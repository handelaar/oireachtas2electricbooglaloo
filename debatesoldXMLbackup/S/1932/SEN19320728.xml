      <P>I think it is the duty of the Chair to inform the House of the very difficult situation in which it is placed regarding the Control of Manufactures Bill.  This Bill received a Second Reading in this House on Friday last, and to the Committee Stage, which is down for to-day, no less than 73 amendments have been offered.  If we do not intend to pass the Bill through all its stages before we adjourn for the summer, then there seems to me to be no point whatever in taking the Committee Stage until the autumn.  There is no suggestion in any quarter that the Seanad is obstructing the Government in regard to the Bill.  The fact is that the Bill is of such importance that it ought to have been received here much earlier if it was seriously intended that we should pass it before the recess.  If we decide to pass it through all its stages before we adjourn, the situation created will be unprecedented.  We can hardly finish the Committee Stage before to-morrow or Saturday, and it would, in my opinion, be an abuse of procedure to take the Report Stage without a reasonable interval, so that the position may be further examined in the light of the amendments that will have been inserted in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The earliest suitable date for the Report Stage would be next Wednesday, August 3rd, which is the Wednesday in Horse Show Week, and if we passed the Fifth Stage also on that day, the necessary certificate would be ready for transmission to the Dáil on the following day.  The Dáil would be summoned specially to consider our amendments on, say, Tuesday, August 9th, and it is almost certain that they would not agree to all of them.  It <Col N="1672" /> would, accordingly, be necessary for me to summon the Seanad, for, say, Wednesday, August 17th, to consider the position further on the Dáil Message.  If there were no agreement, the result would be a deadlock; but if a joint conference were called for, it would be necessary for the Seanad to meet again to agree to such conference and they would also have to meet subsequently, say, on August 24th, to ratify any agreement arrived at.</P>
    <P>It may be that these dates may be altered so as to shorten the various periods, but I do not think very much can be done in that way.  Obviously, very grave inconvenience will result, not only to ourselves, but to the Dáil. And I would like to refer particularly to the ordinary staff of the Oireachtas (I do not, of course, mean our own Clerk and Assistant-Clerk) who have been working very long hours for many weeks and who cannot begin their holidays until both Houses rise for the recess.  The views of the Government in this matter are known, and I would now like to hear the views of representatives of other groups in the light of what I have said.  The Chair is always strictly impartial in these matters, but I feel it to be my duty to make the position clear.</P>

      <P>I did not know that this statement was going to be made, and I cannot speak for anybody but myself.  I have been interested a good deal in this Bill and my own view is that it is the kind of Bill which requires careful consideration by this House.  I believe that the Committee Stage will disclose a great many points requiring further consideration by the Minister and his Department. But for the fact that the Government expressed the view that there might be prevention of a certain amount of industry if the Bill were postponed, I would be in favour of postponing the consideration of it.  My own view is that the House, having got so far, should take up the Committee Stage.  If, on the Committee Stage, there is found to be no likelihood of any kind of agreement on what we might regard as the essential <Col N="1673" /> portions of the Bill, I can see no object in keeping the staff and carrying on.  After that, it would seem to be largely a matter for the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the difficulty of this Bill.  I should like to make clear, however, that the Bill could not have come to this House earlier.  The general principles of the Bill were under consideration almost from the earliest stages of the activities of the Executive Council.  It was a very difficult Bill and all aspects of it had to be considered at great length.  Various drafts of the Bill came before us in the Executive Council and almost every clause of it was examined in detail and referred back.  All sorts of view-points were put forward and we tried, so far as was humanly possible, to make the Bill conform to our ideas as regards industrial development in the country.</P>
      <P>I explained that here last week, when a motion that this Bill should be deferred until the Autumn Session was voted on.  The proposal for a postponement of the Bill was then defeated.  It may be argued that there was a comparatively small House present, but it was a House in session in continuity, and the Bill then before the House was on the Order Paper from the previous Wednesday.  Since last Monday various amendments came in.  Acting in perfect good faith, and assuming that the Bill was going to be completed before this Session was over, I kept my staffs in considering the amendments that were put up. As I explained yesterday those that arrived late for the Committee Stage might obviously be considered with Report Stage amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main issue is, what effect is postponement going to have on the provision of employment, the development of industry and the establishment of manufactures in the country in the meantime?  There is no doubt about it, that manufacturers, both at home and on the other side, are waiting to see exactly the terms in which this Bill will emerge from the Oireachtas.  Many manufacturers on <Col N="1674" /> this side, who are in negotiation with manufacturers on the other side, say that joint operations may be adjusted to meet the terms of this Bill.  We have before us at present quite a number of big projects which will be entirely held up if the Bill is postponed until the autumn.  Naturally no firm is going to undertake the establishment of anything on an industrial basis until it knows where it is on such a measure as this.  We will also be held up in the Department, because our hands will be tied by not knowing exactly in what condition this Bill will emerge from the Oireachtas. Generally speaking it may be taken, if this Bill is adjourned for the ten weeks during which the Oireachtas is not sitting, that there will be a considerable hold-up in potential employment and in potential industrial development.  That is all I have to say on the matter.  I have stressed the necessity and the urgency of having the Bill passed, even if amended.  The amendments have been considered carefully.  We are desirous, if possible, of meeting the views expressed in the amendments.  Where it is thought they will improve the Bill they have been considered sympathetically and, in some cases, accepted.  In other cases they have been accepted conditional on the amendments being put into proper form.  As to other amendments which we were not prepared to accept the refusal is based on our idea that they cut across the principles and the policy embodied in the Bill itself.  I feel that the Government is at the mercy of this House, being in the paradoxical position of being a minority Party in it. I submit that this Bill is one the House ought to put through if it is humanly possible.</P>

      <P>In view of your statement, Sir, and what the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has said, could not a compromise be arrived at by which the House could take the Committee Stage of the Bill to-day and adjourn further consideration of it for a month or five weeks?  Would that suggestion meet with the Minister's approval?</P>

      <P>That will arise on the Committee Stage.  I have tried to get the feeling of the House.  Senator Douglas, speaking individually, has not stated how far taking the Committee Stage now would ease the position. Apparently he has in mind a certain course of action which he would like to pursue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Seanad should consider the concluding words of the Minister.  He stated that the Government were in a minority in this House and therefore were in a difficult position in regard to the Bill.  Speaking on my own behalf, as well as on behalf of the Seanad, I can assure the Minister that as regards this Bill it is not a question of a majority or a minority. All of us are doing our level best to see what is the wisest course with regard to the Bill, honestly believing that we are doing what is right if we can meet the Government.  Undoubtedly the Minister puts the case further, that the Bill was given to us at a very bad time and that it is an extremely difficult one to deal with.  The Minister admitted that it was a difficult Bill, and pointed out how long the Government took to consider it and to get it into its present shape.  I can assure him that some of us who sat down after the last meeting of the Seanad spent hours trying to prepare amendments to modify the Bill in such a way that it could be worked.  I think the Minister will admit that our amendments have a definite policy behind them, and that they are not drafted for the purpose of upsetting the Bill.  Some Senators have not seen the amendments yet and others probably only got them this morning.  I believe we would be doing what is wrong if we hurried this Bill.  That is my considered opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other thing that has been mentioned by the Minister was that <Col N="1676" /> there were proposals about business, and that if negotiations were got through between now and October some employment would be provided in the Free State.  No one in the House except the Minister is able to give any reason against giving further time to this Bill.  The Minister alone can say whether a good deal of employment is awaiting a decision on the Bill and what is the right thing to do. That makes it very difficult for the Seanad to decide because we may take it for granted that his knowledge is such that he could not communicate it to the House.  I do not see what the House can do now except let the Bill go to the Committee Stage and then remembering what you, Sir, have told us, we can consider the question again. I do not see that the Seanad can do anything else at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to the Bill is that it places enormous power in the hands of a Minister.  I want it to be distinctly understood that my objection is not to the present Minister or to the present Ministry. The objection holds to any Minister or to any Ministry.  It leaves the Government of the day open to the charge of favouritism and it leaves it open to a thing that I detest, political pressure.  Once people get that idea into their minds public confidence is lost.  No matter what Government is in power they must have public confidence. I strongly object to any interference with the ordinary flow of trade and commerce.  It is a bad thing for any Government to interfere with either unnecessarily.  The Minister stated that unemployment would be created if this Bill was not passed.  My answer to that is this, if a licence is wanted by a particular firm at present, the Government can inform them that when the Bill is passed a licence will be granted.  On the other hand, if the Bill is not passed there is no harm done because things remain as they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to say one thing, and that is that if there is fear of a breakdown on this Bill it seems to me that there is much greater danger of breakdown if we rush the Bill now than if we postpone consideration. I admit that I voted with the Government the other day, that is to say, I was against postponing it to the Autumn, but after hearing what the Cathaoirleach has told us it seems to me that there is an undoubted possibility of a breakdown.  I think that in the interests of employment which the Minister and everybody is so anxious to bring about, it would be more likely that we would have a full consideration of all the points at issue&mdash;and there are 73 amendments&mdash;and that the matter would be dealt with more adequately if the Committee Stage were postponed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like before we finally leave the issue to point out that in my few years' experience here we have often, in fact invariably, got Bills for the Committee Stage on the Wednesday succeeding the week of Second Reading.  There were many amendments to these Bills and they were taken in the normal course of events on the Wednesday or Thursday of the week following the Second Stage.  I personally have a great deal of experience of sitting up at night to try to understand and digest amendments that were to come up for the Seanad on the Wednesday following the Second Stage.  I think it is at least establishing a new precedent if the ordinary Committee Stage is not to go through on the week following the Second Stage.  As regards what Senator Staines has mentioned about political pressure and public confidence, I dealt with that last week.  There are some things which are left to the discretion of the Minister.  We feel that a Minister responsible to the Executive, which is in turn responsible to the Oireachtas, is likely to be more clear of political pressure or nepotism than a Commission of three of four.</P>

    <Title>Old Age Pensions Bill, 1932&mdash;Report.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New Section.  Before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4. No pension or superannuation received from a trade union or friendly society shall be taken into consideration when determining the means of an applicant for a pension.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not require many words to explain this amendment.  I referred to the matter on the second Reading of the Bill.  It appears to me that it is the one outstanding point that is necessary to make the Old Age Pensions Act what we all desire it should be.  As I stated on the Second Reading, the old craft unions before ever an Old Age Pensions Act was introduced had an arrangement whereby their members paid, from their early apprenticeship, a contribution sufficient to qualify them for what was known as a superannuation allowance in their old age.  That meant that after a certain number of years' continuous membership when a man was past his labour, instead of going on the outdoor relief, he had provision made for him by the trade union. Sometimes these men had been contributing for fifty years to qualify for this superannuation allowance.  The amount varied.  It was given when a man was past his labour, generally when a man was between 65 and 70. The amount varied from 10/- to 15/-. The passing of the Old Age Pensions Act altered the whole equilibrium of the scheme of trade union superannuation. The Old Age Pensions Act allowed a man 10/- per week if his income did not exceed a certain small <Col N="1679" /> amount.  The result was that the trade union deducted the amount of the superannuation allowance from the amount that the man was entitled to receive in addition to the 10/-.  In reality what it means is that you are depriving these old men of 4/- per week because the trade union will not continue to pay this extra amount if it is deducted by the State.  You are depriving these people of something they have paid for all their lives, something they are entitled to receive.  That is the purport of the amendment.  I do not think I need say anything further in favour of it so I formally move the amendment.</P>

      <P>I hope that when the Parliamentary Secretary replies he will give some reason why it is desirable, if he accepts the amendment, to discriminate between different classes. There are many other classes for which I think an equally good case could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the principle behind the amendment is quite wrong. In the case where a thrifty person has put by money for his old age, that is taken into consideration in calculating his means for old age pensions purposes. I do not see any difference between paying into a trade union or, say, into an insurance society.  This cuts across the whole principle.  If the amendment is to operate in these cases it should be applied to every case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain objections to this amendment.  Some of them have been suggested by Senator Wilson and Senator Sir John Keane.  I think it will be agreed that there is scarcely any increase of social legislation that cannot be further extended, but I think it will be also admitted, in relation to this particular piece of legislation, that it is a very generous measure and that we should not be unduly pressed to make it any more generous than it is at the present time.  The amendment proposed by Senator Farren would ensure, no <Col N="1680" /> matter what provision was made by a friendly society or a trade union society for its members or no matter how generous the provision might be, that such income would be left out of consideration in calculating the means of a claimant for an old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Senator would be on sounder ground if the same principle had universal application.  There are many other bodies, corporations and private individuals, who make provision for a gratuitous allowance to their employees when they reach the age of 70.  It could be argued with reason that if the Bill could be extended in relation to trades unions, friendly societies and such other bodies, that it should have universal application.  The Senator, I think, will admit that in relation to this particular class of the community we have considerably improved the conditions in the Bill before the House.  At the present time food, clothing or shelter are taken into consideration and estimated as means against a claimant. A person with a pension from a trades union, a friendly society or from any other voluntary society could not secure an old age pension under existing conditions.  We are remedying that and ensuring that a person can have in addition to free food, clothing and shelter, a six shilling cash pension from a trade union, a voluntary society or other such source.  That will ensure that there will be six shillings from such sources and a ten shilling pension from State sources, that is 16/- and the other supplementary allowances that a trade union or friendly society may be disposed to secure for their people when they reach that age.  If the trade unions or corporations or private individuals wish to make special allowances for old people over 70 years of age I cannot see why they will not make such allowances in the form of providing a house or food or clothing or shelter, and confine themselves to the six shillings cash pension they would be entitled to and enjoy a full State pension.  If this principle were admitted in the Bill, I think a trade unionist would have an equally strong claim.  Trade unionists who <Col N="1681" /> save their money or invest it, or who are deriving considerable income from such money, would have an equally strong claim to have it excluded from the calculation of means in relation to old age pensions.  While I have every sympathy with Senator Farren's object in this amendment, I cannot see that it can be justified in relation to a particular class of the community.  I think the Bill is sufficiently generous in its terms to exclude the possibility of giving it universal application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister has said, I must admit straight off&mdash;and I have admitted already&mdash;that I think this Bill is a decided improvement on the existing position and achieves almost all we have been aiming at for a considerable time.  I see a way now by which any of the trade unions who wish to provide this additional pension for their members may do so.  I therefore do not press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw attention to a matter about which many people throughout the country have spoken, that is, the total abolition of the means test.  Many people think it unfair that poor people should be taxed to relieve a man from the moral obligation of maintaining his dependents in their old age.  That is what it amounts to.  It is because I have been asked to mention this that I am doing it now.  I mentioned it before on the Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take exception to the Minister's attitude on the Second Stage on the question of fraud in connection with Old Age Pensions, and more especially in connection with blind pensions.  I said that it was notorious in the old days that an amount of fraud was indulged in in securing these pensions and that I hoped that steps were to be taken to <Col N="1682" /> prevent such fraud in the future.  The Minister in speaking was somewhat flippant, I thought.  He said: &ldquo;I feel strongly that there is a much larger element of fraud amongst the class of people who have the full use of their senses than amongst the people whose sight is affected, and I would much rather catch the people who commit fraud with their eyes open than the people who are partially blind.&rdquo;  That is the defence of the two wrongs, which is a very weak argument.  I suggest that the Minister should stop every opening for fraud which, in some cases, became a scandal in the matter of blind pensions.  I would like to have an assurance from him that every possible step will be taken by doctors and others whose duty it is to prevent such fraud.  There is a very great opportunity for fraud now, which will be exploited by certain people, and I think that the revenue should be protected at all costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  Perhaps if I am here long enough I may change my mind.  But neither of the criticisms has any real force regarding fraud in regard to claims to old age pensions or blind pensions.  There will be far less likelihood of fraud in the future, for the reason that a person now whose sight is so bad as to render him incapable of following his occupation will be entitled to a pension.  In that way, it may be found that a pension will be drawn by those who have a certain amount of vision, but who are unable to follow their occupation.  A blind pension is not awarded unless and until the claimant has been examined by a medical inspector from the Local Government Department, and it is on the results of that examination and the <Col N="1683" /> report of the medical inspector that these blind pensions are awarded and will be awarded in the future.  In view of that, I think that a layman ought to be slow to take upon himself to decide whether a person with defective vision is so blind as to be unable to follow his occupation or not.  That may be safely left to the experts.  I would assure the Senator, from my own experience and from the experience of others, that there is very little fraud and very little tendency to defraud the ordinary taxpayer.  I believe that they are as honest and conscientious as the section of the community represented by the Senator in this House.</P>

      <P>This amendment, as also amendments Nos. 10 and 20 on the Paper, are intended to meet the point raised by Senator Staines in his amendment No. 11, in connection with the definition of a public utility society.  In the definition in the Bill at present there are two clauses in which a public utility society is described.  One of these definitions we will leave in the Bill, and the other definition of public utility society, when used with the qualification &ldquo;within the meaning of the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919&rdquo; we eliminate.  With the elimination of that definition, and a slight consequential amendment, I think the object Senator Staines sets out to achieve will be accomplished.  Because, in fact, once this definition is removed, and the first definition in the first portion of the Bill stands for all purposes, the definition there of a public utility society will cover public utility societies wherever the words occur in the Bill and I think, therefore, Senator Staines's idea will be met.</P>

What I want to bring in is companies like the Dublin Artisans' Dwellings Company, which did great work for housing in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Section 5, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;society&rdquo; in line 28, page 4, to insert the words &ldquo;or local authority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I spoke last week about the terrible conditions of housing in Dublin and through the country.  Since that I have seen further conditions in Dublin that I might say I could not even mention here, so appalling were they. It is absolutely essential that the terrible housing conditions which exist should be tackled and that everybody must put his shoulder to the wheel. The private individual first of all, the companies established for the purpose of building houses, utility societies and the local authorities must all do their part.  Of course the idea of this Bill is to leave to the local authorities the clearance of slum areas.  I should like to ask the Minister to tell us if he is going to give authority to the Dublin Corporation to house those poor people who occupy the slum areas somewhere, while they are running their municipal plough through these streets; otherwise what is to become of these people? I want to give the local authorities the same rights as the utility society or anybody else should have in this matter.</P>

      <P>I think the Senator is speaking on amendment 4 rather than amendment 3 but I should like first of all to deal with amendment 3.  The particular section with which the amendment deals is designed to cover the transition period so as to fill up the gap between the existing Housing Acts and the present Act.  My impression is that this amendment is based on the misapprehension that we did not take steps to cover existing houses which have been commenced and not yet completed.  In Section 11 of the Bill we provide the money for these existing buildings which is going to amount to about £33,000 and in Section 6, sub-section (2) we make the Bill retrospective in so far as we allow the usual grants which have been allowed £45 per house in this Act.  So I think that amendment 3 is unnecessary in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to oppose this amendment on the ground that I am quite sure that, if it were carried as it stands, it would entirely do away with utility societies as we know them.  Utility societies as described in the Bill, include &ldquo;a company which satisfies the Minister that its objects are wholly philanthropic and includes a provision of houses for the working classes.&rdquo;  If you give to local authorities the loans or the cash designed in the Bill for utility societies, I think there would be no utility societies working in the areas, because the elected bodies, which are, of course, very much stronger than a group of people who come together for a philanthropic purpose, will hold the long-term loans and the cash allowances that are prescribed in the Bill for utility societies.  Utility societies, even for the civic spirit they engender, should be encouraged.  We know what voluntary assistance is.  It is the salt of every movement and of the voluntary societies, of which we have very good examples in Dublin. The scheme carried out by the Rev. Mr. Hall, when he was officiating on the North side of the City, can be seen by anybody who passes along the Great Northern Railway outside Amiens Street.  He set himself out to do this for the working classes with a few helpers.  He had no Government help of any kind.  We came into contact with him when he came to the Corporation for special consideration, which we gave him, and, from that, I think, most of us there at the time became interested in utility societies.  Even before the Rev. Mr. Hall's work, the Alexander College had done very special work in reconstructing tenement houses; seeing that the tenants put into them were proper tenants and that the rents were paid regularly and in respect of which I understand there was no difficulty.  I refer to these things to show that these-utility societies or philanthropic societies composed of individuals should not be interfered with in any way, but, rather, that their work should be helped as it is helped in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no help for these societies <Col N="1694" /> from a Government Department until the last Housing Bill was introduced by General Mulcahy, in which a section was inserted giving a certain amount to these societies.  It passed through this House and I was very glad to say then what I am saying now.  Nobody objected to utility societies getting this money or suggested that it should be handed over to the Urban Councils.  The amendment, if carried, I think, will certainly not help utility societies and, for that alone, I think that those of us who work with voluntary workers know that it would be a very great shame if they were in any way interfered with.  Rather should they be encouraged and I do think that the mover of the amendment does not really understand fully how it will interfere with them.  I must repeat it&mdash;the elected bodies are much stronger and much more powerful than a little utility society and I hope the mover will see his way to withdraw this amendment, which is not original.  It is copied from the other House and I hope the House will stand firm, as I think it will always stand, in helping utility societies and other philanthropic bodies.  If you pass this, I think you will be doing the reverse.</P>

      <P>I did not suggest that the money should be taken from the utility societies.  I want the utility societies and everybody to help housing. They have, I understand, a scheme in hands at Clonmel at present which is costing £200 a house and surely Senator Mrs. Wyse Power does not expect that the State shall give £100&mdash;this is a local authority scheme&mdash;and that the local authority should give £50 to build a £200 house? This scheme is quite suitable for Clonmel and the rents are 3s. 11d. per week inclusive of rates.  I am positive that if people want to build houses, you must help them to do it and, naturally, like Senator Mrs. Wyse Power, I would much prefer it to be done by private individuals or utility societies, but we must get houses.  The conditions, as I said before, are appalling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently there is some misunderstanding as to this amendment.  So far as I can understand it, this Bill is designed on special lines so that a local authority will work in a certain direction.  It is designed with the object of getting local authorities to build and to look after the poorest people in the community and to look after the clearance of slum areas and the provision of houses for people who can least afford to pay for them.  There is also the provision in respect of public utility societies and the private speculative builder to build houses for other people who can better afford to pay. So far as I can understand the framework of the Bill&mdash;I am subject to correction by the Minister&mdash;it is designed on these lines: There is a certain financial provision to induce a corporation or local authority, as the case may be, to work on a certain line, and there is also a provision for public utility societies which is to act as an inducement to them to continue and to spread out in their building operations, and there is a provision to encourage the speculative builder to develop his building operations for the better off people who can afford to pay the higher price for a house.  The whole scheme of the Bill is, I think, designed on these lines, and, if Senator Staines understood that, there would be no necessity for him to move these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 6, as Senator Farren has pointed out, a new principle of assisting local authorities is introduced, and it is done by relieving the loan charges to the extent of two-thirds, in the case of slum clearance schemes, and one-third for renovation of existing dwellings, congested dwellings and so on, so that, <Col N="1696" /> under the provision for loan charges, the State is giving better financial facilities than it would be giving under Senator Staines's amendment, if we accepted it.  In the first place, he would do away entirely with the principle of concentrating on the slum clearance problem, on which, as I explained on Second Reading, it is our intention to get local authorities to concentrate.  It is our intention to get them to concentrate on the larger scheme and to try to get public utility societies, as Senator Farren and Senator Mrs. Wyse Power have pointed out, and the speculative builder as well, to concentrate on their side.  We are giving far more than we would under Senator Staines's amendment.  We are giving them a definite line to work on.  We are trying to get them to concentrate their energies on that side of the work and I fear that, if the Senator's amendment were accepted, that side of the Bill, in Section 6, would collapse altogether.  I think it is quite contrary to the principle of the Bill and I could not accept it.</P>
      <P>The local authorities, in our view, will have plenty to do.  All they need do is get a public utility society formed in the area and substantially the same work&mdash;in fact, greater work&mdash;can be done than under the public authority itself, because we are giving a special financial inducement to enable these public utility societies to be formed.  The Senator knows that because he has referred to it in the course of his remarks.  The only difference between us is that the Senator does not seem to recognise that the thing can be done.  What he wants done in regard to individual dwellings can be done through public utility societies in co-operation with the local authority.  That is the only necessity for a public utility society in an area.</P>

      <P>I would like to mention that for the last ten years in Cork City I do not think a single house has been built that is now rented under 10/- a week.

      <P>It has been estimated that under the provision which enables the State to grant two-thirds of the loan charges, the rent of 10/- ought to be reduced to something in the vicinity of 3/-.  That is the idea underlying this whole proposal.  This is an effort to fill the gap that heretofore has existed.  Labourers or workmen were not able to pay the rents necessitated by building costs.  We are trying to fill that gap.  All these houses will be let as tenancies and there will be a definite advantage over the old system of subsidies.  We are trying to concentrate attention on getting tenancies for people at reasonable rents.  That is the whole object of the proposed financial aid in respect of loan charges.</P>

We went into the matter very carefully and the report we got was to the effect that if we still continued to charge 10/- a week for them we would, without making any allowance whatever for depreciation, insurance or rates, barely get 5 per cent. on the money we would expend in the construction of the houses.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 5:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;area&rdquo; in line 38, page 4, <Col N="1698" /> to insert the words &ldquo;or town which according to the census of 1896 had a population exceeding 1,000 persons.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With the amendment inserted the section would read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b)  to any person or public utility society erecting one or more houses to which this sub-section applies in any urban area or town which according to the census of 1896 had a population exceeding 1,000 persons....</P>
    <P>This amendment was brought forward in the Dáil and was rejected.  I put it down in the hope that the Minister might be induced to accept it.  I make a plea on behalf of the larger of the small towns.  I would like to include them all&mdash;that is, towns as distinct from villages&mdash;but I realise the line must be drawn somewhere. The Minister says there are bound to be anomalies, but I believe there would be a good many less if this amendment were accepted.</P>
    <P>My contention is that many of these towns, even with a population up to 3,000, have no local authority, such as commissioners.  Notwithstanding that, they live under urban conditions and would therefore be subject to the higher prices for building, etc.  I do not know whether that now applies in view of the amendment subsequently passed by the Dáil on the proposal of Deputy Norton.  I think that would add to it.  Therefore, in these towns they should be able to attain the higher grant.</P>
    <P>In so far as I understood the Minister's statement, persons interested in building would be able to obtain the higher grant under the Labourers Acts.  The question arises: What is an agricultural labourer, or rather: What is not an agricultural labourer? I was for many years a member of a district council and the question was constantly arising, especially in connection with labourers' cottages.  I must say I was never able to arrive at a correct solution; in fact, I do not now know what an agricultural labourer is.  If we could be quite sure that what the Minister said in the Dáil was correct there would not be so much need of this amendment. <Col N="1699" /> I notice, however, that he used the words &ldquo;in my opinion,&rdquo;&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I feel it is possible.&rdquo;  He did not make any definite statement.  I feel I would like to say with Browning:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I believe in you, but that is not enough.</P>
    <P>Give my conviction a clinch.</P>
    <P>I would like to know how the women are going to fare in these small towns. There are numbers of them with persons dependent on them.  They would like to build houses but, as the law stands, they would get only £45 instead of the larger amounts that are given in other circumstances.  Would women be considered as agricultural labourers?</P>

      <P>That is a point I am in doubt about and I would like some information on it.  What is the position of a married chauffeur who is dependent on some professional man&mdash; is he a domestic servant or an agricultural labourer?  I would like the Minister to reconsider this amendment. In my own district the towns are small; some of them have a population of just over 1,000.  In the South there are larger towns with populations up to 3,000 and they have no local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point Senator Mrs. Costello raised as to getting a definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer,&rdquo; the Labourers Act of 1919, Section 1, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the Labourers (Ireland) Acts, 1883 to 1918, and this Act, the definition of the expression &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; in section 93 of the Irish Lands Acts 1903, shall be extended so as to include:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any person (other than a domestic or menial servant) working for hire in a rural district whose average wage exceeds 2/6 a day;</P>
      <P>(b)  any person not working for hire but working in a rural district at some trade or handicraft without employing any persons except members of his own family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1700" /> So that I think with the Housing legislation these cases are covered up to the present under the Housing of the Working Classes Act in the towns. These cases are covered by the definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; in the rural areas.  The man who can show that he worked for no matter how short a period in the year, so long as he worked for hire in a rural area or so long as he worked for himself will come under the definition. I am not in a position to say whether a nurse could be described as an &ldquo;agricultural labourer.&rdquo;  Anyhow I do not think that the problem of providing houses for nurses is a big one; it has been attended to already.  The definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; covers substantially the working classes in the rural areas.  But if this amendment were to be extended I do not think it would improve the condition of the people whose interests Senator Mrs. Costello looks after, because in the rural areas an agricultural labourer or a person who has a holding of land less than, I think, a Poor Law valuation of £15, well get from the time the Bill passes until the 1st April, 1935, up to £70 as a grant for building a house.  If the house is built through the medium of a public utility society he will get £80.  If that person is put on the same basis as the people in urban areas he will only get £70 the first year, £60 the year after and £50 the year after that.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any advantage whatever to the people looking for grants if this amendment were accepted.  It would be quite the contrary; because we are already, in fact, giving generous financial help, though some people do not seem to realise that.  I suppose they have an idea that when you are giving generous financial help you should give more&mdash; why should there be any limit?  We have done things in this Bill which have never been done before.  I think it ought to satisfy the Senators.  We have made very special provision for all cases in the rural areas.  We have made provision for reconstruction in these areas.  That is a matter in which rural people are greatly interested. They would like to build their own <Col N="1701" /> houses but where they do not build their own houses they would like to put on new roofs on the existing houses.  We are giving special grants for all these purposes, so that all these classes are covered.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that as the Bill now stands a certain number of towns will be excluded.  Houses with a population of 1,500 can be brought under the Bill if there are town commissioners there.  It is not very difficult to form town commissioners.  Senators should realise that all these towns come in under the Bill.  I realise that a case can be made for towns of a thousand, but why make a differentiation between rural and urban areas?  If we admit that one thousand people constitute an urban area why not admit five hundred as an urban area?  The Senator will realise that people in rural areas are not going to be any worse treated than people in urban areas.  They are in fact better off than people in urban areas.  If in the administration of the Act we find that there is differentiation against rural people we will try to amend it later. At present I cannot go any further in the matter.</P>

      <P>Section 5, sub-section (1). To delete the figure (i) in line 60 and to delete all after the word &ldquo;buildings&rdquo; in line 62, page 4, down to and including the word &ldquo;pounds&rdquo; in line 8, page 5.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to ask for more money.  The provision made to differentiate between various holders of land seems to me unfair.  A small man gets a £70 grant; a man a little above him gets £60 while a man with a bigger valuation gets only £45. I think that in view of the incidence of local rating in connection with land there is a case to be made for the holder of agricultural land as against anybody else; because in comparison with his income he pays excessively in rates as compared with any other man in the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Now wait until I am finished.  For example, a man in the community with £500 a year would be paying a small sum comparatively for rates on his house.  There is no farmer in the community with an income of £500 a year and still that man might be paying rates up to £100 a year.  I am asking in view of the incidence of rating under the law at present&mdash;and the law is wrong but we cannot get it changed&mdash;that we who live on the land just now should be given preferential treatment and that there should be no difference between the small man and the man of second size and the man of third size because we are all now suffering from depression.  I do not say depression in spirit but depression in income.  It is therefore our anxiety where grants are given to farmers that there should be no differentiation; all should be getting the same.  Now that £70 would go a long way towards building a house for a farmer.  Then why not give it and make no difference? That is our case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I cannot accept Senator Wilson's amendment because this principle of differentiation is fundamental.  I am afraid the Senator has glossed over the difference between a man with one hundred acres and a man with a valuation of 30/- or £2.  That sort of valuation is quite common in certain parts of the country and that is the type of man we are specially interested in trying to provide for.  He provides his own materials and he is willing to build his house himself.  We are giving him a large inducement to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Senator that the Land Commission has already looked after the people in whom he is interested. These people have got large farms of land and large houses.  I do not think that the Seanad can quite follow the Senator when he contends that there is quite a heavy burden on these farmers, when we consider that we have recently given them a further sum of a quarter of a million pounds in remission of rates.  Even after that I would remind the Senator that the rates will be somewhat difficult of collection. I do not think that large farmers are doing badly.  I would remind <Col N="1703" /> the Senator that we are giving the same amount for grants as the farmer has got hitherto.  We are giving more to the smaller farmers in grants. Since we cannot have everything, we realise that some people are better entitled to these grants than others. After all, the reason for a Bill of this kind is the endeavour to have houses built for those who require them most. I do not think that the Senator can make out that the class of farmers he speaks for are people whose dwellings are in danger of being condemned as unit for human habitation.  We know that many of them are living in very substantial structures with magnificent out-offices attached to them.  In fact, many of the people that we are looking after would be glad to have a dwelling as good as some of these out-offices, but that is another question. I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister takes exception to the man with a hundred acres.  There is a differentiation in the Bill to this extent: that over a £25 valuation a farmer is regarded as an ordinary person.  I have put the case to the Minister that the farmer with a £26 valuation has a very small income. I have put it to him that on that valuation he is paying more in rates than the man in the city with an income of £300 a year, and that notwithstanding the Relief of Rates Bill.  The man with a £26 valuation will pay more in rates than, say, the school teacher who has an income of £200 or £300 a year.  The school teacher will have his income year in and year out, but it is not so in the case of the farmer with a valuation of £26 a year. I might say that I am not interested in the big man, but rather in the man who, so far as this Bill is concerned, comes just above the border line.  In view of the present condition of agriculture, I think the case I have made merits consideration.  It is only a sum of £25 that is in question, and under <Col N="1704" /> my proposal there might not be 100 houses built.  I am not asking very much and I put it to the Minister seriously to consider the case that I have made.  Undoubtedly relief of rates is going to the small man this year, but the sum of £260,000 that has been spoken of does not, I suggest, touch the £25 valuation man at all.</P>

We have gone into the matter very carefully.  All the different points of view have been before us and we have definitely decided that the man over £25 valuation cannot be described as a small farmer. Senator Wilson may quarrel with that or with the idea of bringing in the question of small farmers at all.  A definite limit has been fixed and we cannot go beyond that.  I cannot offer the Senator any hope that we will go beyond it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 8:</P>
      <P>Section 5, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 52, page 5, the words &ldquo;in a rural area.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to make the grant, not exceeding £40 for reconstruction, available in an urban area as well as in a rural area. I think the Minister will agree that it is very unfair to give a grant of this kind say to a man living at Barna, a rural area in the County Galway, and to refuse it to a man living at Knocknacara in the same county simply because he happens to be living in the urban area.  The object of the amendment is to make the grant available in the urban as well as in the rural area.  I do not think there <Col N="1705" /> should be any objection to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator's idea is to make the grant available according to where a person works instead of where he resides.  In the case of two persons living in an area, one of whom works in an adjoining rural area and the other in an urban area&mdash;both of them residing in the urban area&mdash;the Senator wishes, as I understand him, to differentiate between the two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity for grants for reconstruction in urban areas does not arise because, as the Senator knows, landlords are compelled under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts to recondition their houses if they are not in a proper state of repair. Therefore, I do not see any reason for coming in to do what is statutorily provided for already.  That is one reason why there is no necessity for this amendment; that there is already the obligation on the landlords in urban areas to recondition their houses.  There is a second objection, and it is that if we are to follow people to the places where they work, whether these places were rural areas or not, irrespective of where they lived, then I fear we are going to be faced with very great difficulties. I do not think that provision for reconstruction is really necessary for these people in the urban areas. I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer again to the examples I have already given, and I do so because I am aware that the Minister is familiar with that district.  Take the case of a man living in a house at Knocknacara, which is in Galway urban district.  He is living under the very same conditions as a man residing at Barna, <Col N="1706" /> some miles away.  He has no landlord except the ordinary ground landlord.  His house belongs to himself.  If he wants to reconstruct his house he will not get any grant under this Bill, whereas the man living at Barna, a few miles away, simply because he happens to be residing in a rural area, will get the grant if he requires it.  I think that is unfair.  I do not care where a man works.  It is where he lives that I am concerned with.  Take the case of a man living at Newbridge in an area under the control of the Newbridge Town Commissioners. Why should not that person be as well entitled to get a grant not exceeding £40 as the man living across the border in a rural part of the County Kildare?  I submit that my proposal is a very fair one and that it should be accepted.  As a matter of fact, I think it would have been accepted in the other House but for the fact that there was some mistake about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I again repeat that I cannot accept the amendment.  A man residing in the urban area of Galway has undoubtedly an advantage over the man residing in a remote rural area.  For one thing he is nearer the market.  If he has land within the urban area I claim that he has advantages over the man residing in a rural area.  There may be cases of people who own their own houses and want to reconstruct them, but I think, so far as urban areas are concerned, these are rather the exception.  Most of those for whom this housing legislation purports to deal are of the agricultural labourer class, and I think they are pretty well provided for.  The other class is the small farmer class.  If the labourer whom Senator Staines has in mind, who can neither be described as an agricultural labourer nor as a small farmer and who lives in his own house, exists.  I do not know how he could be properly described.  I feel that such cases are very exceptional.  If there is any question of letting houses, then the principle of reconstruction cannot enter in at all.  It was on the principle that reconstruction is really for the special purpose of helping the small farmer <Col N="1707" /> who, we all know, has done this work under the Land Commission that this clause was inserted.  I do not think that I can accept the Senator's amendment.</P>

      <P>As I have already pointed out, no matter how generous the financial provisions may be you will always get people to say that they are not generous enough.  As I have already explained we have gone further in dealing with rural housing than anybody has ever gone.  We have given special grants in order to induce people to form public utility societies in rural areas and we are giving them larger grants for the building of new houses than in urban areas.  In spite of all that Senator Staines is not satisfied.  He is pleading for a particular class that is not covered, but he cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have provided for a certain number of grants, starting with £70 during the coming year, £60 during the following year, and £50 for the succeeding year for people in urban areas. We have made special provision with regard to slum clearance and renovation of dwellings and I fear we cannot go any further.  We cannot cater for people who want to have the benefits applicable both to the urban and rural areas.  The Senator has not answered my statement that this would create an anomaly between two persons, one <Col N="1708" /> of whom&mdash;because he works in the rural area adjoining an urban area&mdash; he claims, should be entitled to an additional grant as compared with the man who works in the urban area. We may, unfortunately, have anomalies under the Bill, but we will try and smooth them out in the course of administration.  If they press unduly, we can look for further powers later on.  This Bill is intended to cover a three years' period.  I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment, therefore, in the hope that the anomaly, if it exists, will be remedied in the course of administration.

      <P>Under a previous Bill, brought in by another Government, we could not get grants for reconstruction of houses situate more than a quarter of a mile out of a town.  This Bill marks a great advance as regards the rural areas.  At the same time, I cannot see why the old state of affairs should not continue and why we should not have both advantages. The previous Ministry were in favour all the time of the townsman.  Their case was that they could not possibly pay inspectors to go out into the rural areas and look after reconstructed houses.  Now that we have got the grants applied to rural areas, urban houses are excluded.  That seems to be a peculiar way of making law.

That is the unfortunate position in which a <Col N="1709" /> Minister finds himself.  We have got more applications for grants for reconstructed houses than we have got for the building of houses.  As Senator Wilson said, there is going to be a very big demand and, no doubt, new officers will have to be appointed. Perhaps a whole new staff of inspectors will have to be appointed if we extend this principle of reconstruction. The reconstruction of houses will cause exactly the same amount of trouble and expense to the State as regards inspection as the building <Col N="1710" /> of new houses.  It may, in fact, cause more, because reconstructed houses may be in isolated areas, whereas new houses will probaly be built together in large numbers.  I am not against giving every possible facility for reconstruction as well as for the building of houses but we cannot have everything and, in the circumstances, I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 9:</P>
      <P>Section 5, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 58, page 5, the words &ldquo;twenty-five&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;fifty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to ensure that occupants of farms with a valuation of £50 will be able to receive a grant of £40 towards the reconstruction of a house.  I consider the amendment a reasonable one because £50 valuation might represent a farm with 100 acres.  A grant of £40 would go a long way towards the reconstruction of a house on such a holding.</P>

      <P>I suggest to Senator Wilson that he should withdraw this amendment, and keep it hidden away until we have provided housing accommodation for people who cannot afford to build houses.  If the valuation of a farm is £50 it is absurd to suggest that it should be brought under the provisions of this Bill.  In urban areas it was distinctly laid down under previous Housing Acts that the grant depended upon the size of the house. It is not mansions are wanted.  I wonder where would a mansion with £50 valuation come into such a Bill if floor space measurements were to be taken into account, as they are when grants are given to public utility societies? I think it is absurd to be wasting the time of the House on such an amendment, and to try to hold up a Bill for which there is such urgent necessity.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment to which I would like, with the permission of the House, to move by way of addition another amendment which does not appear in the printed list of amendments.  There have been two definitions of a public utility society.  After the passing of the amendment, when the additional words &ldquo;when used without qualification&rdquo; are omitted there will be only one definition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a special definition of &ldquo;public utility society&rdquo; and that is now to be eliminated, as the draftsman says the words &ldquo;when used without qualification&rdquo; are not necessary.  Under the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919, there are certain restrictions placed upon public utility societies.  The draftsman tells me that this amendment is necessary in order to meet the intention in Senator Staines's amendment, No. 20, and to bring it into line with the giving of fuller scope to the definition of a public utility society.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5, sub-section (1). After the word &ldquo;tenancy&rdquo; in line 14, page <Col N="1712" /> 6, to insert the words &ldquo;to a person of the working classes at a rent not exceeding such rent as may be approved of by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>This will help to throw light on the matter of which Senator Douglas has spoken.  Under the 1919 Act definition of public utility societies, there was a limitation of profits which now, in view of our acceptance of the larger definition, we are doing away with.  In order to make up for that we are putting in an amendment to limit the rents which may be chargeable.  They will have to be subject to the control of the Minister in that respect.  We want to put some limit on the working of public utility societies.  As we are taking away the profits limitation, I think it is only right that the Minister should have some power in regard to the rents which the public utility societies may fix.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 13:</P>
      <P>Section 5, sub-section (4).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  For the purposes of this section &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; means the council of a county, county borough or urban district, the commissioners of a town, a board of health or a board of health and public assistance.</P>
      <P>I think there is an error in this amendment, as I do not think that county councils have anything to do with housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>Section 5, sub-section (4).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  The Minister shall make regulations governing the organisation <Col N="1713" /> and working of public utility societies for the purposes of this section and the increased grants contemplated in sub-paragraphs (f) and (g) of sub-section (1) of this section shall not be paid to any society which does not satisfy the Minister that it complies with the regulations so made.</P>
    <P>The position, I understand, at the present time is that a number of farmers in the country can club together and call themselves a public utility society. In some cases a public utility society gets a larger grant than an individual. In my opinion proper regulations should be made governing the formation or the carrying on of these societies.  I know of one case where a trader in building goods suggested to a customer, who came in to buy stuff, to join his public utility society and that he would get £15 more of a grant than he could get for himself. It is to stop that sort of thing that I put down the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, speaking from my experience, there is a certain amount of supervision already of public utility societies.  It must not be forgotten that the public utility society is very advantageous to people who are not well versed in the matter of making preliminary arrangements for the building of houses.  The public utility society has become efficient in the matter of dealing with the acquisition of land and making approaches to the local authority and the Government. It is in order to help the poor type of person who is unable to do this special work on his own and in order that he will get good value for his money that public utility societies have been brought into being. Further than that, public utility societies in most cases which I know have endeavoured to secure loans from some source to help the person who is unable to build a house even with the Government grant.  One public utility society which I know, which was started from a trades union, the Commercial Public Utility Society, has built some 600 or 700 houses.  It caters for classes such as shop assistants and has done really good work. These people of their own volition <Col N="1714" /> could not do the work.  The societies have trained men to do the work for them.  The idea behind it is to get people into public utility societies where their affairs will be better handled than if they had to handle them themselves.  From what I know of the Housing Department, they are more than anxious to see that people who form public utility societies shall do so for the purpose of bringing themselves within the Act and for the purpose of taking advantage of the conditions of the Act.  I do not think there is any necessity for special legislation to deal with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of public utility societies is set out in Part I of the Act.  I do not know whether Senator Staines is dissatisfied with that or whether he thinks that the public utility societies to which he refers would not come under any of these definitions.  The only exceptions are where a company shall satisfy the Minister that its objects are wholly philanthropic and include the provision of houses for the working classes. Surely the very class of utility societies which the Senator has referred to would come under the definitions and they must come under the Minister's observation?  I should like Senator Staines's reason for thinking that lines 30 to 42 in Part I of the Bill do not cover what he is trying to deal with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection is this. Suppose there are a number of grants, seven or eight grants given in an area to farmers.  A local trader forms himself into a public utility society for the building of these houses.  In reality that is not a public utility society.</P>

      <P>I think there is no necessity for the amendment.  Senator Keane and Senator Jameson have pointed out that this is already covered in the definitions.  If there is anything further required other than fresh legislation perhaps the Senator would bring in an amendment himself to cover it.  I think the matter would be covered in any event under Section 16, under which the Minister has power to make regulations.  Under these regulations he will have to satisfy himself that the societies are properly carried on and are such as are contemplated here.  If it is a case that there are too many public utility societies operating in any areas or that the personnel is not acceptable, the Minister will be able to refuse recognition to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Edward Bigger</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>7.&mdash;In the case of any grants made to a local authority under sub-section (1) of Section 5 or sub-section (1) of Section 6 of this Act, regulations to be prescribed by the Minister under Section 13 of this Act shall provide that not less than twenty per cent. of the dwellings for which such grants are made shall <Col N="1716" /> be allocated for the provision of housing accommodation for families living in one-roomed dwellings at the date of the making of such grants where either</P>
    <P>(a)  one or more members of any such family is or are suffering from tuberculosis; or</P>
    <P>(b)  one or more members of any such family, exclusive of the parents, has or have attained the age of sixteen years; or</P>
    <P>(c)  such dwelling has been condemned as being unfit for human habitation.</P>
    <P>The amendment standing in my name should appeal to every right-minded person.  Words utterly fail me in trying to describe the appalling conditions in some of the one-roomed dwellings. No person who has not visited these dwellings can have any conception of the hardships, suffering and misery the human beings living there have to submit to.  The minimum requirement for the new houses to be provided under this Bill is five hundred square feet of floor space, that is three times as large as most of the one-roomed dwellings I visited in which there were 7 to 11 human beings living.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to hurt the feelings of members of this House, but I must give some particulars of a few families living in these one-roomed dwellings. In one of these dwellings there were a father, mother, and seven children living in one room which was 12 feet by 14 feet, that is, 168 square feet of floor space.  The mother was suffering from tuberculosis and had been in Crooksling Sanatorium and was then attending the Tuberculosis Dispensary. One of the children was in the Sanatorium.  Can anyone imagine any surer way of spreading the disease, and what benefit is to be gained by sanatorium treatment under these conditions? The State pays half the cost of the sanatorium treatment; therefore it is in the interest of the State to prevent the spread of tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>The second case was that of another one-roomed dwelling, in which there were the father, mother and nine children. One child was in Crooksling <Col N="1717" /> Sanatorium and another was there last year.  There were there also another girl, nineteen years of age, and a boy seventeen years of age.  This is too appalling from a moral point of view, as well as being a hotbed for producing disease.</P>
    <P>In another one-roomed dwelling&mdash; this was a cellar kitchen&mdash;there were a father, mother and nine children, the eldest sixteen years of age.  A daughter died in this room.  The size of the room was 16 by 13 feet and 8 feet high.  This is a little more than one-third the size of the smallest new house to be provided under the Bill, and much less than half the cubic space required under the law for lodgers in common lodging-houses, much less than what is required under the Factories Act.</P>
    <P>The fourth case was that of another one-roomed dwelling, also a cellar kitchen.  In this there were the father, mother, and five children, the eldest sixteen years.  Three children have died in this room.  The father had been in Crooksling Sanatorium six times.  The size of the room was 12 × 14 × 8 feet.</P>
    <P>The fifth case was another one-roomed dwelling.  This was an attic, which contained the father, mother and eight children.  The father had been four times in Crooksling Sanatorium. The eldest daughter was twenty years of age.  The size of the room was 15 × 15 × 7 feet.</P>
    <P>All the facts I have given were taken down at the time of my visits.  I have notes of a number of other families living under similar conditions, but perhaps I have given enough to show that it is in the best interests of the community from every point of view that those living under the conditions I have mentioned should receive preference, as regards the houses that are to be provided by the State funds, to the extent of 66? per cent. of their cost.</P>
    <P>There are several ways I could elaborate what I have said.  I might point out the huge cost to the State of the sanatorium treatment, the loss of wages to the sufferers, the nullifying of the benefits of medical inspection <Col N="1718" /> of school children and child welfare schemes, the misery of the homes where one of the family is suffering from tuberculosis, the moral effect on adult children of both sexes living in one room with their parents, and so on.  Former housing schemes have done a great deal to improve the housing conditions, and most of the local authorities have spent to the limit of their resources on housing, still the worst features of the slum problem remain practically untouched.</P>
    <P>Ever since I entered this House six years ago, it was thought that with each of the Housing Bills introduced something would be done to relieve this appalling condition.  Certain things have been done, but they have not improved the worst features of the slum problem.  I willingly give every credit to the Government for trying to solve the slum problem, and I feel sure that that was their intention in providing such liberal financial assistance, and for bringing in the help of voluntary associations, but I can assure them their intentions will not be realised unless they make it a necessary condition that the classes I have indicated are provided for.  I know how difficult it is for a local authority to select tenants for any new or vacant houses under their control, and the influence that is brought to bear upon the members is such that they cannot select the most urgent cases.  It is, therefore, for the Government to see that the largest Government grant ever made towards housing in this or any other country in the world should be used to remove the appalling conditions indicated in the amendment which I now propose. I do hope, and sincerely hope, that the Government will agree to adopt it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to accept that amendment with certain changes if the Seanad would give me leave to add it as a new sub-section (5) to Section 6 in this form:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  The regulations made by the Minister for the purposes of this section shall provide that in the allocation of any houses in respect of the provision of which a contribution is made under this section preference <Col N="1719" /> may be given, wherever practicable, to the families living in one-roomed dwellings where either</P>
    <P>(a)  one or more members of the family is or are suffering from tuberculosis; or</P>
    <P>(b)  one or more members of the family exclusive of the parents has or have attained the age of sixteen years; or</P>
    <P>(c)  the dwelling has been condemned as unfit for human habitation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>That appears to be satisfactory, but there seems to be one snag in it and that is the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  What is the reason of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons are administrative reasons.  They compel the Minister to seek for some elasticity.  I am informed that the intentions underlying Senator Sir Edward Bigger's amendment are fully covered in the housing policy of the State, under the present as well as the preceding Governments.  In the 1931 Act it was specially designed to deal with the problem of slum clearances as laid down in Section 5.  Wherever the local authority takes power either to clear or demolish the whole slum area it is statutorily necessary for them to find accommodation for all persons who have been cleared, so to speak.  That is the position under the 1931 Act. There are there full powers to get that done.  The Senator seems to think that the particular cases he has in mind are not covered.  The question is, for example, with regard to the 20 per cent.  He says he only wants to point, say, to 20 per cent., but it may be found that 20 per cent, should not be the particular figure.  I have no doubt 100 per cent. could be brought in to a particular clause if the Senator desires.  Nobody would be more delighted than I would to have to keep in touch with the local authorities in Dublin and see what their view is.  I think the Seanad will realise that when it comes to slum dwellers the difficulty is as to where you are to draw a line between those suffering <Col N="1720" /> from tuberculosis and those who have or may have suffered from it.  It is rather hard to differentiate.  If it can be shown that in administration that discrimination can be made, it is fully our intention to make it, and I can assure the House that we will take every step possible to see that primary consideration is given to this clause.  But, I would remind the Senator and the House that I am not absolutely clear for example about the 20 per cent. There may be some difficulty in administration; I would like if the House is willing that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; which can be turned into the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; if the Minister so desires&mdash;it has been done&mdash;would be accepted in this particular clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I asked the question is that I am very interested in the amendment.  I believe there is a principle of very considerable importance underlying it.  If I understand what Senator Sir Edward Bigger desires it is this.  He has no doubt whatever, and I have no doubt whatever of the desire of any right-minded Minister, to whatever party he may belong, to see that as far as it reasonably can be done, people living in one-roomed dwellings shall be got out of them and into proper houses as soon as possible.  But if I understand correctly what he wants I think it is to make it an obligatory provision on the part of the local authorities that they will see that one-fifth of the houses are used for these people within these years.  I would not object&mdash;I cannot speak for Senator Sir Edward Bigger&mdash;to make the 20 per cent. &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  I would not at all object to run the risk if the Senator made it less.  I understand it provides that the Minister may make regulations. If, later on, on the Report Stage he would alter the wording from &ldquo;may make regulations&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall make regulations&rdquo; which would give him some discretion as to the amount of the percentage, I would be glad.  I feel there is a great deal in what has been said with regard to tuberculosis. If you speak to those who have had experience in what is known as &ldquo;after-care work,&rdquo; they will tell you <Col N="1721" /> that people sent to Crooksling and Peamount and other places come back certified by the doctor that they are cured and that they may go back to work, but they have not the ghost of a chance of remaining in good condition in the surroundings in which they live in the slums.  It sounds rather brutal but I doubt that it is doing any good to send people to sanatoria preserving their life for a short time and then sending them back to certain disease and death. What some of us would like to see introduced would be an obligation percentage in respect of provision for that kind of people, leaving the percentage to be fixed by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only fair to say that as far as the local authorities here are concerned they have done their best.  The last batch of houses allotted by the local authority here were given to cellar dwellers, people living in cellars and people living in houses that were condemned or about to fall and no others were considered. I think that in itself is sufficient to show that the local authorities here tackled the problem and dealt with people who deserved to be dealt with. I think the Bill itself specially provides that that is the type of person that the local authority will devote their attention to in the future.  I think that is the type of person that will be catered for by the local authority.  I have no objection to this amendment, but I think the provisions of the Bill show that it is not necessary to have it in.  However, I have no objection to it.  I am in full sympathy with it, but in order to be fair to the local authorities I say, that so far as I know, the houses that have been allotted were allotted to the right type of people.</P>

      <P>I beg to move recommendation No. 1:</P>
      <P>First Schedule.  To delete Ref. No. 5, including relevant references in columns 2, 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that these few recommendations of mine were too late for the Committee Stage.  Under the new conditions a Finance Bill really brings us into a whole mass of detail which previously was dealt with in a much more deliberate manner.  We have now in the Schedule of this Finance Bill virtually a whole range of Customs duties which, I suggest, a body of this kind is singularly unfitted to examine.  It is highly technical. I think it will be generally admitted that the confusion which followed the imposition of some of those duties rather suggests that this is not the right way in which to go about imposing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Reference No. 5, I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary some justification for the placing of a preferential rate of duty of 33? per cent. on metal door frames, metal window frames, metal window sashes, and metal casements, excluding certain of those articles which are designed, constructed and intended for use as containers for stained glass.  Surely all building material should be made not only as cheaply, but as wide in variety, as possible?  It is inconceivable that local manufacturers, in this matter of metal casements and other metal work set out in the Schedule, can adequately supply the country's requirements. Anybody who has seen the catalogues of the large firms which specialise in this work will observe the infinite variety of these articles and will realise that it would never be <Col N="1727" /> worth the while of any firm with a restricted market to make them. These articles are of specialised manufacture and they are varied in their design.</P>
    <P>I suggest that from the point of view of cheapness and quality we cannot, from our own resources, adequately meet those requirements.  I do not say you will not get metal casements of one or two varieties and they may look all right, but I cannot believe that in a restricted market there will not be a very great temptation to cut quality.  That is inherent in all these tariff questions in a manner that no ordinary person can detect.  The range of competition is one of the sure methods by which you receive value.  Value is not merely a question of price; it is just as much a matter of quality.  In this case there are articles which are necessary for building, which are what I might call the amenities of building owing to their variety, and I think it is very wrong that a heavy duty of this kind should be placed upon them and that the sources of supply should be so restricted. I fail to see why casements intended for use as containers for stained glass should be free.  I cannot take the view that ecclesiastical buildings, which probably have got stronger finances, should be given a preference of this kind.  I take it that is the object in this instance.  I think those engaged in work of that kind are just as well able to bear a tax as are those who are in need of housing and who very often are hard pressed to finance that need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The relative justification of any tariff is quite a difficult job.  As between half-a-dozen tariffs, to say one is justifiable and one is not justifiable is a matter for highly technical examination. Broadly speaking, this Government has decided that over a broad range those things which can be manufactured in Ireland, with the necessary limitations which are put upon them by the fact that they have to be manufactured in Ireland, shall be so <Col N="1728" /> manufactured.  That means that we may have to sacrifice variety in the article for the sake of getting it at home.  It may mean that in certain cases we may have to sacrifice some of the price for the purpose of getting it at home.  It means that we will be restricted necessarily in our choice if we are going to provide machinery for constructing a wide variety of articles for a limited market.</P>
      <P>That is quite a common and admitted condition in relation to the whole tariff position in respect to a small country with a limited market. Nobody needs to put up any one of those arguments in relation to any other thing which is objected to.  It is the policy of the Government to stand over those particular proposals for the purpose of having the goods manufactured here.  I say deliberately, as one who recognises the narrowness of the resources of this country and the greatness of its necessities, that we will have to be prepared to put up with the things that we can afford to have until we can afford to get the things that we want.  That is, broadly, the answer to all the objections which will be made to all tariffs on all articles for the purpose of a market which is relatively small.  There is no special objection outside that being put forward in relation to this particular tariff.</P>
      <P>There is a firm in Ireland capable and willing to make those things. There is a firm in Ireland at the present moment which gives a certain amount of variety.  There are other firms, such as the Macroom Engineering Works&mdash;and it is doing marvellous work in the way of casting and so on &mdash;which, with the wider market that will be provided, will be able to enter upon this trade.  On broad grounds, we are satisfied that the sacrifice of variety or anything else which is entailed in having these goods manufactured in this country is justified by the advantage of having them manufactured here and that is the reason we are going on with these tariffs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed that in the Parliamentary Secretary's reply&mdash; whether it was intentional or not&mdash; there was not a word mentioned about cost.  It is a peculiar thing that the Seanad's attention should be drawn to this when we have just finished the Housing Bill.  I should think that a very vital question arises as to the cost of housing and as to how the money spent on housing is to be spent and if it is to be profitably spent and for the benefit of the class that we are trying to help.  For instance, we find very vital items in the structure of a house &mdash;window frames, door frames and so on&mdash;of late years have been enormously improved and greatly cheapened and they have greatly cheapened the cost of building as far as one can judge, but I have not heard the Parliamentary Secretary say a word as to how the tax on these will affect the ultimate cost of the house.  It is true that we are not going to get from our Irish manufacturers at the present moment anything as cheap as the iron structures we are getting just now.  But the duty that is being put on these frames is going to raise the cost of the building of the houses and raise it to the prejudice of the very class for which we are passing the money under the Housing Bill.  The tax under the Finance Bill will fall on our very poorest classes.  There is no doubt it will increase the cost of the houses.  Why are we not logical?  Here we are trying to help the solving of the housing problem of the very poor classes and at the very same time we are increasing the cost of erecting these buildings.  The latter is part of the policy of the Government.  It is a <Col N="1730" /> policy which I cannot understand.  On the one hand, you say &ldquo;help the poor&rdquo; and, on the other hand, you are going to put a tax on the very money you are giving the poor to build those houses and you are making the solution of the housing problem more difficult. We are all going to pay in taxation for the grants towards these houses and yet a large part of that grant is going to be taken away because of the tariff on the building material.  I utterly fail to understand a policy like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say that in this matter of window frames and sashes, I noticed the Parliamentary Secretary has told us that there are firms now making this part of the material in Ireland.  If so they must be only beginning operations, I should imagine, and they will be in competition with firms in England.  I could mention several of the latter who have for years studied this department of the industry and who are turning out these things for a very long time and who now make them far more cheaply than they can be turned out here.  I think there is a great advantage in being able to buy things of this description in a cheap market and these things are very necessary for house building to-day.  I am afraid the Minister would not adopt my suggestion in the matter in regard to deleting the duty.  If it were necessary to support a local industry, which I <Col N="1731" /> admit is a most advantageous thing to do, I suggest that the rate of duty should be reduced.  I say that because a 50 per cent. or a 33? per cent. preferential duty will practically exclude all this metal work, castings and frames.  I know these are very finely turned out articles.  They are finished now all right.  It is quite impossible in any new factory to make an article equal to these at the same price.  After all, a reduced tariff would still allow the new industry here to develop slowly and on reasonable and proper lines.  But with a 50 per cent or a 33? per cent.  Imperial preference duty it will be made practically impossible to make use here of these metal frames which are now almost invariably used in both small and large houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that probably we are only discussing again the principles which were discussed on quite a number of similar recommendations.  I would not like it to be thought that there was not some pretty good quality, and well-made window frames turned out at present in Ireland and they have, I think, been made for some years.  One firm of which I have knowledge had very long experience in metal work.  Where I myself differ from the Government policy is, as I said previously, not that they are prepared to put on tariffs for the purpose of getting goods made here, but that instead of proceeding slowly they are going on without a careful examination. As I have demonstrated here on a good many occasions, if you have one-sixth of the total demand as in the case of shoes, it would not be wise to put on a high tariff on the whole amount instead of proceeding gradually so as to give the home manufacturer an opportunity of gradually increasing his output.  The same thing applies in this case.  If you have specific articles in metal work and if you were satisfied that the articles could be made here if you gave them protection, in that gradual way you could get the manufacture of the articles going here without increasing the cost to the people.  That would have been the <Col N="1732" /> way to proceed.  But the policy now is to go along slap-bang in every way and then hope for the best.  I do not think that is the best way to proceed. I do not disagree with most of the arguments put up by the Parliamentary Secretary, but when he assumes that the policy to be accepted is that you are to pay for the setting up of industries here by paying higher prices than would be necessary if a scientific way were adopted, then I disagree with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that this metal work required for houses built under housing schemes should be allowed to come in free of duty?  After all, the necessity of having this material as cheap as possible has been recognised and the way to help in that direction now is to leave it in free of tariff.  It is essential that the money that we are going to vote for the housing scheme should be put to the very best advantage and that we should get as many houses as possible for the money voted.  I ask that the Parliamentary Secretary should make inquiry in the office of the Revenue Commissioners as to what loss would be entailed by admitting, duty free, metal work for houses for these schemes that we have been discussing to-day. Failing that, I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary would agree to fixing a very reduced tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour these broader issues.  We have got to agree to differ, but I do rather feel a certain satisfaction that the Parliamentary Secretary practically makes my case.  He says that as a small nation we have got to suffer in a lack of variety.  Why should we suffer because we are a small nation?  I do not want to get into deep waters, but the whole philosophy of life, as expounded by the Government, is that because we happen to be a small nation our whole standard of life should be reduced.  Now that is a way of looking at it that has the effect of discouraging people of wealth to seek the amenities of life.  It will suggest to them either to stay out of the country <Col N="1733" /> or if they are in the country to leave it.  The result is that the money they might have been circulating here is lost to the country.  That is a very big issue.  It would be a different matter if these things were examined carefully and their implications weighed, but the Government are dealing with the matter like a bull in a china shop and there is the end of it.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary thought anything about the reactions of these things and what they will do?  Has he abandoned all inquiry by the Tariff Commission and substituted for it Ministerial orders after a cursory examination?  This is a matter that vitally affects the most important element of our national life, that of housing. This is a very flagrant case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I took the line at the beginning with the deliberate purpose to avoid a whole lot of futile discussion. I do not want every single thing of this kind that is brought up as an individual instance to be made the basis of a general tariff debate.  That is exactly what I was out to stop, and for that reason I have stated with strength and clarity, which Senator Sir John Keane is apparently incapable of, the case against tariffs as strongly as it could be put so that it would be recognised that we are fully conscious of everything that could be stated against it and that it is on balance as between good and evil, that we have decided this particular matter.  In other words, we are going to save Senator Sir John Keane the trouble of making the same speech that he made on the first recommendation on every other recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator said that we have abandoned the systematic method of inquiry.  We have abandoned the method by which they spent three years inquiring into a tariff on coach-building while the trade and industry of coach-building was in process of disappearing.  We have abandoned that definitely.  The Senator wants to know why a small nation should suffer under a lack of variety?  Because a small nation may not be able to survive unless it is prepared to put up with that and other difficulties.  If we <Col N="1734" /> are going to take it on that no man in this country will be employed except he is employed on a job which cannot be done cheaper in any other country in the world, then this small nation will disappear.  We are not prepared to play chess in the matter.  The Senator spoke of going ahead like a bull.  He asked me to play chess with the bull, and I am not going to do it. Those are the actual circumstances in the world, and I am not going to have a nice mathematical formula put up to me which means the elimination of the whole people of this country, a scientific programme as represented by three years of investigating an industry which was disappearing.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas has put up a question which, in my opinion, is one of legitimate difference.  Accepting the principle that we have to make sacrifices for the purpose of getting industries by means of tariffs, at what rate shall we do it?  That is a matter of perfectly legitimate difference of opinion.  We differ from Senator Douglas, and for that reason we refuse this recommendation.  Senator Jameson has taken on a perfectly common polemical case against this thing; it interferes with housing.  It is always the poor, always the poor widow and the orphan who are called in to help in all these cases.</P>

      <P>And who suffer.  If, for instance, you add an extra tax on drink it is the widows and orphans who have to share it.  If you do anything in relation to any large company or enterprise it is the widows and the orphans who hold all the shares. Senator Jameson, I am very glad to say, did not take the whole burden on his own shoulders, like the Knight of Tears, but he certainly did use these people.  I am in favour of everything that is humanly possible being done in relation to reducing the cost of housing, but I am not prepared to take censure from those who are not prepared to do it themselves.  When has the Seanad, which objects to this cost of housing, objected to other costs of housing?  When have they helped us <Col N="1735" /> to reduce ground rents, when have they helped us to reduce freights, when have they helped us to reduce law costs or helped us to reduce anything except the labour costs that goes into housing?</P>

If the Seanad and the Dáil are prepared to take the line of doing anything and everything which is necessary to reduce the cost of housing to the lowest limit, I am prepared to go for it, but I am certainly not prepared to take the line that we should be treated as people who are acting improperly when we had not concentrated on iron windows and ignored the lawyers, ground-renters and all the rest which enter into the cost of this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> I put down this recommendation to get information.  What is the purpose behind this proposal?  Is it to raise revenue or is it a tax on ideas?  If it is not to raise revenue, I think it is very wrong to place a tax on printed matter&mdash;not that I myself do not regard some printed matter as highly dangerous.  But on the whole, I would rather incur the danger than not have the printed matter at all; it is a safety valve.  It does seem to be a most reactionary aspect of tariff policy to tax thought or ideas as expressed in print.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to define the meaning of &ldquo;foreign Government.&rdquo;  I cannot imagine that, holding the views he and his Party do, the British Government, which are generally supposed to be governing us here and under whose tyranny we are supposed to be suffering, could be classed as &ldquo;foreign.&rdquo;  I should like enlightenment on that point.  I should also like to know why the tax on books is confined to those bound in leather or in imitation leather.  If they are going to be taxed at all, why should only one limited class be taxed?  I suggest that, owing to the tax, there will be very little demand for that class of books.  I do not want to enter into elaboration of the broader principles.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will refrain on this item from a general attack on the mentality of this House.  I was not surprised at his last outburst.  I never expected his timidity at his first shot yesterday to last long&mdash;it was only to be expected&mdash;but I assure him that he should, with no justification whatever, not distinguish himself by a rather unseemly attack&mdash;an unwarranted attack &mdash;on this House which, as far as I can recollect, on no occasion has rejected any measure brought forward by either Government to ameliorate the conditions of the working classes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane described this as a tax on ideas.  Well, if the object of a tariff is to promote new industries in this country, a tax on foreign ideas may be assumed to promote new industries.  I hope, in the future, we will have some new ideas <Col N="1738" /> in which we can join, and that we will not be brigaded into Parties which are now as old as our grandfathers.  I hope to see Senator Sir John Keane and ourselves having the same ideas on some subject in the near future.</P>

      <P>Unless Senator Douglas spoke from experience, as a commercial man, in relation to his own printing, when he said what he said he certainly ought to withdraw it in the interests of the reputation of commercial morality.  The Senator thought this referred only to fiction.  Broadly speaking it refers to commercial printing. Most of the stuff that will come under this item will be commercial printing, which Senator Douglas would be the first to say is not supposed to be fiction.</P>

      <P>The object is protective. It is for revenue to the extent to which it does not provide new employment. That is a definition of protective duty of a reasonable character.  It is intended to protect our own industry including all binding that has foreign leather, to which Senator Sir John Keane objects.  I understand that the binding output in Ireland recently from the technical point of view would compare with anything in the world. We are anxious to maintain that condition, just in the same way as yesterday we had to deal with trade technique that we do not know; that was on &ldquo;eights&rdquo; for rowing.  In the same way the technique in which we have been supreme we desire to maintain. If Senator Sir John Keane's objection is to any preference or discrimination in favour of leather or other binding, if he would like to put down a recommendation that it be extended to all binding we will consider it with an amount of care.  As far as the general reference to myself&mdash;the unprovoked attack made upon myself&mdash;and the inarticulation which made it difficult to know whether it was humility of which he accused me or not, I can only <Col N="1739" /> say that my humility is much preferable to Senator Sir John Keane's humidity, and that I am very glad the form of attack which he has been subjected to has raised the temperature so high that from this on he will be dry.</P>

    <P>In order to show the effects in this special case that this will have I had the misfortune to try to restore some old Adam plaster work and I found that it is quite impossible to get the moulds in this country.  My inquiries, which may be challenged, led me to believe that it was impossible to get the old moulds of work of a first class character done here.  Only one or two firms are in possession of these moulds. People with any artistic taste wishing <Col N="1740" /> to restore a work of value will have to pay the tax on the imported article. There again that strikes absolutely at the amenities of life and does reduce the standard of living in the country.

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Recommendation No. 5:</P>
      <P>Second Schedule.  To delete Ref. No. 3, including relevant references in columns 2, 3, 4 and 5.</P>
      <P>I put this recommendation down in order to get information as to why a tax on newspapers is necessary at all. Is it for revenue or to limit again thought, inquiry, and the stimulus of ideas amongst the reading public?  If necessary, why is it limited to certain papers and not imposed upon all papers?  Why are ordinary large-sized daily papers free while a weekly one like <i>The Spectator</i>, which, generally speaking, appeals to a most thoughtful and intellectual class, is taxed?  There seems to be no policy or purpose except, of course, the very potent one of <i>force majeure</i> behind it, and that the Government cannot afford to offend the more popular daily papers, but does not mind the comments of <i>The Spectator</i> or <i>The new Statesman</i>, which appeal to a very limited public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then again, why is this tax confined to English papers, papers published in the English language?  Why should this tax not affect Russian, French or German papers?  The whole thing seems to me to be utterly inconsistent. I can quite understand the exclusion of periodicals of trade unions.  Behind that is the idea of the master's voice. I do not want any explanation on that point.  I should like also some explanation of the term &ldquo;in bulk.&rdquo;  It does not seem satisfactory to leave these general terms to the well-intentioned and, I admit, the generally well-applied judgment of the Revenue Commissioners. Can we not get from the Government some idea of what &ldquo;in bulk&rdquo; means?  If Senator Gogarty or myself brings in two or three papers are we obliged to pay tax or not on them or where does this end?  This whole tax seems reactionary.  It <Col N="1742" /> seems far more a political tax or to be far more inspired by a political outlook than by the so-called tariff or revenue point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That a voice which pleads so strongly for thought and culture should make a speech which was nothing but a series of innuendoes is the condemnation of that speech and the whole mentality behind it. We have nothing but &ldquo;His Master's Voice,&rdquo;&ldquo;the political outlook&rdquo; and the &ldquo;superior newspapers.&rdquo;  That was all.  That is certainly not a good introduction for an amendment which is put forward on the grounds of the development of culture.  The matter of Senator Sir John Keane's speech can be dealt with simply.  &ldquo;Bulk&rdquo; means two or more.  Very subtle! The reason that English papers are taxed is because unfortunately we do, most of us, know English and anyone who gets in a German or French paper will have to do some study as a rule, and in the process of reading it will keep up that culture and development of thought which is so desirable in the estimation of Senator Sir John Keane.  The object is again a protective object, to develop, if possible, printing along that line and alternatively to get revenue. Senator Sir John Keane will understand that in all these cases you have a formula in which there is protection, there is revenue and there is possibly even regulation.  In all cases that formula is made up of these particular qualities in different values.  I do not think that I need be asked to go into the larger question of what Sir John or I might think might be reactionary&mdash;whose master's voice we are to obey in this country.  That is a matter we ought to leave out of this question.  It is to be regretted that Senator Sir John Keane's recommendation cannot be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the object of this tax unless it is purely for revenue purposes.  What substitute <Col N="1743" /> can we supply in this country for a number of the weekly journals which are taxed?  I might mention <i>The New Statesman</i>, which I invariably read and which is rather favourable to the present Government.  Then you have such papers as <i>The Saturday Review</i> and <i>The Spectator.</i>  Surely it is not suggested that they are being taxed because the Saorstát is in process of developing the production of periodicals of the same description? That cannot be the reason.  If the Minister told us the tax was purely for revenue purposes I could understand it.  On that ground I object myself to paying 7d. for <i>The Spectator</i> every week.  The amount of revenue from this tariff is infinitesimal while it is most annoying.  I remember the first time I was asked to pay it I felt inclined to do without the paper.  That, however, was foolish, so I paid my extra penny.  I really think it is most annoying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to call attention to the tax as it affects children's papers, those of boys particularly.  A large number of small boys are growing up rebels against the Government because of the fact that they have to pay 3d. for these papers now.  I think it is a hardship to children to deprive them, as it is depriving a great many of them, of their weekly literature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my personal opinion about this tax, as it has been discussed so freely. I think it must be recognised that a great many of the periodicals that were coming into this country and for which there was a ready market were not at all of a desirable type.  I refer to the very big circulation of such papers as were known as penny weeklies and that were published in England.  It is felt that if these are going to come in &mdash;and they do come in in bulk to a circulation of thirty or forty thousand &mdash;at least that circulation justifies printing here.  I do not think the culture of the country is going to be disturbed or interfered with if these papers are kept out.  The same applies, only to a greater extent, to such boys' <Col N="1744" /> papers as come in here.  They were entirely an anglicising and certainly not an improving type of literature, if one could call them literature at all. The purpose is to get such papers as have a large circulation printed here or preferably have these substituted by papers of our own.  If they have to come in, then we should make these papers a source of revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister is not disposed to treat my remarks seriously.  I think it is due to the House to be told or to be given more particulars as to the revenue which it is estimated will be derived from this tax.  Senator Connolly tells us what is intended, but does he realise the effect of this?  The effect of this is that if a person gets the <i>Boys Own Paper, The Sphere</i> and <i>The Spectator</i> by post he is charged 3/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not correct? I shall put it this way.  If you get three old copies of <i>The Sphere</i> in you are charged 3/-.  That has been my unfortunate experience.  That is what actually happens in practice. No doubt, perhaps, it is not intended, but one of the beauties of all this tariff business is that what is not intended very often happens.  That is the sort of thing that happens, and the Parliamentary Secretary must be extraordinarily out of touch if he does not know how exasperated the people are about these things.  Would he deal specifically with these cases?  For example, if you get two or three of these papers sent you in one wrapper, are you not allowed?</P>

      <P>There you are! There is the kind of irritation the public is suffering.  Take a person in a country district.  He cannot rely on a newsagent in his district.  You have not got newsagents in these districts who find it worth while to carry stocks of these more or less intellectual newspapers with a limited public.  I only ask the Seanad to weigh the two <Col N="1745" /> sides.  The Parliamentary Secretary is asking us to look at it from the employment side.  Up and down the country there are people being annoyed beyond all measure by this policy, and that is why I think it my duty to bring up this matter, simply as one example of the actual effect, the irritating effect, of this no doubt well-intentioned policy.</P>

      <P>I admitted it.  Not merely did I admit it, but I proclaimed the truth of Senator Sir John Keane's statement, and he says &ldquo;There you are&rdquo;!  That does not carry us anywhere.  What does it mean?  It means that if someone who prefers to get some English newsagent to send him the stuff, it will cost him 3/-, and if he tells a newsagent in Dublin to send it, it will cost him 3d.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh yes!  That is the difficulty.  There is no reason in the wide world to believe that they would be even a day late in the matter, and the idea that the whole policy of the Government is to be altered because somebody is afraid that his copy of the <i>Delineator</i> or the <i>Tatler</i> or the <i>Sphere</i> might arrive a day late is absurd.  It is enormously important to such people to see those beautiful advertisements on the front pages, but to the average person it does not matter the tossing of a coin. By putting on that 3/-, it means that Senator Connolly, in his capacity as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, will get the revenue of the distribution of those newspapers to the extent to which they are distributed by post as distinct from the revenue obtained on the other side.  This is a tax making for regulation to the extent of keeping out relatively undesirable periodicals &mdash;I mean a certain type of periodical which does not certainly include such papers as those mentioned.  The tax is here in relation to income, to the extent that the type of people who buy <i>Tatler</i> or the <i>Delineator</i> or the <i>Sphere</i> are quite capable of paying the extra tax, having regard to the 5/- in the £ of income tax and all sorts of other taxes on the poor <Col N="1746" /> here yesterday.  It is for the purpose of giving employment to the extent to which it will induce these things to be printed in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have a certain sympathy with the objection of Senator Miss Browne on the point of the boys' papers.  I will tell a story, however, which will illustrate the hopelessness of her position. The Minister who was responsible, and who has refused to exempt them in my House, was subject to the most violent pressure of two small boys, whom I cannot resist under any circumstances, and they were not able to shift him.  If they were not able to do it, I am perfectly sure the Seanad will not be able.</P>

      <P>Second Schedule.  To delete Ref. No. 6, including relevant references in columns 2, 3, 4 and 5.</P>
      <P>Here again, I should like to protest against this tax on books confined to novels.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary say how this distinction is really going to be determined, because I imagine that there is a very wide range of literature which is on the borderline?  And again, why is this tax, or most of this tax, confined to books printed in the English language? Is it a revenue tax?  If so, how much is it going to bring in?  If it is not a revenue tax what is its purpose?</P>

      <P>As far as regulation is concerned, to an extent that the Senator is in quite as good a position as I am to judge.  To what degree a particular amount of tax would prevent a particular amount of literature coming in, his judgment is a matter of his opinion, and mine would not most certainly be agreed to by him.  From the point of view of income, as far as all the taxes in the Dáil are concerned, <Col N="1747" /> a figure of £900,000 was estimated to cover all of them.  It was recognised that owing to the lack of systematic preparation, it was not possible to get those exact estimates which we would like, in relation to a whole series of individual items which have proved to be so wrong in so far as they were systematically examined.  We do not profess to give in any detail the income which is to be derived from each of those sources.  From the point of view of employment, it is certainly giving employment.  There is a firm here in Dublin which is turning out very excellently bound volumes.  I read one every night of my life, because I do not sleep in the City.  They are the best bound and easiest to read of any novels of that particular character which I have come across, and I believe that this tax will enable that industry to be developed.</P>

Considering the number of things that the Revenue Commisioners are asked to define it does seem a ridiculous job to ask them now to define a novel. They are asked, for instance, to define what is religious.  If we have that amount of confidence in them that we ask them to define what is a religious periodical I think we may leave them safely to define what is a novel.

I do not think anyone could have pointed out more forcibly <Col N="1748" /> the absurdity of the whole thing than the case of the Revenue Commissioners being asked to define what is religious. It was very interesting what the Parliamentary Secretary stated about a firm turning out excellent novels of which the Parliamentary Secretary tells us he reads one each night.  I am surprised he has that capacity.  I think there can be only one firm in the country that is doing that particular trade, that is a firm that does cheap business and has done a lot of printing for Woolworths.  It would be worth his while to inquire further. The managing director of the firm I have in mind said that owing to the tariff policy that has been pursued they have lost their export trade.  I think it is worth following up to see if it is the same firm.  It certainly is a firm that does a large amount of novel printing and the managing director informed me that they were losing their export trade.  I am sure the Minister would like to know what the reactions of his policy are and I think this would be one of the ways of finding out.  I ask leave to withdraw the recommendation.</P>

Like Senator O'Hanlon, I put forward my argument against postponing the Committee Stage last Friday and also set out the reasons why this Control of Manufactures Bill should be taken and disposed of this week.  I do not propose to go into these arguments again.  If the Bill is held up in this way we can only look upon it as obstruction, in the sense that the proposals of the Government, embodied in the Control of Manufactures Bill, are being held up with very serious results to the whole industrial development of the Government, and to employment in the State generally.

I am half inclined to think that, if we proceed with the Committee Stage, we should make up our minds that we are going to give the Bill complete, otherwise, I do not see any reason why we should go ahead with it.  My own opinion is that there are no great developments likely to be held up and the country will not be much worse for waiting another nine or ten weeks. This is a most difficult measure and it has to be carefully considered and I admit that I, for one, have not given, or have not had the opportunity of giving, sufficient consideration to these amendments, and I say with the greatest possible respect that for the House to proceed with the Committee Stage would, to me, anyway, seem rather foolish and a thing which the House should not commit itself to.

Let us go through the Committee Stage, and, if we do decide that it has to be put off, let it be because we know, after having put it through Committee, that there is no good going on; that it is impossible to do justice to it, but to divide about it now, when, even Senator O'Hanlon admits that he has not had time to go through the things, will not get us much further.  Let us, at any rate, thrash it out.  We may all come to the conclusion that he is perfectly right, but at present some of us are not persuaded.  We think that we ought to see if there is a chance in Committee of arriving at the conclusion that it can be done.  At present I believe Senator O'Hanlon is right. I do not think the House can possibly give us enough attention, but I do not think that we ought to decide on that now.  I think we ought to see what we can do with it in Committee.</P>

    <P>This is a comparatively small amendment and I think the Minister will appreciate the reasons for it.  I found a good deal of difficulty in drafting most of the amendments that stand in my name and I quite recognise that it may be necessary, on Report, to make some alterations, but I gathered from the Minister that it was not the intention generally to control the retail trade.  The provisions of the Bill, as amended in the Dáil, allow retailers <Col N="1755" /> to pack, bottle or label goods.  In other trades, it is quite usual to make repairs of a minor nature, and, so long as the repairs are made by a retailer for sale by him, it would be clearly in the spirit of the Bill, and I propose, therefore to add the words &ldquo;alteration or repair.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1, sub-section (2).  To delete lines 26-27 and to substitute therefor the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  a person born in Ireland or a person born outside Ireland whose mother was a resident in Ireland but temporarily absent from Ireland at the time of his birth.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1756" /> I am not at all satisfied that my amendment is drafted as well as it ought to be.  However, it raises one of the most important matters in connection with this Bill.  It deals with one of the issues in which, judging by his speech on the Second Reading, the Minister held rather different views to those held by me.  It deals with a matter which I consider is of the greatest importance, not only to this Bill, but to the country.  The Bill, as it comes to us, provides that a person will be regarded as a Saorstát national only if he has either been born within the area of the Free State or if he has resided in the Free State, no matter where he was born, for a period of seven years.  I was not able to be here during the debate, but I gathered from what I read of the Minister's speech that he was afraid people would reside in Northern Ireland and then come in here on short residence.  I can quite understand that attitude and I am not proposing to provide that residence in Northern Ireland would be sufficient.</P>
    <P>I hold that in a Bill of this kind it is absolutely wrong to exclude a man who is carrying on business here, who has put money into the country, because he had the fortune or the misfortune to be born in the Six Counties, which was then Ireland and which we still all regard as Ireland.  To show something of the absurdity of it, I would like to point out that the present acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the last Government, the Minister for Finance in this Government and the Minister for Finance in the last Government were all born in the Six Counties.  If this Bill is to be taken as it stands, we are in the extraordinary position that we believe birth in the Six Counties is quite good enough for a Minister for Finance or a Minister for Industry and Commerce, but it will not do in the case of a person holding shares in a company here. Frankly, I am unable to see why a person who was born in the Six Counties should have to reside seven years here before he can hold shares in a company.</P>
    <P>If the Bill provided &mdash; though I am <Col N="1757" /> not advocating it &mdash; that birth after the partitioning of the country was to count I still would not be in favour of it, although I could understand it. But it does not provide anything of the kind.  As we know quite well, in most cases the people who will be ruled out under this Bill will be people who were born before the partitioning of the country and who happened, through no fault of their own, to be born in the Six Counties.  I think there is a principle of very considerable importance involved.  I want people born in Northern Ireland, particularly the people who may not have much interest here, to be encouraged to put money into industries in the Saorstát.  I believe it is to our interest to get them financially interested here.  If every one of them was so interested, we probably would not have to talk about Partition at all.  I am proposing that we should include persons born inside the whole of Ireland and I am suggesting a provision where a mother might be temporarily absent from Ireland, but was yet an Irish resident.  I suggest that that should be sufficient to qualify a person under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it must be realised that however regrettable it is, and it is more regrettable to me, perhaps, even than to Senator Douglas, to find the people of the Six Counties excluded from citizenship here, that position has not been of our creation.  The Senator has instanced the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the last Executive and myself, and quite a number of others might be instanced too.  I am sure the late Minister for Industry and Commerce feels equally with me the undesirable position that we have been placed in, and that our fellow-citizens in the Six Counties have been placed in, but we have to realise what occurred and how it occurred and the conditions that now prevail.  One has to admit, whether one likes it or not, that a series of political events caused the partitioning of this country.  We know, without going into political issues of that nature at the moment, where the responsibility for that position <Col N="1758" /> lies.  I submit the case is not parallel with any of the people mentioned by Senator Douglas because of their long residence here.  To eliminate any residence test, to leave it possible for a person born of an Irish mother, widens the scope of this measure until its citizenship clause would cease to have any effect whatever.</P>

      <P>(a)  a person born in Ireland or a person born outside Ireland whose mother was a resident in Ireland but temporarily absent from Ireland at the time of his birth.</P>
      <P>In the event of an unexpected birth, where a person would be on holidays or away for a period of twelve months or so in the United States or on a visit to relatives, I do not think there would be any impediment placed in the way of citizenship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not dealing with citizenship now; we are dealing with the actual provisions of the Bill. I only put in the second portion of my amendment in order to show there was a difficulty there and in the hope that the Minister would find a better way of dealing with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated already, the whole issue of citizenship has been neglected for the last ten years.  We propose to have citizenship defined.  At the moment this is the nearest approach that we can make to what would suit this measure pending a definite definition of citizenship. In all the circumstances we could not possibly accept this amendment because it would widen the scope, and the whole purpose as regards conserving possibilities for manufacturers here could be evaded entirely.  We certainly would be glad to have the people of the thirty-two counties in a position to come here to start factories &mdash; invest money in factories, operate them and everything else, but the political position must be recognised at the moment.  Certain politicians and alleged statesmen in <Col N="1759" /> the North of Ireland decided that the Six Counties would have nothing to do with the Twenty-six Counties.  I spent a good portion of my life resisting that.  We were beaten at it. These people cannot have it both ways.  You might as well say, &ldquo;We are all citizens of the British Empire&rdquo; and have people from England coming in.  The principle is the same.  These people in the Six Counties are more affiliated with the whole political life of Britain than with us.  They claim that they are British, that is to say, a small majority in the North of Ireland claim that they are British and that they have succeeded in establishing that political position.  For these reasons, I do not see that there is any justification for the case that Senator Douglas has made and we could not accept it in the terms of this Bill.  It would be fundamentally in opposition to the whole idea of it.</P>

      <P>Surely it is very inconsistent for Senator Connolly and his Party to go on protesting against the Partition of Ireland while they bring in Bills like this which are rising the barriers every day?  I do submit that it is due to their policy for the past ten years that we have Partition to-day.</P>

      <P>I protest against that statement of Senator Miss Browne. We are not responsible for the Boundary Commission.  We are not responsible for the Feetham Commission. We are not responsible for having the Boundary there.  But Partition is there and the people responsible for Partition cannot have it both ways, and so far as we are concerned they will not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech made by Senator Connolly is getting away from the issue entirely.  The vast majority of the people for whom I speak neither approved of Partition nor resisted it.  These people come under this Bill because they have been born in the Six Counties.  The Constitution provides for a Bill dealing with citizenship and it is time a Bill were introduced to deal with it.  A considerable inconvenience has been caused to <Col N="1760" /> a great many people through the absence of this Citizenship Bill.  The Constitution sets out the principles on which such a Citizenship Bill must apply.  If you read Article III of the Constitution you will find it stated, &ldquo;Every person without distinction of sex, domiciled in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) at the time of the coming into operation of this Constitution, who was born in Ireland or either of whose parents was born in Ireland...&rdquo;  A person born in the Six Counties if he happened to be a shareholder in a business here would be disqualified under this Bill.  The Minister knows I have a great respect for his point of view, but he must admit that the wording of this section is not right and unless he can produce a better wording I must press my amendment.</P>

There are people in the North who are not in favour of the Boundary either, people who are good Irishmen and Irishwomen, and I think it is wrong to cut them completely out, if they want to come in. Even yet I hope that the Minister will find some way of allowing the people to come under this Bill, and I hope that some accommodation will be found.</P>

      <P>I need not explain again that as a Six Counties man, born and reared there and spending most of my business life in Belfast, there is no person more anxious to see how it can be done than I am. I cannot see how the principle can be accepted, the political situation being as it is.  I hold that we are the victims of an inheritance, and if anybody can suggest a way by which it can be got round I will welcome such a suggestion. I would welcome a Citizenship Bill to define this.  But the situation is that there is a political entity of the Twenty-six Counties and another political entity of the Six Counties. Obviously in a Bill of this kind where we want to protect manufacturers within our own State, the solution of the <Col N="1761" /> problem is the abolition of the Boundary.</P>

      <P>There are people resident in the Free State now who have not at the moment resided there for seven years.  In the case of the Minister himself who happened to have service abroad, if this Bill had been introduced three or four years ago he would not be entitled to hold shares in one of these firms although residing here for he had not seven years' residence. I am saying that in a friendly way to show that there is something here that must be dealt with.  This Bill as it stands cuts people like that out.  I am of opinion that a man who is prepared to put money into a firm here, and who happens to have been born in the Northern area is far more <Col N="1762" /> likely to come to live here if this section is omitted.  Many people have come to live here because they happened to have money invested here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 5:</P>
      <P>Section 1, sub-section (2).  To delete in line 29 the word &ldquo;seven&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;three.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister's previous offer still holds good, I would be prepared to accept &ldquo;5.&rdquo;  I think &ldquo;7&rdquo; is rather long.  This deals with the question of length of residence.  This &ldquo;residence&rdquo; means that any person, whether born in Hong Kong or Jamaica, can become, I will not say a citizen but a national under this Bill, if he lives here seven years.  I am in this difficulty that I feel that seven years, that is for people starting now, is not unreasonable having regard to the idea of the Bill.  I think that for people with money in <Col N="1763" /> the country and who are in here at the present moment three years is ample. What I would like to suggest to the Minister, if he would consider it, is that people who are actually residing here at the present moment having put money in the country that three years' residence is ample, but as regards other people who may come in now and want to get the qualification, I do not object to the longer residence. I confess also that the carrying of the other amendment, if it remains in the Bill, makes this amendment not nearly so important from my point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept a compromise on this, namely, five years.  On the question of people who are already in here and engaged in carrying on a certain business, if we assume that they are not going to engage in other manufacturing business, then this Bill will hardly affect them at all.  It may, of course, affect them as shareholders or as interested parties, but in all the circumstances I am prepared to agree to the seven years being amended to five.  It has to be remembered in all these discussions, both as regards citizenship and everything else, that my attitude and the attitude of the Ministry is entirely based on the effective use of this particular Bill.  It has nothing to do with our fundamental attitude to citizenship.  One has to realise the circumstances and the application of those principles to a Bill of this type which is rather vital to various manufacturing interests already established in the State which might allow very undesirable elements to come in and exploit the possibilities even under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 1, sub-section (2).  To delete in line 30 the words &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;any country comprised within the British Commonwealth&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister may not take this amendment seriously, but I assure him that such is my intention in moving it. I cannot accept, for one moment, and I hope the House will not accept, this political division as in any way regulating business or economic activity.  One would have thought &mdash; I do not want to make a second reading speech &mdash; that the tariff policy would have been sufficient; that when you have got manufacturers protected by tariffs that you had done with it.  Not a bit of it.  You go further now and you limit the control of business to nationals.  I regard it as an indictment of the capacity of our own nationals to do business and face the ordinary competition that they may come up against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the whole principle is thoroughly enervating.  To come more closely to the amendment, the provision is against the whole of our Commonwealth spirit.  Of course, it will be said: &ldquo;The Commonwealth spirit leaves us cold; we are not in any way concerned about the Commonwealth; we want to be a separate, isolated Republic doing our business in our own way, be that way good or bad.&rdquo;  If Ireland's idea is to stimulate trade, we must increase our exports. We must have exports to buy a large amount of the raw material that we cannot produce ourselves. That seems never to enter into the consideration of the Government.  To carry on, we must obtain the raw material of industry.  We can only pay for that by our exports and we can only build up an export trade by efficiency and by providing goods at a competitive price.  That is the fallacy underlying this whole policy of economic isolation.  In our own interests <Col N="1765" /> and in the interests of cooperation, we should recognise this Empire association and let business in this country be carried on freely by any citizens of the British Commonwealth. The restriction is quite capricious.  A person who does not happen to be born in the country may find himself handicapped under this Bill.  On the other hand, a person born here of British parents &mdash; if you like, the child of a member of the British garrison stationed here in former times &mdash; who has no connection with Ireland and no sympathy with the country whatever, by reason of being born here, can qualify as a national.  The whole thing seems to be ridiculous.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 7:</P>
      <P>Section 1.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  A person shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be resident in Saorstát Eireann if he has spent the greater portion of each year in Saorstát Eireann or if he is resident outside Saorstát Eireann in the employment of a person or corporate body carrying on business in Saorstát Eireann or if he is resident outside Saorstát Eireann in the service of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is intended to supply a defect in the Bill.  I do not profess for a moment to have been successful in that intention.  If this Bill is going to be workable and if it is to be possible <Col N="1766" /> for a company secretary to find out whether or not his shareholders are Saorstát nationals within the meaning of the Bill, there will have to be some definition of &ldquo;residence.&rdquo;  I am not a lawyer but I am informed that we cannot, by referring to any other Act, find out the meaning of the word &ldquo;residence.&rdquo;  The meaning I have put down does not purport to be satisfactory. It is merely put down to raise the question, in the hope that the Minister or his Department will see the necessity of having a definition brought in in a properly drafted amendment.  In this amendment, I have suggested that if a man has lived here the greater part of the year he should be regarded as a resident.  I have also tried to draft another provision which, I think, is necessary. Probably, the Minister will appreciate that I had him in view when framing the last portion of this amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister spent a certain portion of his life in useful work for this country abroad.  I think it would be quite wrong if that could not be counted as residence here.  I think that any person in the service of the State should be regarded as resident here.  I also think &mdash; I see a difficulty here as regards the wording &mdash; that a person <i>bona fide</i> in the service of a company here who has to reside abroad because of his service in that company should not lose his residence qualification here.  I want to get a definition of &ldquo;residence&rdquo; which will include people who are in the service of the State or who are in the service of <i>bona fide</i> Irish companies and who may have to live abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have discussed this question at considerable length with our legal advisers.  We think the position as stipulated in the Bill is really better, even from Senator Douglas's point of view, than the suggested amendment.  It is true that in no legislation passed here has &ldquo;residence&rdquo; been defined.  That omission is not accidental.  The matter is judged by the court when it comes up for legal decision.  I understand that the court practice is to have regard to all the circumstances, including <Col N="1767" /> such circumstances as Senator Douglas mentioned.  In the case of a citizen sent out of the country as a foreign representative and detained there for nine months, twelve months or two or three years, it would not, I think, be contended, nor do I think that it would be held by the Court, that residence was broken.  It is for that reason, as I understand, that the definition of &ldquo;residence&rdquo; is left out &mdash; so that the Court may decide in all the circumstances, from the point of view of equity, whether or not residence has been interfered with.  With that in my mind, I think it would be unwise for Senator Douglas to press his amendment.  If he decides to go on with it, we may meet him with a suggestion, but I submit that anything we do here would not be as equitably done as it would be done if left to Court interpretation.  On the other hand, it may be argued that the discretionary power vested in the Minister will not have the same sanction as a Court decision.  But we assume that the same set of circumstances would apply, that the Minister, in deciding such a question, would take into consideration all the factors and circumstances under which it might be argued residence had been broken.  I feel that the present position is the more happy one, even from Senator Douglas's point of view, and that it would be better in all the circumstances to leave it as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to answer a question which will set out my real difficulty.  I am not at all concerned with the difficulties of the Court.  I am not concerned in this case with the difficulties of the Minister, but if you go through this Bill, you will find a series of questions which can be addressed to individuals in a partnership or to secretaries of companies.  They are asked, under certain conditions, to state whether persons are nationals or not within the meaning of this measure.  They cannot afford to go to Court.  I do not know exactly how they could bring a test case before the Court.  They may have a company with 500 or 1,000 <Col N="1768" /> shareholders and the secretary has to ask each of these whether or not he is a national within the meaning of this Act.  If he was born in the Saorstát it would be simple enough. But if he asks a shareholder &ldquo;were you resident here for seven years?&rdquo; what will inevitably happen will be &mdash; I am assuming for the sake of argument that I am a company secretary and that I have sent out this question to shareholders &mdash; an answer will come back somewhat like this: &ldquo;During the first year, I spent five months here; during the second year, I spent seven months; the next year I was not in Ireland at all and the year after I was the whole time in Ireland; will you please tell me whether I am a resident or not within the meaning of the Act.&rdquo;  I am not trying to argue an absurdity.  Unless you give a definition here, you are putting a question to a company secretary or a man in a partnership which he is not able to answer, because the Act will not tell him the meaning of &ldquo;residence.&rdquo; Until there has been a number of test cases in the Courts, he will not know what the meaning is.</P>

    <P>It is not a matter for the Minister to decide.  There is no provision by which the Minister is to decide it.  It is a matter for the person replying to state &mdash; incidentally, he is subject to very heavy penalties for giving false information &mdash; whether the person concerned is a national or not.  I hold that you ought to give him some kind of guiding line as to the meaning of &ldquo;residence.&rdquo;  It is for the purpose of getting the Act to work that I put this amendment down.  If it was not a matter for the individual, I would be satisfied to leave it to the Court. I am sure the Court would give a perfectly equitable decision and that, at the end of some time, we would arrive at some general understanding as to the meaning of &ldquo;residence.&rdquo;  But I do not visualise this sort of question going to Court for a long time, at all events, and I think there will be very few prosecutions from the point of view of false information.  It will not be in anybody's interests to give false information, but I want to make it <Col N="1769" /> easy for the people concerned to give accurate information.</P>

      <P>I do not visualise the difficulties that Senator Douglas has raised at all.  I imagine that this matter will be carried through by an intelligent secretary, taking what he considers to be the ordinary residence of the shareholder.  I do not anticipate that the matter will go to Court and I do not anticipate any of the difficulties which Senator Douglas foresees. The secretary will in this, as in most other cases, simply give an intelligent analysis of the position truthfully and to the best of his ability. There is no intention of putting up Star Chamber standards with which he will have to comply and there is no intention of making him feel that he is expected to do something unreasonable in specifying to the day, hour or month what constitutes &ldquo;residence.&rdquo; I do not want to labour the question any more.  If this suggestion meets with Senator Douglas's approval, I am quite willing to accept it, not that I believe that it will improve the Bill or that there is any necessity to meet the objection which he has raised, but merely to satisfy him that we are trying to meet the point.  With that in mind and with the approval of the House, I would suggest that we add a new sub-section at the end of Section 1 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>For the purpose of the next preceding sub-section of this section a person shall be deemed to be resident in Saorstát Eireann during the whole of any year if he has resided continuously in Saorstát Eireann during more than two-thirds of that year.</P>
      <P>That means that for four months of the year he may live out of the country. I do not know what other step we can take to meet the point raised by Senator Douglas.  I think the Bill is better as it is, but if the Senator feels that he wants a definition as regards the period of any year which will constitute residence that is the nearest provision to what he desires that I can offer.</P>

      <P>I recommend Senator <Col N="1770" /> Douglas to consider this matter between now and the Report Stage.  In my opinion, both the Senator's amendment and the suggestion of the Minister would limit the law as to residence to a very considerable degree.  The question of residence has been the subject of numerous decisions in connection with the Representation of the People Acts and it has been defined in a very liberal way.  I would ask Senator Douglas to consider that before he presses his amendment or requires the Minister to substitute the other amendment for it.</P>

I am not quite satisfied that the matter is so simple as the Minister represents.  I would ask the leave of the House to withdraw my amendment and I would ask the Minister to be good enough to send me a copy of the draft he has read, leaving it for me to put down an amendment on Report Stage if I think well, having meantime had an opportunity of going into the matter further. I am not dealing with this question purely on my own.  A number of business men have approached me and I think the Chamber of Commerce also raised a question as to the necessity for a definition of &ldquo;residence.&rdquo;  It is a question which is exercising the minds of business men at present and I should like to consult some of these before coming to a conclusion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; in line 52 to insert the words &ldquo;which was carrying on business in Saorstát Eireann on the 1st day of June, 1932 or a body corporate.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I ought to explain that we are now coming to a number of amendments which are designed for the purpose of carrying out the intentions of the Government, as far as leaving existing companies in the position in which they are at present.  I take it, judging by speeches in the Dáil, and by the speech of the Minister, that, as far as possible, it is not the intention of the Government to interfere in this Bill with the present powers of existing companies. The effect of the amendment would be that a body corporate carrying on business, at the date the Bill is to come into effective operation, will be entitled to hold shares in another company.  That would give them power to extend their business if they thought fit, but would not allow any person outside to do so.  There are cases at the moment where existing companies hold shares and in finding out whether the companies in which they hold shares are free to do whatever they like, by having 51 per cent. held by nationals, you have to define whether the holders of the shares are Saorstát nationals or not.  Where a company at present works a subsidiary company, it should be, to my mind, in the position it was before, and should be allowed to do exactly what any national company would do, <Col N="1775" /> without further examination into the exact ownership of its own shares.  The object of the amendment is to try to meet that position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is not quite so innocuous as one would think from the remarks of Senator Douglas.  Let me make it clear that as from 1st June any company carrying on activities here cannot be interfered with.  There will be no question of having to apply for a new licence. There will be no question of objection to any extension within their own business.  But the proposal embodied in the amendment raises the possibility of a very wide extension of the activities of the holding company and the creation of subsidiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps Senator Douglas knows better than anyone in the House, other than myself, the danger of subsidiaries. He knows what happened in other countries, particularly in the United States.  He knows that the subsidiary company would, by its very workings, by its very nature and by the manipulative operations of those who control it, be one of the greatest dangers that could be introduced into this country.  I am not suggesting that all controlling companies having power over subsidiaries are wrong, but I say that it has worked out in practice that most of them are.  I certainly would fight against anything of the kind suggested in the way of an amendment to this Bill, because it does inherently allow the development of the controlling companies with subsidiaries. I suggest that the extension of a legitimate business cannot be prevented under the Bill.  I suggest that a legitimate case made to the Minister for a desirable industry, in the terms of the Bill, and consideration by the Minister of all the circumstances, gives ample protection for desirable development.  This would open the door to what I look upon as a most undesirable type of development.  It has to be remembered &mdash;and it was pointed out by a Senator last week&mdash;that Articles of Association drawn up for a company are drawn up in the widest possible <Col N="1776" /> manner.  Occasionally you will find clauses empowering the company to do practically anything covered by a blanketing clause, to buy, to sell or to make.  That is our fundamental point of view and we will resist any attempt to let the controlling company operate without the full cognisance of the Department and Executive. The whole purpose of the Bill would be defeated by opening doors in that way.  It would be foolish to consider the whole question of controlling manufactures at all if we gave away the principle which is involved in this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I understand it two points have been raised by the Minister.  One has relation to investments in a company and the other to the extension of the business of a company.  I take it that it is not intended that any company that has reserves&mdash;a good many companies have, and it is so much to the good that they have&mdash;will be permitted to hold them possibly in securities of other companies or in securities of the State.  The majority of companies that are well worked have reserve funds, possibly in Government and other similar securities.  Is it to be understood that that would be contrary to the intentions of the Bill? If that were so it would create a state of affairs that would be extremely unusual, to say nothing else.  On that point I would like the Minister to tell us what exactly is the position to-day with regard to shares or investments of a company operating in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the extension of a company's own business the Minister told us that there would be no objection, and that no additional licence would be required.  Exactly what is its own business is a rather difficult thing to define.  May I take it that a company that went in for a tobacco business&mdash;pipe tobacco&mdash;might possibly like to develop the cigar business and also to manufacture pipes and accessories to pipe smoking?  I could not say if that would be considered within the company's own business.  The Ford Company, of Cork, was mentioned at a <Col N="1777" /> recent meeting of the Seanad.  I believe it was suggested that they might develop other business besides the motor business, such as the manufacture of cast iron piping and articles of that description.  I can also visualise a brewery being anxious to make soda water.  The ingredients are on the spot.  Whether that would be an extension of the business I cannot say. I think it would be well if we had definite information from the Minister on these points, as we would then not be so much in the dark about what some of these amendments are intended to cover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I made an appeal to the Minister last Friday, which he did not accept, that this Bill should be sent to a committee of business men. This amendment is a case in point. He sees in this amendment a possibility of an extension beyond the point I was trying to deal with.  I confess quite frankly, after listening to his argument, that this amendment, as worded, could be extended.  He does not meet the real difficulty I am up against and out of which I am perfectly satisfied a way could be found in a committee of half a dozen, although I do not see how we can get out of it across the floor of the House. One of the reasons why the Minister was so anxious to get this Bill through was that certain licences would be issued under it.  The reason I wanted to deal with this is that I know the question of the formation of a company is hanging on the Bill and that a certain set of circumstances is going to prevent its happening.  I dare not say more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an additional difficulty that the Government do not want to extend this to provide for an unlimited extension of business beyond the point which we have here at the moment.  On the other hand the position is that companies who are doing a legitimate business at the moment and who want to extend to form a 51 per cent. company, may find themselves in a difficulty because of a rigid interpretation of the Bill.  I want, subject to some safeguards which I recognise have to go in and which, not having a fully <Col N="1778" /> technical mind I was not able to deal with&mdash;they would probably mean a new section&mdash;to provide that that can be carried on by existing companies.  I see the force of what the Minister has said, that some limits would be required and I believe we could get a solution by discussing the matter in a round table way.  A way out would be found there which you cannot get here.  I think the only thing I can do for the moment is to withdraw this amendment and to reserve my right to put it again on the Report Stage unless the Minister can find some other way of dealing with it.  Possibly we may be able to find some way out in conversation in the meantime.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the matter on which I think the Minister and I will never agree.  He feels, and very naturally feels, that if a company is in a difficulty all it has got to do is to ask for a permit and that a reasonable Government will give it to them.  I know that, reasonably or unreasonably, there are many existing companies which will not ask for that permit and which will wind up in preference to doing it.  That may be silly but it will happen in certain cases.  After this Act comes into operation and after some years have elapsed and when there is a general principle adopted, quite possibly we will not have that hostility, but the fact remains that it is there. If the Minister, and I do not question his sincerity for a second, is most anxious to get the Bill through in a hurry in order that there may be some development, I am equally anxious to see that the Bill is not passed in a way that will prevent development.  I doubt if in the manner in which the Bill is now being dealt with a way out will be found.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that the inclusion of an amendment such as this or even any amendment in this Bill would meet the difficulties presented by a firm that, so to speak, is not prepared to recognise the court. If they are going to trade here they will have to recognise the Act and will have to comply with certain conditions. I cannot see if they have to meet certain difficulties under the Act <Col N="1779" /> or certain obligations under the Act why they should raise any particular difficulty about this point.  I admit it is difficult and it is really one of the outstanding instances in this Bill which make it almost impossible to draft all the covering points that you would need in a Bill of this type, to eliminate the discretion of the Minister.  Let us look at it from the practical point of view.  A concern wants a permit or a licence to manufacture. A proposition is put up. The Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time naturally is anxious to see development.  If all the other conditions that are desirable from the point of view of manufacturing in this State are complied with, does anyone believe, in the light of the development of industry which obviously concerns the whole country and for which he is primarily responsible, that he is going to stand in the way of this development?  It is the one case where the discretionary power of the Minister is exemplified to the fullest.  The discussion of all the points you may imagine you are covering now will not be covered when you are done with it.</P>
      <P>The same answer really applies to the question raised by Senator Guinness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An extension can be intelligently understood when that particular extension is defined by the manufacturer who wants to extend.  You may raise all sorts of hypothetical situations in a debate, but it is difficult to conceive that you will have then covered them all.  What we assume is that in an ordinary, normal, intelligent administration all these factors will be taken into account.  I cannot conceive any responsible Minister holding up any legitimate trade development.  Let us take the hypothetical case that a firm already engaged in making sugar had decided to branch into the manufacture of chocolate and assume for a moment that, six months before, a licence had been issued to half-a-dozen firms for the making of chocolate.  The Minister knew that although sugar was a fundamental ingredient in <Col N="1780" /> chocolate that this company had accummulated reserves of say half a million and they were going to branch out into the manufacture of chocolate under conditions which would give them practically a monopoly.  I can conceive the Minister saying that the existing half-dozen manufacturers could not be broken on the wheel of the sheer power of capital.  I am giving that as an illustration of how almost impossible it is to have anything but the discretion of the Minister to guide the intelligent administration of a Bill such as this.</P>
    <P>I submit that the arguments I have made exemplify completely the absolute necessity of the discretionary powers of the Minister in a matter like this.  I think that Senator Douglas has very wisely withdrawn this amendment. I would be willing to consider anything else he likes to put up and I am most anxious to have the Bill as perfect as it can be made but I would like to emphasise that the question of the discretionary power of the Minister is something that cannot be got over.</P>

      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 4 the words and figures &ldquo;1st day of June, 1932,&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;day on which this Act comes into operation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in a different category altogether.  I foresaw what <Col N="1781" /> you yourself, a Chathaoirligh, pointed out this morning, that inevitably there would be a certain amount of delay. Either the House may postpone the Final Stage to a later date or it will have to be taken next week or in ten days' time and then go to the Dáil.  I can see two or three things on which there may have to be conferences between the two Houses to reach agreement. In the meantime I am very anxious that there should be nothing held up during that period.  If you look at the end of the Bill you will find that, although June is mentioned, this Act does not come into operation after it is passed.  For some reason that is not quite clear, but to which I do not object, the Minister shall fix the date on which the Act shall come into operation.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is, so that no company which may wish to start now will be unduly prevented through the delay of possibly a month or three weeks, that we should change all through the Act the &ldquo;1st June&rdquo; to &ldquo;the day on which the Act comes into operation.&rdquo; I meant, as a matter of fact, to have sent a note to the Minister to tell him my reasons, so as to give him time for more consideration.  I would ask him to consider it carefully, because it might have that effect.  The law cannot take real effect until the Act comes into operation and it might avoid difficulties if this were done.  There will be inevitably a certain amount of discussion. It is a difficult Act and I agree with him that even to-day snags will be found.  It is the kind of Bill which this House has thought it necessary in the past to spend time over and it can get more careful consideration here than ever it could get in the Dáil.  A certain amount of delay would be inevitable and this might meet the danger.  There cannot be more than one or two companies affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In face of what has happened, we could not accept this amendment.  Suppose that this Act does not come into operation, by the terms of the Act itself, until the 1st September.  We have to realise what could and what would happen in the meantime.  A company could be in here, get a footing here, get itself sufficiently <Col N="1782" /> established here, comply with the company laws, be in a position to operate, and you would have no power then under the Bill to interfere with them.  I have a very specific case in mind.  I cannot mention the name nor can I mention the type of industry, but it is one of the companies to which I was referring when I said I was anxious to have this Bill put through. Assuming that we did what Senator Douglas wants us to do, or proposes that we should do, we would be handicapped.  Certain companies, knowing that this June 1st date was fixed in the Bill, have been precluded from coming in as free lances into this country.  If the proposal made were accepted it would permit a firm to come in here which would smash every other industrial enterprise in that particular business overnight. There is nothing in this country which would be able to stand up to them in their particular line.  In this market at the moment we are able to produce almost all of the goods we want.  Tariffs have gone on, and the reason June 1st was mentioned was because tariffs had gone on, and immediately it became obvious to certain big manufacturers that there was a golden harvest to be reaped here if they could get in.</P>
      <P>I think we owe a duty to those manufacturers who have struggled here during the lean years, and who are still struggling here, and endeavouring to produce here with Irish workers, on Irish lines for Irish consumption.  I think it would be an outrage to allow a period during which manufacturers could come in here and be in a position in spite of the Act to come in and smash up our native firms.  I think the position will be obvious to anybody who realises just what I have said.</P>

I have devoted a good deal of time in trying to induce people to come in and manufacture here.  I do not say for a moment that I disapprove of this measure, but I think that from everything the Minister has said it is obvious that it should not be dealt with here where we can only give a very cursory <Col N="1783" /> examination into the various things.  I suggest that it might be referred to a Select Committee of the House.</P>
      <P>I will give you a little experience I have had.  It just happened accidentally that I was Chairman of the Industrial Association in Cork.  In my capacity as Chairman of that Association, I actually negotiated the purchase for Ford from the Cork Corporation of the land on which Ford's factory now stands.  I also negotiated the purchase of the Rushbrooke Docks for the Furness-Withy people.  I thought I was doing a good and worthy work, but apparently now what we have got to preserve for this country is not so much the wages of the workmen as the profits of the capitalists. I am not against capital, but I do think that the coming in here of foreign companies is likely to give more employment and that the probabilities are that from these companies subsidiary companies may spring, not run by these people themselves, but run by nationals.  When Ford's came first to look into this matter, they undertook to employ ten thousand people at one shilling an hour.  The current wage then in Cork was fivepence per hour. They reduced the offer to 2,000, and even that was a very great boon.  They had intended to extend in Cork&mdash;as they have since done in Dagenham&mdash; and they believed that, directly or indirectly, they would have created employment for 60,000 hands.  The tariffs on motor cars between the two countries spoiled that.  Whether that was a good thing or not, I am not prepared to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the Furness-Withy people, it was pure accident or bad luck that they are not employing a great number of people here, because there were negotiations going on between various shipping companies which had intended to make Rushbrooke the headquarters for all of their ships going West.  These, unfortunately, broke down.  Out of this would have grown a tremendous number of subsidiary companies.  I cannot see the Minister's point that keeping out these foreign companies is really going to develop the country here.  I differ with him there, because <Col N="1784" /> I do not believe we have in the country the skilled labour or the educated management that is capable of setting up successful industries here, even with the tariff.  We all know that no industry has ever been successfully established here up to this by a public company.  We hope, sincerely, that that will not happen in the future, but it is very questionable to me if, even with the advantage of the tariff, taking into account the tremendous drawback which it is for anybody who has to go into a new business with no experience and with the knowledge that they cannot get, locally, skilled labour, they can make these companies successful.  I quite sympathise with and understand the position that the Minister takes.  He, naturally, is anxious that profits made in Ireland should remain in Ireland.</P>

      <P>As far as this particular amendment is concerned, I am rather nonplussed, in some ways, by the speech of the Minister.  He accused me of creating difficulty and delay.  I think he very much exaggerated the possibility of what would happen in the next month if the date were put back.  I thought the amendment was a way out of the difficulty, but if the Minister does not want it, and as there is no principle involved so far as I am concerned, I do not think I shall press it.  His last statement makes one uncomfortable, when he says that this particular date this Bill may be holding people up and frightening people who would come in, and that being so I do not press it.</P>

      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  After the figures &ldquo;1932&rdquo; in line 6 to insert the words and figures &ldquo;or by a body corporate formed as the result of a reconstruction without change of control of the body corporate by which it was owned on the 1st day of June, 1932.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1785" /> There is a point in this amendment that I think ought to be met, although there again my draftsmanship may not be perfectly satisfactory.  We all know of cases, from time to time, where reconstruction of a company is necessary, sometimes through unfortunate reasons, sometimes for fortunate reasons. Where the control of the body does not change I do not think it should be necessary to get a permit as a result of reconstruction.  My amendment provides that a body corporate formed after reconstruction without change of control should be exempt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>With great respect I cannot see that that is the case, having regard to the wording of the Bill, and a lawyer whom I consulted told me that, in his opinion, it would not be the case. My only object is to cover a case such as the Minister referred to.  I provide that there is to be no change of control. It is not the personnel of the shareholders but it is the control of the business, and here I think there is something that is not met in the Bill and I have been so advised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke of reconstruction I assumed that, in the main, the control in personnel and the personnel itself would be the same as it was.  If there was a substantial transfer of interests from certain groups of owners to other groups of owners, or shareholders, it would mean that the majority of the shareholding would have passed from the original <Col N="1786" /> shareholders and an entirely different situation would have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>You have here a body corporate which was owned by somebody. The reconstructed company is not the body corporate by which it was owned.  It may be exactly the same people.  If it is under the same control I want to cover that, though the body corporate is not the same body corporate but it is the same control by which it shall be governed.  A lawyer friend told me that the wording of the Bill does not cover that.  Senator Comyn is the only lawyer here at the moment.  Perhaps he would tell us what his view is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is mainly concerned with the business the body corporate carries on in case of reconstruction. There is no doubt reconstruction must alter probably some of the individuals connected with the management.  It frequently means change of directors.  Probably there would have been trouble with the old board.  It would be a difficult thing to say that they are absolutely the same people and everything is the same that controls the business after reconstruction. What the Minister wants is that the body corporate carries on the same business as before.  I judge him to say that he does not think this amendment is required, that what it seeks to do is already in the Bill.  If it is not required in his opinion I should say that it would be better for the Minister to put it in.  He says it is there already. Well, I say, put it in here again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>When I say the company remains the same legal entity, and in that event would not require a licence, we still have to be satisfied that what we look upon as control, namely the voting of shareholders in a company, complies with the terms of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my proposal. Senator Comyn bears me out when he says that it would not be the same body corporate and, therefore, it would not <Col N="1787" /> be the same legal entity although it was the same business.  I ask the Committee to accept this amendment and if it is found necessary to do so <Col N="1788" /> we can redraft it on Report Stage if the Minister's officials are able to draft it better than I have drafted it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 18:</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;Eireann&rdquo; in line 10 to insert the words &ldquo;or at the relevant time is in the ordinary course or forms part of an extension of such business as previously carried on.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The idea of this amendment is to cover the case of a firm like Ford's, of Cork, if they wanted to make, for instance, typewriters, or Gallaher's, if they wanted to make cigars instead of cigarettes.  I think the Minister more or less agreed on Second Reading that anything in an allied trade would be allowed to be carried on and I do not think I need say more on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this amendment is unnecessary, and, I think, also, that it might lead to a considerable amount of trouble in the interpretation of the Act and, consequently, trouble in the administering of the Act.  The amendment says &ldquo;is in the ordinary course or forms part of an extension of such business as previously carried on,&rdquo; and it might seem as though there was really no objection to that, but it is a question of possibly making the section difficult to administer and it might seem as if intended to increase the allowable extensions. Frankly, I do not see any objection being raised, and I do not think the issue will arise, provided that firms were extending in their own line of activities or anything that would be intelligently looked upon as allied branches of their existing trade.  I do not think the Senator ought to pursue it, in view of the fact that, in the opinion of our legal people, it might lead to trouble in the interpretation of the Act.  I would ask the Senator to reconsider it as we do not feel that we can accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This raises a rather large question.  There is quite a lot involved in the interpretation here. I have discussed this matter with some people since the Second Reading and I am reasonably satisfied that the wording here is going definitely to restrict extension, perfectly legitimate extension of which even I know the Minister would approve; it will restrict <Col N="1789" /> such extension in the case of certain businesses.  The Minister says this amendment would cause difficulty in interpretation.  I say the wording of the Bill will cause very great difficulty.  I think the Minister should be prepared to go the whole hog.  I think a company which exists here, which came in here <i>bona fide</i>, should be allowed to operate within the terms of its Articles of Association; that is, assuming the company is <i>bona fide</i> here at the moment.  If the Minister will not go that far, he should make it clear that an extension which is reasonably allied to an existing business should be allowed.</P>
      <P>It is very probable that if this economic war, as we call it, goes on, our existing companies, those that depend to any extent on trade across the water, will have to adapt their machinery to other lines of business. Do not make it difficult for them to do so.  Do not make it necessary for them to have legal advice.  If you do you will add to their difficulties at a time when you ought not.  You have here in the amendment &ldquo;or forms part of an extension of such business.&rdquo; In the case of business of which I have personal experience I can think of a number of perfectly legitimate extensions quite within the line of business now carried on, but which would not be in the ordinary course of such business on 1st June.  In one case goods were manufactured years ago, but the trade was small and they ceased to manufacture.  If they were depending entirely on an Irish market they would probably start to manufacture again, but that would not be in the ordinary course of business on 1st June and there is, in that case, that definite restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Staines's amendment tries to some extent to help, but I do not think it goes far enough.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not submit a proposal which would to some extent meet the points raised here. The Bill, such as it is, is restrictive and it would be risky for a company, without seeking for a permit, to go ahead with any extension.  I need not deal now with the reluctance of certain <Col N="1790" /> companies to seek a permit.  We must deal with the facts.  We are not always dealing with reasonable people and in the next three to six months it is going to be difficult enough to get companies to carry on at all.  It may be difficult enough to get them to extend business on other lines.  This restriction in the Bill will not carry out what the Minister stated was his intention.  Companies free to make extensions within the general line of their own business at present will not be free unless the extension is in the ordinary course of their business on a particular day, which is 1st June. The extension must form part of their business on that particular day.  It may have been part of their business a year or two ago, but if it is not in the ordinary course of their business on 1st June it will not be permitted.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider this and try to bring forward on Report something which will cover a reasonable extension.  I am not asking, for instance, that a firm that brews beer should be allowed to manufacture bicycles.  I am suggesting, however, that you would have plenty of closely allied extensions which would come in the ordinary way but which might not be in the ordinary course of business on 1st June.  The Bill, I think, is far too restrictive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with everything Senator Douglas has said.  I jotted down, for my own information, what I believe would cover the point. I do not put it forward as an amendment, but I am merely suggesting that it might meet the point.  Here is what I have written: &ldquo;Corporate bodies which, prior to 1st June, 1932, have been engaged in the manufacture of commodities in Saorstát Eireann and which may in the interests of their trade desire to extend or modify the production of the particular goods or by-products associated with their respective manufactures, shall be entitled to undertake such extension or modification without being required to comply with the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;  Something of that nature would tend to clarify the situation.  It would help to allow possible extensions <Col N="1791" /> within the scope of what the Minister desires to accomplish.  Extensions associated with a business are all that are asked for.  It is not suggested, as Senator Douglas has pointed out, that a brewer should be allowed to make a bicycle.  That is not intended.</P>

      <P>It is not quite so simple as all that.  I am assuming that a situation may arise here such as arose in America.  This country might go dry.  In such circumstances would Messrs. Guinness be allowed to make soft drinks?  Is it necessary that they should have to seek a Government permit in order to make soft drinks?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am willing to accept this amendment if Senator Staines will agree to the inclusion of the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;; that is what would, in the opinion of the Minister, form an extension.  I realise the difficulty some Senators have with regard to this matter, but frankly, I think an intelligent analysis of the position should be very easily achieved.  With regard to the point raised by Senator Sir John Keane, I take it that if this country went dry&mdash; which, I suppose, would mean going on soft drinks, though it is rather a paradox&mdash;Guinness's would be quite entitled to go in for soft drinks.  I do not know whether the family escutcheon would stand the strain.  If Senator Staines would agree to my suggestion, I would be willing to accept his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree to that suggestion because it seems to me that that would make the case a thousand times worse.  At the present <Col N="1792" /> moment if a company went on with an extension and then were challenged in the court they could at any rate argue that it was reasonable under the Act. If you put in the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister,&rdquo; the court has no say at all.  The Minister says &ldquo;That is my opinion,&rdquo; and that is the finish.  It may be the most unreasonable opinion on earth.  You may have the stupidest Minister possible.</P>

      <P>The position might be that the court would have to decide what was the opinion of the Minister before it decided whether a company had broken the law or not.  I would not approve of that.  It would not be workable.  I urge the Minister to look carefully into the amendment proposed by Senator Staines.  All you have to prove is that it is an extension of the business then carried on or previously carried on by the same company.  That is reasonable.  In the case of a prosecution&mdash;and it is the Minister who will have to prosecute&mdash;I am quite satisfied a court will be able to decide on the arguments as to whether an extension was reasonable, was an extension of the business then carried on, or whether it had been previously carried on.  As the Bill stands, a company which had previously carried on business, but which was not carrying it on on a certain day, will not be able to operate without getting a permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 22:</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (3).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  For the purposes of paragraph (c) of the immediately preceding sub-section, but not further or otherwise, the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  where the shares of a body corporate are registered in the name of a bank carrying on business in Saorstát Eireann, such shares shall be deemed to be in the beneficial ownership of a national of Saorstát Eireann;</P>
      <P>(b)  where shares in a body corporate which is a public company are transferred to a person who is not a national of Saorstát Eireann and as a result of such transfer the issued shares of such body corporate cease to be to an extent exceeding one half thereof in the beneficial ownership of nationals of Saorstát Eireann, such body corporate shall nevertheless be entitled to continue its business without holding a new manufacturer's licence for a period of six months or such longer period as may be specified by the Minister in writing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is another amendment which endeavours to deal with two problems that I raised in speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill.  They are two quite distinct problems and I was very much puzzled as to the way they might be dealt with.  When I looked at the Bill I found what seems to me to be a good way of dealing with this matter.  If the Minister finds another way I am not wedded to my amendment. I want to get over this difficulty which is a real difficulty to the holding of shares in the name of a bank.  It is well known that a considerable number of us are unfortunate enough to have at a bank overdrafts and the holding of our shares by the bank is a good way of giving collateral security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I suppose, does not <Col N="1794" /> want us to go into banking secrecy. I do not think any harm will be done in the way of the bank's secrets if it is confined to the banks here.  But it is possible that the Minister might want to make some proviso to deal with possible evasions that may arise.  But if you had to pass a Bill without making some provision such as I have here you are going to have the people who have overdrafts at present and who hold Irish investments becoming quite frightened because questions will arise as to ownership of the company.  A bank will say: &ldquo;We are not going to the trouble of proving this; we, as a bank, are not writing to our shareholders to ascertain their nationality and consequently we will not hold these shares as collateral security any longer.&rdquo;  What would happen would be that it would be found that a number of Irish shares would be put on the market because they were no longer good security with the bank.  That is the first part of the amendment, (a); (b) deals with another problem altogether, one which I feel sure the Minister will agree himself must be met whether he meets it my way or not.  I am assuming in this case that the company is formed after the passing of this Bill, and that it is an Irish company within the meaning of the Act, that is, that 51 per cent. or more of its shares are held by Saorstát nationals.  But by the selling or the transferring of a certain number of shares to a person who happens not to be a national, if this Bill stood as it was a few hours ago the company ceases to be a Saorstát company; if the shares happen to be transferred by a person living in the Saorstát to his son who happens to be domiciled in Northern Ireland it would mean that suddenly the company would cease to function here.  By my amendment, if the company found that the ownership went below 51 per cent. of Saorstát nationals, the company would not be breaking the law by operating for six months, and in the meantime it could arrange first, to sell some of its shares to some other person living in the Saorstát or to come to the Government for a permit.  If not, it would be found the company would have to <Col N="1795" /> stop business.  This will happen in the case of a private company by the death of one of its shareholders who leaves his share to somebody outside this State.  Over a thing like that, you would have the business of the company held up and the people thrown out of employment.  No serious harm can be done during that six months' time that my amendment would give.  In that time, the company must either get a permit from the Minister or arrange for the shares to be bought and transferred to somebody who comes under the Act.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept paragraph (a) of the proposed amendment.  The position is that any person or group of persons or corporate body out to defeat the purpose of the Act could, by this amendment and operating through a bank, defeat the purpose of the Bill.  That is quite possible in my judgment if we accepted this amendment. The second section, paragraph (b) of the proposed amendment, is one I am willing to accept provided the following meets with Senator Douglas's views: &ldquo;Whenever the issued shares of a body corporate cease to be held in the manner stated in the said paragraph such shares might be deemed to be held in accordance with that paragraph for a period of six months after they have ceased to be so held.&rdquo; That is a draft that we would like to have and it covers all that Senator Douglas wants by his amendment.  I suggest that, if that meets with his approval, we accept it.</P>

      <P>As regards paragraph (a) of the amendment, which the Minister says he cannot accept, I am afraid this is another case that we have seen where the Government say &ldquo;Well, accidents must happen.  We will carry on our policy; the people who will suffer from our policy are people that we are sorry to see suffer, but they will have to suffer.&rdquo; There is not a shadow of doubt that what Senator Douglas said is correct. There are plenty of shares, personally held in the names of banks as security <Col N="1796" /> in an Irish business.  It is the banks who are carrying on their business in Ireland and undoubtedly the Bill as it is without this amendment throws a great disqualification on these shares. I really believe that the Minister is resolved on this.  He is putting this disqualification on shares not knowing what the effect will be at all.  I am a bank director and I carry a lot of overdrafts and securities in my head and if you ask me to-day what is the effect of the Bill on the lending power of the bank and what arrangements would a bank have to make by reason of this Bill I could not tell you and I do not suppose anybody could tell you.  The danger is there, and a good many Irish people with money in Irish businesses will find themselves in a difficulty.  I suppose this Bill only applies to new businesses.</P>

      <P>I recognise that.  If you have a Bill with a blot of that nature, and if you want new businesses to be supported by the banks, surely you should make the shares a first-class security to the banks to any extent?  If this section is a disqualification of the shares of a new company that should be accepted by the banks, you are doing a real harm to the new industries.  The banks want to see new industries as well as the Minister, and for that reason I think he should seriously consider the question. It is only because he wants to go along a certain line that he will not deal with the danger.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly what would happen with new businesses would be that they would have the worst chance of getting banking accommodation because of the nonacceptance of the amendment, and holders of shares will probably not be able to borrow on them as easily as they should be.  It is a distinct disqualification. I strongly support the amendment because it will make the business of promoting new companies better, so far as they are likely to get the accommodation they need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keeping to the section and my remarks are germane to it.  I think the Minister understands how the danger of shares being held by banks will really arise. I suppose he means people who wish to disguise their nationality, shareholders who will get their shares held by the banks as their nominees.  I can see a much easier process which would be perfectly within their power, and that is to get a person born in what is Saorstát Eireann, who lives in England, and who has got no affiliation here, to hold these shares.  As far as I can see he will be able to do so. I would like the Minister to deal with that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that we want to know who are the real owners of businesses here.  The suggestion that the operation could be carried through by banks on the lines suggested would defeat us in knowing the <Col N="1798" /> ownership.  Senator Douglas knows that.  Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Jameson know that the purpose of the Bill could be torpedoed by such a proceeding.  We want to know who owns the shares.  If, say, the Bank of Ireland, the National Bank or the Hibernian Bank want to buy fifty thousand shares in an Irish company they can buy them and there will be no objection.  They will not have to be licensed.  If a bunch of Frenchmen, Italians or anyone else go to the Bank of Ireland to buy fifty thousand pounds' worth of stock in an Irish company in order to get control in the name of the bank, how are we to find the ownership?  The secrecy of the banks is well known.  We are facing up to realities.  If the Seanad does not want the Bill they should have thrown it out.  I submit that it is indecent to go on with an amendment like this after passing the Second Reading.  I again protest against the attitude exhibited continuously by Senator Sir John Keane.  I resent it. I feel that I have as much credit and honour in this country as regards resentment to political pull and to the suggestion of jobbery as anyone.  I have been in politics since I was 17 years of age and no one could ever point a finger at me for any political job.  I hope Senator Sir John Keane's record is equally clean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister has allowed resentment at some other remarks to be an opportunity to make the charge that this amendment should not be put down unless I wanted to defeat the purpose of the Bill.  That statement is neither accurate nor fair.  The position is that this amendment is put down because of a real problem, one which may seriously hurt subscribers for shares, or the possibility of getting subscribers for shares in Irish industries in the future.  This is another case of an amendment where it is almost impossible in the open House to get down to brass tacks and to find whether you can get a way out to deal with it.  The Minister says there is a possibility of evasion in the section. He thinks the banks here would allow some foreigner to come in and borrow <Col N="1799" /> money from them, saying &ldquo;Will you put these in your name?&rdquo;  I agree that that could happen.  I do not agree that it is likely to happen.  I say that a way could be found to prevent that happening without exactly accepting the amendment in my name. A way could be found if we could get together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister did not find some proviso that would prevent anything outside the number of shares that a bank could hold.  He ignored that entirely and accused me of putting down something that I should not put down after agreeing to the Second Reading.  The Minister has not dealt with the real problem.  There are not many wealthy people in this country, unfortunately.  Most of us put our money into Irish businesses.  We cannot do business unless it is possible from time to time to be able to use such securities.  If individuals here are to be placed in the position of putting their money in British securities that is all right.  The banks will be able to take them.  If you put your money into Irish industries there must be an examination of the holding of the shares and the banks will not facilitate you.  It is putting the banks in an unfair position.  It means that when anyone goes to the Irish market to try to get people to take shares they will be put in an unfair position. There is a way out, but not by my accusing the Minister or by ignoring something.  It has to be carefully considered to see if there is not another way.  I put down the amendment acting on my own initiative.  I sat down during the week-end to try&mdash; and it was not an easy task&mdash;to draft amendments in the short time that was available.  I do not pretend that I found a way out.  I put down the amendment because I believe there is a difficulty, and in order that members of the House might find a way out if the Bill is to become law.  If we got together, a way would be found.  To simply reject the amendment and to leave shareholders in the position that they will not be able to go to the banks and to use shares collaterally the same as English shares are used, is <Col N="1800" /> the point the Minister has not dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>What is to prevent ownership of the shares being cloaked and lost in the name of some person who was merely born in Ireland but who does not live here at all?  A person who may live in Italy or Timbuctoo can be made the nominee of shares of any syndicate or group who want to disguise their identity.  Would the Minister deal with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>My standards are different from those of Sir John Keane, evidently.  The point is this: are we going to accept it as a fact that because a bank is operating here as an Irish bank, they can operate shares in any way for any person who is a national or otherwise?  Does this open a way for non-nationals, people whom we do not want in manufacturing industry here to operate through a bank?  Senator Douglas raised two points on that issue.  He raised the point that the banks would not do that.  Senator Douglas trusts the banks.  So do I.  I believe we have probably in our banking system here men according to their standing of supreme integrity, perhaps unequalled in any other country in the world; but how are they going to operate if some group outside tries to purchase through them £50,000 worth of shares in a company here?  We have been told that the Minister is not the person to show discretion, that a Commission must do all this.  I hold that this Bill has got to be applied like every <Col N="1801" /> other Act, from a human point of view, intelligently, honestly and with discretion.  I hold there is no alternative. Senator Douglas also raised the question of security.  I assume these shares will rank as security just as the shares show security to the bank. The shareholders can raise loans in the bank if their shares as collateral show value to the bank and in no other way.  I cannot see the point that the Senator pursues so ruthlessly, this question of having the banks in a confidential position to defeat the object of the Bill.  I cannot see that it can be argued that they could not defeat the object of the Bill if they wished.  I admit that in many ways a Bill admits of evasion, but I have stated that people who evade Acts of Parliament deliberately for profit are crooks, and I stand over that.  That is why I cannot accept paragraph (a).</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>He says these shares will be just as good and that they will <Col N="1802" /> be full value as security.  I am assuming that they will be value for a reasonable amount.  Assume that I hold shares in a company which is brought under the Bill and in which 51 per cent. or 52 per cent. of its capital is held by people who are Saorstát nationals under the terms of the Bill. For the sake of argument, let us assume that 2 per cent. or 3 per cent. of these shares are mine and I want to borrow money on them for any purpose. I take those to the bank and I transfer them into the name, we will say for the sake of argument, of the Bank of Ireland.  When I do so, if I am challenged as to whether my company is a Saorstát company or not, I have to prove that the majority of the shareholders of the Bank of Ireland, 51 per cent. of the shareholders of the Bank of Ireland, which then becomes a holding company under this Act, are Saorstát nationals.  I say that the bank would decline to go to all that expense for the sake of the £200 or £300 which I required as a loan.  They would have to do it at the time I was challenged, and in two months' time the position might change.  That is what I want to avoid.  That would definitely make it harder for people like myself to subscribe for shares of companies that are started here, because I would not be able to borrow money on those shares.  I believe there is a way out of this difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to have this amendment inserted now, but I do not want to insist on the amendment further than the Report Stage if we can get some other way of dealing with it.  I think there are ways which would avoid serious abuses, such as providing that a certain percentage of shares might be held in the name of a bank or some other method which would meet my objection and avoid what the Minister is afraid of.  It is suggested that we cannot do this as the Minister fears that the banks might be given power to evade the Act by holding shares for somebody else.  I think he would find that it would be a long time before you will get the banks to do anything of the kind.  Even if they were approached by some other company to do so, I feel the company would be <Col N="1803" /> turned down ruthlessly.  As to the argument that there is a big risk involved, I say the risk is less harmful than would be occasioned by the loss of borrowing facilities to the shareholders.  If it were a question as between the two, I would prefer to run the other risk.  At the same time, I think a way can be found out of this difficulty which will meet my point without running the risk which the Minister says is involved.  The Minister has got his legal draftsman and I think he could find some way out of the difficulty.  With regard to paragraph (b) I am satisfied with the alteration which the Minister proposes. It goes further than I asked.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to that is that it is in law a transfer to the bank, but the bank merely holds them as collateral.  As long as there is proper security the bank will hold these shares.  While in a legal sense you have sold to the bank, you have not parted with them entirely. Unless something happens affecting the value of the shares and that you have not got better security, the bank will not decide to sell them.  The bank would not sell them to anybody else. If the bank gets a notice with regard to a shareholders' meeting, it sends it on to you.  It sends any papers which it gets, and the dividends, on to you.</P>

If he is not an Irishman, the bank will look upon the matter as suspect, and surely the first question they would ask is: &ldquo;Are these shares in your name, and are you an Irish citizen, and are you one of the people who own these fifty-one or fifty-two of a balance of shares?&rdquo;  He will have to satisfy the bank that he fulfils all these requirements.

      <P>A point has just occurred to me.  On reading this over again, I think I can see a possible way out.  I have got here in the amendment &ldquo;that such shares shall be deemed to be in the beneficial ownership of a national of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; Perhaps wording could be arranged to the effect that such shares shall be deemed to be so, provided a certificate is obtained from the bank that they are in the ownership of a national of Saorstát Eireann.  All a person would have to do then would be to get a certificate from the bank that he was, in the bank's opinion, a national. That would meet what I want and I suggest that it might be a way of dealing with it.  This attitude, however, of the Minister, that he cannot have it at all, leaves me no option but to insist on the amendment in its original form.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 23:</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (3).  After the word &ldquo;who&rdquo; in line 18 to insert the word &ldquo;knowingly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are several amendments of a similar character.  This is an amendment which I think is reasonable.  If you look back over a number of similar Acts where regulations had to be carried out and returns to be made, perhaps you will remember that the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; had to be inserted by this House on a number of occasions, and generally it was accepted.</P>
      <P>I believe there was an amendment in the Dáil to put in the word &ldquo;wilfully,&rdquo; but I understood that the Government were unwilling to introduce the word &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo; because it was difficult to prove that a person wilfully made a false statement.  I want to provide something that will enable the court to acquit somebody who may quite inadvertently have made a return which was inaccurate.  I think there will be no difficulty in distinguishing between people trying to evade the Act, and those trying to carry it out but who find some difficulty. The very difficulty we find about fixing responsibility and things of that kind is all the more reason for inserting a word like &ldquo;knowingly.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of a prosecution before a court, and it is entirely for the court to be satisfied whether he knew or not.  We had a good many cases here before and they were discussed.  If it was a case of <Col N="1808" /> the Minister expressing an opinion it would be a different matter, but judges are not in the habit of accepting a man's statement that he did not know.  All the circumstances of the case would be taken into consideration. What I want to avoid is the rigid obligation to fix a fine in a perfectly genuine case.  If anyone acted as a company secretary or had to make returns he would soon find out how difficult it is.  Many of us have to make income tax returns and the officials always make a clear distinction between putting in a false statement and putting in such a statement inadvertently.</P>

Therefore they object to the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; being put in, as it would give a considerable amount of trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 24:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (3).  To delete all after the word &ldquo;exceeding&rdquo; in line 21 down to the end of the sub-section and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;twenty pounds in the case of a first offence and fifty pounds in the case of a second or subsequent offence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the object of this amendment will be pretty clear without very much discussion.  I think that £50 is too much for a first offence and £10 for every day of a continuous offence is far too much.  There are many people who may have been born outside the country who will find themselves coming under this Act, who did not realise that they did come under it, and who will inadvertently change their method of business or alter their business, and they may commit quite trivial offences. My suggestion is that there should be a fine of £20 for the offence and £50 for the second.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept this amendment.  Of course, it is perfectly obvious that fines are placed at a maximum amount but that often 10/- and 25/- fines are imposed where there are £20 and £50 penalties.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 25:</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (4).  After the word &ldquo;section&rdquo; in line 25 to insert the words &ldquo;and <i>prima facie</i> evidence of such offence has been given.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is quite evident from the discussion on this Bill that there are many pitfalls in it.  The sub-section sets out:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person is charged with having committed an offence under this section, the onus of proving the matters or any of the matters mentioned <Col N="1812" /> in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) respectively of sub-section (1) of this section shall lie on the person so charged, and until the contrary is proved it shall be assumed that none of those matters is applicable in relation to the act alleged to constitute such offence.</P>
    <P>I think that very unfair, and the object of the amendment is to insert the words &ldquo;and <i>prima facie</i> evidence of such offence has been given.&rdquo;  That will ensure that there shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence, at least, before a man is charged, and that the onus should not be placed on him of proving his innocence.  Amendment No. 26 works in with it:</P>
    <P>Section 2, sub-section (4).  To delete all after the word &ldquo;charged&rdquo; in line 28 down to the end of the sub-section.</P>
    <P>And I think the Minister ought to accept both amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment is unnecessary, because the Minister would have to prove that the person had committed an offence. With regard to the second one, it merely amplifies and explains the earlier words throwing the onus of proof on the person charged.  I am not very much wedded to it, one way or the other, but I think the drafting of the section as it is is quite all right and will meet the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, I would urge the Minister to accept the first one, because there are people who, reading this, have been rather worried about the position and it would make it much clearer.  Probably the Minister's advice is right, but I am inclined to think that the strict reading of this means that, if a person is charged, it is sufficient for him to be charged with an offence under the Act, and the onus of proving that he is exempt is thrown on the person charged and it might mean in some cases a considerable amount.  I am perfectly certain that it will be the intention of any <Col N="1813" /> reasonable Government to give <i>prima facie</i> evidence, but there is nothing fundamental in it.  It would, however, clarify the position and I do not see any harm in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Minister would really be expected, according to the strict terms of the Act, to do it. I am advised legally that it is not necessary, but if the House insists on it, of course, the House will insist upon it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Brown is not <Col N="1814" /> well and I am sorry he is not able to be here.  He was the only person with whom I discussed this, but I gathered that the procedure, in effect, would be that a charge would be made, not by the Minister personally, or even by his Department, but through the ordinary operation of the law, at the instance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and, if you put in the words &ldquo;and <i>prima facie</i> evidence is given,&rdquo; it means that the judge, before asking the defendant to accept the onus of proof provided in the Act, will simply satisfy himself that a <i>prima facie</i> case has been made.  The onus of proof will then be on the person charged. If you do not put them in, they would have to come down with full evidence prepared immediately.  That might mean a considerable amount of expense and, for that reason, I think we should put these words in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister no other suggestion that would meet the difficulty?  This affects existing companies. If you look at the Bill you will find that questions can be addressed to existing companies and <Col N="1816" /> they may be obliged to supply information. You are putting a very big charge indeed on some of the larger companies here and their secretaries when you ask them to supply information with regard to the nationality, the place of residence or the place of birth of their shareholders.  Take Messrs. Guinness as an example.  Such a question might be addressed to them.  They are a public company and it is well known that their shares are held all over the world; there are large numbers of shareholders in Ireland and in other places.  The Minister possibly will want to know the position with regard to Messrs. Guinness.</P>
      <P>I cannot help the feeling that you are almost putting them in an intolerable position in making them responsible.  I cannot think of a way out of it at the moment but there is probably some way.  I see now that the Minister is afraid that some dishonest people may take advantage of it and have an arrangement to give a false statement.  But is the safeguard any good?  Because if he will go on to a section later on he will find that the Minister has power to address any shareholder in a company direct and to ask him his nationality.  All I am wanting to do is to safeguard the secretary of the company.  The secretary must give the address and the names.  If he does not give them the Minister can get them anyway in the office.  If there is a suspicion in the mind of the Minister that evasion has taken place he can address a question to the persons concerned and if he doubts the answer he can challenge that person in the courts with regard to the information.</P>

      <P>Frankly, I cannot see how Senator Douglas argues that I can take up with any company such as Messrs. Guinness.  Everything in this Bill applies to the licensing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>What about section 10?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of licensing the sections of the Bill are in the main referring entirely to those companies that are going to come on in the future.</P>

    <Col N="1817" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  The position is that Section 10 provides for putting the question to the manufacturers. My point is that this is in relation to companies now existing or afterwards.  A large number of the questions apply to existing companies and fairly large companies may have these questions addressed to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of fraud, this section is unnecessary, but the amendment of the section proposed by Senator Douglas would facilitate fraud on the part of the Secretary of the company.  I am sure Senator Douglas does not intend that.  It would be quite possible for a fraudulent secretary to say that he had received information from the shareholders although the reception of that information may be in pursuance of a pre-arranged plan.  That is the reason why I think Senator Douglas's amendment is not reasonable and does not carry out the intention he has in his mind.  If there is any fraud the secretary is protected by the Bill as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it as Senator Comyn's opinion that, suppose a secretary sends in a false statement or an inaccurate statement with regard to the nationality of a person, and then if he goes to the courts and says that that was the information given, the court will hold that he has not committed a technical offence under the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Well I have the greatest respect for Senator Comyn's opinion but I have the greatest doubt that what he says is the case.  I should like to draw attention to Section 10, paragraph 4, with regard to fraud. Senators will find there that &ldquo;the Minister may, from time to time, serve a notice in writing on any persons who hold any shares in a body corporate carrying on a business to which this section applies requiring such persons within twenty-eight days after the service of such notice to send to the Minister a return....&rdquo;  I suggest that that is a safeguard to the Minister against fraud.  If the company sends in the names, these names can be <Col N="1818" /> checked at the company's office, and if the Minister has any doubt about the accuracy of that information he can take steps in court and he can prosecute them for giving wrong information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit again that whilst the companies can be asked for information under the Bill just as they are asked for a good deal of information to-day there is no intention in this Bill to interfere with any company operating before June 1st, 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>They can be asked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>They can, but they do not require a licence at all so long as they are operating before the 1st June, 1932.  The circumstances that Senator Douglas suggests could happen should not in fact happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put a problematical case?  A company is in existence on June 1st and it decides to go into another line of business, a very probable thing to happen.  The Ministry is to find out whether they are entitled to do that under permit or not and questions are sent to the company. The company must give that information. If that company happens to hold any shares in any subsidiary company, another matter may arise at any moment.  The question will arise whether the company is a national company.  The company would have to get information that it is; they would have to get a statement, if you like, in writing.  What will happen in the larger companies is that the secretary will send out a questionnaire to each shareholder as to whether the person was born in the Saorstát.  I do not want to have fraud in any way but here is a difficulty that must be faced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that if Senator Douglas withdraws this we might meet it by a sub-section of Section 10 or we might consider that we might accept it up to a certain point. I should like in the morning to go into it as regards whether we can accept it <Col N="1819" /> in that form or whether it can be appropriately met under a sub-section of Section 10.</P>
