      <P>With regard to items 1, 2 and 3 on to-day's Order Paper, the Standing Orders provide that the Committee of Selection and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges shall be appointed at the commencement of each triennial period; and, further, that all Committees shall be deemed to be discharged at the end of each such period.  It was not possible to deal with these matters until to-day, owing to the delay in the election of the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  Consultations are taking place at the moment between representatives of various groups regarding the personnel of the Committee of Selection: and I suggest to the House that the items I have mentioned be accordingly postponed until a later stage of to-day's sitting.</P>

      <Col N="402" /> SECTION 11.</P>
    <P>(2)  In the case of an application duly made in accordance with this Act for an annual passenger licence to commence on the appointed day by a person who carried on an existing service (within the meaning of this section) identical or substantially identical with the passenger road service (in this sub-section referred to as the proposed service) in respect of which such application is made, the Minister shall not refuse such application except upon one or other of the following grounds, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on the ground that in his opinion such existing service was not carried on efficiently with a due regard to the requirements of the public;</P>
    <P>(b)  on the ground that in his opinion such existing service was not sufficient, in regard to frequency of service or in regard to daily duration of the service or in regard to any other matter, to meet the requirements of the public;</P>
    <P>(c)  on the ground that in his opinion the organisation and equipment at the disposal of the person making the application are not such as to enable him to carry on the proposed service in accordance with the conditions which the Minister considers should be inserted in the passenger licence to which such application relates.</P>
    <P>(d)  on any ground on which the Minister is expressly authorised by any other section of this Act to refuse such application.</P>

      <P>Section 11, sub-section (2).  After the word &ldquo;requirements&rdquo; in line 34 to insert the words &ldquo;and safety.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know many buses which would satisfy most of the requirements set out in this Bill&mdash;the services are carried on frequently and efficiently&mdash;but I am also aware that in a district where I travel fairly frequently there are buses operating that are a positive deathtrap if a fire were to break out in them. I do not observe any clause in the Bill <Col N="403" /> which deals with the safety of the public.  Of course, the Minister will possibly say that adequate requirements in regard to public safety are embodied in the road traffic legislation. I think it is necessary to have some reference contained in this Bill to the safety of the public who utilise buses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose amendment 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 11, sub-section (2).  Before paragraph (d) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d)  on the ground that in his opinion the rates of wages paid to and the hours of duty worked by the drivers and conductors employed in such existing service, or which it is intended shall be applicable to the proposed service, are in the case of wages unduly low and in the case of hours of duty unduly long, and are such as to give such service an unfair advantage over competing services in respect of which the rates of wages and hours of duty are regulated by agreements between the employers and the trade unions representing their employees.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment the object of which is to give power to the Minister to refuse a licence to existing services on certain grounds which are not those stated in the Bill.  As the section stands the Minister is practically bound to grant licences except on certain grounds&mdash;that the existing service is not efficient, that the frequency and duration of the service do not meet the requirements of the public, or that the organisation and equipment at the disposal of the persons proposing to run the service are not satisfactory. There are certain other grounds on which the Minister is expressly authorised under sections of the Bill to refuse to grant a licence to applicants.  I want to give the Minister power to <Col N="404" /> refuse a licence to existing services if, in his opinion, the conditions of service of the employees of that concern, the drivers and conductors, are not satisfactory, that is if the wages paid are unduly low and so constitute an unfair advantage to that employer against other competing services where the wages and the hours of service are regulated between the company and the trade unions.</P>
    <P>I do not think there can be any difficulty in this from the point of view of administration, because the Minister is empowered to get all the information he requires in regard to the rates of pay and the hours of work that have been in operation in the past and the rates and hours that are proposed to be put into operation.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce is in a position to know the arrangements that are being made between the trade unions and the employers in regard to the wages and hours, this information can be easily secured.  I think I may take the position in the Dublin area and point out that there are services&mdash;well organised services, such as those which the Minister hopes or intends some day shall in fact control the bus services in and around Dublin&mdash;and in these services there are agreements between the people running the service and the organisations representing the drivers and conductors.</P>
    <P>But these bus services are meeting with severe competition from bus owners whose drivers and conductors are paid very low wages in some cases. In a considerable number of cases they are paid considerably lower wages in respect of the drivers and very low wages in the case of the conductors. That kind of competition is disastrous not only for the employees in the better organised services, but it is disastrous for the companies running those services.  It is also dangerous for the public inasmuch as there is no regulation regarding the hours on which the drivers or conductors are to run those services.  The proposition in the motion is clearly that once we enter upon the question of licensing and regulation, as the Minister said, with a view to ultimate extinction, or shall I say a considerable reduction, of <Col N="405" /> the anarchic kind of competition that at present prevails, we should begin right at the beginning and give the Minister power to refuse a licence to any service which he is satisfied is being run under uneconomic conditions.</P>
    <P>It has been often said that trade unions ought to have some regard to the position in which their employers are placed.  I think there is a great deal to be said for that point of view. In this case we are asking that employers who are prepared to pay fair wages and give humane conditions to their employees should be protected against this anarchic competition which pays no regard to the conditions under which the employees work.  Unfortunately when employment is sought by scores, hundreds and thousands of people, and when these people are pressed by the economic conditions because their children are crying for bread they accept low wages.  I trust the House will see that no encouragement will be given to employers of that kind so as to enable them to take advantage of the economic condition of hungry and workless people.  The giving of a licence in respect of a bus service should be governed by the conditions of the employment of the various competing companies and these various competing companies ought to be placed on a fair level.</P>
    <P>I think there are members of the Seanad who have within recent months expressed certain views with regard to competition from abroad in respect of commodities they sell here.  These Senators were very loud in denunciation of the freedom of importation from countries where the people were supposed to be employed, or alleged to be employed, under very bad conditions. Unfortunately, it is not possible for this country even though it has high ideals regarding the conditions of employment to ensure that the conditions of employment under which goods produced abroad shall be satisfactory. But we have power here to ensure that the conditions of employment shall be made satisfactory in respect of this particular corner of the industrial life of the Saorstát.  We do want to <Col N="406" /> prevent the good employer from being damaged and from being forced in a downward direction in regard to rates of pay, hours of labour and conditions generally.  We want to see some encouragement given to the idea of organisation on the employees' side and on the employers' side, and that the two sides shall come to some kind of reasonable and decent agreement, and that the State should use what influence it has in that direction.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives an opportunity to the Minister to bring the necessary pressure to bear upon employers to raise the level of the low wage service, and to raise it to that of a fair wage service, such as is given by the fair wage companies.  I ask the House to agree that it is a reasonable proposition that the good employer shall not be damaged by virtue of the fact that the freedom of competition in respect to wages and hours is allowed in the licences that are proposed to be given for the existing services as well as for future services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest there are at least two reasons why this amendment should not be passed by the House.  In the first place it goes too much into particulars and, in the second place, I consider it is unnecessary.  Section 11 (b) contains a reason justifying the Minister in refusing a licence.  He can refuse the licence if he is of opinion that the existing service is not sufficient in regard to frequency of service or in regard to daily duration of the service or in regard to any other matter.  That covers the point which the Senator has in mind, as well as any other point that might arise.  Further than that, Section 12 (k)&mdash;it is the section which deals with the attachment of conditions to passenger licences&mdash;sets out that whenever the Minister grants a passenger licence he may attach to it such conditions as he shall think proper, such as &ldquo;the rates of wages and hours of duty of employees and agreements or arrangements in reference thereto in the working of the passenger road service to which a licence relates.&rdquo;  I suggest the amendment is unnecessary having regard to these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="407" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment.  It suggests that before the licence is issued the Minister shall take all precautions necessary to safeguard the interests of the public. There is one matter of vital importance to the public arising from this amendment. Those of us who know conditions with regard to bus services in the city know that there is a positive danger to the public because of the long hours that some of the drivers and conductors are compelled to work.  I have in mind certain buses in the Dublin area on which the men work the 365 days of the year&mdash;they have not one day off.  Imagine a bus driver being compelled to drive continuously eight hours each day through the very heavy traffic in the city and suburbs. Imagine that man being obliged to work 365 days in the year.  Could any sane man confidently say that by allowing that we are safeguarding the rights of the public?  Would any member of this House who drives a car be prepared to go through that ordeal, not to speak of having the responsibility of the lives of twenty or thirty people in the bus?  Is it reasonable to ask any man to undertake that responsibility for the 365 days of the year?</P>
      <P>That is a statement I am prepared to prove.  That does not refer to the one-man bus only, but to companies employing large numbers of men. Worse than that, in some cases the men work their full eight hours at one stretch with an interval of ten minutes to get a cup of tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we safeguarding the interests of the travelling public by allowing that to take place?  This amendment asks that the Minister, before granting a licence in these cases, shall take the necessary precautions to safeguard the interests of the public.  No doubt we have the interests of the employed people to consider also in connection with this matter.  Senator Johnson has pointed out quite fairly that if a number of companies are going to get licences to engage in bus traffic in the city and suburbs of Dublin, at least there ought to be fair competition amongst them.  The amendment asks that where agreements have been made between trade unions catering <Col N="408" /> for the employees and companies engaged in the transport service, at least the conditions prevailing in these cases shall be the conditions under which the other companies shall work. Nothing could be more reasonable or fair than that.  Apart from all that, I am putting to the House the importance of safeguarding the public.  There is no necessity to speak about the terrible bus tragedies which have occurred in the city and suburbs.  It is almost impossible for a man engaged in driving for the 365 days of the year, with the ordeal of going through the enormous traffic in the city and suburbs, to be able to do it continuously. No Senator would like to do it, and if that is so, we ought not to ask anybody else to do it.  Further, we ought to insist, in any legislation passed governing this question of transport, that at least the safety of the public is protected.  I ask the House to support the amendment for these reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>With the main objects of the amendment as stated by the two Senators, I am in agreement.  I have always in this House held that it is good neither for the employee, the employer or the public to have workers working unreasonable hours.  But I cannot see that the method proposed in this amendment would be either satisfactory or achieve what the Senators want.  We are dealing now with the State.  To my mind, the State can only fix either a minimum wage or a maximum number of hours to be worked.  It cannot or ought not give to the Minister a discretion over and above fixing a minimum wage or a maximum number of hours.  If I understand the next section in the Bill, it clearly gives the Minister power to fix a minimum wage, if he thinks fit, or a maximum number of hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not know the transport business sufficiently well to know whether there is need for the fixing of a minimum wage at present, I have no doubt whatever that there is need for the fixing of a maximum number of hours for employees.  I do not say that there is no need for the other&mdash;I simply do not know.  Assuming that that is done, and the power is given to <Col N="409" /> do it in Section 12, unless I completely misunderstand it, then this amendment proposes that over and above that the Minister is to have a discretion to refuse a licence&mdash;although the company cannot have a licence at all unless it is keeping within that minimum&mdash;because though keeping within the minimum it is possibly paying a lower wage than may have been agreed to between the trade unions and certain other companies who might represent the majority.  I have always been in favour, so far as it is reasonably possible, of employers working harmoniously with the trade unions, and I believe it is in their interest to do so, but I am not prepared, in the event of a dispute between the unions or a dispute between the employers and the trade unions as to what are reasonable rates, to say that the Minister for the time being is to come in and say to certain companies, who may be either employing men of a different union or men who may not belong to any union &mdash;I am assuming that there is a minimum rate fixed&mdash;that although they are keeping the law they cannot have a licence because he does not like their rates of wages.  That is what is proposed in this amendment.  I think that is the wrong way of doing it.  I think the only right way of doing it at the present time, in our stage of development, is for the State to fix something which it regards as a minimum, and let the employers and the trade unions work out under normal conditions the improvements that may be made above that minimum.  It is the State's duty to fix maximum hours of work, particularly in a service of this kind where it is obvious that a man working anything like the hours mentioned cannot be fit to drive a bus continuously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a very grave danger in this amendment. If you look at this thing as a matter of principle I think you must agree that we have got largely, not only in the railways but all over the world, into a mess by over-regulation and restrictions and largely by the sheltered position of certain wage earners who maintain wages at an uneconomic level.  I see Senator O'Farrell getting his notebook ready, <Col N="410" /> so I know that I am in for it in a minute.  We have more or less now an opportunity to mend our hand.  We are starting to a great extent on a new adventure.  Do let us have regard to experience and to the present state of the world brought about by all this regulation.  I think also that Senator Johnson's amendment is a great confession of weakness, because surely with the organisation of labour and with the great power they have in many industries they could secure these conditions themselves, if they have the support of their own people. I would ask Senator Johnson, if he is prepared to give the Minister power to regulate wages, is he prepared to give up the weapon of the strike completely? Then, I think, the position might be more logical, but of course he is not.  He wants to have it both ways.  This sort of vague talk about bad conditions meaning danger and lack of safety of course is far too remote, because you might pay a man very good wages and he might be a bad liver.  Without exactly appearing the worse for drink on duty he might spend a lot of his spare time in the public-house.  He might have a debilitated constitution and he might be a thoroughly undesirable man as a driver and a danger to the public. You cannot carry that to that extent. You cannot actually follow up how a man lives.  The same way in regard to wages.  Who is going to regulate the question of degree?  We all know that if two families get the same wage one may be very thrifty and do very well while the other may be in poverty simply because of bad management. Whatever powers the Minister has with regard to the regulation of wages &mdash;I am sorry to hear he has any; Senators Douglas and Bagwell seem to think he has some; it comes rather as a shock to me to hear that he has any&mdash;I hope he will exercise them sparingly.  Let us get back to common sense and back to realising that wages have a commodity value as well as everything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing very extraordinary about this amendment. It is equivalent to inserting a fair wages clause in the industry now to be controlled by the State in its own interest <Col N="411" /> and for its own preservation. That in effect is the principle involved. I know we are at great disadvantage in discussing most important matters of this kind just at this particular time. The political correspondent of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; in his notes published to-day says, and I think he is right: &ldquo;It seems to be the general opinion that the Government supporters will be present in the Senate in sufficient numbers to ensure that it will be unnecessary to summon the Dáil to meet and that there will be no alteration in these measures.&rdquo;  So, according to that source Government supporters are here in sufficient numbers to-day to ensure that no amendment will be inserted in this Bill.  Whether that is true or not it is the duty of those who move amendments to give reasons for them.  I am afraid that is the only justification we have for talking at all in regard to these amendments.</P>
      <P>Now this amendment is moved in different interests.  In the first place it is moved in the interests of the travelling public; secondly, it is moved in the interests of the men who drive the buses that will carry the public. It is also moved in the interests of the companies, and particularly the companies that are at present paying reasonable rates of wages or that at least observe reasonable hours of work. Senator Farren mentioned eight hours per day.  I only wish that eight hours were observed on the part of the whole of those running the transport services at present, but unfortunately I think we can at least add 50 per cent. in certain cases.  As I pointed out on the Second Reading of this Bill, a man, whether an owner driver or not, who works more than he is capable of working while driving a bus is a menace not only to the people he drives but to everybody else who uses the highway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane talked about a man who may be well off on a small salary and a man who may be exceedingly poorly off on a high salary because he may be a bad liver.  I do not know how many people can afford to get a bad liver by over consumption of anything in these times in this <Col N="412" /> country.  The fact is that a very big part of the duty of a driver of a bus, particularly on bank holidays, is to avoid killing people who have plenty of money and who indulge themselves not wisely but too well.  Senator Sir John Keane talked about the world being in a mess through over State regulation of all kinds.  The railways are in a mess because of the doctrine of <i>laissez faire</i> or Paddy Go easy which Senator Bagwell glorifies.  He will find if he reads the papers, as I know he does, that State regúlation and control are becoming increasingly necessary and will become more and more necessary if the existing order is not to collapse in the lifetime of most of us.  State regulation is absolutely necessary now in order to save the existing order.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the Dáil argued against a somewhat similar amendment to this and said: It would be bad for the worker because he would have to fix, or might fix, a particular rate adequate in itself even though it was well below the maximum rate fixed. That is a matter for the workers.  These amendments are put down after due consideration and the workers are prepared to take the risk.  We are concerned mainly with the small man who has a few buses and who is able to get people to work for anything because of the existing state of employment and because they are starving and are prepared to work at any rate.  He is able to get men and to work them on certain occasions up to 14 hours per day and give them anything he may please.  They are prepared to do this work because necessity knows no law.  Four or five of that type of bus competing with a company that pays reasonable rates make it impossible for them to continue these rates if they are to continue charging the same fares.</P>
    <P>Then we have the other problem of the one-man bus where the conductor is also the driver.  He has, therefore, a double responsibility put upon him. Having to pay only one man that employer is effecting a considerable saving and he should be compelled to observe reasonable hours of duty and pay the trade union rate of wages. <Col N="413" /> The whole tendency to-day is to try and dispense with men.  That is creating huge unemployment everywhere. They have at present machinery in America which turns out 73,000 electric bulbs per day which were previously turned out by 2,000 skilled operators. They have a tabulating machine that does the work of one hundred skilled persons.  They have machinery for excavating and laying concrete streets and sewers which attended by 70 operatives do work which previously employed 7,000 men working with pick and shovel.  All these are tendencies to throw men more and more out of employment while the employers hope to grab a greater share of the profits. It is not working, it cannot work, because there is nobody to buy the commodities which are turned out.</P>
    <P>The same development has taken place in transport.  You have the driver acting the part of the conductor, and where you had on the railways the permanent way and the signal cabins, and stations and all the rest, you have now the bus owner with at most two men on a bus, with a highway ready-made, with Civic Guards acting as signalmen, and a whole lot of other privileges conferred upon him by the State and the ratepayers.  In return he simply thinks of dispensing with more men, and is consequently able to make greater profit than if he had been running on rails.  I suggest, in these circumstances, seeing there are so many people anxious to run buses, seeing that they have such special privileges conferred upon them in that branch of transport, as compared with others, that they be compelled to agree, when they come to the Minister for a licence, when he says: I shall only grant the licence on condition that you work your men for what, in my opinion, and in the opinion of everybody else, is a reasonable number of hours, in the interests of the men and in the interests of the public, and that you shall observe at least the same rates of pay and conditions of service as are observed by other companies in the same district running similar services.</P>

      <P>Senators are alive to the legislation passed on this matter all over the world.  They have not pointed out where any country has gone to the extent they desire we should go in regulating bus wages. There is regulation of traffic in Northern Ireland, in England and in France, and I am sure if there was anything of this kind in the legislation there Senators would have pointed it out.  If it is there Senators made a bad case in not pointing it out.  I do not agree that it is the right of any Minister to fix wages.  He should only interfere where it was necessary to safeguard the public.  He does not fix railway wages.  He never had power to fix wages in any industry I know of.</P>

      <P>They would be made to work for any wages they could get. As to Senator Sir John Keane's regulations, the present chaotic state of the world is testimony to the benefits accruing from the regulations which he and his class made regarding the trade and commerce of the world.  I have personal knowledge of one bus driver who had to drive 62 miles from a certain city in the Saorstát, and who, at the end of the journey got one half hour off before he drove back again. He had to make a third journey the same day and had to remain at his destination at night.  The next day he did the same journeys in the opposite direction.  As a result he had to sleep in a different bed each night.  Another bus driver operated a similar bus in the opposite direction. Neither of these men received an equitable wage.  The result was that one bus broke down four drivers in three months.  One driver who was fairly virile stuck to the position for three months and had then to go into hospital.  That is happening all over the Free State.  One of these drivers lost control of his bus and only that there happened to be a protecting wall at the side of the road the thirty passengers would have fallen fifteen feet into a field.  Accidents are bound to happen from time to time if the present conditions are allowed to continue.  There are regulations on the railways as to the engine drivers' hours of work.  It was found necessary to introduce these regulations for the protection of the public. It is only when there is some big catastrophe and when there is proof that bus drivers and conductors are overworked that some protection will <Col N="416" /> be given to the public.  Why not give that protection now by imposing reasonable conditions in bus services, and by seeing that the workers are paid a rate of wages which would enable them to maintain their physique and to give satisfaction to the public and to their employers?</P>

      <P>Labour is a commodity and has its price, and if there is a supply of labour over and above the demand, then labour must be cut down to the lowest possible level, to the margin of subsistence.  Keep a man in being, give him sufficient food to keep up his labour powers, and that is all you need think of, because labour is a commodity.  That I suggest is what Senator Wilson thinks in his heart, what Senator Bagwell thinks in his heart, what all those who will vote against this amendment think in their hearts, but it is absolutely opposed to every decent thought, to every decent ethic, to every decent system of morality and to every decent system of religion.  Labour is not a commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment does not ask the Minister to fix wages.  The amendment gives an additional power to those which he has asked for.  There are certain things which the Minister takes to himself as reasons for refusing a licence to an existing service.  These <Col N="417" /> things will have to be enquired into, and these things imply regulation on the ground of inefficiency, inadequacy and inability to carry on the service as it ought to be carried on.  All require some kind of State intervention.  Am I to understand that the opponents of the amendment are against the whole sub-section?  If they are against State intervention then they should oppose this Bill.</P>

      <P>The amendment asks that the Minister should have power to refuse a licence if the conditions of labour are not up to a level which has been agreed upon between employers and employees in decent services&mdash;the services which the Minister says he desires shall eventually have a monopoly. I do not know how those who are supporting the Minister can oppose this amendment, because it seeks, by regulation of the transport services, to make easier the establishment of that monopoly.  It is a move in that direction admittedly, accompanied by the desire to humanise the conditions of the workers in competing services in the first period before the monopoly stage is reached.  Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Wilson appear to have joined the active syndicalists.</P>

      <P>Those people who are against political action in industrial affairs, and who say to the workmen: &ldquo;Organise one hundred per cent. in your trade unions and use your industrial power to force what you wish on the community.&rdquo;  That is the position of Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Wilson.  &ldquo;If perchance you are not able to organise your workmen one hundred per cent., when you have fifty per cent. organised you are powerful enough to disorganise the transport services, to make yourself a nuisance, and to put pressure on the employers and on the public.  The strike weapon is the weapon you should use.&rdquo;  That is what Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Wilson advocate.  I wonder do they desire that?  Are we to take it from the action of those who oppose this amendment, that it is the will of this Seanad that workmen shall use the <Col N="418" /> strike weapon to disorganise the transport industry, to prevent transport services running unless they are run under decent conditions, to leave political affairs alone and to use the industrial weapon?</P>
      <P>Senator Bagwell and Senator Douglas have both pointed to section 11 of the Bill, and Senator Bagwell quoted paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) which sets out that the Minister may refuse to grant a passenger licence &ldquo;on the ground that, in his opinion, such existing service was not sufficient, in regard to frequency of service or in regard to daily duration of the service or in regard to any matter.&rdquo;  The Senator emphasised the phrase &ldquo;in regard to any other matter&rdquo; and suggested that that gave the Minister the power which we seek by this amendment to give him.  The Senator, however, forgot to continue the sentence &mdash;&ldquo;to meet the requirements of the public.&rdquo;  I am not putting forward this amendment for the purpose of meeting the requirements of the public, though it would incidentally increase the safety of the public.  There is no power in paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) to enable the Minister to use wages and hours as a reason for refusing a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two Senators argued that Section 12, paragraph (k), was sufficient for the purpose.  I wish I could believe that it is sufficient, but I cannot do so in view of what the Minister said in the other House.  Section 12 deals with the attachment of conditions to passenger licences.  The Minister, in discussing that matter in the other House, said: &ldquo;I am pointing out that it is not going to be very effective. My objection to it is that it is not going to have any effect.&rdquo;  The Minister points out that the paragraph is no use there.  It is not going to be effective; to be effective it ought to be in some other place.  If the House is agreeable to putting the amendment I have down into section 11, I am quite agreeable to remove it from section 12.  If the Minister assures me that what he said in the Dáil was wrong, I can understand a certain amount of weight being attached to the objections made by the two Senators <Col N="419" /> who have spoken.  But I am accepting the Minister's view, that, where it stands, this paragraph is of no use whatever, that it is quite ineffective. I want to make it effective somewhere.  Consequently, I have put down the amendment in regard to the issue of licences to existing services and to the issue of licences to new services.</P>
    <P>We would like that these matters should be arranged so far as possible between organised workers and organised employers.  But no matter how well organised, short of perfection, workers or employers may be, there is always a minority outside.  If you desire that non-legal pressure should be brought upon this minority, and if you legalise that we might be very pleased, but we do desire that this matter should be regulated by other means than by the use of the strike weapon.  It is perfectly true that the insertion of these amendments is an admission of weakness, to the extent that all the possible drivers and conductors of buses are not organised in a trade union.  The more unemployment you have the less is the efficacy of a trade union.  The House should ask itself whether it is prepared to use that weapon of hunger&mdash;the fact that people are unemployed and, therefore, are willing to work at low wages&mdash;as a means of bringing down the wage levels of those who are already at work and are getting decent wages.  The employers' contention always is: &ldquo;We cannot compete with others who are getting preferential treatment by virtue of low wages.&rdquo;  Consequently, the pressure is downwards all the time. We are asking the House to make one little effort to humanise and regularise the conditions of employment on the buses to be licensed under this Bill, when passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnson raised one point which I think requires to be cleared up.  He referred to paragraph (k) of Section 12.  That section provides that the Minister may attach conditions to passenger licences respecting &ldquo;the rates of wages and hours of duties of employees and <Col N="420" /> agreements or arrangements in reference thereto in the working of the passenger road service to which a licence relates.&rdquo;  Senator Johnson said that that condition could not be operative and, I think, he said that the Minister admitted that in the Dáil.  If the Minister admitted that, it is a very serious matter.  I do not intend, by my intervention, to spoil in any way the beauty of the discussion between Senator Johnson and Senator Sir John Keane as to whether wages are a commodity or not.  Speaking now as a member of the public and as one who uses the roads with a motor car, I think there ought to be efficient regulation as regards the hours worked by these bus drivers.  It should be definitely laid down that men in charge of buses ought not to work unduly long hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">

      <P>I think there ought to be not alone one day's rest, but that there should be several hours' rest between each journey.  I do not know anything so dangerous as a sleepy bus driver.  If the Minister admitted in the Dáil that paragraph (k) of Section 12 is not sufficient to prevent the working of bus drivers over an excessive number of hours or on too frequent journeys such as were referred to by Senator Duffy&mdash;if that state of affairs is to continue, it is a frightful danger to the public and to the people using the roads.  I intend to vote in favour of the amendment.  I would ask Senators who intend to vote against it to have the question of hours cleared up; to have from the Minister a clear statement as to whether he thinks paragraph (k) of Section 12 is sufficient to prevent owners of buses from employing men for hours that are too long and from the danger of having worn-out, sleepy drivers in charge of these juggernauts to the general danger of the public.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to preface my remarks by saying, in regard to labour, that I do not share the philosophy alleged by Senator Johnson to be that of Senator Sir John Keane and of others.  So far as this amendment is concerned, I am clearly of opinion that paragraph (k) of Section 12 is sufficient.  In a moment I will refer to the remarks that I made in the Dáil dealing with it.  First of all it has been objected to paragraph (k) of Section 12 that it only has relation to <Col N="422" /> the attachment of conditions once a licence has been granted, whereas this amendment wants to stop the granting of a licence.  I think that I can show in a moment that there is not much difference between these two things.  Secondly, I expected to have it said that it is somewhere in the penumbra of the consciousness of those moving the amendment that section 12 gives considerable power to the Minister to grant a passenger licence. He may attach certain conditions. With regard to the two points, so far as the Minister is concerned he is about equal as between the two amendments.  Under the amendment as put down a licence may be refused on the grounds that &ldquo;in his opinion&rdquo;&mdash;so that the same judge is to act as between the two types of amendments. The Minister may attach conditions if he thinks they are required, or at any rate he may refuse a licence if he thinks that the hours are unduly long or the wages unduly low.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any difference on the point of preventing the Minister from granting a licence.  In fact it does not prevent him.  It gives him power.  It is entirely at his discretion to refuse a licence if certain conditions are not complied with. This amendment refers to hours of duty worked.  That is peculiarly in the past tense, but by contrast it is intended that it shall be applicable by reference backwards and forwards. So far as reference backwards is concerned, my attitude is that I prefer to have it that the licence must be granted if the applicant has for the previous twelve months been on the road running a service efficiently and adequately.  If he has been running it unsatisfactorily the Minister operating the Act can attach conditions at once.  If the man concerned cannot comply with the conditions attached, then he has to get off the road.  I think further it would be slightly inequitable to refuse a man a licence on the ground that he had not observed certain standards in regard to wages and hours which had not been previously laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the main desire of those moving the amendment is to look to <Col N="423" /> the future.  They are not so much concerned with the past.  The future is safeguarded in regard to paragraph (k) Section 12.  The only point that has been made against it is something that I said in the Dáil.  I notice that from the three or four columns of matter that I spoke in the Dáil only one particular phrase has been pulled out. Senator Wilson jumped to the first point that I was speaking against the insertion of a particular amendment, not exactly this, in another part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It was moved to put the particular amendment into Section 12 at the point where paragraph (k) went.  As the Senator will see if he reads it my argument was founded on that.  At any rate that argument referred to wages fixed in a particular way.  To meet the distinction in the clause, I said that in so far as it related to hours of duty there was some value in it.  I said in so far as it related to agreements, either referring to wages or hours of duty, there was value in it, but that in regard to standards of wages, which were left to me to be decided, it was ineffective.  I said that the minimum would have to be fixed so low that it would give a bad indication to good bus proprietors as to what they might do.  On the amendment which was accepted and which stands as paragraph (k) of Section 12, I stated in the Dáil: &ldquo;In regard to hours of duty I do say that there is a possibility that that might not be as ineffective as the rest.  I do not know what this means exactly&mdash;&lsquo;agreements or arrangements in reference thereto.&rsquo;  If that means something corresponding to what is in the Railways Act of 1924, then I think it may be of use.  The Act of 1924 provides, or at least establishes, this sort of procedure, that there should be registered agreements that were entered into as between the Unions and the Companies and that where these agreements were registered they should be brought within the framework of the Act.  If this amendment means the same thing it may be of use.&rdquo;  Similarly I said: &ldquo;The amendment will have some use in relation to <Col N="424" /> the hours of duty.  It may be of some use in relation to either hours or wages where these things are in particular areas covered by agreements entered into by the unions and the men, because possibly it will have some good effect in these cases ...  I accept it for what it is worth.&rdquo;  At any rate the clause is there as it stands.  It gives the Minister power to attach these conditions.  The amendment gives the Minister discretion as to whether he is going to refuse a licence on the ground of these abuses or not. If you have an unsympathetic Minister he is not going to refuse a licence or to attach conditions.  If he is going to be sympathetically disposed from the Senator's angle, he can attach conditions and impose regulations, both as regards wages and hours of duty.  Therefore I think paragraph (k) meets the whole situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is necessary to make some comment on what the Minister has said, not on the conclusion he arrived at but on the statements in regard to the course of procedure which led to the insertion of the amendment.  Originally there were a number of amendments put down in respect of other sections of the Bill with something like the same object in view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>None in relation to Section 12, except one not dealing with this purpose at all.  There was another amendment put down in relation to Section 11.  There was no amendment put down in this matter to Section 12, but there were later amendments, and it was intimated that they were perhaps outside the scope of the Bill, and the actual amendment that is now inserted in the Bill was submitted almost at the last moment.  That was the amendment to Section 12 which would be permissible under the Rules of Order in the Dáil, and it is that amendment which now appears in the Bill, and which the Minister said as has been quoted, that he accepted for what it is worth.  He was not concerned.  I was not able to understand the arguments of the Minister.  I was not able <Col N="425" /> to understand why it was not of some value in Section 12 if it gave the Minister power to attach conditions to licences, but I give him credit for knowing the working of his Department and what powers he would have, if he had the will, under the amendment. But in view of what he said, right from the beginning to the end of the discussion, belittling the value of it even to effect what was desired.  I came to the conclusion, under my reading of the Bill as it passed the Dáil, that this sub-section was defective. The Minister was satisfied that it was not going to do any good.  It was quite harmless and innocuous, so we sought to get something in the section which was of benefit.  Now we have the Minister telling us it may be of benefit.  It may be of equal value as a condition attached to the licence, as it would be if inserted in Section 11. <Col N="426" /> Frankly and openly I admit at once that everything depends on the discretion of the Minister.  This is not a Bill placing obligations on the Minister in regard to these things.  It is a Bill giving power, and I would be delighted if I could think that the Minister would take into account the conditions under which employees are expected to be employed in regard to wages and hours, and that there will be attached to the licence certain conditions in these respects.  I do not know whether we can take it from the Minister that there would be an inclination in that direction if he remains in his present position.  I would like to have that indication.  If we had it, I do not think we need press the amendment, but in the absence of it, I think we will have to.</P>

      <P>I bow to the superior wisdom of Senator Wilson.  The amendment that has been disposed of dealt with the position of existing services. This deals with new services. Whatever might have been said against the imposition of responsibility in this matter in respect to existing services, I think the case for new services is a much stronger one.  That is to say, that if there are people coming along asking for licences to carry on a new service it is reasonable that the position of the employees in that service should be considered, and that the licence might be refused on the grounds stated in the amendment, that the wages and hours proposed to be applicable create an unfair competition with those already existing services.  I do not think I need argue the case again, but it will be obvious to any Senator who has his mind open in the matter that, in regard to the position of an applicant for a new service, if he is going to apply for a licence to run in competition with certain existing services, it is surely reasonable that the terms on which the persons who are going to be engaged in that service should be employed should be taken into account by the Minister before issuing a licence.  I was quite prepared to ask the House simply to take into account the hours of duty, but as the House is not willing to give me that permission, I must ask that the amendment be put forward in the case of the new services in accordance with the terms of the amendment on the paper.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to state if he can give any idea of his attitude towards a new service of this kind where two brothers want to run a service.  Of course they <Col N="428" /> can camouflage wages to any extent. There is no test of wages.  There is a test of hours alone.  I think it would be wrong that any pioneer enterprise of that kind should be, in any way, limited.  It has been one of the most refreshing features to me to see the variety of buses around Dublin.  Some of them are unregulated, but it rejoiced my heart to see them with those names Brown, Carmel, Pioneer, etc.  It showed a proper pioneer spirit to see the way they are being set up.  I am not in favour of those large aggregations of capital which Senator Johnson suggests I have a sinister regard for.  I like to see one man get ahead with due regard for public safety.</P>

The Minister will be able to do so, but I cannot see any difference in this amendment of Senator Johnson in principle as against the other.  I still believe that a proper method of controlling hours, which is what he is concerned with, is by setting out conditions governing the maximum hours to be permitted and putting them in the licence and not by putting in specific cases.  I believe the proper way to deal with hours is to put down conditions.  If the Minister is not able to do that I think the proper thing for the State is to make conditions governing hours and to put those in the licence.</P>

      <P>I have the same reply to this as I made previously with regard to paragraph (k) of Section 12 because of the power that is required. I point out also that in Section <Col N="429" /> 11 I have absolute discretion to grant or to refuse an application for a passenger licence.  Paragraph 3, which calls attention to certain things, says that the Minister shall (without prejudice to the absolute discretion conferred on him by the first sub-section of this section) have regard to the following matters, that is to say.  I personally would much prefer to see any items regarding rates of wages and hours of duty dealt with by way of an attachment of the conditions if there is to be any regulation of this at all.  Certainly I think there ought to be such a regulation as would do away with some of the scandalous abuses I have heard of.  I have not very much experience of but I heard of the extraordinary hours of work being imposed on some of these people who are not proprietors.  Where the proprietor decides to work a certain length of time himself, subject to this that we should see to the safety of the public, that person should be allowed to work and encouraged to work as much as he can.  I would much prefer to stand by paragraph (k) of Section 12.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane puts the point of the two brothers who propose to run a bus service.  With regard to them I have not any definite attitude because it will depend entirely on the circumstances.  There might be remote areas in the country where one would look to the small man working on his own where he would be the only person where the traffic is not very much and where it would require a great deal of enterprise and very hard work on the part of one person or two at a maximum to get a service run there.  There that person would be favoured, but I think in the main the single man or one or two men will not be very much favoured in the administration of this Bill.</P>

It is suggested that that class of person, which common sense fits into the realities of life, is not to be given ample <Col N="430" /> scope under this new system.  Perhaps I was rather lacking in diligence when I did not take the Minister up on the Second Reading when he pictured our having the whole transport organisation in the hands of three rather big companies, one in the Dublin area and two outside it.  I should have perhaps been more apt then.  Surely it is not contemplated that these big capitalist organisations should cater for these small outlying villages that might be quite satisfied with a bi-weekly service to a central town?  If that sort of thing is going to be brought about by this Bill it will be very bad for the future of transport and for the general travelling public.</P>

      <P>There is only one remark that I want to make.  It is, if the Minister has this absolute discretion, I wonder why all these subsections and paragraphs are in the Bill at all.  I take it the purpose is to indicate to the Minister for the time <Col N="431" /> being what the intentions of the Legislature were, at least to give a pointer to the Minister in the exercise of his discretion.  When the Minister points out, in objecting to an amendment of this kind, that in any case he has an absolute discretion in all the other matters, if his argument has any value at all, he need only have a section saying: &ldquo;The Minister shall have an absolute discretion to grant or refuse an application for any passenger licence,&rdquo; and that would have been quite sufficient.  I assume there is some value in putting in these indications of the will of the Legislature to the Minister for the time being, even though he has a discretion as to how he shall apply them.  Consequently, we desire to add to the number of things which he should take into account this question of hours and wages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reply to that very briefly.  This piece of legislation was in fact originally drafted with the opening paragraph as it is: &ldquo;The Minister shall have absolute discretion subject to the provisions of the section.&rdquo;  The original provision had only this, with regard to the company that was already on the road for a year, giving adequate and efficient service.  Then we decided to put in these other points.  I call attention to paragraph (c) &ldquo;whether the organisation and equipment at the disposal of the person making the application are sufficient to enable him to carry on the proposed service in accordance with the conditions which the Minister considers should be inserted in the passenger licence to which such application relates.&rdquo;  Surely that carries terms of reference to Section 12, where we have inserted this item with regard to wages and hours?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 4:</P>
      <P>New Section.  Before Section 12 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>12.  Where a person who carried on an existing service as defined in the preceding section is refused a licence, such person shall be permitted to continue such service for a period of twelve months from the date of refusal or alternatively shall be entitled to fair and reasonable compensation, such compensation to be fixed by the Minister and payable out of public funds.  All moneys paid for such compensation shall be repayable by surviving and new licensees under such conditions of amount and time as the Minister may direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather heartened in moving this amendment by the remarks of Senator Sir John Keane in regard to the enterprise of the smaller bus proprietors, in which views I might say candidly I have always shared, but it is fairly clear now, under this Bill, that most of these smaller proprietors <Col N="433" /> will be put off the roads at very considerable loss to themselves.  The Minister was very frank in telling us that they anticipated that this traffic would go into the hands of three large undertakings with others that might be sanctioned.  It is fairly clear that he secured to some extent a monopoly for three powerful organisations and that a number of smaller individuals will be severely financially injured. My amendment is to minimise, so far as possible, the financial loss to these people.  If a small proprietor is refused a licence a bus or a couple of buses will be on his hands, absolutely an unmarketable asset.  Most of us know pretty well those buses are frequently only taken on on the hire-purchase system, and in addition to being knocked out of business the man may possibly be bankrupted. Not only will he not be able to carry on his existing business but he will be precluded from going into another line of business that may be open to him.</P>
    <P>The amendment is to the effect that such a man, who has an existing service and who is now refused a licence, may, at the option of the Minister, run his bus for a period of 12 months or, alternatively, that he be granted a sum as compensation, such compensation to be fixed by the Minister out of moneys payable out of the public funds, and to have this compensation recouped to the Exchequer by instalments from the surviving licensees or by the new licensees.  I think it is a perfectly fair and equitable proposal and I will now ask the House to give an assent to it.</P>

      <P>I have some sympathy with the view expressed by the mover of the amendment, but I am against the amendment because I do not think it is a practicable amendment.  There would be hard cases, perhaps, but if this amendment were carried it would practically set up a problem which would be difficult of solution.  It would be very difficult to assess the amount of compensation to be paid. All this would lend itself to a very great deal of discussion, expense, and so on, before the matter was wound up.  I might suggest that the House <Col N="434" /> should have regard to the fact that if a licence is refused it is refused for very good reasons.  Everybody knows what these reasons are; they are good and sufficient reasons.  I suggest to the House, therefore, that the amendment is one which should not be passed.</P>

I am not sure if an amendment of this kind can be moved by a Senator.  I am assuming, however, that as the amendment has been allowed to go on, it is in order. The arguments made for it do not impress me.  Senator Dowdall here presents himself in various disguises to this House.  Sometimes he presents himself to the House as a protectionist and sometimes as a life-long free trader.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that I have an extremely good record on that point as compared with certain other people. The Senator generally expresses himself as being against people who have sent things into this country, and I have heard his Party, if not himself, on more than one occasion talk about the bait held out by the hire-purchase system.  He now tells us that most of these buses for which he seeks to get compensation have been brought in here on the hire-purchase system. Then they are all the more easily got rid of.  The Senator is running counter to the policy of his Party as explained in the Dáil.  The idea of his Party was that these buses were to be ruthlessly got rid of, and that they should be wiped off the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Bagwell put up another type of argument.  That was on the merits.  This refers to the type of bus-owner who has been refused a licence. Why?  On the grounds that he has been running an unsatisfactory service. Senator Dowdall thinks that that is the reason why we should compensate him&mdash;we should compensate a man who has been running an unsatisfactory service, and because he was doing so <Col N="435" /> failed to get a licence.  I do not think it is fair, as the Senator suggests, that such an owner should be compensated by other people.  That is quite unfair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his opening statement was quite frank and clear about it that one of his objects was to create such a position as would enable the railway companies to run buses free from existing restriction and therefore to enable new powerful licensees to get a practical monopoly.  It is an injustice that those people who were allowed to invest their money freely should now be faced with the position that legislation is being brought in to knock them off the road.  I know that this amendment is in order.  But whether this amendment is the best way in which the matter should be dealt with is a thing to which I am not pinning myself.  I am prepared to assent to any form of amendment which will give consideration to people who had enterprise to cater for a necessary public service.</P>

I feel, therefore, that there is an unreality about it.  I honestly believe that there is a great deal in what the Senator has stated.  It is unjust to refuse any person who is running a service at the present time a renewal of his licence without giving him an opportunity of winding up.  If the Senate were dealing with a Bill like this in normal and more realistic times and under more realistic conditions it would examine more closely than it does now the spirit of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 5.</P>
      <P>Section 12.  Before paragraph (b) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) the provision of waiting-rooms and sanitary accommodation for passengers at appropriate <Col N="436" /> intervals on the route of such service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes that one of the conditions which the Minister may attach to the granting of a licence shall be the provision of waiting-rooms and sanitary accommodation for passengers at appropriate intervals along the route on each service.  I think it will be agreed that that is a reasonable condition.  We are to-day going back to very primitive conditions so far as sanitary accommodation is concerned in connection with road transport.  Take the position of a bus setting out from Dublin to Cork, a distance of 160 miles, and no provision is made for waiting-rooms or sanitary accommodation of any kind.  It is not sufficient to pull up outside a public house.  That may meet the requirements of men who are not over particular, but it does not meet the travelling requirements of women and children.  This would apply pretty well entirely to any long service route.  The Minister has told us that he hopes that two of these zones which will cover the long distance routes will eventually be controlled by the two railway companies. Now the railway companies had the railway stations generally convenient to towns, and they could easily avail of the accommodation already there in their waiting-rooms, and these could be fitted in with the bus services.  I do believe that when the State does proceed to make regulations with regard to transport and the issuing of licences for transport this should be one of the conditions.  The railway company would not be allowed to run a service without having certain sanitary accommodation.</P>
    <P>To-day where there is much competition with regard to transport, and when we have become more modern with regard to hygiene it is deplorable that there is not a waiting-room and no sanitary accommodation of any kind from the time a person leaves until he reaches his destination, unless he avails of the charity of the publican or the hotel proprietor.  The travelling public should not be at the mercy of people whom they are not paying and with whom they have no contract.  I <Col N="437" /> would earnestly commend this amendment to the consideration of the House and to the consideration of the Minister.  I know that there are restrictions, and the Minister would not probably accept anything at all that would alter this Bill, but if the Minister cannot accept some of those amendments then I put it to him that he might agree to an adjournment until after the election.  It is deplorable to find, after the length of time during which this Bill has been in preparation, that we should here now in the teeth of an election be told that the matter cannot get consideration because of political necessity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>Very many motives have been imputed in this debate. Perhaps the unkindest of all is the proposition that some of us are opposing amendments because we desire no amendment to be carried.  I can assure the House that so far as I am concerned I speak with complete innocence on every amendment.  I am opposing this amendment on the merits.  I can conceive where people can be put to inconvenience through the circumstances of their transport, but that we should insert amendments of this kind which practically impose on the Minister the obligation of looking into the whole question of the provision of waiting-rooms and sanitary accommodation for road services, is, to my mind, really going a great deal too far.  It seems to me to be absurd.</P>
      <P>How did people travel on the roads before motor buses came?  They were accustomed to travel in traps, horse-drawn vehicles, pony or donkey-carts. Was it necessary in those times to provide sanitary accommodation?  Of course it was not.  At the moment those people travel a considerable distance in order to join the bus.  In the towns there are sanitary conveniences adequate for the needs of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be unjust further to burden this service.  It would make this method of transport more expensive if this accommodation were to be provided, because in order to provide it the ground would have to be properly drained and kept.  In my own experience as general manager of a <Col N="438" /> railway company I found that it was necessary, in the case of waiting-rooms and sanitary conveniences, to employ a person to look after these places, because otherwise they would be abused and rendered in such a disgusting condition that they would be no use to any respectable person.</P>
    <P>I am against this proposal, because it would mean making these arrangements all along the country roads, and that would cost a great deal of money. Besides, it would necessitate employing some person to look after each place, as otherwise they would very soon become unfit for use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Just as in the case of other amendments, Senator Bagwell is &ldquo;agin&rdquo; this amendment.  His speech is a deplorable example of the attitude of a general manager of a railway in regard to modern requirements.  The last day he boasted that he had been general manager for fifteen years.  He now gives us his idea of what modern travelling conditions should be.  How, he asks, did our forefathers do without lavatories?  A speech like that from an ignorant farmer from the backwoods would be understandable, but, coming from a man of the standing of Senator Bagwell, who was general manager of an important railway for fifteen years, it is really extraordinary.  It is a remarkable example of the attitude of the railways, and probably it is one explanation of their decay to-day. <i>Laissez faire</i> or &ldquo;Paddy-go-easy&rdquo; has been the policy adopted, and Senator Bagwell wants to perpetuate that by introducing it into the new form of transport.</P>
      <P>In view of what we have heard from the Senator, we need not be surprised that to-day the railways are crying out for assistance.  As far as I can see, their position is due to lack of enterprise, and we have had a glaring example of that in this debate as far as an ex-general manager is concerned. Senator Bagwell makes a comparison of present and past travelling conditions. He talks of a pony-trap taking people to market, and he compares that with a family going by bus a distance of 160 miles, say to Cork!  Surely there is no comparison!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> The Senator says that there should not be any sanitary accommodation, because it would be necessary to have somebody to attend to it.  Did anyone ever hear such an argument advanced seriously against the establishment of modern hygienic conditions?  The amendment suggests the introduction of certain conditions, and the Minister would be failing in his duty if he omitted to include them in this measure.</P>

      <P>I am sure everyone would be in sympathy with Senator O'Farrell's proposal if it were at all practicable.  The adoption of this suggestion would mean the erection of waiting-rooms and sanitary conveniences all along the road to Cork.  I agree that that would be most desirable and necessary if it could be done, but I do not see how it can be done.  I daresay everyone would like to see it done if it were at all economically feasible.</P>

Senator Bagwell took the extreme view on the other side when he spoke of a pony trap. The real point at issue comes in between these extremes.  I contend that the Minister has the necessary power under Section 11 (b).  He can refuse a licence on the grounds that in his opinion the service is not sufficient in regard to frequency or daily duration or &ldquo;in regard to any other matter.&rdquo;  There is ample power contained in the Bill, and it is at the discretion of the Minister to insist on all the things that modern civilisation demands.</P>

Road transport services are utilised to carry people distances of 70 to 170 miles without suitable accommodation being provided.  The Minister's attention has, by means of this amendment, been directed to a grave necessity, and we all hope that something will be done.  So far as <Col N="440" /> difficulties are concerned, everything you attack, if it is new, presents a difficulty.  Everything you attack in this world presents a difficulty.</P>
      <P>With regard to setting up lavatories at the main stopping places I do not think much difficulty should be experienced.  It was never thought that these conveniences should be set up on country roads.  I think in villages and towns there would be no great difficulty experienced.  No reasonable objection could be put forward, even on the ground of expense. If shops were given a small amount I am sure they would provide reasonable accommodation, particularly for women and children.  The Minister has the necessary power, and I am sure he will exercise it.</P>

My experience in human affairs leads me to believe that all these things ultimately settle themselves.  If there is a demand for this accommodation, and if there is any element of competition, all these things will arrange themselves.  The Senator starts out as if he were living in some sort of detached academic atmosphere, imagining all the modern things that we should have.  To my mind this is all the outcome of the doctrine of Karl Marx that everybody should have everything straight away, cut and dried.  Life is not directed that way; it is a process of evolution.  For my part I am unimaginative.  This proposal never suggested itself to me; it never occurred to me until the Senator got up that there was any difficulty about this matter.  I have travelled miles on buses and I never heard any mention of it.  To carry this proposal into effect would mean a huge amount of expense, and the cost of travelling would be increased.  The railways have met with very heavy losses and, of course, shareholders have suffered. I do think we should not carry matters to extremes; we should let this private enterprise system have a fair run.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out that Section 12 gives me sufficient power to deal with this matter if it is found necessary to deal with it at all. &ldquo;Whenever the Minister grants a passenger <Col N="441" /> licence he may attach to such licence such conditions as he shall think proper....&rdquo;  He may impose conditions in respect of several matters.  There is power enough in Section 12 if it is required.  I am not sure that it will be used.  It will not be used in the beginning.  I think the way in which one will find this matter having effect will be that the railway-controlled buses will be able to give accommodation, such as waiting-rooms, better than can be provided otherwise, and that will be another point in their favour.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Wilson, I would not under any conditions refuse to grant a licence to a company that was otherwise satisfactory on the grounds mentioned in the amendment.  There is power enough if the matter has to be dealt with, but as I say it will arise later.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 7:</P>
      <P>New section.  After Section 30 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;31.&mdash;(1)  A railway company to which this Part of this Act applies shall keep such accounts and make such returns in relation to road transport business as the Minister shall from time to time direct.</P>
      <P>(2)  A railway company which has acquired the whole or any part of or any share or interest in the capital or undertaking of a company carrying on the business of road transport shall include in its annual statement of accounts issued to its stock or shareholders a copy of the last published Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account of such company.</P>
      <P>(3)  A company which fails to comply with the provisions of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds for every day during which such failure continues.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed new section deals with <Col N="442" /> railway companies who run road motor services, and provides that they shall keep and furnish such accounts as the Minister shall direct.  The important part of the amendment is paragraph 2. I may say that I did not put down this amendment without consultation with some important railway shareholders. Railway companies embarking upon road transport have either to pledge their credit or use the reserves of the railway undertaking itself to purchase these road transport undertakings.  In certain cases, instead of buying and running the buses under the name of the railway company they acquire a controlling interest in another company.  Take, for example, the Great Southern Railways Company, which owns the Irish Omnibus Company.  There is a certain arrangement whereby the profit or loss of the road transport section is shared by the railway company. So far nothing has been shared by the railway company except losses.  The railway company has had to make up very big losses.  When the shareholders meet once a year they have no opportunity, good, bad or indifferent, of discussing the manner in which the road transport section has been run, which was purchased with their money or through their credit.  They cannot see whether it is run efficiently or otherwise.  They have got nothing to do except merely to make up the losses.  All that appears on the balance sheet is an item like this: &ldquo;Balance of payment to or by other undertakings under working agreement in respect of working expenses,&rdquo; and you see a loss of £33,246, which the railway company has to make up.  They have nothing to do but to make it up.  They cannot discuss it.  There is no statement of accounts of the road transport company which they own.  That transport company is run as a private company which does not issue a public balance sheet or statement of accounts.  There is no criticism of its working.  It is, in my opinion, an absolutely irregular form of commercial transaction, and involves a grave abuse of the reserves of the railway shareholders, and, incidentally, of the railway employees, whose productive efforts have gone to make up the deficit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> The Railway (Road Motor Services) Act, 1927, in Section 8, contains a provision compelling the railway companies which run a road motor service under the Act to keep such accounts and make such returns in relation to such services as the Minister shall from time to time direct.  They do that in regard to those particular services that they run themselves definitely as Great Southern Railway services, but where they made an agreement with another company, or used their reserves to purchase a company and run it under its own name, they made no return.  So that, in fact, they are not accounting to the people who supply the cash or the credit for the running of the services, which might involve a very considerable loss.  I have discussed this with shareholders who are quite dissatisfied with the present position and who believe that this amendment should be inserted in the interests of the railway company and in the interests of commercial integrity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping to hear from the Senator any of the points, say, on which he had found Section 22 of this Act deficient, because I have myself adverted to some defects in the accounts to which the Senator has referred and had thought that we had provided for the future sufficiently well by what is contained in Section 22.  The Senator has referred to Section 8 of the 1927 Act. We go much further in Section 22 as we take power by regulations to prescribe the accounts to be kept by every person carrying on a passenger road service, not merely a railway company owning such a service.  We go much further in sub-section (3), because we take power to publish, as and when it seems proper, all or any returns made under the section and also statistics compiled from such returns.  I had thought that Section 22 at least enabled the Minister to get everything he wanted in the way of accounts.  I hesitate to ask the Seanad to consent to the passing of the amendment in this form, because the opening part merely says that a railway company shall keep <Col N="444" /> such accounts and make such returns as the Minister shall from time to time direct.  The amendment goes on to be quite mandatory in the second clause which says that a railway company which has done certain things shall include in its annual statement of accounts a statement of certain things. If there are shareholders dissatisfied with the way returns are published at present they can, if they are sufficiently numerous, get a change made in that.  Even if they are not sufficiently numerous to sway the directors to carry out their desires in the future, if they are a sufficiently numerous body in other respects they can certainly get regulations made which will force on the company the keeping of the accounts and they can get them from the Ministers themselves in published form.  I think Section 22 meets everything that the Senator has in mind.</P>

      <P>Section 22 depends on the type of regulation which the Minister will make.  Largely what he wants is a return showing the number of passengers carried, the number of miles run, and the receipts per passenger and so on.  These are of absolutely no use to people who have invested money, and who want a full statement of accounts.  They want to know what the expenditure in regard to the various branches of working has been.  They want to be able to see for themselves whether there has been waste or inefficiency, and so on.  The railway company is different from an ordinary bus company, particularly where it has a working agreement with, or has purchased, another company but run it in the old name.  The railway shareholder has only his railway balance sheet before him.  It is all very well to say that the shareholders should make certain demands. Hardly one in 500 shareholders turns up at the meetings.  The shareholders send their proxies to be used by the directors.  A director naturally is not going to put himself to any trouble, and he is going to use the proxies against the people who are present at the meeting if he thinks their demands are unreasonable or inconvenient.  I should like to know if the sort of <Col N="445" /> accounts the Minister proposes to ask firms to keep is the type of accounts that already he has asked them to make returns of?  He will agree that they have been merely certain statistics showing the number of passengers carried, etc.</P>

      <P>We have in mind the getting of much more information than what is ordinarily supplied to us. I do not think that the Senator should insist too much upon what was done in the past by, say, a railway-owned bus concern where the ownership was absolutely clear or less clear than it might have been, because obviously the accounts would have been kept according to the circumstances of the arrangement.  There will be no necessity for that type of arrangement in the future.  There will be a more clear-cut and direct association possible where you aim at that type of return that the Senator has in the main been thinking of.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 8:</P>
      <P>New section.  After Section 30 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;31.&mdash;(1)  If the whole of the capital of a company carrying on the business of road transport is acquired by a railway company the name of such railway company shall be exhibited upon all vehicles used by, and inserted in all notices, business letters and documents issued by such road transport company in such manner as shall reasonably indicate that the ownership of the capital of such road transport company is vested in such railway company.</P>
      <P>(2)  A company which fails to comply with the provisions of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section, and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds for every day during which such failure continues.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment may appear a bit complicated.  I do not know whether <Col N="446" /> the wording will give effect to what is required.  The effect of it is, in any case, that where a railway company owns the whole of the stocks and shares of a particular bus company, the railway company shall put its name on the buses, on its billheads and tickets and so on.  I am moving that because of the lamentable experience we have had of the present practice.  You have for instance the railway company completely owning two road transport services, one a passenger road service and the other a merchandise service, running them under their original names.  They have separate headquarters, separate officers, separate directors, and all the appendages an ordinary company has. Directors of the railway companies are appointed as directors of these companies also, some three or four of them in each particular case, and they get double fees for acting in this capacity.  One director, for instance, who acts as managing director in this little road transport company gets £1,400 a year free of income tax.  He draws his salary also as a railway director, and the same sort of thing applies throughout.  It is a lamentable exhibition of waste at a time when economy is so necessary and when railwaymen and others are being thrown out of employment on the ground of financial stringency. Worse even than the waste is the lack of coherence or co-ordination in the policy of those companies.  Needless to say, if you set up a separate concern like a road transport company, although it belongs to the railway company, it has its own officers and directors, and their one object is to make that part of the concern a success, even at the expense of the railway, which is the parent company. I gave an example of this on the last day.  An agent from one of these transport sections goes down on instructions from his manager to get a railway clerk to go out and canvass traffic from the railway that bought this road section in order to protect the railway interests.  That is going on all over the place.  Railwaymen go out and canvass traffic and get it at reasonable rates.  Then the representative of their own road section comes <Col N="447" /> along and wins it back or gets it because he offers more favourable terms.  The tendency in this Bill is to encourage railways to develop on the roads rather than on the rails&mdash;a lamentable tendency in my opinion&mdash; and to induce these companies to compete with their own parent company. We want to end that.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a service that will be economical and efficient there should be unity of policy between the railway and its road transport section.  There should be only one management, one board of directors.  Under the same management, apart from any question of unity of policy, it would at least save an enormous amount of unnecessary expense and duplication and triplication of salaries such as exist at the present time.</P>
    <P>This system is creating an immense amount of unrest throughout the railways. Because when the men have been asked to make sacrifices and to work four days a week instead of six days, and take four days' pay when they have been asked to accept dismissal and the prospect of starvation, to see one man draw two or three large sums in salaries and a man with a huge pension brought back and paid a salary has a maddening effect upon the four or five thousand men involved.  If the Minister cannot accept this particular proposal I hope he will at all events use his power to insist upon the elimination of this wasteful system that exists in regard to transport throughout the greater part of the Free State at the present time.</P>

      <P>When I hear Senator O'Farrell talking about economy I am reminded of Satan reproving sin, because of the disparity of the wages paid on the railways to those earned by the workers in primary industries.  I know he stands solid behind those wages which are, I suggest, at the root of the burden placed on the commercial community and on trade, and are at the root of the whole railway trouble.  With regard to this amendment it seems to try by a side wind to defeat the whole principle of company law.  There is power <Col N="448" /> under company law for one company to hold an interest in another.  I cannot see how it would be just to single out railway companies who wish to control bus companies for special treatment on these lines.  Moreover, I want to point out that the amendment is wholly ineffective because it says &ldquo;the whole of the capital.&rdquo;  Of course we know a railway company could control a bus company without owning the whole of the capital.  As long as it has 51 per cent. control, it can impose its conditions. I suggest that the whole of this is reactionary and defeats what is given in this Bill, and that is a return to freedom of operation in regard to road services.  It shakes off the trammels that are imposing the burden that has brought the railways to their present deplorable condition.</P>

      <P>Again I am going to raise the question of Section 12, which gives me power to attack two types of conditions to passenger licences.  This matter can be dealt with under that section.  I give the Senator this assurance: that it is the type of regulation which I would insist on in the main.  I do not want to go into the details which he has gone, but I do think it is better to have the road auxiliaries of any big company identified as such.  I am not sure it is going to lead immediately to the economies the Senator has spoken of, but it may at any rate, by a certain process of ridicule, lead away from some of the more absurd things that are happening.  I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the statement, but the statement was made to me that a trader in one town was quoted a rate by the railway company, and immediately after he was quoted that figure he was canvassed by an I.O.C. canvasser who offered a lesser rate, and within an hour or so after he was canvassed by Messrs. J. Wallis and Company, who quoted a third rate.  I do know that a handbill was issued by the I.O.C. Company in connection with Fairyhouse Races, with the slogan to people to travel by cars with the guarantee that they would not be left two miles from the course, which was a slap in the eye to the Great Southern Railways Company.  If by putting the <Col N="449" /> name of the railway company or tramway company on all vehicles owned by them it would eliminate that peculiar kind of competition by the road section then it will be all to the good. I think we would almost necessarily have to insist upon this type of thing, but circumstances, particularly at the beginning, may be a little bit difficult, and I do not want to insist too much upon it. All these things arose under peculiar circumstances.  The 1927 Act was found not to be very effective unless certain peculiar arrangements were entered into, and I think pretty nearly everything else flowed from that.  I would not like to have that amendment forced upon me as binding, particularly in the early days of the new régime that we want to establish.  Under the powers given in Section 12 I think I can deal with this matter.  It would be my intention to deal with it more or less on the lines suggested by the Senator.</P>

      <P>I saw that there was a considerable amount of legal difficulty in giving effect to what most people think is necessary.  The Minister's statement is satisfactory to the extent that he says he will not encourage a continuance of that type of administration which seemingly Senator Sir John Keane thinks is an admirable example of private enterprise.  He seems to glorify the most stupid and wasteful thing that is done, provided it is done free of State interference.  I quoted for him an example of what was done without any State interference at all, and the Senator actually seems to think it was an admirable regulation.  He then quoted the case of a railway man drawing 35/- a week as being responsible for the present state of the railways, while when I quoted a glaring example of duplication and triplication of salaries which are huge in this country he had not one word to say against them.  That sort of speech and mentality is enough to make Communists of what would be sane Christian men&mdash;this talk of economy at the expense of the workers while there is the most colossal and shameful waste on the part of the people who have the big money and the big salaries.  However, in view of <Col N="450" /> the assurance given by the Minister, I ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Part II of the Bill, of which this section is part, deals with the cessation of services on certain railway lines and the possible closing of the lines.  Most if not all of these lines were made under the authority of Parliament directly, or by statutory orders which had the approval of Parliament.  It is proposed that the Minister may make orders allowing these lines to be closed on his own initiative without seeking the approval or the sanction of the Oireachtas.  The first prompt was to put down the normal amendment dealing with orders to be laid on the Table which might be declared invalid after a certain period, and that even though such invalidity was declared any act done under the order would be valid. I think that formula would be unsatisfactory in this case, because if a line were made non-effective the act of the Oireachtas in invalidating the order at a later stage would be of no effect.  Consequently the amendment put down is to the effect that every order made by the Minister with regard to the cessation <Col N="452" /> of services shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and a motion of approval be passed by each House.  I think that is a reasonable proposition in view of the fact that services that may be closed have been ordered by Parliament, have been supported by public funds or have been approved by specific resolutions of the Parliament of the time.  If there is to be a cessation of these services it ought not to be done merely by the order of the Minister but by an order of the Minister plus the sanction of the Oireachtas.</P>

As the Bill stands the matter would be the subject of inquiry and would be settled in a judicial and responsible atmosphere, because the Minister has much more responsibility than either of the two Houses could have in a matter of this kind.  It would become a controversial and a political matter under the amendment, and for that reason I do not think the amendment is desirable.</P>

      <P>I want to point out that I have taken precautions to give myself power to hold an inquiry.  I do not say that that inquiry will always have to be held.  The phrase is: &ldquo;The Minister may, if he thinks proper so to do, cause a public inquiry in regard to the making of such order to be held.&rdquo; I said that, ordinarily speaking, I would have such an inquiry held in order to get the views of the people affected, and to have the situation clarified for them, so that they would get some idea of the respective economics of the types of transport on offer.  I agree with Senator Bagwell that after going through that process&mdash;having a local inquiry held, with a certain amount of ventilation of ideas there and a report made&mdash;if I am supposed to delay action until a resolution has been laid before the Oireachtas, and until both Houses pass resolutions approving of such order, then, undoubtedly, the delays <Col N="453" /> are going to be interminable, and I do not know that we are going to have any better situation created.  As Senator Bagwell pointed out, by discussion of these orders in either of these Houses an amount of consideration would be brought to bear upon them that would not universally arise at a public inquiry.  The responsible Minister, in these circumstances, with the information that he has obtained from the public inquiry, will have a certain amount of extra responsibility placed upon him before the making of the order.  He will have to consider all the facts, and, incidentally, although it is not a complete answer on the main merits of the amendment or in respect of anything I have said against it, it would be my intention&mdash;I would be driven to do so&mdash;to make orders with regard to certain railway areas almost immediately upon the Act coming into operation.  I am not at all sure that certain services being run at the moment are strictly in accordance with the obligations of the company.  They are the most that could be demanded in the circumstances of the time, but they do seem to me to be less than the statutory obligation.  It would be my desire, my intention, and, I think, my duty to make an order immediately establishing the existing services as I find them until such time as an inquiry can be held.  This amendment would make that impossible.  That, however, is only incidental.  I have the objection that I spoke of already to having this put in as a precise provision in the Bill. In speedily reorganising the transport system in certain areas, there will be great necessity for quick movement, and that would be impossible under the amendment.</P>

      <P>As many people are aware, the railway company are compelled, by their statutory obligations, to provide services on many of the branch lines which are uneconomic.  Some of these branch lines mean an annual loss to the railway company of from £2,000 to £3,000 a year.  The permanent way and other amenities in connection with these lines are in very bad repair and in a few years very large capital sums will have to be expended upon them.  The railway company have no alternative.  Under the Bill, the railway company cannot close down these lines unless they offer an alternative road service.  No public trading company is likely to undertake such a service, and it seems as if the unfortunate railway company would have to shoulder this burden for all time.  The burden will consist not alone of an annual loss, but of large capital sums which will have to be incurred if the railway company are to comply with the regulations of the Board of Trade or whatever body has succeeded the Board of Trade in the Saorstát.  Under these circumstances, I move the amendment.  The amendment does not really represent what I wish to happen in the matter.  We do not wish to deprive people living in these poor areas of transport facilities, but something ought to be substituted, and the unfortunate railway company ought not to be required to shoulder the whole of the burden.</P>

      <P>I oppose this amendment on the grounds that it would wipe out the trade of a number of important towns and districts of the Saorstát.  If these branch lines are not paying the railway companies at <Col N="455" /> present, they paid them for twenty or thirty years.  The lines which it is intended to close now were built and handed over to the railway companies without any cost.  During the years they worked them, they must have made some profit for the companies. It is a preposterous proposition to suggest that these lines should be closed down without giving an alternative service.  There might be a case made for asking the Government to come to the rescue and subsidise these lines.  I am sure the House would agree to a proposition of that sort, but the closing down of the lines without providing an adequate alternative service is out of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest sympathy with railway companies in a matter of this kind.  From the legislative point of view, I think they have not been fairly treated in this matter. They had those baronially guaranteed lines shoved on to them at some period. However, I do not think the amendment is one that will commend itself to the House.  Here, you have a public service being provided, and from the public point of view I think it is only reasonable that the Minister, before he gives permission to close a line should inquire as to whether an alternative service should be provided and, if he thinks such is reasonable, that he should insist on that alternative service being provided.  I cannot conceive of any district at present served by a branch line being so poor as to be unable to provide business for a small motor enterprise, which would be the alternative&mdash;possibly a sufficiently reasonable alternative&mdash;to a railway, which in many cases is much too big.  To absolve the Minister from making any inquiries in the public <Col N="456" /> interest as to whether or not there is an alternative means of transport available, is, I think, going too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, in the first place, that the section to which the amendment refers and the amendment itself should be brought into line with the facts.  It must be remembered that&mdash;if, at the moment, we are speaking of baronially guaranteed areas or of lines built out of public funds&mdash;there is an obligation on the railway company to provide services.  It was recognised that it was an onerous obligation to impose upon them in the circumstances in certain districts a continuance of the old services.  In fact, some of these have been modified&mdash; modified, I am afraid, beyond what is strictly and legally allowable.  This represents a gesture of a generous type towards the railway company in regard to the running of these services.  It allows the Minister to make an order for the modification of the services, or for the complete cesser of the services. The only sentence that Senator Parkinson, I think, objects to is this: &ldquo;The Minister shall not make such order unless he is satisfied that, having regard to the alternative transport facilities which are or will be available in a district served by the railway lines to which such order relates, adequate transport facilities will be available to the public in such districts....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all that is required.  There is no obligation and there is no insistence in this that an alternative transport service shall be provided by the railway companies.  It can be provided by anybody, even by the two-man concern that Senator Sir John Keane spoke of earlier.  It will be in the Minister's discretion to interpret this phrase, and the phrase will have to be read in relation to the circumstances of the district: what is adequate transport and what are adequate transport facilities in any area.  It may be, as Senator Bagwell will say, that a single small motor vehicle running a limited number of times in the week would be found in the circumstances of a locality to be adequate transport facilities.  There is no necessity, as I said previously, for these adequate transport facilities <Col N="457" /> of an alternative type to be provided by the railway companies.  All that is here is the obligation on the Minister to see that there is going to be something which, in his opinion, is adequate.  He will be the person who will pass judgment on what that means, and the whole thing will have to be taken in relation to a particular area of country.  Certainly there is no injustice going to be done to the railway company or to anybody else under this.  I do not think there is even likely to be the possibility of a mistake made.  I would say that there are very few areas in the country where you have conditions, due to modern motor transport, in which even on its own a limited service would pay if we think entirely of the railway. That leaves out altogether the feeder value of such a service to the main line system.  I have no doubt at all that in most instances we will be able to induce the railway company or some outside people to put on some type of transport which will be considered adequate to the needs of the people in a particular area.</P>
    <P>I think there has been too much misrepresentation with regard to this section and not enough care to study the exact terminology of it.  I hope the explanation I have given will help to reduce some of the fears that are on that point.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 11, and in Part II, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>11.&mdash;Every existing officer and servant of a company owning a railway line whose office or situation is abolished, or whose services are dispensed with on the ground that they are unnecessary or for any other reason not being on account of any <Col N="458" /> misconduct or incapacity, or whose remuneration or emoluments are reduced, or who otherwise suffers any direct pecuniary loss as a result of an order made by the Minister, under this Part of this Act, shall be entitled to be paid compensation by such company, the amount of such compensation to be determined by such company and to be subject to appeal in accordance with the rules prescribed in paragraph 5 of the Third Schedule to the Principal Act as amended by Section 4 of the Railways (Existing Officers and Servants) Act, 1926, and the said rules and paragraph 8 of the said Schedule shall apply to any such claim for compensation as if they had been incorporated herein, and references to the amalgamating company, an amalgamating company or an absorbed company shall for the purposes of this section be construed as references to the company owning a railway line by whom such officer or servant was employed immediately prior to the happening of the event giving rise to such claim for compensation.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides for the payment of compensation to railway employees who lose their employment as a result of the closing down of a railway line by order of the Minister. This amendment does not embody any new principle.  The Railway Act of 1924 contained a provision whereby men who lost their employment as a result of amalgamation were to receive compensation along certain specified lines.  A railway company is a statutory undertaking, and is only allowed to operate as a result of an Act of the Legislature.  It has certain commitments to the public, in reference to cases dealt with in this Bill.  It has definite contracts with the baronies or with the State.  All these are being enforced, or at least are being provided for.  The only exception is its contract with its employees.  A baronially guaranteed line had to give a certain minimum service.  In return for that the baronies guaranteed the dividends at a certain rate, so that whether the line closed down or not <Col N="459" /> that guarantee had to be fulfilled as far as the baronies were concerned.</P>
    <P>In order that railways might run at all, men had to be employed.  Their employment was always looked upon as being of a reasonably permanent character.  In fact, such employment was always of a permanent character. Until quite recent times unemployment amongst railway employees was unknown. But now there is a great encouragement and a great incitement, in fact, to railway companies to develop along the ordinary highways instead of on their railways.  Although they may be doing reasonably well on these branch lines, their policy seems to be to neglect them, and to develop a road service instead in the same district. They can then apply to the Minister for permission to close down the railway and show that they are giving an adequate service by road, whether that service be by bus or lorry.</P>
    <P>The public may have no objection to that, because they may be quite satisfied with the new service that the company is providing, but the unhappy railway employees have no protection at all.  The public must be provided with an alternative service, and the district generally must be served, but men who have given their life's service may take their tools and go, and there is to be no compensation for them.  In many cases this will not happen because of any great reduction in railway traffic, but because of the greater incentive to develop a road service against the railways.  I submit that if the Minister is to give permission for the closing down of a line because of the considerations I have mentioned, then he should impose on the railway company concerned the duty of giving compensation to these men or of finding alternative employment for them.</P>
    <P>The amendment does not provide for alternative employment, but if it is incorporated in the Bill the company will be able, in the great majority of cases, to find employment for them elsewhere in the railway service or in connection with the new bus or lorry services which they are running.  If there is no provision of this kind the <Col N="460" /> incentive will be to dismiss the men who have fairly long service and to take on men who can start at the bottom rung.  There will be no incentive at all to find alternative employment for them or to transfer them to other portions of the service.</P>
    <P>The compensation provisions in the Railways Act of 1921 passed for Great Britain operate indefinitely, so that any man losing his employment as a result of amalgamation continues to get his compensation up to the present day.  The compensation provisions in the Act passed here in 1924 were limited to seven years by the amending Act of 1926.  The result of that is that railwaymen going out now are not entitled and have no legal rights to compensation at all.  In this Bill a new principle is introduced. The Minister, representing the State, is given power to authorise the closing down of a railway line, and the company is given facilities to go on the road to get revenue by other means.  I think that should carry some responsibility with it, the responsibility being to pay compensation as set out in the amendment.  The amendment does not propose to give luxurious compensation because in order to get half-pay a man would need to have a minimum of twenty years' service.  In order to get two-thirds of his pay he would need to have thirty years' service.  In these matters, even though men may feel that they have a very good case, they are inclined to come to a compromise with the company rather than go before the arbitrator.  In that way the railway company may get out of it at a considerably lower figure than that suggested in the amendment as they have been doing in the case of the Railways Act, where practically all the cases were settled below the statutory figure incorporated in that Act.  I think that such a provision as I suggest would only be an act of elementary justice to the railwaymen who see their employment taken from them by the opening up of a new form of transport.  I hope the Minister will feel that it is the duty of the State to see that some compensation is given to them.</P>

      <P>This amendment is a very important one.  A very important principle underlies it and I hope to give reasons to the House why they should not adopt it.  There is a certain amount of precedent for this, as the Senator stated.  There is a precedent in the Amalgamation Act passed in Great Britain and in this country, with none of which, may I say, I was in agreement and none of which I think should ever have been passed.  The circumstances, however, in this case are somewhat different.  I do not say that the precedent justifies the amendment, because personally I do not approve of the precedent.  That is, however, only a personal point of view.  Circumstances here are somewhat different.  The Amalgamation Acts were compulsory. They compelled amalgamation of railways and automatically set up a state of affairs whereby a number of people lost their employment or were likely to lose their employment.  This Bill is not, I suggest, quite of that kind. The action is Governmental action to a certain extent, now, in that the Minister makes an order.  What has brought about the circumstances under which it has become necessary and justifiable for the Minister to make such an order?  It is the economic state of affairs whereby the railway company is not justified in carrying on a particular part of the concern because it is not paying.  It is losing money and it is bleeding the rest which is a vital necessity to the public.  What makes this thing so important is that there is a principle underlying the amendment which really and simply is this, that railway employees should remain a privileged class.  I say that with due regard to the gravity of what I am saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell has alluded to the fact that until comparatively recent years railway employment was looked upon as permanent or, in fact, was of a permanent character.  Yes, it was.  That is perfectly correct, and a very good thing it was too, and I wish that the state of affairs which existed for so many years, and that brought that about, existed to-day.  Of <Col N="462" /> course, circumstances have very much changed, and I suggest that it is not only the advent of road traffic, which is a new thing and which is a great competitor of the railways, that has brought about the necessity for closing down certain sections of the railway line, but also the demands of the railway men voiced by, among other people, the mover of the amendment. I cannot really see why one section of men in the country should be compensated because they lose their employment any more than any other section.  It is a dreadful thing for a man to lose his employment.  Do not think that I do not realise that. It is a terrible thing, and all sorts of provisions are made by the State to tide men over such a misfortune.  They cannot entirely tide them over it.  It is a dreadful calamity for a man, but I do not really see why any one section of the community should be entitled to compensation any more than any other section because of that, because, of course, such a provision could not be applied generally.  The State could not possibly afford it, and whatever is done for one section to put them in a privileged position or to compensate them for losing their employment owing to economic reasons has got to be borne by the rest of the community to the detriment of the State as a whole.  For that reason, I cannot see from the point of view of statesmanship that such action is justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is always a delight to hear Senator Bagwell.  I believe he would honestly be amazed to hear Queen Anne was dead.  He has brought into this discussion arguments against amalgamation both here and in Great Britain, but were it not that the Act of 1924 was passed there would be half a score of railways closed down at the present time.  Still he says the whole thing was a mistake. He argues further that the reason for giving compensation under the Act of 1924 was because amalgamation was compulsory.  I suggest that if there was any argument for getting out of paying compensation it might be found there, that the railways were compelled to do something which they themselves did not desire to do. <Col N="463" /> Still they were compelled to pay compensation to the men discharged; they had to do it under that Act.  In this case they are not compelled.  They are simply themselves asking for permission from the Minister to close a line, and in return for giving that permission I suggest that they should be compelled to pay compensation to the men who are being discharged.</P>
      <P>The very argument Senator Bagwell used against the amendment could be used far more effectively in the other direction.  He also brings King Charles's head into it when talking about high wages on the railways.  Is 35/- a week an exorbitant rate?  It is true, as he states, that railway work was permanent in the past, but I should not like to go back to the days when the railway milesman was paid 12/- a week, porters were paid 13/- or 14/-, and hundreds of stationmasters were paid from £1 to 25/- a week with a free house.  That probably accounted for the fact that it was permanent, together with the other consideration that there were no fixed hours of duty and no payment for overtime or Sunday duty.  To say that it is railway wages that have the railways in their present condition, as has been said hundreds of times, is a statement that has failed to impress the members of the Railway Wages Board, on which there are representatives of the trading public.  At all events, I think there is a better case here for compensation even than under the Railways Act. The amount involved will be a comparatively small sum.  It will be rendered all the smaller by the fact that the company will be able to absorb redundant members of the staff on other sections of the service or in the alternative service which they will be creating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard any argument based on what happened under amalgamation as entirely inappropriate to this discussion.  Amalgamation was really something that was brought about by direct State action.  It was also brought about because it was believed, and has since found to be a fact, that the amalgamation process <Col N="464" /> would leave the railways in a healthier condition financially than they were at the moment of amalgamation or that they were likely to be in if there was to be no amalgamation.  Arising from that and from the economies which is was thought could be effected under amalgamation, at least there was some fund out of which compensation could be paid to people whose disemployment was brought about by direct State action.  This is entirely different.  The Senator has argued that I make the Order, and the weak-analogy is drawn that it is through State compulsion.  The fact is that the Order will only be made when the facts of the situation warrant its being made.  The facts will only warrant the Order in the case in which it is found that the railway system is either obsolete or obsolescent, and where in fact the position is that there is really no work of a railway type for railway men to do.  The circumstances are therefore entirely different.</P>
      <P>The amendment of the Senator would give compensation to people who are dismissed for any reason.  Quite clearly the Railways Act of 1924, as well as the amending Act, provided that compensation would only be payable where the dismissal or the loss of employment was directly due to amalgamation. The speech made explaining the amendment before the House shows clearly that here compensation is being claimed for loss of employment or loss of employment whether or not as a result of any State action.  It is being claimed even if the reason for the loss of employment is clearly this: that there is no railway traffic to be handled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to the closing down of the railway line because the traffic does not warrant the line being kept there.  That amounts, in fact, to what I have often argued against before in the other House&mdash;the contention of the Labour Party that we should stereotype the number of railway servants and should compensate those who leave, no matter what the reason <Col N="465" /> that brings about their dismissal or their loss of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, of course, I am going to ask the House not to agree to.  We have got to recognise facts.  Senator Bagwell has deplored that facts may bring about the disemployment of certain people.  I deplore it myself.  If that is the fact, and if, contrariwise, there are going to be other people put into employment of a different type of service, the resulting situation is no worse off from the point of view of employment given.  It is different with regard to the individual who is being disemployed in any particular section.  I made a point in the Dáil.  I can make it again here&mdash;that where, in fact, the circumstances are such that a railway company decides to close down a branch-line railway service and to substitute for that a road service of its own, I would make an appeal to the railway company to see that those disemployed railwaymen would be given whatever employment there was before any new entrants, and that they should have regard to the unemployed railwaymen, but only in the circumstances where there is a branch railway line closing down and where the railway company are themselves taking on a new form of transport.  I certainly would not feel able to make that appeal to them in a case where they are closing down a branch line because the traffic does not warrant its being kept open and where they are not themselves providing an alternative form of transport.  There are certain other objections I would have to this amendment, but this is the main one. The subsidiary one which I think I will mention is that the contrast in different types of railway services, if this amendment were carried, would be most extraordinary.  If men were put out of employment because a railway company decide either to abandon or single certain parts of their main line, no compensation is payable; but if the same thing happens in a branch line by reason of stress of economic forces such as have been described, then compensation has got to be paid.  I think that is completely illogical.  At any <Col N="466" /> rate, I have spoken of the merits of the amendment in the main, and I ask the Seanad not to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to touch on the principles involved in this, especially in view of the speech of Senator Bagwell. He has argued against the very principle of compensating the workmen who are thrown out of work by action taken for the public interest. Hitherto railwaymen have been, or are said to be, a privileged class, because they are claiming compensation on being thrown out of employment, and he says it is impossible for that principle to be applied to other workmen in other industries because the State would not be able to bear the cost.  Let me draw attention to the fact that the railwaymen that would be thrown out of employment if they have served three years are not even entitled to unemployment insurance.  Therefore they are thrown out of employment penniless, without even a week's expectation of wages or money to keep their family.  Surely one has to take into account the relationships between the workmen and those who own the industry?  The Senator is quite right in saying that if this is applied to railwaymen it ought to be applied to all other workers.  I agree, and it ought to be applied to all other workers. Industries ought to be made to bear the cost of their redundant servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, as Senator Sir John Keane said a little while ago, the labourer was a chattel, or a word to that effect, that he was a commodity; well, if the commodity were a horse, there would be some kind of assurance given that the horse was going to be kept after it had lost its ability to give faithful service. I want to put it to the Senate that the principle of compensation for disemployment, when it suits either the public or the shareholders to disemploy, is a just one and founded upon a right ethic and reasonable justice.  In the days that, no doubt, the Senator looks to as being ideal, the days before the War, the days before the trades unions became effective, when, as Senator O'Farrell <Col N="467" /> pointed out, there were ten, eleven, twelve and thirteen shillings paid to adult railwaymen with families, either the public or the railway shareholders or both got the advantage of this sweated labour of their workmen.  The company, as an organisation, got the advantage, and the company to-day has the right to bear some of the responsibilities of the services of those whom they employed and who through their service paid the dividends that were realised by the company.  The principle that is involved in the amendment is one that this House ought to assent to, and if the time comes when we ask the House to apply it to other industries, again the House ought to assent.  The principle is that the workman who gives his life to a particular service has a right to be considered in the days when his labour is passed, or when, to suit the shareholders or the public, the services of that man are no longer required.  We take a man working for twenty, thirty or thirty-five years, and say we are closing down in the public interest or we are closing down in the shareholders' interest.  You can go; we have no further responsibility for you.  That is the position the Senator and, if I might say so, the Minister in the Bill ask the House to assent to.  The amendment puts the contrary proposition.  It asks the House to see that the railway company, having employed men for years and taking all they could get out of them, have no right when in their declining years they are being deposed for the benefit of the shareholders or the public, as the case may be, to get out of their responsibilities.</P>

      <P>With reference to the last remark, I would like to say that the length of service would determine <Col N="468" /> the amount of compensation that would be paid.  A man with short service would have little compensation or practically nothing to get.  I would like to call the attention of the House to the difference in the treatment that it is proposed to be meted out to the actual people who carried on the work of the railways and the Board of Directors.  The people who have given a long service on these branch lines, many of them at considerably less wages than should have been paid to them, are to be dispensed with and thrown on the rates.  In consequence of the reduction of the services it is contemplated in the Bill that there ought to be a reduction of directors, but what do we find?  We find that the number of directors is to be reduced when they die or resign, notwithstanding the fact that most of these people have six, seven or eight directorships as well.  The same set of people who are directors of the Great Southern Railways and who receive handsome remuneration as directors, are directors of the I.O.C., for which they get remuneration, and they are also directors of John Wallis and Co., which is a kindred company, and for which they also receive their fees.  It is nearly time that this class inequality was wiped out.  This Bill is protecting the rights of the directors; they are not to be removed or to lose their jobs notwithstanding the fact that some of them have five or six other jobs, with handsome remuneration for the whole of them. Their number is to be reduced only when they die or resign, but the unfortunate stationmaster who is in receipt of 24/- or 25/- a week with a small house, the milesman, the linesman or the platform porter, who may have given thirty or thirty-five years' service are to be thrown on the rates.  As Senator Johnson pointed out, they will not even get unemployment benefit because the railway company were exempted from stamping cards.  The ratepayers have got to keep them after the long and faithful service given by these people.</P>

    <P>Amendment lost.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 to 15 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 16.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGriffith" hpid="Sir John Griffith Sir John Griffith">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Griffith</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 16 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>16.&mdash;Notwithstanding anything contained in any Act or in any Statutory Order a company owning a railway to which the Principal Act applies shall be entitled for all services rendered in respect of the conveyance of passengers or passengers' luggage or merchandise upon such railway to make and receive such fares rates or charges as may be agreed upon between the said Company and the person or persons liable to pay the same, provided that such fares rates or charges do not exceed the amount of the Standard Charges for the time being in force and applicable to the conveyance of such passengers or passengers' luggage or merchandise.</P>
      <P>Provided that the provisions of this section shall not extend so as to discharge such a company from the operation of sub-section (2) of Section 30 of the Principal Act or of any section contained in any Private Act and expressed to be made for the protection of any port, town or city.</P>
      <P>The first part of the section confers on railway companies full freedom to vary rates for the carriage of merchandise below the standard maximum rates, and thereby be placed on an equal footing in respect to merchandise carried on the roads.  The second part of the section confirms the clause in the Act of 1924 for the protection of ports.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that my original intention was to ask the Senate to postpone the further consideration of these Bills until after the General Election so as to remove them from political controversy.  I consider that the problems involved are of national importance, and should, therefore, be dealt with as non-Party measures.</P>
      <P>However, on consulting the highest authorities on the subject, I was told that probably my motion would be ruled out of order as the Second Reading had been passed unopposed by the Seanad.  I am, therefore, at the request of the Great Southern Railways, submitting this amendment to the Seanad.  It is not my drafting; it was drafted by a skilled exponent of that class of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the amendment is to place the transport of traffic by rail under identical conditions with traffic carried on roads.  The Bill proposes to place the railway companies on a footing of equality on roads with any other road carriers; <Col N="471" /> that is, that they can adopt competitive rates on their road services, and actually act as competitors to their own traffic on their own lines of railway, which are controlled by standard rates.</P>
    <P>My object in moving this amendment is to give an opportunity for full and free discussion on this important, but much misunderstood problem.</P>
    <P>My justification for bringing this matter forward is the state of the finances of the railways.  Probably I have been selected by the Great Southern Railways because I am a shareholder.  Let us look at the present value of our railway property. We have on several occasions heard it spoken of as representing £26,000,000. Part of that is Debenture Stock&mdash; £8,760,000.  The rest of it is composed of Preference and Ordinary Stock amounting to over £17,000,000.  Our Debenture Stock this month represents £4,000,000.  Our £17,000,000 of varying stocks are down to £3,400,000.  The total of £26,000,000 is represented now by something below £7,500,000.</P>
    <P>The present method of fixing standard rates on rails for goods is defended as a necessary protection against &ldquo;undue preference.&rdquo;  No such restrictions are imposed on carriers by road.  It has been suggested, in defence of this, that if a trader is aggrieved by this, he can obtain a motor lorry of his own.  The same argument might be used in connection with what is called &ldquo;undue preference&rdquo; by a railway company&mdash;the trader can get his own motor or avail himself of competitive rates by road.</P>
    <P>The inevitable result of the proposed legislation and fettering of the railway companies in fixing their rates below a standard maximum must be to drive merchandise from the rails on to the road.  It is perfectly obvious that it will always be possible for the road carrier to quote a lower rate than the authorised rate which the railway company must charge.  The railway rates are published.</P>
    <P>The idea of co-ordination or cooperation of rail and road traffic was that the railways should be the principal <Col N="472" /> agencies for the transport of merchandise, and that the road services should act as feeders to the railways for all long-distance traffic.  The proposed arrangements in regard to rates and charges must result in the railway companies having to carry merchandise to its destination by road instead of by rail, in consequence of having to charge a higher rate on the rails than on the roads.  This may be of some advantage to traders, but not to the proprietors of the railways or to those who have to maintain the roads.  Such a policy must lead to the abandonment of railways unless they are taken over as a charge to the State, or, in other words, nationalised.</P>
    <P>To combine road and rail transport efficiently, much thought and ingenuity has been expended on the design of road and rail trucks, waggons or carriages, sometimes known as &ldquo;convertible vehicles,&rdquo; for use on railways and roads (that would be by a slight change in the tyres) and the same car or truck would be available either for rail or road.  To the merchant the direct delivery of produce or materials from farm to market, from factory to store or from door to door, is the ideal. It reduces cost in transhipments, in handling and in injury to goods.  This is one of the special attractions of transport by road lorries, but with the development of road-rail vehicles this advantage should be shared by the railways.</P>
    <P>To summarise the case on behalf of the railway companies, they have standard rates fixed by the Tribunal under a rigid classification scheme, and if they attempt to vary these rates to meet exceptional cases they must justify their action, obtain the sanction of the Tribunal, and publish the rate. The railways are hampered in their goods traffic dealings and conveyance by harassing regulations not one of which has been relaxed.  If what is called &ldquo;undue preference&rdquo; is allowable on the roads, and if the road carriers can charge what they like and go where and when they like, absolutely free as regards the wages they pay and the hours their employees serve, how can the railways survive against such unfair <Col N="473" /> conditions?  What is the remedy? Relieve them of obligations imposed by standard rates and charges, subject only to maximum rates to be fixed for public protection against overcharge and thus be placed on a level with road competitors.</P>
    <P>The Senate should, I think, resent the way in which it has been treated by having Bills of first-class importance submitted to them late in the Session, with threats.  I think this is the worst case which has come under my notice. The capital of the shareholders representing millions of pounds is threatened with confiscation, and Bills supposed to give relief are to be hustled through without amendment. It is remarkable that during the discussions on these Bills no suggestions have been made that the traffic will increase, or that any of the proposals in the Bill will increase the earning power of the railways, or benefit the shareholders in any respect.  It appears that the opposite will be the case.  The whole object of the proposals appears to be to transfer the traffic from the rails to the road, and if to meet this, railways have to place a fleet of lorries on the road, new capital will be wanted for the purpose, and the value of the existing capital of the railways must depreciate.</P>
    <P>There seems a general impression that in the interests of the country, railways must be maintained for main line traffic, but with a vanishing revenue it is quite clear that they cannot be maintained by the companies. The inevitable result must be that the State will have to intervene with subsidies leading to final nationalisation.  The one and only way to save the situation is to adopt the amendment which I have moved. By this means the railways will be able to recover much of their traffic and carry it much more expeditiously and safely than could possibly be done on the roads.  At the same time inordinate expenditure in the maintenance of our roads will be reduced.</P>
    <P>I fancy but few Senators remember the intense controversy which raged on &ldquo;undue preference&rdquo; and &ldquo;preferential rates&rdquo; in the eighties <Col N="474" /> and the nineties of the last century accompanied by inquiries, commissions, committees and legislation. The maximum charges permitted to railways were laid down in a series of Rates and Charges Confirmation Acts of Parliament passed in the Sessions of 1891 and 1892.  These were necessary on account of the monoply of transport exercised by the railways at the time.  No such monoply exists now, competition by road having put an end to railway monoply, and there can be no reason for not allowing railways to compete with the roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I must oppose this amendment.  If carried it would give the railways, in my view, the right to differentiate in the matter of rates.  Almost invariably the rates would be in favour of the large trader rather than the small trader.  Not only would they differentiate as between trader and trader, but in some classes of business they might divert traffic from the most natural ports and routes.  Long before any amalgamations were brought about I frequently had need to get goods from London to Cork.  Both from the point of view of convenience and preference my firm was anxious to get the goods via Fishguard direct by steamer to Cork.  When the Great Western opened at Rosslare, notwithstanding specific instructions, goods were sent by Fishguard and Rosslare. If the amendment proposed by Senator Griffith is passed I can see goods being diverted at the option of the railway company through ports which are not the most convenient to the general public.  I ask the Seanad to bear in mind that an Act called the Railway (Directorate) Act was passed in 1924 and statutorily it puts the representative of the L.M.S. on the Board of the Great Southern Railways Company.  I opposed that provision very strongly at the time, but it was passed into law.  I need hardly say it is expecting too much of human nature to assume that a nominee of the L.M.S. is put on the Board of the Great Southern Railways Company without some advantage, consciously or unconsciously, accruing to that railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> The railways exist to cope with traffic and it is to the advantage of the products of the country that the railways exist.  The railways have no special virtue <i>per se.</i>  There are very few competitive avenues in freights.  The L.M.S. combines a number of companies including the old London North Western.  There were also three competitive lines, the Lancashire, Yorkshire and Cheshire railways.  All those systems became unified, and now there is no competition in that area.  When you come to send traffic to Birmingham or London, if there are to be special advantages, and they may creep in through this amendment, by bringing the goods via Holyhead on the L.M.S. you will gradually choke up and atrophy the Great Western Railway through Fishguard, Cardiff and Bristol. That is very important.  While it is advisable to do all that is reasonably possible, and this Bill does a good deal that is reasonably possible, to promote the rehabilitation of the railways, it should not be done at the expense of the agricultural producer, and agricultural produce is what is largely carried in this country.  I shall give one figure. Notwithstanding the little bit of competition we have, the freight on butter per ton, which pre-war was 30/- is now 58/10.  Close up one avenue and it will not remain long at 58/10.  The advantage that road traffic has can now be shared by the railways if they undertake the duty of carriers and, as the Minister said, divest themselves of the railway mind.  One great advantage is that goods are taken from door to door instead of being sent to a station and then carried by rail, and picked up again and carried to their destination. In addition to that, as various railway developments went on, and railways sought Parliamentary sanction for these developments, when they went before Parliament they had to make their case or, as it is technically called; prove the preamble, and either by compromise, or the decision of the Committee before which these matters were threshed out, various provisos were put in safeguarding the interests of certain ports and districts.  These applied practically to the very few ports we have.  In the short time at <Col N="476" /> my disposal, I was only able to get some of these, which dealt with the port of Cork.  In the Fishguard and Rosslare Act, 1898, Section 74, a provision is inserted safeguarding the rights, I think, of Wexford and Cork. Section 35 of the Great Southern and Western Railway (Amalgamation) Act, 1900, contains a provision inserted as a compromise safeguarding certain ports&mdash;both Cork and Limerick I think. Section 30 of the Railways Act, 1924, also safeguards certain interests with regard to certain ports.  What is true of Cork is equally true of the few ports we have, although I have not the details here.  I ask the House not to do anything which would permit the railway companies to act in such a way as will be prejudicial to those interests which were safeguarded after careful and exhaustive examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the amendment on the same grounds as Senator Dowdall, that it would divert traffic from its natural route.  Notwithstanding the protection which the public have at present as to the diversion of traffic, we have experience of its being practised in many cases to the detriment of Galway, Limerick and Ballina.  I shall give an instance. Some time ago the cattle trade decided to send live stock through the port of Galway and approached the G.S.R. Superintendent for a special train from Athenry fair to Galway, but we were refused any facilities to send cattle to Galway.  The cattle trade decided to walk the cattle to Galway in order to create competition, but when they got to Galway the colleagues of Senators Johnson and O'Farrell there went on strike.  That shows that there is more than the railway and the shipping combine&mdash; that they are all combining to close these small ports.  They are all in the swim in doing that.  Something the same occurred in Limerick.  If, with the restrictions which are on the railway companies at present, they give preferential treatment in this way, I am very doubtful, notwithstanding what Senator Sir John Griffith said, about this portion of his amendment protecting the ports.  I would be very loth to give any further <Col N="477" /> facilities to the railway companies which might injure these ports.  The railway companies have done all they can to close these western ports.  Consequently they would prevent the cattle trade from having any competitive routes and, eventually, if they have their way, their idea will be to close all ports except the ports worked by the combine&mdash;Dublin, Cork, and possibly Drogheda.  For that reason I hope the House will not accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Counihan referred to the closing down of a port. I did not hear him very well, but I think he talked of closing it down by a strike.  The men took in that case the advice of Senator Wilson and Senator Sir John Keane and acted industrially instead of depending on legislation. This amendment is exceedingly difficult to vote for.  At the same time, it has to be admitted that it is a logical development of the present state of affairs and of this very Bill.  What is the use of talking of controlling traffic on the rails?  Supposing you are controlling a certain line of railway, may be thirty, forty or fifty miles long.  You control the rates on that. The Railway Tribunal fixes the classification of rates and everything else.  The Minister may make an order closing down that line, and the traffic, which previously went over the rails and was controlled, goes by lorry and bus, and forthwith all the control is lost.  The natural tendency at present, the tendency of the Government by its legislation, and the tendency of the general public, is to get traffic carried by road.  A time will come when probably three-fourths of the traffic will go by road and one-fourth by rail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The railways must be kept up for livestock and heavy goods only.  I thought I answered that on Second Reading.  In any case, if three-fourths of the traffic goes to the roads, the railway companies can carry it and just quote whatever they like.  They can make separate contracts in regard to livestock and <Col N="478" /> minerals and ordinary merchandise. The Minister, the State, or anyone else, has nothing to say to it.  What on earth is the use of controlling the remaining one-fourth if the railways still continue to run, and to allow the remainder to go absolutely uncontrolled? Suppose there is a big building scheme being carried out in some big town and a lot of material has to be conveyed there.  Some private contractors can come along and offer to carry it at a certain rate.  The railway companies can compete with their own lorries and offer to carry it at a cheaper rate.  They dare not carry it by rail at a cheaper rate, if that rate is more than 40 per cent. below the figure fixed by the Railway Tribunal.  Where is the logic in that sort of arrangement?  The railway companies cannot even carry it by lorry to a railway station, put it on a train, take it from the station at the other end, and deliver it on the spot because the rates on the railway section will be such as to raise the total rate above the figure quoted by their competitors. In this case you are not asking for the protection of the public against high rates, but you are asking for the protection of the public against low rates, against what are called differential rates.  You allow differential rates as long as the company goes on the road.  It can go on the road and do what it likes, but if it goes on the rail you must control it. What is the idea of that?  Is it simply that this country is fed-up with railways and wants to encourage road traffic instead?  That is the only logical conclusion.  Senator Dowdall talked about railways sending traffic in direct violation of the instructions issued.  That is a very rare occurrence.  The Senator has a perfect right to route his own traffic and the railway company dare not send it by any other route.</P>

      <P>The Senator had a claim against the company in that respect.  That is an exception.  A canvasser comes to the Senator and <Col N="479" /> asks him will he route traffic by a certain route.  He signs the route order and it is only when that is signed that it is sent other than by the natural route.  On the sea, you have no control of shipping rates.  A foreign company&mdash;Coast Lines Ltd.&mdash; is absolutely ruining the G.S.R. down south.  It is supported by people who are supposed to be very patriotic. It is supported by the method of charging and so on that they indulge in.  They are encouraged in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the shipping company does it.  The railway company cannot.  The Senator said the railway companies have no special virtue <i>per se.</i>  Of course not.  Then why treat them differently from all other forms of transport?  If the railways had a monopoly, and were the only people allowed to carry goods, then by all means control them.  I have always been in favour of that, so that one class of trader could not get preference against another, and so that the big trader must not get undue preference against the smaller, although bulk traffic must get some preference.  It is essential to business for bulk traffic to be carried cheaper.  The Senator would probably do the same in his own trade.  Talk about competition!  Competition is fair; it is the life of trade. Senator Sir John Keane and others want free play for individual enterprise; nevertheless they will not allow them to compete except on the roads.  One absolutely necessary development of that will be that the railway companies will put all the capital that they can possibly amass into the purchase of road motor vehicles.  And all these vehicles will have to be imported.  They will put their capital on the roads in order to beat their competitors.  Having invested all that capital on that kind of trade they cannot very well go back again to the railways.  The railways will have to get something on the roads for the capital they invested. You are going to take away eventually practically the whole of the traffic now <Col N="480" /> controlled on the rails, and put it on the roads and say: &ldquo;We cannot control it, and will have to let it go on as it is.&rdquo;  I believe in the interest of national credit, and in the interest of those who invested their money in railways, and in that way made a great contribution to the progress of civilisation and prosperity, and in the interest of an efficient form of transport, if the railways are to continue they should be given the same free play as they get if they go on the roads.  I say, in virtue of the free play on the roads and control on the railways, in future the tendency will be to drive all on to the roads, which will be unable to bear the traffic.  The amendment removes the control of the Railway Tribunal altogether.</P>

      <P>The Railway Tribunal.  It is not for me to explain the amendment, I am not moving it, but it gives free play in regard to the charges, and allows them to make separate contracts, just as we are allowing the transport companies, including the railway companies, to do on the roads.  There is nothing illogical in that.  It is a logical development. We only turn this down because we believe we should control whatever traffic goes by rail.  But if the whole went by road we would not control it.  Is not that a ridiculous position for the State to be in?  The Minister says he cannot control merchandise traffic on the roads, but he will control every ton of traffic while it goes on steel rails and is drawn by a locomotive.  That is the position in which we are placed.  And it is perfectly ridiculous, and is going to have results which are not going to be in the interests of transport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to road transport as shown by Senator O'Farrell is not going to be so ridiculous as he would lead the Seanad to <Col N="481" /> believe.  On the roads the small man is able to compete with the railway company or any other company.  If the price charged on the road is too high you can get a lorry cheaply and compete yourself.  Those conditions do not apply to the railways.  There is always the opposition of the public on the roads against any company.  It is not illogical to allow the companies free play on the roads, because they will be controlled by competitors and those who want traffic carried on the roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a curious fact, that although 40 per cent. is allowed by law to be taken off the standard rates by the railways, still it is said these rates are so high you cannot compete? It shows your rates hitherto have been up in the moon, far and away from anything relating to conditions in the country, and that is the reason the roads are used now mainly for traffic. We know perfectly well why the roads are being used.  Everyone who has been dealing with railways, if they can possibly get their traffic sent in any other way, will take it away from the railways.  So long as they had a monopoly they carried on, but now there is a way out.  I have no objection to a condition of things by which the railway companies can have free play on the roads just as any other persons. But that is all they are entitled to.  It is not illogical to do that.  But it is illogical when they have a monopoly to give them a right to charge a rate which even when 40 per cent. reduced is still too high for the traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment has my sympathy, but whether it is going to get my vote is another matter.  It is true that railways are under obligations in the matter of quoting rates which arise out of a time when they were a monopoly in inland transport. These obligations are now being continued although the monopoly has disappeared.  That seems to be on the face of it illogical.  Lorry owners <Col N="482" /> are free from all such obligations; they can do as they like.  The argument that you must retain this control because preferential treatment will be given to certain ports to the detriment of others does not weigh with me very much because of the last part of the amendment, which specially provides for them.  When you come to look closely into it I do not think there is so much in it as to make a great deal of difference, or that it will be an advantage to the railway companies.  I do not know of my own knowledge because I am no longer in railway life, and I am now perhaps a little out of date, but I accept the information given in this House, which was never contradicted, that railway companies could, without going to the Railway Tribunal, quote rates 40 per cent. below the standard. Further they could go very much lower and come subsequently to the Railway Tribunal for sanction which, we are informed, has never been refused.  If that is the case in fact they have a good deal of freedom.  I see the Minister's point that it is desirable that he should have some record of what is done in the matter of rates because, after all, we are a very long way from the state of affairs alluded to by Senator O'Farrell&mdash; three-fourths of the traffic of the country being carried on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are a long way from that.  A great deal of traffic is carried by rail. An overwhelming amount of a certain class of traffic is carried by rail.  It is, therefore, reasonable that the Minister should know what he is going on.  He would not know if the amendment was carried.  The position seems somewhat anomalous.  A railway company which has no longer got a monopoly is under obligations that lorry owners are not under.  Taking the situation which has to be dealt with as a whole, I would like to know who could devise a Railway Bill which would not have some anomalies when dealing with so complicated and so difficult a problem as is dealt with by this Bill.  As I said on the Second Reading, I think this Bill is a very good attempt to deal with a very <Col N="483" /> difficult situation.  I think it should be taken in conjunction with other Bills, and that it will be a very great help to the railways to get back some measure of prosperity.  I do not agree with the views expressed by the mover of the amendment, that this Bill is so bad that it would be desirable to redraft it or to have some other Bill brought in.  Speaking as a humble individual with such knowledge of this subject as I possess, which is certainly not expert in every direction, I am convinced that this Bill, taken with the other Bills, is a help.  I would not like to see it deferred or held up by any action of this House.  I think that would be a great mistake.  I cannot see my way to support the amendment for these two reasons.</P>

      <P>While I would be very impressed by any statement made by Senator Sir John Griffith I share his views when I say that I think that if possible it would be better to postpone this Bill until after the election, when there would be more time to deal with it.  No matter what conclusion is come to in relation to the present legislation, I think it will have to be amended later.  We are not yet at the end of the traffic competition between rail and road.  I see cattle coming to the Dublin market every week in increased numbers and from greater distances by road.  I know that arrangements have been made by a certain organisation of farmers for the safe loading of their cattle on lorries.  I would be very glad to see some consideration given to the railway system, because the railways are the iron roads of commerce and are the principal carriers for the staple industry of this country.  There were 104 wagons of stock for shipment, particularly store cattle, carried from Roscrea fair last Monday.  There is no such thing as competition with the railway for 1,000 cattle which were shipped that day to England and Scotland. The importance of the railway service to the staple industry cannot be ignored.  The railways must be kept up either by some kind of subsidies or under Government control. <Col N="484" /> The question of preventing competition by road is impracticable.  It is unreasonable to expect farmers not to use their own lorries.  As another Senator mentioned, a farmer can run his sheep into market by lorry and can effect considerable economy as compared with railway costs.  For a number of years the rate for stock from Roscrea to Dublin was £2 1s. 3d. a wagon, while the rate since the war is £4 5s. 6d., over 100 per cent. of an increase.  When people find that they can get their cattle and sheep carried conveniently by road they will avail of the road service.  At present a service is running from Birr by lorry, and it is a most efficient service.  People who send sheep to the market consider it much more economical to do so by lorry, while the appearance of the stock is better.  It is a very tall order to have final legislation in this matter. I think it is possible that there will be a rearrangement of the two systems of traffic, and that that will be in the interests of the country.  I was on a deputation that went to London thirty years ago with regard to the maximum rates on the railways.  At that time such a thing as a road transport service was undreamt of.  The deputation went because the railway people had not a great deal of sympathy with their interests.  The railways had a monopoly, and the deputation went with a view to preventing their exceeding the maximum rates.  Sir Courtenay Boyle, who was head of the Board of Trade at the time, was very sympathetic with the people representing the cattle trade.  I happen to be a small railway shareholder, and I am interested in seeing the traffic increase.  The position will have to be dealt with in some generous way, while at the same time being fair to everyone.  Unfortunately the prices for stock have taken a very bad turn in recent years, so that farmers are very interested in economising in every possible way.  Any saving that they can effect in the transport of stock will be taken advantage of.</P>

      <P>When I saw the condition into which the railways got I was inclined first to blame the directors.  There were a great many of <Col N="485" /> them, and perhaps one would be inclined to imagine that under the long Government control to which they were subject their minds were running in a single track.  The railway at Blessington failed as a steel railway, but seems to be quite successful by the adoption of a small 25 h.p. Ford motor.  It carries about 40 people by taking advantage of the smoothness of the line.  This is not a very complicated part of the railway question.  We can get a clear example as to what would happen if the railways exerted themselves, adopted modern discoveries and progressed on up-to-date lines.  For instance, if they were to adopt such a thing as the Michelin train that runs in France, a train that takes advantage of the smooth rail surface to use pneumatic tyres, and which is capable of greater speed, great carrying capacity and great braking capacity on account of the grip of the rubber, we would get a picture such as this.  Suppose you put a five ton lorry on the railway at the Broadstone with pneumatic tyres, and if necessary with a modern 25 h.p. engine.  That could run to Galway&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keeping to the amendment, and the suggestion that Senator Sir John Griffith made.  I do not know whether Senator Sir John Keane is a railway director or not.  He may have got into the single-track way of looking at things.  I was giving an example of how an anomaly arises from the limitation of charge when a vehicle is on the rail and when it is free while on the road.  If you put a 5 ton wagon, fitted with a 25 h.p. engine on rail at the Broadstone and take it off at Galway and make it run round to every house&mdash;which could easily be done by the adoption of the patent mentioned by Senator Sir John Griffith &mdash;that wagon is controlled when on the rail, and there has to be a man counting up the distance it ran when <Col N="486" /> on the rail, while on the road it has free powers.  The amendment allows the railway company scope in that direction, and I would be strongly inclined to vote for it unless the Minister can assure us that in the event of the railway companies becoming modern-minded and adopting the methods that railway companies in other countries have adopted to save themselves, he would not apply control to such a vehicle as that.</P>
      <P>As regards the interests of the ports, it might be no harm to point out that &ldquo;the interests of the ports&rdquo; is merely a paraphrase of &ldquo;the interests of foreign shipping companies.&rdquo;  It is the interests of English shipping companies that are being served at the expense of an Irish company.  I will support the amendment because it holds open the hope that modern invention will give the railways a chance.  Even if they had a completely free hand, the railways will have to compete against the motor.  They have to compete against the door-to-door service in a very small area.  This country is too small for a successful railway.  It is far too small for a controlled railway. It is perfectly obvious that the railway will have to be an amphibious thing. It will have to give a better road service and it will have to adopt the pneumatic tyre on rail.  By so doing, it will take away the biggest of all anomalies&mdash;the anomaly of a company which has to pay its own shareholders competing with a system which is on the charges&mdash;on the rates.  This system pays no rates.  It has no charges for upkeep and it has not even to guarantee a constant service.  Until the other Bill is through, that will be the case.  That competition is unchecked and it is subsidised by the public as against a private system like the railways.  Senator Sir John Griffith's amendment, inasmuch as it gives scope for the amphibious vehicle, will deserve such support as I hope it will get.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer for a moment to the reference made by the last Senator to the interests of the ports being the interest of foreign shipping companies.  That was largely <Col N="487" /> true until recently.  There is an independent service at present running out of Dublin and I may tell the Minister that, within a few months, there will be an independent service running out of Cork.  That will do away with the foreign monopoly to which the Senator referred.</P>

      <P>The House will take upon itself a great responsibility if it rejects this amendment.  We have got to weigh the balance of the advantages according to the argument. Speaking as a layman, the arguments I have heard are on the side of the amendment.  Senator Bagwell, with his special knowledge, was lukewarm. If the arguments against the amendment were strong, he would have been in a position effectively to voice them. It appears the only thing you are going to protect under the existing state of affairs are certain vested interests. These small traders can have recourse to the road whenever they like.  Reference has been made to the interests of the ports.  I think these are largely imaginary.  I do not think the railway companies have any sinister designs in that respect.  They merely want to save themselves.  When a responsible corporation, with a capital of £26,000,000, come along, say they want to save themselves, and believe&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;that this is vital to the continuance of their operations, public feeling being as strong as it is, we would take a great responsibility in turning this amendment down on the arguments we have heard so far.  Unfortunately, as Senator Sir John Griffith said, there is an atmosphere of unreality about this whole debate.  I think that is a very sad feature of the whole thing.  This measure has been considered under totally unreal conditions.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator O'Farrell in his contention that the logical development of the statement by the Minister that he is not prepared to apply any control to the road transport of merchandise is the amendment moved by Senator Sir John Griffith. There is, however, a point of view which has not yet found expression. <Col N="488" /> A Bill passed with this amendment will leave the railway shareholders in a position to appoint a particular type of director from a particular district. You may have the well-known organising ability of the merchants of Cork used to collar the directorate of the Great Southern Railways Company. They could arrange affairs in such a way as to give a preference to Cork over such areas as Dublin, Galway, Limerick, or any other part of the country.  A position similar to that may arise if there is no control at all.  Everybody will admit that there were a variety of reasons for attaching the control in the original statutes.  Only some of them have changed.  There is still the possibility, under the position that would be created by Senator Sir John Griffith's amendment, of the kind of thing that he, above all, knows developed in America.  You may have a maximum rate fixed, but if you have no control in regard to preferences you will be allowing a particular group of proprietors to get hold of the shares and use the railway companies to subserve an entirely different interest, not a railway interest at all.  That is a position you have to guard against by applying the kind of check which the law at present provides and which would be removed by the adoption of the amendment.  That point of view has to be taken into account, and will prevent me and, I believe, all my colleagues from voting for the amendment, notwithstanding the contention put forward by Senator O'Farrell, that it is the logical development of the attitude of the Minister in explaining the purposes he has in mind in promoting the Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Gogarty said that the putting on of restrictions would merely be preserving the ports for foreign shipping companies.  That is not the case, because the ports that are adversely hit up to the present are those of Galway, Limerick, and possibly Sligo.  These are the only ports in the country which are run by Irish shipping companies.  The danger is that the combine may step in and subsidise the railway companies to give rates very much lower than the <Col N="489" /> 40 per cent. which they are allowed to give under the Act so as to take away traffic from these ports and divert it to Dublin until they have those companies in such a state that they will have to close down.  Senator Gogarty was under a misapprehension in making the statement that he did.</P>

There has been no explanation of the contention that the removal of the restrictions and the allowing of preferential rates will not have the effect of enabling the big combine to destroy the commerce of the ports of Limerick and Galway.  That contention has been very well put by some Senators.  So far as I know, it has not been answered.  Unless it is answered I am going to vote against the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Gogarty's line of argument was of the type that if I were a director I should not feel complimented by having it addressed to me even with the amendment carried. I stress that because on the last occasion this was discussed there were thirteen speakers.  Nine spoke in favour of the Bill, two did not identify their attitude very much, and two <Col N="490" /> spoke against it for different reasons&mdash; Senator Sir John Griffith for much the same reason that he gave to-day, and Senator O'Farrell for other reasons. Yet I found the debate described in the newspapers next day as that I was at a loss to answer my critics, with the impression created that the Bill had been very badly received.  That was a complete misrepresentation of a most deliberate type of what happened here. By reason of that misrepresentation quite an amount of hubbub has been created, the result of which we find in the single amendment put down to-day.</P>
      <P>Again, I want to refer to something that happened outside, because I think this thing should be ventilated.  Certain people who feel aggrieved over this have met and passed a resolution. In the course of passing the resolution they complained that they did not know what I meant about certain things.  I am sorry that is the case, but it is not my fault.  When I heard that that meeting was going to be called I asked leave to meet the shareholders, so as to put before them what was in the Bill.  They adopted a different policy, saying that they preferred not to avail of my offer until after their meeting was held&mdash;that is, until after they had passed the resolutions. That was not a very helpful course, however discreet it may have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told of political controversy about this.  I never had a Bill about which there was less Party politics than this special measure.  Two Labour Senators spoke on the Second Reading of the Bill, and expressed rather different points of view. Senator O'Farrell expressed himself as being against it from one angle, and from Senator Johnson I found no hint of disagreement except on one point which he brought up again to-day in one of his amendments.  Two Fianna Fáil Senators spoke.  One expressed himself in the most unequivocal fashion as in favour of the measure and the other approved, I think, by inference.  I found no politics brought into this.  I have not found anything so free from ordinary political controversy as these two transport measures.  Therefore, I do not understand the use of the phrase <Col N="491" /> to-day &ldquo;that it is a pity we cannot have it free from political controversy.&rdquo; I do not know where it exists.  I think if there was a straight vote taken on any point urged on the Second Reading in relation to the particular matter we are discussing&mdash; those handicaps upon the railway company&mdash;there would hardly have been found a seconder for such an amendment, and at most there would not have been more than three people voting and the vote would not have been a Party one.  There is no political controversy about the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Griffith told us frankly that he was putting forward this clause at the request of the Great Southern Railways Company.  I would like to hear from the Senator now, or later, whether the arguments he has used are his own or the arguments of the Great Southern Railways Company, because they are certainly not the arguments that have been used to me by the Great Southern Railways Company.</P>

      <P>I am going to show that it is rather a peculiar thing to have arguments put forward here which, in the course of many discussions I had with the railway company, were not put forward to enable me to know what was the true situation so that I could mould legislation accordingly.  The Senator has talked of the many handicaps.  I have heard the phrase &ldquo;hampering regulations which affect the railway company, not one of which is relieved by the Bill.&rdquo; I asked before when that phrase was going to be used that I should have some enumeration of the hampering regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator referred to what he describes as this system of controlled rates and the wages policy.  It is noticeable that no amendment has been put forward in regard to the Wages Board to take it away.  Apparently it was not thought <Col N="492" /> an advisable amendment to put down that the Irish Railway Wages Board should be done away with, and that we should be left with some other type of machinery for negotiation.  The sole thing concentrated on is the matter of controlled rates.  A great deal of misunderstanding has certainly arisen about this point.  Senator Sir John Griffith said that the tendency of the Bill is to divert traffic to the roads, and in that point of view he was joined by Senator O'Farrell.  That is not my object or aim in the Bill, and I do not see it happening.  That has not been the result of this type of arrangement when made elsewhere.  It has had the advantage of diverting a great deal more traffic back to the railway companies, the railway company in the new circumstances being a real transport agency having both road and rail services.  But it is by no means the intention, nor do I believe it will have the effect, to drive traffic on to the roads.  There is a phrase used in that connection that the diversion of traffic to the roads will not be to the advantage of those who maintain the roads. Senator Gogarty talked about road services which pay no rates.  Our policy on that has been explained over and over again.  The policy aimed at and so far effected has been to charge those who use the roads a sufficient sum in the way of taxation, licences and everything else to pay for their maintenance.  If that has not been achieved then taxation can be put up. That is certainly the aim, and I think it has had that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do these hampering regulations amount to?  I want to get to the net point and to cut a little closer to the bone to-day than we did before.  Senator O'Farrell used a phrase which surprised me coming from a person of his railway experience.  I thought I heard him say that the railway company dare not carry by rail anything where the rate was more than the 40 per cent. below the standard rate.  I may be misunderstanding the Senator, but that is the impression he seems to have left on some members of the House and it is completely wrong.  Senator Sir John Griffith talked of maximum rates as having been established.  There is no <Col N="493" /> such thing.  Standard rates have been established.  If maximum rates were to be established we would have a different policy.  My Department would have a different policy in appearing before the Railway Tribunal.  To the standard rates we did raise certain objections, that if these traffic conditions continued the result would be to subsidise the passenger service by extra charges on goods.  That is exactly the result at the moment.  These standard rates, not being maximum, are subject to certain reductions which can be made immediately by the railway company.  A 40 per cent. reduction can be made right away, but that does not finish the matter.  A procedure has grown up, which is settled practice at the moment, that where the railway company wishes to establish exceptional rates lower than the 40 per cent. deduction from the standard rates, they do so and then apply to the Railway Tribunal after the event for sanction.  As I said before, I know of no case in which sanction was refused.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Griffith and some other Senator brought in the point on that that these rates have to be advertised and can be availed of by other people who want to use the system. That is not a fact.  Let me give some quotations from letters I have to show that it is not the practice.  Last year I had to address a communication to the Great Southern Railways Company in regard to certain rates to one part of the country which, to my Department, seemed to compare unfavourably with rates in another direction, and we received a letter which contained the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My Company could not agree to take our proportion of a rate, exceptionally low because of direct sea competition, as our factor in compiling a rate from another station where the circumstances in regard to competition by sea are entirely different.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At a later date we received a further letter from them, which contained the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not prepared to allow the lowest rates on our books between <Col N="494" /> any two points to be used as a basis of charging in other directions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In fact they do not do it.  They are apparently prepared to stand their ground and say that it is not undue preference, that it is an exceptional rate because of sea competition.  I do not see any reason why the rate should not be lower because of road competition, and that rate refused to other areas where the same competition does not hold.  I have had no statement from the railway company that they have found that particular system disadvantageous to them.  I have found no case made.  I have merely got from them representations that they want something and no argument for it.  All this hubbub about shackles and impediments, as far as I can gather, boils down to wages and controlled rates.</P>
    <P>With regard to control of rates I think if it is looked at in its proper light it will be found that there is no handicap of any substance on the railway company.  They have the standard rates fixed.  It can be dropped 40 per cent. immediately and even lower in exceptional cases. There is no obligation on the company to allow these exceptional rates to form portion of a large rate or of a rate that operates as between two places further apart.  That is the net point that has to be met so far as the amendment is concerned.  To meet that the Senator proposes that the railway company should be given leave to charge anything they like provided always that sub-section (2) of Section 30 of the Principal Act holds.  That is to say that whatever protection is given there either to a port town or city shall still continue, but the undue preference of any other type as between traders in the same area or traders in other areas, if they cannot be defined as a port town or city, shall be at the will and whim of the railway company.  Until a better case has been made in regard to hardship, until we see some cases where hardship has been put on the railway company by reason of the other system, I do not think you should give them the big power that they ask.  No argument has been put forward that would make <Col N="495" /> anyone relax the particular condition that I speak of below the point to which it has been relaxed already.</P>
    <P>May I again repeat that it is after the event that the Railway Tribunal meets to give sanction to a rate of an exceptional type lowered beyond the 40 per cent. allowance freely given? I think it is right that the public should have some defence.  That is the very last line of defence, that this judicial, impartially-minded Tribunal shall meet after the event and say whether there is not an undue preference as between port and port or between traders and traders.  That is what is called a shackle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They can run at anything they like on the roads.  There is nothing to prevent their lowering their rail rates.  The only thing that is in the background, so far as that is concerned, is the Railway Tribunal to see that there is no undue preference between trader and trader in a particular area.  I do not like using the word, and I use it without any disrespect, but when you wipe out all the camouflage, what is the bold claim made for this amendment?  That we should say to the railway directors as we know them: &ldquo;You have complete freedom; we trust to your discretion and impartiality to fix rates as between port and port, trader and trader, or area and area.&rdquo;  There are many road systems, but there is only one rail system.  Have we any reason to believe that people generally will say of the directors of our two rail services: <Col N="496" />&ldquo;We can trust them not to look for a long haul and to divert away from a particular port?&rdquo;  That would be the ordinary outlook of the railwayman. Can we say that to them when in the opposition you have the system I have spoken of&mdash;<i>post factum</i> sanction of the exceptional rate by the Railway Tribunal?  The Railway Tribunal stands between the railway company and the public and if it can be shown that the Tribunal has treated the railway company in a niggardly fashion, then I would be prepared to modify my attitude.  That has not been done. That case has certainly not been made in the House and I invited representations on it.</P>
      <P>I must refer to another matter.  I again noticed the comment made, adverting to the statement I made with regard to the proposition of the railway company, that traders should only be allowed to carry their own goods within a ten mile radius.  That was not contained in the draft Bill presented to me.  The comment has been made in a way which shows that correspondence addressed to me in a confidential way was not regarded by certain people as confidential, because that particular item has been referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The representations made to me by the railway company did, in fact, contain more than what I said on the last day.  They contained this request to me: that as the railway company were now in a position to provide all necessary transport, and it did not limit that to goods, they should be given a complete monopoly of it subject only to this, that within a ten mile area traders might be allowed to carry their own goods on their own lorries.  I think the phrase must have been badly drafted because I cannot see them wanting to deprive the ordinary man of the use of his motor car, but the phrase did mean that they wanted a monopoly of that transport. They wanted a monopoly of the business except that they were prepared to allow traders within a ten mile area to carry their own goods in their own lorries.  A fantastic proposition which was greeted with derision when I announced it here. <Col N="497" /> That was put to me.  The proposition has never seen the light of day by way of amendment and I think that no one with reason would vote seriously for that amendment.  We may come to the time when it has to be considered, but we are certainly not at that point now.  It will be after reason given and the reason must be of this type that the Railway Tribunal is narrow and rigid in its interpretation of the Act, that it has acted awkwardly in its decisions for the company, that it has prevented them from lowering rates and that rates could be lowered with advantage.  That case has not been made, I put it to the Seanad, by any one making a speech on this amendment. It is remarkable that no suggestion has been made that railway earnings will increase.  I have made that suggestion.  I did not confine myself to saying that the earnings of railway companies on the rails would increase, but certainly the earnings on their joint services ought to increase.</P>
    <P>I ask the opposition is there any likelihood of railway earnings increasing under this amendment, the effect of which is to enable the railway company to cut down their rates below a point at which they found it economic in order to get some traffic back.  I wonder what is going to happen after the traffic is got back. After the traffic is got back, if the services have disappeared, if they are going to continue on the road the railway earnings will seriously decrease. The amendment to my mind would reduce revenue, and we are not in such a bad position as certain railway protagonists would have us believe in regard to railway traffic.  Yet Senator O'Farrell sees the time when three-fourths of the merchandise will be carried by road.  I did not see it at all, but I do say this, that the 1930 traffic on the railways was much in advance of what was carried in 1925, and I said previously that I saw a certain decrease from the peak point they had reached before 1928, and I say a good amount of that has to be related to the general reduction that there has been in every country.  It cannot be taken merely because the figures are down that it proves a diversion of traffic from one <Col N="498" /> system of transport to another.  I think most people realise in the circumstances of the last one and a half years that certain traffic has disappeared altogether.  It is not being carried by any type of service. Senator O'Farrell again said that the Railway Tribunal had control&mdash;he said myself, but I think he meant the Railway Tribunal&mdash;of all goods run on steel rails.  He does not think that the word &ldquo;control&rdquo; is going to be applicable to the circumstances I have outlined.</P>

      <P>Control of the type I have described is the whole control. If the Senator means control of every pound of goods on steel rails, then there is a new meaning for the word &ldquo;control.&rdquo;  There is no control as the word is used outside in the sense of this narrow advertence of the Railway Tribunal to certain Acts and a funny interpretation of these Acts.  We have got to the last point of defence of the public.  The case for giving an unrestricted discretion to the railway management&mdash;a discretion that I would be prepared to give them in other circumstances&mdash;has not been made up to the moment.</P>

      <P>You could not get rid of the whole Board without legislation. There are certain directorships which fall vacant every year.  I think the shareholders have that matter in hands by refusing to fill the vacancy. If the Senator means to substitute the directorate as a body by a manager, that would require legislation.</P>
