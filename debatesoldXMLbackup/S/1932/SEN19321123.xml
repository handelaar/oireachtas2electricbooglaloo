      <P>This Bill is of a very technical nature and I do not propose to go into an explanatory statement in any great detail.  Its object is to secure proper supervision of substances whose technical purity and potency have to be determined by experiment rather than by chemical examination. The information in the Pharmacopoeia is available to chemists in connection with chemical prescriptions, but the examination of the therapeutic substances particularly referred to in this Bill is a complicated process and can only be undertaken or carried out by a bacteriologist or a physiologist and, in that way, the public and the medical profession are depending on the State to take such steps as will ensure that these substances, when offered for sale in this country, will have reached a certain standard of purity and potency.  Medical research and medical science have made considerable progress in recent times and, as a direct result of that progress in medical science, many important substances <Col N="82" /> derived from animal sources have been introduced for the prevention, treatment and diagnosis of discases. To a considerable extent, these substances have replaced in treatment and diagnosis some of the older drugs of vegetable origin.  The control of the biological products, such as sera, vaccines and other products, is really of greater importance to the community than the control of the ordinary chemical preparations.  In most European countries at the present time the manufacture and importation of these substances are under State control.</P>
      <P>With the exception of vaccine lymph and stock vaccines, the substances covered in this Bill are not manufactured in this country.  The production of vaccine lymph is already adequately supervised by the Department of Local Government and Public Health, but, as I have said, the bulk of the therapeutic substances with which we are concerned now are manufactured outside this country and, by the very nature of the complicated process of their manufacture, must continue to be manufactured outside this country.  I think it would be obvious, even to the lay mind, that there are certain dangers to the community arising out of the existing position, arising out of the fact that such substances of doubtful origin, and even of doubtful purity, can be dumped into this country and used in the treatment of certain diseases. Apart from that, many of these substances are relatively unstable and if they have been manufactured a considerable time before use, dissociation may have taken place with very serious consequences to the patient to whom they might come to be administered. We have consulted very eminent physicians and eminent men in the medical profession in relation to these matters and there appears to be no difference of opinion that the potency of several of these substances varies to a very extraordinary extent, and it has, indeed, been stated by a physician of eminence in the City of Dublin that some of these substances that are being used for specific diseases have, for all practical purposes, no curative powers at all by reason of their low potency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended under the Bill to issue <Col N="83" /> licences to duly authorised persons for the manufacture or importation of these substances and the issue of research licences to persons using the substances for research purposes will, of course, involve the inspection of the establishment concerned and laboratory examination of samples of the products to ensure the observation of safe methods of manufacture and to ascertain their freedom from contamination, etc.  For the purpose of advising the Minister from time to time as to the issue of licences to manufacturers of these substances, the Minister will have the expert advice of a consulting bacteriologist, and, on the advice of that consulting bacteriologist, licences will be issued or refused to manufacturers.  During the discussion in the Dáil on this Bill, representations were made to me regarding the possible difficulties that might be placed in the way of a medical practitioner who required such substances in a case of urgency, and who, perhaps, might find that a person to whom an importer's licence had been issued had not any of the material in stock. Amendments were inserted dealing with that point in order to enable the Minister in cases of emergency to issue a permit to a medical practitioner to import any of the substances to which the Bill might have application, if the Minister was satisfied that the case was sufficiently urgent or that it was advisable to issue such permit.  I think that covers the main features of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir E. Coey Bigger</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in supporting the Second Reading of this Bill.  It is a very important and very necessary Bill.  It is only right that these substances which are of vital importance to the community should be of a particular standard and that is the aim and object of the Bill.  The Bill is framed largely on the English Act, but circumstances in Ireland and in England are somewhat different.  In England, they manufacture these substances, but this country is too small and we do not manufacture them, but it is quite possible, and I have two cases in mind at the moment, that it might be very <Col N="84" /> important for a medical practitioner, in case of sudden or urgent necessity, to get the substances he wishes without going to the trouble or delay of putting the application to the Minister. Such a case may not occur for years and it may occur to-morrow.  It may occur on a Saturday when it will not be possible to get at the Minister and the delay until Monday of two days, or a delay of even twelve hours, might mean the difference between life and death.</P>
      <P>I strongly urge the advisability of giving power to medical practitioners to get these substances.  I remember when we had rabies ten or twelve years ago anti-rabies serum had to be obtained. Another instance was a case of botulism which we had no serum for treating.  These were very urgent cases, because a difference of a few hours might have meant a difference between life and death.  The serums were obtained by telegraph within twelve hours.  The same thing might occur in some other diseases because these cases occur like a bolt from the blue.  It will not injure but rather will improve the Bill to have such a provision in it for dealing with such cases.  It would be only in a case of great emergency the question would arise, but it might be a safeguard that a person who would want these substances must give particulars to the Minister within a specified time thereafter.</P>

      <P>I should like to point to Section 11 of the Bill, to which I have no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary has referred.  Cases of emergency are not met, seeing that you have to get the permit of the Minister.  It is not in a case where you would not have time to get a permit of the Minister, that this becomes important.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should accept an amendment which, I am sure, Senator Bigger will undertake to move on the next stage.</P>

      <P>The only point that calls for further discussion is that raised by Senator Bigger and by Senator Brown.  The amendment which was produced in the Dáil, dealing with this particular difficulty, was drafted after consultation with members of the <Col N="85" /> medical profession.  I think Senator Bigger will agree that, generally speaking, the substances under discussion are used in the treatment of chronic cases rather than acute cases.  I can quite conceive the possibility of such substances being required urgently, in very exceptional circumstances, in acute cases such as the Senator cited. I think some further consideration might be given to the point he has made.  I do not think, under the amendment, there would be very much delay.  Those who have given special consideration to the matter under discussion agree that if we make it too loose it is going to defeat its object. While it would be necessary, as the Bill stands, for a medical practitioner to apply for the Minister's permission to import such substances, the delay in securing permission, in the circumstances outlined by Senator Bigger, would certainly be very short.  However, I am quite prepared to look into the point again, and perhaps we would be able further to amend it, without making it unduly lax.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure the Parliamentary Secretary that I do not wish to make the Bill in any way lax in its operations.  I followed the discussion in the Dáil and I thought the point raised by Deputy Hennessy was rather not to hamper the profession too much.  He had not in mind the cases I mentioned.  Similar cases might occur.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="86" />
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill aims at extending the Army Pensions Acts of 1923 and 1927 so as to enable men who were wounded, and the dependents of those who were killed, during the Black-and-Tan war and the civil war to be compensated. It will also enable the Minister for Defence to re-open certain cases that were marked &ldquo;final awards&rdquo; under the 1923 and 1927 Pensions Acts.  On that point a lot of hardship has been inflicted on certain pensioners who were disabled or wounded as their cases were marked &ldquo;final&rdquo; and there was no power in the Minister under these Acts to re-open them, even if disability increased manifold afterwards.  In order to provide that only those entitled to pensions will get them a Military Service Registration Board will be established.  Applicants will have to prove service to three members of that board and if they are judged entitled to pensions for service rendered their claims will be passed on to the Army Pensions Board, on which there will be two medical officers.  They will assess the degree of disability from which claimants suffer.  The structure of the Bill is much the same as the previous Acts.  Where there are dependents they will be entitled to get either gratuities or pensions.  Unless there is total dependency proved, the dependents of a deceased person will not be entitled to a pension; they will simply get a gratuity.  For all who were wounded the scale of pensions is three-quarters of that given to officers under the 1923 and 1927 Acts.  In America and certain other countries when volunteers turn out at a time of national crisis, both officers and men are afterwards treated on the same basis.  It is recognised that there is not the same distinction between officers and men in a volunteer force as there is in regular armies, and as they are only up for one or two years they are treated exactly on the same lines and get the same scale of pensions. We have adopted that procedure in this Bill.  In certain cases where men die, if they were not married before a certain date, the widows would only be entitled to a grant instead of a pension. Section 12 deals with such cases. As in the 1923 and 1927 Acts provision <Col N="87" /> is made for the hospital treatment of those who claim pensions.  There is also provision made for the forfeiture of pensions if a pensioner is found guilty of certain offences by a civil court.  By direction of the Minister where a pensioner neglects his wife the pension can be paid direct to the wife. In Part III of the Bill there are certain proposals which were recommended by the Public Accounts Committee.  They are simply to tighten up the original Acts and to make the intention behind these Acts have full force and effect. Section 23 of Part II is the section under which the Minister can re-open &ldquo;final awards&rdquo; under the 1923 and 1927 Acts.  I have already dealt with the scale of pensions, three-quarters that of officers, that will apply to both officers and men.  I hardly think there is any necessity to go into any further details, but if any Senator raises any question I will do my best to explain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The question that agitates my mind about this Bill is this: When the Act is in operation what amount is it likely to cost the country?  I am sure the Minister will have made some estimate of what it is likely to cost.  In these days, when taxation is so high, that is one of the things that it is necessary, for the farming community at all events, to direct attention to.  I also want to direct the attention of the House to the fact that in taking the scale of pensions at three-quarters of that allowed to officers the effect will be to raise the standard of pensions of the rank and file considerably above what was allowed under previous Acts.  For example, previously the ordinary volunteer was allowed up to £105 yearly.  If this Bill becomes law the ordinary volunteer will get three-quarters of an officer's pension, up to £150.  These are days when the cost of food has fallen, because there is a plethora of it in the country, when butter is cheap, and when there is no sale for beef or mutton.  One would imagine that instead of the scale advancing it would be reduced.  If this scale is carried through, those who operated as non-commissioned officers <Col N="88" /> in the National Army in the past will be receiving less than men of the same rank to whom they were opposed. I do not think that is a just state of affairs.  Apart altogether from pensions being provided for one army, and provided now for another army, why should one man have a larger pension than another man?  That is a point the Minister should have explained. I am simply asking this question to find out exactly what is in the Minister's mind, and to ascertain roughly what it is going to cost and, in that way, to direct public attention to the matter.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the national interest in the fullest sense of the word, I think it is very questionable if this Bill should be brought in now.  Whatever the disabilities and the hardships of the beneficiaries under this Bill&mdash;and I dare say that these hardships may have been very great in many cases&mdash;and however much the persons concerned may have incurred those disabilities through actions which they considered at the time to be patriotic, I still hold that this Bill is a bad piece of legislation and is nationally a bad precedent.  It gives pensions and gratuities to persons of a particular political point of view. It gives these gratuities in recognition of hostilities against the <i>de facto</i> Government of the day.  In my opinion, payments of that kind cannot fail to come under the head of payments given for Party services and that I hold to be a bad and demoralising principle in any civilised State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, this is a Bill, for which, in the main, the responsibility lies with the Executive Council.  I do not know the views of the majority of this House, but if there were a majority that was not satisfied with the Bill, nevertheless this is a Bill, the passage of which, I think, they ought not to attempt to stop.  When introducing the Bill into the Dáil, the Minister for Defence said that he estimated that it would cost about £30,000 a year.  That is the figure he mentioned, I think.  In introducing the Bill he said that he was satisfied that it would remove a great <Col N="89" /> deal of bitterness and ill-feeling in the country and that it would in a large measure remove the memories of past dissensions and create a great deal of happiness.  The Executive Council have the responsibility for order in the country, and if they are satisfied that a Bill of this kind will remove bitterness and make for order, then I do not think that this House should take responsibility for rejecting the Bill.  Some of us have adopted exactly the same attitude in the case of former Bills about which we were not very enthusiastic, and I think we should adopt the same attitude now.</P>
      <P>The main object of the Bill, I think, is to provide pensions for disabled men, or the dependents of those who were disabled or killed, who were previously prevented from having pensions because of the fact that they had taken up arms against the State, which was not only the <i>de facto</i> State but, as Senator Bagwell said, established by law by the elected representatives of the people.  I have considerable respect for the point of view of Senator Bagwell and others who say that the State should not provide pensions for those who fought against the State, but, personally, I am not able to take that point of view.  We have the highest possible authority for the belief that we should forgive our enemies, and also that if we find any man hungry we should feed him or if he thirst give him to drink for in so doing we heap coals of fire upon his head.  If these pensions are to be given in the spirit of making the recipients uncomfortable in so far as they have taken up arms against the State, I agree; but what makes me uncomfortable is that in the minds of many people the pensions are being given for actions of which I cannot and did not approve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot asked the Minister for Defence what seemed to me to be a perfectly fair and reasonable question in the Dáil, and that was whether they were prepared &ldquo;always to defend against armed interference the institutions accepted by the majority of the people of this country&rdquo;&mdash;I think these were Deputy MacDermot's exact words.  In view of the President's <Col N="90" /> statements with regard to majority rule.  I would have expected that the Minister would have been able to answer that question of Deputy MacDermot's frankly in the affirmative.  The Minister's reply seemed to me, and to many other persons I think, to evade Deputy MacDermot's point.  His reply was that Deputy MacDermot could always &ldquo;rely on Fianna Fáil and the members of their Party doing what they think best for Ireland and the Irish people.&rdquo;  To my mind, that kind of answer gets us nowhere.  Every Party says that it is doing the best for Ireland.  Lord Craigavon and Lord Carson said the same, and the same is said by those who stand for the Soviet Republic.  But these people have no right to attempt to force their will on the majority of the people.  It seems to me that that is a principle which ought to be condemned, and if every Party should be allowed to do what they liked, even to the extent of violence, it will lead to chaos and disorder. The security of the State depends on the frank acceptance of the principle of majority rule by all parties and certainly by those who are going to accept responsibility for government.  If the Minister had been able to give a straight answer in the affirmative to Deputy MacDermot's question I might have supported this Bill without any misgivings whatever. I would like to give every support to any effort to let bygones be bygones and to remove bitterness in this country, no matter on what side people fought.  In spite of the fact that the Minister's answer gives me considerable misgiving, I am prepared to support the Bill.  My reasons are mainly two-fold.  In the first place the responsibility for taking up arms against the State lay on the leaders and not on the rank and file.  The people in this country in many cases have elected leaders to high office, some of whom are Ministers either in this House or in the other House, and it seems to me that if the people have elected leaders to that position we cannot criticise their making provision for pensions as provided in this Bill.  I am quite certain, personally, and I hope very much that it will not be the case, that if any <Col N="91" /> other people take up arms in the future against this State, and if the people then elected to high office by the people wish to do so, we shall have another Pensions Bill.  I do not think that the people should grumble about the expense in the circumstances.  I do not see how the former Government could have introduced this Bill because theirs was the responsibility for the State against which these people took up arms.  With the present Executive in power, the position is changed and we are faced with a different point of view.</P>
    <P>My second reason is that I do not believe that it is good for the country to have disabled men or their dependents in a disgruntled state of mind, especially having regard to the history of the last twenty years.  I do not think that that is a good state of affairs.  I believe that it is far better for the State to take the risk of erring on the side of generosity, even when people are misguided enough to oppose majority rule, and I am prepared to support the Bill when the Minister states that in his opinion this Bill will remove bitterness and ill-feeling.  Together with a number of other people, I had considerable experience of relief work before the Treaty.  At that time funds were given to people without any regard to their political beliefs.  We even gave relief to the dependents of Black-and-Tans if their dependents were resident in this country.  After the Treaty, also, money was voted to men coming out of jail, although in many cases, probably, these men were opposed to the State.  I believed that that was a wise policy then and I still believe it to have been a wise policy. I think that personal and political bitterness is probably the worst curse from which we are suffering at the present time, and that if you can do anything which will enable those of us who honestly differ from one another to state our opinions in good faith and without bitterness, it is worth some cost.  Although I sympathise with Senator Wilson in his unwillingness to pay money out at this time, still I feel that if as a result of this measure you can do away with the bitterness and get <Col N="92" /> an honest opinion, a Bill of this kind would be very cheap at the price.  I may be wrong, but if we can do anything to remove that bitterness and ill-feeling, it is probably the greatest duty that any person in any party could undertake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse what Senator Bagwell said and to protest against the principle in this Bill on the ground that it sets up a dangerous precedent and leads to no finality in the matter of revolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it should be pointed out that this Bill does not go to the extent of the old Bills.  It does not give pensions or gratuities to any person except those who have been disabled to some degree.  That is a big distinction between the treatment of those who served in one or other of the armies and the treatment of men under the previous Bill which dealt with the same problem.  I think it is desirable, in view of what Senator Bagwell said, to call attention to the fact that the previous Bills, while ostensibly giving pensions or gratuities to those who served in the National Army, in fact did not give a pension for that service at all but rather for pre-Treaty service.  To meet Senator Bagwell's point that the effect of this Bill is to give some kind of encouragement of a partisan nature, I think we cannot criticise in that direction unless we are also prepared to denounce the policy of the previous Bills, because, quite clearly, those Bills were definitely intended to penalise any person, no matter how he were wounded or disabled in the pre-Truce fighting, unless he joined the National Army.  If this Bill is worthy of condemnation because it has a partisan effect, according to Senator Bagwell, the other Bills were equally partisan, because they penalised the person if he did not join the National Army, even though he had been wounded or disabled in the previous fighting.  I think that it is a reasonable criticism to say that this Bill, if taken as a precedent and dealt with purely in the abstract, is perhaps fraught with certain danger.  But the point made by Senator Douglas, <Col N="93" /> I think, is a valid one and a sound principle to enunciate, that is to say, that if something of this kind is not done there is going to be, for at least one generation, a continuation and an emphasis of a certain internal bitterness which ought to be avoided, and that the cost of removing that bitterness will not be high compared with the benefit which, I think, will be attained.  Senator Wilson has made a point regarding the differentiation in the benefits which would accrue under this Bill as compared with those under the previous Bills.  I am not quite sure, but it does appear to me that under the clause which the Senator has referred to, where the awards were final under the old Bill, if a good case can be made that the disablement is of such a degree as to make it impossible for the recipient of the pension to live decently, he comes within the scope of this Bill if his award is revived and revised. I am not quite sure of that point but I think it is correct.  I do not think in fact that the principle is so very great as to warrant our paying too much heed to the criticism to which Senator Wilson refers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If I believed, like Senator Douglas, that this Bill would remove the bitterness of the past, or that it would relieve people who are suffering, I should find it very hard to make up my mind to oppose it. I should find it very hard to refuse aid to those who are suffering because I realise that many of these men were absolutely misguided in the actions they took.  They may have thought that they were doing a patriotic action in opposing majority rule.  I cannot, however, believe for a moment that this Bill will remove bitterness.  I believe, with Senator Bagwell, that it will have a thoroughly demoralising effect on the whole community.  For that reason, I cannot support the Bill. I do not know that there is a precedent for this Bill in any country in the world, either in America or any other country, where you had a rebellion of a section of the people against the majority.  I never heard or never read of an instance anywhere in which those who opposed <Col N="94" /> majority rule were rewarded afterwards. I think it is a terribly bad precedent to set up.</P>
      <P>There are certain things which are not very pleasant to remember, things which those who lived and suffered during that dreadful period of the civil war cannot very easily forget.  It will be remembered that very large sums of money were robbed from the banks in that period. It is well known that a great deal of that money found its way into the pockets of the men who robbed it.  It did not go into a general fund.  It did not go to keep up the general army, if you might call it such.  It went directly into the pockets of certain individuals.  Many of these men have been pretty well rewarded&mdash;not all, of course.  Only the clever ones got more than their share of such money.  Cases of people in the country who made fortunes are very well known.  Some of them suffered wounds. Others did not.  As I say, I would be very sorry indeed if I thought by not supporting the Bill I should be causing unnecessary suffering or want to anyone, but there are other means of relief besides giving pensions.  For the reason principally that I believe that it will have a thoroughly demoralising effect on the country and that it will encourage rebellion against authority in future, I cannot support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  I think, if anything, it is overdue and that the interests of those who have suffered injury in health as a result of wounds or the development of disease should be attended to by the State at the earliest possible moment.  I do not desire to introduce any controversial matter in relation to the general principles of the Bill, but I feel that I cannot allow to go unchallenged the references made to the establishment of this State and the apparent, I might say unconscious, interchange of the names of the geographical unit of Ireland and the name of this State.  I do not agree with Senator Douglas that this State was established by the will of the majority of the Irish people nor do I agree with the last speaker in her libels on members <Col N="95" /> of the Irish Republican Army who took part in the civil war in which she states rather definitely&mdash;she always does and without any without any proof&mdash;that men in the army bettered their own position through raids on banks or otherwise.</P>
      <P>My chief concern with the Bill is that I do not think it goes far enough.  I would suggest that not merely should pensions be awarded to those covered by the Bill but that a retrospective help should be given to those families who had a burden placed on them in respect of the care and nursing of men who were wounded in the last ten years.  I have in mind one particular case where a family not very well off has had the responsibility of nursing and providing medical and surgical attention for the senior member of the family who has been unable to leave his bed for the last ten years.  They are in an impoverished position to-day because of the attention and care given to that member of the family.  I think the Bill should go further than it does and should provide retrospective help for such families so as to place them at least in the same financial position as they held at the beginning or end of the civil war.  I welcome the introduction of the Bill and I wish the Minister God-speed.</P>

      <P>Senator Johnson, I think, confused the Military Service Pensions Act with the Wounds and Disability Pensions Acts of 1923 and 1927.  He said that the previous Acts penalised those who did not serve with the National Army. That is true with reference to the Military Service Pensions Act, but it is not so in regard to the Wound and Disability Pensions Acts.  Under the Military Service Pensions Act, able-bodied men got pensions provided they had both pre-Truce service in the I.R.A. and post-Truce service in the National Army, but under the Wounds and Disability Pensions Acts, members of the Irish Republican Army who fought on the Republican side against the Free State Government after the Truce got pensions if they proved that their wounds were received during the Black-and-Tan war.  I hope that is <Col N="96" /> quite clear, because the past Government were a little bit more humane than Senator Bagwell in that respect. Even though the men who were wounded in the Black-and-Tan war afterwards fought against them, they allowed, under the Acts which they introduced and passed, pensions to these men in respect of wounds received during the Black-and-Tan war.  However, there were some men who were wounded during the Black-and-Tan war who did not claim under the previous Acts and their time has lapsed.  According to these Acts, if they did not claim within a certain period there was no legal power in the hands of the Free State Government to accept their claims.  Under this Bill we are extending the time and they can claim under this Bill either for wounds received during the Black-and-Tan war or in the civil war.</P>
      <P>I really do not think this House would wish to discuss the events of the past sixteen or seventeen years.  Fundamentally our outlook, the outlook of the Government, is one of peace.  We set out, many of us sixteen or seventeen years ago, some before that, in order to bring about peace in this country, such conditions as would allow our people to live in it and be at peace with their brother Irishmen.  In regard to majority rule, when a question is flung at one suddenly about majority rule to be answered by a sentence across the floor of the House, the answer will not be satisfactory if it is done in that way.  I could easily imagine Deputy MacDermot asking me across the floor of the Dáil whether I stood for majority rule or not.  I suppose Senator Bagwell has as little knowledge of Irish history, and I could well imagine him asking me a similar question, but I cannot very well imagine Senator Douglas doing it unless he is simply asking it in order to give me an opportunity of explaining the whole situation and of stating our attitude in regard to majority rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas is one of those who is fairly conversant with our attitude with regard to majority rule.  I just happen to have here on my file a copy of the Cease Fire Proposals which Mr. de Valera forwarded to the Free State Government at the end of the civil <Col N="97" /> war, through Senator Douglas, I think. At least, he was one of them.  In these Cease Fire Proposals the attitude of the Republican Army, to which I had the honour to be Chief of Staff at the time, was quite definitely pointed out. The proposals offer an immediate cessation of hostilities on the basis of the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  That the sovereign rights of this nation are indefeasible and inalienable.</P>
    <P>(2)  That all legitimate governmental authority in Ireland, legislative, executive and judicial, is derived exclusively from the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>(3)  That the ultimate court of appeal for deciding disputed questions of national expediency and policy is the people of Ireland&mdash;the judgment being by majority vote of the adult citizenry, and the decision to be submitted to, and resistance by violence excluded, not because the decision is necessarily right or just or permanent, but because acceptance of this rule makes for peace, order and unity in national action, and is the democratic alternative to arbitrament by force.</P>
    <P>That quite clearly points out our attitude to majority rule.  No one could put majority rule in the category of an Eleventh Commandment.  We believe that majority rule is a good rule of order, but there are certain things on which no individual would allow himself to be bound by a decision of the majority.  There are certain matters of religion, morals and other things in which the individual has an absolute right&mdash;as a matter of fact, has an absolute duty&mdash;to think for himself.  The Republican Army offered to cease hostilities and to stand by majority rule. It is provided in the fourth item of these Cease Fire Proposals:</P>
    <P>That no individual, or class of individuals, who subscribe to these principles of national right, order and good citizenship can be justly excluded by any political oath, test, or other device, from their proper share and influence in determining national policy, or from the councils and parliament of the nation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> The fifth was</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That freedom to express political or economic opinions or to advocate political or economic programmes, freedom to assemble in public meeting and freedom of the press are rights of citizenship and of the community which must not be abrogated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And (6)</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the military forces of the nation are the servants of the nation, and, subject to the foregoing, amenable to the national assembly when freely elected by the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And the statement went on</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are informed that many in the ranks of our opponents will accept these principles as we accept them.  If that is so, peace can be arranged forthwith.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We hope that this advance will be met in the spirit in which we make it and that it will be supported by all who love our country and who desire a speedy and just ending to the present national troubles.  As evidence of our goodwill the Army Command is issuing herewith an order to all units to suspend aggressive action&mdash;the order to take effect as soon as may be but not later than noon Monday, April 30th &mdash;Eamon de Valera, President.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have, as I pointed out, been endeavouring to get a real rule of freedom here in this country.  We wanted certain principles accepted that would exclude the use of force between Irishmen and that would save much political difference. That was not alone our attitude after the civil war, but it was our attitude before the civil war. Allowing other people to speak for themselves, speaking for myself I can say that I endeavoured before the civil war started to prevent it starting, and during the Four Courts time I endeavoured to bring about peace, and for my trouble I was put in jail. It may be known to some Senators, but not to all, that the Dáil elected by a majority of the people of this country the like of which was never secured by any Party ever previously elected, declared that they wanted <Col N="99" /> peace in June 1922; but it did not meet until three months after the civil war had started.  Those of us who wanted to see peace between Irishmen, and to see majority rule accepted, endeavoured to have the Dáil summoned at that time.  Senator Johnson will remember that the Labour Party called for a meeting of the Dáil at that time, and, although I was not very closely in touch with things at that time still, I arrived at the same conclusion for myself.  I came to Dublin and I endeavoured to get the Dáil summoned, but I was forced into the civil war, I was put into jail for trying to make peace; I escaped later on.  We called a meeting in Dundalk and our first claim was that Deputies should be called together and have an opportunity of going into the difficulty. It is an infamous libel on the men who were killed to say that they were against the majority will of the people of the country.  There are people who accuse us of being against majority rule, simply because we would not accept the majority will of the people of Great Britain and Ireland. We did not accept the majority will of the people of Great Britain and Ireland.  A large number of people were proud of the fact and they fought against the <i>de facto</i> Government.</P>
    <P>In answer to the question put by Senator Wilson I should say that the cost of this Bill will be £30,000 and I think the estimate is very much on the safe side.  It is confined entirely to people wounded in the civil war and to the dependents of those killed. There may be a difference of opinion&mdash; I am sure there always will be&mdash;as to what the scale should be.  I think the scale we have adopted is the correct one.  We knew perfectly well there would be criticism.  Looking at this from the point of view of the private soldier, the private soldier, under this Bill will get 25 per cent. more than the private soldier under previous Acts.  There is the other point of view of criticism here that the officer under this Bill is getting 25 per cent. more than under the previous Acts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think if the Senator knew the figures he would find that under the previous Acts, as between officers and men, there was a wide difference, but it will not be the same under this Bill.  It was the men who were most active in the old days that became officers and that stopped the most bullets.  I think this scale is the best.  It is carried out in other countries which have both regular armies and volunteer armies.  The regular army is offered a certain scale of pension.  When the volunteers are called up, and afterwards disbanded, both officers and men are treated alike. I hope the Seanad will pass this Bill which will do much more than any amount of speeches or sermons to create goodwill in the country.  When the Bill was going through the Dáil I appealed that it should be accepted by all, and that the Opposition, in a spirit of generosity, should say &ldquo;these men were wounded or these women were left widows and out of a humane spirit we should give them pensions.&rdquo;  I was quite prepared to carry on as usual and to hear it said that these people were merely victims of President de Valera and myself and other rascals like us.  We were quite prepared for that.  But I think the majority of them had attained the use of reason and were quite prepared to be wounded for the cause.  But from the Opposition point of view if they wanted to be humane they could say &ldquo;these poor fellows were innocent victims of other people now in good positions and it is only right that these victims should be looked after.&rdquo;  If Senator Bagwell wants to pension all men who fought against the <i>de facto</i> Government either British or Free State he would have to introduce an amendment to abolish other Army Pensions Acts.</P>

      <P>The Senator does not want pensions for anybody under this Bill, but if he did want pensions I was pointing out the way he could proceed. While I quite understand some people <Col N="101" /> do not want to pension others who fought against the British Government, at any rate, I cannot see why there should not be pensions for widows who lost their husbands and, perhaps, also, lost their sons.  This Bill will relieve a lot of hardship.  There are cases where men have been suffering from wounds for nearly ten years past.  With regard to Senator Wilson's point, it is quite clear that privates under this Bill would get a little more than privates under the previous Acts.  Under the previous Acts people have been enjoying their pensions for nearly ten years while those for whom we are providing now have not got anything at all yet.  These men have not been able to do any work and have been a burden to their families for years.  If this Bill errs a little on the side of generosity it only tends to provide a little levelling up of things.  You will find people like Senator O'Doherty who would like to have this Bill retrospective for years.  They say that some recompense should be made for the hardship these people have suffered and have been suffering for years.  In this Bill we are not making recompense for anything. We are only hoping to relieve hardships.  Compensation does not come in in any way under the Bill. There is no dependents' allowance given unless dependents can prove that they really were dependents.  If the finances of the country were in a better state than they are it might be possible, going back more, to give the Bill greater retrospective effect.  Under the circumstances, I think, we are doing as much as the state of the Exchequer can be reasonably asked to bear.  I think the Bill will do a great lot of good in the country and if the Seanad passes it, I do not think that anybody will regret their action in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to Vote No. 8, which deals with the appropriation for the Local Loans Fund.  That particular fund, to the extent of £600,000, used to furnish the money to be paid each year to the British, but according to the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance, that is not going to be done this year.  I want to know from the Minister why he proposes to raise that money from the taxpayer when he is not going to pay it to the British.  The question with regard to the Local Loans Fund is, as Senators are aware, one that is in dispute between the British Government and our Government.  I want to deal with this from the point of view of the farmer.  First of all he is called upon, as a taxpayer, to contribute towards this Local Loans Fund.  As a beneficiary under the Fund he is also called upon to repay his loan, whether as a land annuitant under the various Land Acts up to 1923, or as a man who got a loan from the Board of Works to build a shed.  Having discharged these two liabilities he is called upon a third time by the British to pay the duty that they are levying at the English ports.  In addition to his land annuities, the farmer has to pay this sum of £600,000 and, I understand, £1,000,000 for pensions.  The remarks I have just made in connection with the Local Loans Fund apply also to the Vote for the R.I.C. pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point that I want to make is this: that in these times of stress and depression, when things are so bad, I cannot understand why the Minister for Finance should appropriate money to the extent of £2,000,000 which he does not want and which he says he will not pay.  The people will find it very difficult to foot that huge bill when the tax-gatherer comes along to collect.  The British are looking for five and a quarter million pounds.  The amount of the land annuities which the farmers owed under the various Land Acts previous to the 1923 Acts was less than three million pounds.  We have this peculiar position now, that the farmer, having paid the less than three <Col N="103" /> million pounds to the Irish Land Commission, will have to pay the British on the export of his produce at the port five and a quarter million pounds. We have, therefore, this position: that not alone is the farmer liable for his land annuities but has to pay them twice.  In addition, he is paying an excess of something like two and a quarter million pounds, or will have to pay that.  I do not think that is a fair or a reasonable proposition to bring before the House in these days.</P>
    <P>There is very great inconsistency in the policy of the Ministry in connection with the land annuities.  It was recognised, when they came into office, that there was great depression in agriculture.  A Bill was passed through the Oireachtas under which a moratorium was granted to those who were in arrears with their annuities up to December, 1931.  Owing to the tariff war between Britain and the Free State the land annuities which will accrue due at the end of this year and the annuities which will fall due at the end of June of next year will, if the annuitant can make a case to the Land Commission, be funded, plus a four and a half per cent. interest charge.  But in between these periods there comes the annuity due in June. The Ministry, as I have said, recognised the depression in agriculture that prevailed before June, and yet in connection with the land annuities due in June shoals and sheaves of writs have been issued all over the country.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how that can be considered to be a consistent policy on the part of the Ministry so far as the land annuities are concerned.  It will be argued that the farmers have not been, or are not, willing to pay the land annuities: that they want to get out of them and all that kind of thing. I want to direct the attention of the House to this: that statistics were given in the Dáil which reflect the highest credit on our farmers for their honesty.  When the Free State Government took over from the British on the 1st April, 1923, the amount of the land annuities in arrear at that period was £640,000.  On the 30th June, 1930, the arrears were only £505,000, while on <Col N="104" /> the 31st January, 1931, they were only £665,000.  That is to say, they were only £25,000 in arrears over a period of depressed prices that lasted for ten years.  There was an additional collection since 1923 of one million pounds a year.  Following the passage of the 1923 Land Act, there was the collection of three years' arrears&mdash;they were called compounded arrears of rent&mdash;so that on a collection of close on thirtysix million pounds there was only a deficit of £25,000.</P>
    <P>That is a record that I think could not be beaten in any part of the world, and it certainly reflects the highest credit on our farmers.  It is a record that the farmers of Ireland have reason to be proud of, and a record, too, that the Ministry should recognise. For that reason I think the Ministry should stop the proceedings that are being taken for the collection of the June annuities.  Everybody knows that it is impossible to sell cattle or agricultural produce of any kind at a reasonable price at the present time. Farmers who used to be offered for a 9-cwt. bullock £15 or £16 are now offered £11 10s. 0d., so that their losses may be roughly estimated at £5 a head.  Under such circumstances, how can any farmer carry on?  How can he pay his land annuities or pay his shop debts?  The Minister should realise that to proceed against farmers in the position I have described is both foolish and futile.</P>
    <P>Not alone are proceedings being taken for the payment of the land annuities, but people are being processed and decrees obtained against them for their rates.  Only last week I was in a District Court near Dublin where proceedings for the payment of the current rate up to the 31st March were being taken against farmers.  The farmers who are being most severely hit by tariffs are not so much the tillage farmers as the energetic men who are doing some tillage and, having saved some money out of their tillage, have put capital into cattle.  A man in that position may have one hundred cattle out on grass.  He may not have had enough money to buy them and, in consequence, had to go to the bank to borrow.  He is now faced with a loss <Col N="105" /> of probably half his capital.  In these circumstances it is the limit of unreasonableness to ask him to pay his land annuities, his rates and other debts.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have something to say with regard to the three items I have mentioned: the £600,000 for the Local Loans Fund, the R.I.C. pensions and the excess stock.  The Minister is asking for money under these three heads which he does not require because he is not going to pay it.  Therefore, I ask the House to recommend that the amounts under these three heads be excluded from the Appropriation Bill.  I do not expect, of course, that the recommendation will be accepted.  I think, however, that these three items should be excluded from the Bill in view of the fact that the money is not going to be paid out.  It is too bad, I think, to expect farmers to pay it in these bad times and under the circumstances I have described.  The money will not be wanted if we are going to win the fight.  Therefore, I think it is only right that our rates and taxes should be reduced accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that portion of the money asked for under this Bill is required to meet the bounties payable to our farmers on agricultural live stock and produce.  I think a recommendation should be put in against using this money for the payment of bounties.  On the Second Reading of the Bill, Senator Jameson stated that the bounties were not going into the pockets of the farmers.  That statement was probably correct for the first two or three weeks when the bounties were paid by the Government, but since then, every farthing of the bounty, and in some cases more than the bounty, has been paid to the farmers.  The Government are paying bounties on butter, cattle, pigs, poultry and other things.  We have sheep and lambs in this country to the value of about three and a half million pounds.  Why are the Government not paying a bounty on sheep and lambs? Do they consider that it is more important to foster the production of turkeys than to preserve the sheep and lamb trade of the country?  With all <Col N="106" /> the tariffs that have been imposed, the restrictions, and all the uncertainty that there is the farmers of this country are in a terrible plight at the moment.  Very many of them are going out of production.  There will be very few cattle stall-fed this winter, with the result that we will have very few to sell next year.  If stall-feeding is stopped it will mean a lot of unemployment amongst the agricultural labourers, the most deserving and honest class of labourers we have in the country.</P>

      <P>When the Government were starting their economic war with England every responsible representative in the country who had any experience of business, or knew anything as to how trade is carried on, warned the Government of the disaster and the ruin that it was going to bring on the country.  It was painful for many of us who have had some experience of the export trade and of business in general to have to listen to statements made by members of the Executive Council and by responsible supporters of the Government on that subject.  We were told that we were going to find alternative and better markets for our live-stock and our agricultural produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told to hold our cattle and we would get better prices.  We were told that England could not do without our cattle, and that the tariffs, if put on, would not last a month.  We were told that England was &ldquo;broke&rdquo; and could not purchase our live cattle, and innumerable things to that effect.  All those statements have now been proved to be false, and it is no satisfaction to those of us who issued a warning at that time to be able to say &ldquo;We told you so.&rdquo;  The President has admitted that there is no other market for our live-stock and agricultural produce but Great Britain, and England can very well do without our live-stock with very little inconvenience to herself.  For the past three or four years, England has been increasing her live stock population very considerably. The statistics show that for the two years up to last June there <Col N="107" /> was an increase of 505,800 cattle, an increase of 2,162,800 sheep and an increase of 870,700 pigs.  Our average export of live-stock to Great Britain would be about 800,000, and that shows that all England would require from us to keep up her normal supply would be about 300,000, and those she could easily get from Canada or some other source without much inconvenience.</P>
    <P>Our beef trade has now been practically wiped out.  A large number of the best cattle we had were purchased by English and Scottish buyers, fed for some time and sold as English and Scottish beef.  As a result of the ill-will which has sprung up, and the scare that was created at the time the tariffs were put on, that trade has gone and so has our Lancashire trade.  A number of our customers, retail butchers, through enmity towards Ireland started to force the sale of chilled meat and, in that way, they got people into the habit of using chilled meat, which was very much cheaper than our product, and the people having got into it, found that it is a very good article of food.  They have never gone back to the fresh meat, and they may never go back to it.  That is one of the results of economic war.  The only statement that bears any relation to fact is that the production of beef cattle did not pay.  I have said myself on several occasions, at cattle trade meetings and in this House, that the production of beef did not pay, but I always took care to explain what appeared to me to be the reason why the production of fat stock did not pay&mdash;that the cost of production was too great.  For the last few years we are getting prices only slightly better than pre-war prices for our fat stock.  Our overhead charges were something about 200 per cent. more.  The cost of labour at the present time is, and has been for some years past, about 150 per cent. above pre-war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>About 150 per cent. above pre-war&mdash;the Senator can make it out from that.  Our transport <Col N="108" /> charges are from 150 to 200 per cent. more and other charges were on the same footing.  That is why the production of beef did not pay.  We were told that we would have to cut out the production of beef because it did not pay, and go in for the production of wheat, but I doubt very much whether the production of wheat will pay.  In any case, the production of wheat will give very much less employment than the production of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cattle trade has had to undergo enormous hardship and cruelty since this economic war started and I would like to give the House an experience that I personally witnessed, a fortnight ago, to illustrate the appalling cruelty inflicted on our live stock by the callous attitude of the British Customs officials, which was a disgrace to humanity, and the enormous loss which honest and innocent farmers and cattle traders have to suffer. When the British Government's Order, imposing a further 20 per cent. duty on our live stock, appeared in the morning papers on November 8th, it spread consternation amongst cattle traders and farmers in this country. A rush was made to the railway company and they were beseeched for wagons and special trains to carry the cattle across the Border for the purpose of evading the extra 20 per cent. duty.  The railway company did what they possibly could under the circumstances, but, of course, everybody could not be accommodated. Still, over 8,000 cattle crossed the Border before midnight, the hour at which the order was supposed to come into force, but when we arrived at Belfast another shock awaited us. We found that only a few hundred cattle had arrived in time to evade the extra duty according to the regulations. We found our cattle being trampled on in the wagons, and we found the railway yards and loading banks in confusion and disorder. Some of our cattle, we could see, were being pulled out of the wagons dead, while others were being trampled to death.  Some of them came out of the wagons and were unable to stand so broken up were they.  Many of these cattle were two days in the wagons <Col N="109" /> and would not be allowed to be unloaded. They had to stay there without food or water.  All this cruelty went on for two days and the British Customs officials stood surlily at their posts and did not relax one iota of the regulations.  They did not seem to have the smallest particle of consideration for the losses of the distressed owners or the sufferings of the dumb animals.  The British Government did not play the game on that occasion. On the previous occasion, when the first duty was imposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving an idea of the hardships we had to undergo and drawing attention to the cruelty which our live stock had to suffer on that occasion.  The British Government did not act fairly in imposing the extra tax on that occasion on our cattle, but, on the previous occasion, when the tax was first imposed, every beast that had crossed the Border before 12 o'clock, midnight, escaped the duty.  I say that the British Government robbed the Irish farmer and cattle trader by a dodge and they have, by their attitude, alienated the support and sympathy of many people who were their ardent friends and supporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said so much on that aspect of the question, I would like to give the other aspect and to say that everybody else in Belfast was most kind and considerate to us.  The North of Ireland cattle traders did everything in their power to facilitate us.  The Great Northern Railway officials did everything they could, and even the port authorities of the Northern Government were most obliging and facilitating. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also did its bit and even the Prime Minister, Lord Craigavon, was very sympathetic and offered us the use of the Royal Ulster Society showgrounds to house our <Col N="110" /> cattle.  Nothing, however, had effect on the British Customs authorities, who seem to be all powerful in Northern Ireland.  Nobody dare interfere with their regulations.  It is a humiliating position for a Prime Minister to be put in that he cannot have any say in the regulations of his own country.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity of calling attention to the treatment we got in Belfast and, if some members of the Executive Council could realise what the cattle traders and farmers of the country are going through, they would not be so anxious to continue this economic war.</P>

      <P>We are asked to vote money for a specific purpose.  If that money is used for anything else it will be misappropriation of the money and this is an Appropriation Bill. We know from public statements that the Minister is not going to send this money where it is due.  We know that these 2¼ million pounds are not going to be sent to England.  We are asked to vote this money for a specific purpose and, if it goes anywhere else, it is misappropriation, and this Bill ought to be called a Misappropriation Bill.

      <P>It is rather amusing to listen to the statements made now. If Senators cast their minds back for a few years and remember that all those farmers who are complaining now that they cannot get cash at once and keep all this money in the country were deadly opposed to keeping it at all and opposed it in every way they could.  If they had tried to get their friends, the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, to keep this money, they would have been able to keep it.  If they had even helped the present Government to keep the money they would probably have succeeded in keeping it here without any effort.  Against every effort that they have ever made, they suddenly want to get all that money back in a few months or a few days&mdash;handed over to them quickly. That is the whole beginning and end of their argument&mdash;they must get something at once the getting of which they have been opposing for the the last ten years.  They have been raising the question of the price of cattle, but one of the last Senators who spoke said that cattle never did pay.</P>

      <P>The fact that cattle are not fetching a good price is not due to these taxes at all.  As a matter <Col N="112" /> of fact, I was told by a farmer, during the past few hours, that prices have risen, and that the tax reductions have been covered.  Anybody who takes the trouble to find out knows that the price of cattle in England has fallen enormously.  The reductions have been less in Ireland.  Nobody has been able to get good prices for cattle any place. That applies not only to England but to America.  I have relations on ranches and for the last three years they have not been able to make the cost of production.  In the State of Iowa on the Rocky Mountains the cost of cattle is not half what it was three years ago, and not a farmer in that State is able to pay his bank bill.  As a result the banks have refused to collect the money, and the State has stepped in to help the banks.</P>

      <P>Yes, but I must also address some of my friends who are very anxious to hear me.  It is quite clear that the fall in the price of stock, the fall in the value of money and everything else, applies to all parts of the world, and that money is short not only in Ireland but everywhere else. If the farmers in Ireland had the common sense to fight their battle a few years ago when someone else was in power, I could forgive them.  As they did exactly the opposite, they must now suffer&mdash;if there is to be any suffering&mdash;for their past misdeeds and follies, seeing that they had not the courage to see that the money for the land annuities was kept, as the greater part of it would go back to themselves. Before we hand over the money we have to get it.  The very people who <Col N="113" /> are so anxious to get this money now were urging us to pay it away to England. They act in contrary ways. They say that we must pay this money to England, but they put themselves in a ludicrous, illogical and unpatriotic position, and then they complain.</P>

In order to emphasise his remarks the Senator said that he was surprised that shippers here were being treated in such a manner by the British authorities &ldquo;on account of being ardent supporters of theirs.&rdquo;  That is certainly a &ldquo;showdown,&rdquo; and it is out at long last.

That is exactly what the argument of the Opposition Party has been for the past two months, when we are fighting for what might be called the life blood of this State, fighting for our own land and for the wealth it produces, in order to give it back to the people to carry them over the depression that exists here as well as all over the world.  I wish we had the same honesty in the speeches of the rest of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, and that they would <Col N="114" /> say quite frankly what Senator Counihan said.  At the beginning of this controversy I gave an interview to Press representatives in connection with the live-stock trade, and I said then, and I say now, that the British farmers cannot maintain their live-stock trade without coming to Ireland for a supply of store cattle.</P>

A higher price was paid in Dublin cattle market on last Thursday than before the 20 per cent. tax was put on.

      <P>I prophesy in relation to the price of Irish live-stock in the British market that British farmers will be buying Irish stores next Spring and paying as big a price for them as ever they paid.  They will have to come here, because they will not have a supply of young calves to turn out on the pastures unless they get them in Ireland. It is well known amongst English graziers that any of them that have had experience of Canadian cattle never fed them a second time.  That <Col N="115" /> is the position and that is how it will work out.  If we only had a certain amount of confidence in ourselves, instead of suffering from the inferiority complex because the British Government and the British people take certain things into their heads, we would be all right.  We have been paying too dearly for that for ten years, and it is time to cry a halt.</P>

Three-fourths of what he said he knew perfectly well was no better than a tissue of lies. It was first-class politics for him to say it.  It was in connection with shooting that occurred at Balla, not very far from my place.  The Deputy made accusations without knowing anything about the matter, and actually suggested that the President of the State and myself connived at such an occurrence. It is obvious that such a suggestion was ridiculous.  As far as I am concerned, I cannot agree with any activities of that nature.  The common law must be maintained in the interests of the common good, and it is up to everybody to see that it is obeyed.  As far as I am concerned, I feel that an Irishman's greatest patriotism lies in his love of home, and that home should be his castle, whether it is the poorest cottage in the country or the greatest house in the State.  That is my principle and that is what I stand for. However, the sneering, scringing ex-Minister for Justice got up in the other House and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I said anything out of order I withdraw, but there was running in that man's mind the idea of gaining some political point.  He was more concerned at gaining some petty political point than anything else.  He was not satisfied with gaining that particular little point, but tried in a small petty way to bring it in that the President of the State connived at it.  There is no necessity to say anything further about it.  The Deputy lost himself so much that he was not satisfied then, but launched a grand slam attack on the Gárda Síochána in the county because people were not put into jail and beaten and battered against the wall or shot.  He felt that the Guards must have been got at.  Just imagine the length this wonderful, brilliant&mdash;I might call him the great administrator of the law&mdash; this lawyer-politician can go in order to gain a little point.  He launched the grand slam attack against the Gárda Síochána in the district alleging that they were got at, and the people were asked to believe that.

I have been asked by a number of people recently if I could tell them the exact position of Irish manufactured goods entering the various British Dominions and Crown Colonies.  It appears to me that there is a good deal of uncertainty in connection with this.  We know that since November 15th, any Irish goods which happened to be dutiable in Britain now pay the full duty.  Does that apply to Crown Colonies?  Are they governed by British laws or is there a preference?  Does it apply in the case of India?  I am putting this question seriously because I have been asked it by a number of people and I think that if it were made clear it would be of real assistance to Irish manufacturers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anxious to get some information on one or two points in the Schedule.  The Bill is an Appropriation Bill under which the Minister asks permission to appropriate certain sums for expenditure, and under the head of No. 16 the amount which he asks for to spend is approximately £1,653,000.  The Budget, as stated here, is for pensions and other items which are at present paid by the British Government. That seems to me to be somewhat contradictory. Why does the Minister ask for money to spend here when it is at present paid by the British Government? It may be one of these complications that has been introduced through the difficulties which have occurred of late between the two Governments, but I fail to see why the Minister appropriates £1,600,000 for the purpose of making payments which are at present paid by the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> The second item was referred to by Senator Wilson.  He stated that somewhere in these Schedules there was an item, I think, of £600,000 for Local Loans.  Again, the Minister might possibly tell me and save me dealing with it, is there an item for Local Loans?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I see: &ldquo;For Capital for the Local Loans Fund, and to make repayment to the British Government in respect of Local Loans outstanding&mdash;£1,150,000.&rdquo;  I can quite understand a capital sum for the Local Loans Fund which would be capital for expenditure during the current year and which would include expenditure for this purpose.  Local Loans, as I understand it, means that moneys are advanced by the State to individuals&mdash; farmers and others&mdash;who require them for various purposes, such as drainage, buildings, hay-sheds and all that sort of thing.  That money is advanced by the State, and the individual who gets the loan pays interest and sinking fund until the loan is paid back again.  It is unquestionably a debt owing by the person who builds the house.  It is not a Government debt.  It is a debt due by the individual who takes the loan.  That being the case, I do not quite understand why the Minister wishes to appropriate money again&mdash;that is, to get money out of the Central Fund in this country&mdash;for the purpose of paying interest on outstanding loans, which is part of this £1,150,000 which is mentioned here.  If it is purely for capital purposes it is all right, but it is not to go for that purpose because it refers here again to repayment to the British Government of loans outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third item was this&mdash;No. 68 for &ldquo;Electrical Battery Research and Development, a sum of £25,000.  I presume that that is the Drumm Battery.  We have not heard much about that enterprise of late.  Possibly, the Minister may be able to tell us something about it.  It is hardly a financial question, but the Minister, in his wisdom, may be able to give <Col N="120" /> us some information as to its progress up to date.  Experiments have been carried out extensively, I believe, but we have not heard recently whether the enterprise is likely to prove a successful venture for the Government.</P>

      <P>Amongst the things I mentioned the other day, I said that I should like information from the Minister for Finance, or that the Minister might take the opportunity of telling us, how the Budget figures now stand.  This is an Appropriation Bill.  Apparently, except for the £2,000,000 at the end, it is an Appropriation Bill drawn on the lines of the Budget speech which the Minister made last May.  A great deal has happened since then, and the Minister has incurred a great many more liabilities, I imagine, and I should like to know whether that £2,000,000 is calculated to cover all these various bounties and grants and other allowances which we have heard about from time to time.  I should like the Minister to give us some idea as to the extent to which this Bill meets the liabilities which we are likely to have to meet at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought also that we would like to have some figures as regards unemployment. We have heard a great deal about what the tariffs were going to do and the amount of employment which was to be given as a result of the tariffs.  One of the biggest items of expenditure which we see coming along now is for the relief of unemployment. Apparently&mdash;especially in this City of Dublin&mdash;it is hitting us in the rates extremely severely.  I think that the Minister might take the opportunity now of telling us what employment has really been given at all in the last six or eight months, or are we really facing far greater unemployment than there was this time last year?  If so, when are we likely to see the figures which will enable us to form some judgment as to what condition of debt we are getting into?  It is quite evident that when the Minister was making his Budget speech he intended to appropriate £5,000,000 for various things in the State, amongst them, I suppose, unemployment.  As to that £5,000,000, <Col N="121" /> I think he could tell us whether the land annuities up to next March or April, or whatever the time is, are going to come up to the amount which he thought they would come to.  There were also very considerable amounts of money which were going to come off the salaries of the civil servants, and various other things which were forecast then.  We are now in November and the figures must be below that.  I think that the Minister should give us some sort of a forecast as to what has happened and how these payments are going to be met and to what extent this Bill is really going to meet the situation, and how far we will have to face other charges before we come finally to clear our Budget for the year.  These are one or two of the things about which I should like the Minister to give us information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGarahan" hpid="Mr. Garahan Mr. Garahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garahan</NameTxt>
      <P>An economic war between this country and England has developed here.  The war centres around the live-stock production and the trade for the product of this country has been very much injured as a result.  This has resulted from an effort by our Government to retain the land annuities in this country.  I do not know if our Government anticipated that this economic war would have developed as a result or that the means which the British Government has taken would be those which that Government has adopted.  This development is seriously affecting the interests of the farmers of this country, so seriously that it is likely to knock them out of action as farmers altogether if it continues for very much longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the result of the tariffs that have been placed on our cattle by the British Government.  It is very easy for anybody who knows how the trade is and has been conducted to understand what the result will be whilst the present situation continues.  Take a beast worth £20 in the English market to-day.  We must add to that price £2 for freight and £1 profit for the exporter.  The beast that produces £23 at an English market is worth only £12 at an Irish fair.  The 40 per cent. tariff is deducted from <Col N="122" /> the £20; I am not sure that it is not deducted from the gross price of the beast in England.  But let us calculate it on £20.  You have then £2 for the cost of transit, £1 for the exporter and the 40 per cent. tariff, making £9 in all.  That beast which fetches £23 in the English market produces only £12 here.  That is the situation as it stands to-day, and I say it as one who had full experience in the live-stock trade.  I am referring now merely to cattle.  So far as poultry and other sections of live-stock are concerned, conditions are no better.  In fact, to some extent they are worse because of the absence of a bounty which is given by the Government to ease the position in regard to cattle.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have had what I consider the audacity to say that the imposition of a tariff on our live-stock had increased the price of cattle in England and, consequently, increased the prices here.  I do not know how that could possibly happen.  It may be because of the law of supply and demand.  If it is said that the supply is less from this country because the tariffs have been imposed, I do not know how that is borne out or if it can be borne out by argument.  The fact is that we have a certain amount of cattle, and our surplus cattle must be exported no matter what price we receive on the British market.  If a sum of £9 had to be paid on a beast exported we must receive £9 less than we would receive if the 40 per cent. tariff did not exist.  That is a plain logical fact that cannot be disputed. It has been stated that the price of cattle went up in England or in the Dublin market by £2 per head recently. I think it was said that that was so in the last market and that that was consequent on an increase of £2 in England.  That, however, proves nothing with regard to the tariff.  The tariff is operating nevertheless. A beast which became £2 dearer in England became £2 dearer in the Dublin market, minus the tariff.</P>
    <P>I asked an exporter who knows his business and who talks intelligently about it what was the cause of the increase of the price of beef in England. <Col N="123" /> He said that it was due to the fact that the supply of chilled meat had run out there.  That, I suppose, is pretty correct, but it is hardly a question that is very material to the farmers of the country.  What is material to them is the fact that they receive £12 for a beast that fetches £23 in England.  That £12 does not pay the cost of production or does not go near paying the cost of production. If the existing state of affairs continues for any length of time the farmer cannot continue in production. He must be knocked out of business, and incidentally there will be a good deal of confusion and lack of prosperity in the country.  How that confusion is to be made right by the efforts of the Government I do not understand, nor can I see any likelihood that it will be set right within the life of many of us here.  I think it is a very serious proposition to ruin the trade of the country, a trade that was at least giving those engaged in it a fairly decent living. The ramifications of that trade were many and far-reaching.  In fact, the four provinces of the country were dependent on it.  To injure that trade very seriously is a very grave matter indeed and the result, I am afraid, will be disastrous not only to the farmer, but to the country generally.</P>
    <P>It is not for me at the present time, or at any time perhaps&mdash;I do not think I should have the ability to do it&mdash;to go into the question of the economic policy that our Government forecasts, but I do know that the cattle trade we have had up to the present was the best trade that our country was in a position to engage in.  It was one of the most remunerative we had, and one that should be fostered until a better is developed&mdash; mind you, developed and not merely promised with talk of development being commenced at some future time. For that reason I should like very seriously to impress upon this House the gravity of the situation.</P>
    <P>I do know, let the attempt of the Government be as strong as it may to collect the annuities now due, they will not be able to do so in very <Col N="124" /> many cases, for the simple reason that the farmers have not the money to pay them.  After one more gale has accrued and after some few have paid, the percentage of those not able to pay will have increased, and consequently the percentage of those able to pay will have declined.  I say that if we are going to preserve the country the Government must have consideration for the plight in which the farmers have been placed through action resultant upon the attempt to keep the annuities here.  In so describing the situation, I am neither blaming nor praising the attitude of the Government in their attempt to retain the annuities.  It would be a very proper thing to retain these annuities if we were entitled to retain them, and even if the legal aspect of the case were against us, if it could be shown that we had a moral right to them.  One would be glad for the sake of the alleviation it would mean in the poverty which confronts this country.  Apart from the state of the cattle trade, there is at the present time a want of capital to develop this country as one would like to see it developed.</P>
    <P>The farmers have been forced into the forefront of this economic war.  On them lies the burden.  I have heard people, civil servants and others enjoying salaries and having a wage earning capacity as professional men, say with great patriotic enthusiasm that the farmers should not be grumbling about what has happened in the economic war.  They say: &ldquo;Back up the Government by paying your rates and annuities in due time and everything will come right.&rdquo;  That was their vague way of encouraging the farmers and when one asks: &ldquo;Would you like to forego your salary as a contribution to the economic war for even one year, let alone for an indefinite period?&rdquo;  the reply is: &ldquo;Oh I have nothing to do with it, you know it is all about your cattle.&rdquo;  It is all about our cattle!  And the idea is to collect the annuities from year to year for the good of the country, these salaried gentlemen included, and not to hand back the total to the farmers who pay them!  Nor would this Government be <Col N="125" /> so foolish, if it was their intention to hand back one hundred per cent. to the farmers from whom the annuities were collected, or be so tied up in red tape, as to collect them at all.  If it is the farmer who is going to get these annuities, the farmer who has them and the farmer who has not, what is the use of collecting them from him and returning them to him again? That is my reply to the salaried gentlemen who say: &ldquo;It is your business to bear the brunt of the economic war and to pay all your just debts in addition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Anyone who knows much about agriculture knows that one cannot knock blood out of a turnip, and to try to collect the annuities or any other debts from a very large percentage&mdash;more than fifty per cent. of the farmers of the country as far even as the last June annuities are concerned&mdash;is trying to knock blood out of a turnip.  I say here to-day that if consideration is not given the plight of the farmer, a plight brought about through no fault of his own&mdash;you have the fine record which President Wilson quoted here to-day &mdash;&mdash;</P>

I take it, as Senator Wilson has stated it, that it is true. That is proof that the farmer has certainly done his part in trying to pay his way in the past.  The farmer would pay now if he was able.  I know, as one living among the people, and being part of the farming community of this country, that they are not able to pay now.  That means that we must get some consideration, and consideration upon the right lines, not through any shibboleths on new departures in the methods of farming but on lines pursued for years past.  Will-o'-the-Wisp lines of development are of no value. The farmer eked out his livelihood in the past; he knows from experience how he should act.  He knows the methods his forefathers pursued in <Col N="126" /> making their lands pay.  I say he is entitled to get some consideration now if he is to survive as the carrier of the greater part of the business of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Bill, in discussing the cattle trade there is one aspect in which I think we are contributing to our own deception, that is when we argue as if the situation was due to some fortuitous and unfortunate act of the British Government.  That is the view to be drawn from what President de Valera said here, and from what Senator Connolly said.  President de Valera said it would be a lucky thing if Ireland were trapped into a reconsideration of this commercial union with England.  We all know what Senator Connolly envisaged in Geneva with regard to the cattle trade collapsing everywhere.  He thought it might collapse in Ireland and he said it would collapse.  We are apt to forget that this was a determined, deliberate act against this country, whether performed with a vote-catching object, by promising that young men in the West would get the ranches or not, I do not know, but very likely.  What would they do with the ranches if the beef which they produced on them was cut off from exportation?  We are told that England is almost independent of store cattle at the present moment.  Why she has not become so long ago I do not know.  They have plenty of smooth well-watered pasture lands at hand without even a chicken upon them, still they come over here and buy our cattle. In the confused account we get of prices to-day we are told that England may have to put her hand in her pocket to pay.  One would have thought that we should have acknowledged that we possessed access to the most enhanced cattle market in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could have got almost any conditions in settlement of the annuities question.  But now we are told not so much for the purpose of withholding the annuities but purely as a parallelism of conditions that we would be very lucky if we were trapped into losing our cattle trade.  Here it would seem we are to engage in the business <Col N="127" /> of self-immolation.  From the purely trade point of view we should almost welcome doubling the annuities in order to secure and preserve our cattle trade.  It would be worth an extra million to bring up our annual export trade beyond what it is at present.  If it was any other business it would require 15 or 16 per cent. expenditure to lead to an increased export of several millions extension in the value of our trade.  Yet we are told that it is a lucky thing if our commercial trade with England should be lost.</P>
    <P>Senator Connolly told us that this new economic war has been thrust upon us.  That is what he told the people, and that the annuities would be given back to the people.  As Senator Garahan said, why go to all this trouble of collecting the annuities and then paying them back?  If they are intended to reach the farmers, why have to provide all this extra service so that they may reach their destination? Why take them out of the farmers' pockets at all?  But in discussing the loss of the cattle trade, that was surely offering a temptation to England to make herself for ever independent of us, we must not think we are dealing with a lot of convergencies of expenditure.  It was the deliberate policy of President de Valera and Senator Connolly and there is not a single word on record to show that the most fertile land in the world might not be left as derelict as the Sahara.  Because of something said at Geneva we were told there was no cattle trade in places where they had to kill their veal.  It is like the man at the North Wall who said: &ldquo;I do not see any bullocks here.  It is a pity we have none in Ireland.&rdquo;  But it will never happen us that we will be as infertile as these regions to which Senator Connolly referred.  The Government policy is to destroy our cattle trade with England.  Senator Connolly did not deny that.  Let us not pretend that this is to some extent more or less to be attributed to the deliberate policy of the British.  It is not.  It would be a wise thing for the directors of any company to advance an <Col N="128" /> equivalent sum to the annuities in order to extend a trade equal to our cattle trade with England.  We only get six per cent. of the universal trade of England.  Our trade with them in that direction ought easily to be increased by six or seven millions a year. We should not have carried the war into the treasure house of the savings of the Irish people.  Despite the Government's suspicion of the English people we must not distrust the industry, the energy and the dependability of Britain.  The amount of our investments in Great Britain may be two thousand millions, or it may not.</P>
    <P>There are two growths of the wealth of the Irish nation.  One is the asset that we possess in our market in Britain and the other is that of flesh and blood.  That cannot be very nicely calculated, nor can the amount of money entrusted to the perfidious Saxon be nicely calculated.  The war is against both these.  It is against both the resources and the wealth of the country.  It is the second round with England.  It does not touch the English people; it is really an action against the Irish people.  I asked an Englishman why it was that they did not raise their own stores.  Of course I realised, at the moment, that I was playing England's game&mdash;giving a hint to them, although it was only about a month ago.  I said it is amazing to me that you do not raise your own stores, and he said: &ldquo;My answer may be more amazing to you still.  Poverty!  We have only two million farmers and most of them are dairy farmers.  And how could we allocate to them what would be the equivalent of the value of the Irish cattle trade.  What would that mean?  Supposing it was a subsidy and it only meant £10 per head of cattle, it would amount to forty million.&rdquo;  So this war is the considered policy of the Government and we are to be mulcted in order to gratify that policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I had better deal with the points raised by Senator Guinness first.  He drew my attention to the Schedule to the Appropriation Bill, and particularly, I think, to item 16 dealing with the provision to be made for pensions, superannuation, compensation and additional and other allowances and gratuities under sundry statutes.  He asked me whether, in view of the fact that these pensions were already being paid by the British Government, it was right that the amount that would be required to recoup the British Government in respect of these payments should be included in the present Appropriation Bill.  I think, in that connection, it is well to point out&mdash;lest any member of the Seanad should be under any misapprehension in regard to it&mdash;that the Appropriation Bill does not compel the Minister for Finance to spend this money, it merely confers upon him the power to make certain issues out of the Central Fund of the State, the only restriction upon that power being that in respect of certain definite items, set out in detail in the Schedule, the amount provided for these items shall not be exceeded.  The fact that item 16 is included in the Schedule does not compel the Minister to pay out the £1,179,000 which was formerly paid in recoupment to Great Britain for the money she expended in paying pensions to members of the Royal Irish Constabulary.  But it does give the Minister power, within his discretion, so far as it is in conformity with the general policy of the Government, to make this payment.  If circumstances arise in which it is not necessary to make these payments the Minister may not make them.</P>

      <P>That it can be retained.  Yes.  The only thing is that the Minister is not entitled to do in respect of any particular item of the Schedule, is to exceed the amount set against that item, without coming back to the Dáil for authority to make such excess payment.  For instance, in regard to the particular item No. 16 in the Schedule against which there is charged £1,653,243 the Minister, except in very grave and unusual circumstances when it might not be possible to secure the authority of the Dáil, could not spend £1,700,000 for pensions, superannuation and allowances and other items.  But he may spend any less sum than that, that the general policy of the Government warranted.  The position we are in with regard to this and to item No. 8&mdash;Local Loans Fund&mdash;is that at the present moment these moneys are in dispute. It may be that, before the end of the financial year, the dispute will have terminated satisfactorily; that we shall retain all these moneys, or that some part of them will have to be paid away.  If we retain all these moneys it will not be necessary for us to impose additional taxation which might otherwise have to be imposed in order to meet expenditure which might be incurred under item 73, which is &ldquo;For a Grant-in-Aid to a fund required to meet disbursements arising out of and in the course of the present emergency &mdash;£2,000,000.&rdquo;  If we retain a part of them, the provision which would have to be made to meet expenditure under item 73 would be correspondingly reduced. The point I am making is that there are in this Appropriation Bill alternative items.  As against item 73, which is for a Grant-in-Aid to meet the emergency, we can put item 8, item 16 and a host of other small items amounting, roughly, I think, to about £2,172,000 in a normal year: that accordingly as the dispute develops, or is settled, we shall have available the moneys to provide for the emergency which has arisen out of the dispute or for the position which would be created by a settlement of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that the Government, looking still for a settlement, hoping that notwithstanding the manner in which this issue has been <Col N="131" /> clouded on the other side of the water, hoping that Great Britain will realise that our claim to retain the annuities and the R.I.C. pensions has a sound foundation in equity and in law and, therefore, will be prepared to remove the penal impositions upon our exports to that country and thereby remove the need for the provision which has to be made in item 73&mdash; the Government believing still that justice and right will in the end prevail, that we shall be able to retain the annuities and to retain the R.I.C. pensions, but at the same time leaving our minds open to be convinced, if conviction is possible, upon the evidence and the history of this matter that Great Britain may be right, is making the necessary provision here.  We have asked the Dáil to give us authority to provide these moneys, if necessary, out of the Central Fund, and, should it be impossible in the current year to meet the resultant expenditure out of the ordinary proceeds of revenue, to raise them by borrowing. That is the principle which underlies the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want it, however, to be taken, nor do the Executive Council want it to be taken, that they have for a moment weakened in their conviction that we are rightfully entitled to keep these moneys.  At the same time we have to realise that this dispute cannot go on indefinitely: that we cannot continue to tax our people for an indefinite period in order to ease our exporter's position in a situation which is not of our own creation.  There are two parties to this dispute.  We have entered it in a perfectly reasonable frame of mind, anxious to secure a settlement, a just settlement, from the outset, we are still anxious to secure that settlement.  We have been met by a refusal to consider our claim on any other ground except our inability to pay.  That is an attempt to impose humiliation on our people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We will not withdraw from the attitude which we have taken in that regard and, instead of standing up for our rights, crawl on our knees and ask for charity.  Because we have taken up that attitude there appears to have grown up in the minds of the people in Great Britain that we are a stubborn and stiff-necked race&mdash;&mdash;</P>

With a view to securing that result we have had imposed upon us penal tariffs.  We feel that when the position has been created, not by our act but by the act of the other parties to this dispute, it would be wrong, as I was saying, for us to continue to tax our people in order to ease the hardships arising out of the emergency.  If some settlement of the dispute is not arrived at at an early date we will propose to withhold any issues from the Central Fund in respect of items 16 and 8 and the other minor payments which are covered by a considerable number of items in the Appropriation Bill, and utilise these moneys instead to provide the £2,000,000 required to finance the emergency as set out under item 73 of the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked if the Schedule fully represented our commitments.  It does, with the exception of item 73&mdash;and one other.  It is estimated that the total cost of the present bounties for the year ending 31st March next will be £2,248,000.  We have as against that the amount which is in the Suspense Account.  It already exceeds £2,500,000, and before the end will, I think, reach about £3,200,000. So that we have, in the moneys which <Col N="133" /> we already hold, much more than sufficient to meet any payment which may arise out of item 73.  I said that this represented a total payment to be made this year.  It does with one exception which I ought to have made clear.  Arising out of the recent decision of the Government to permit those who so require it to fund the annuities due in respect of the November and December gales under the 1923 Land Act, we may possibly require an additional sum of £580,000 to meet the interest and sinking fund charges on the 4½ per cent.  Land Bonds.</P>
    <P>I do not know how much of that we may need.  I heard a Senator commenting on the manner in which the farmers have paid up the annuities for the last gale.  I thought that in view of the many attempts made to prevent the farmers from paying these annuities; in view of the covert and open incitements to them not to pay these annuities; in view of the offer of free legal advice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to any farmer who refused to listen to the exhortation of the Government that the payment of these annuities was a patriotic duty which any man who was in a position to do so ought to discharge; in view of the fact that certain prominent individuals have told them that, if the Government did not collect these annuities in order to pay them over to Great Britain, the Government had no moral right to collect the annuities at all; in view of the campaign which has been carried on through the country on these lines, I think it is an extraordinary fact that, out of 490,000 farmers in this country, over 400,000 paid their annuities, and it shows that the farmers, at any rate, are prepared to stand behind the Government.</P>

      <P>They have come in at an increased rate ever since.  The British tariffs have not prevented farmers from paying the annuities&mdash;at least, they have not prevented that section of the farmers who regard themselves as Irishmen first.  Of the 90,000 who have not paid, there are about 16,000 whose inability to pay has been chronic over an extended period, and there is a balance which may be divided up between those who have been peculiarly hit by the present emergency and whose positions are really so much worse than they were last year that they are not able to pay, but I do not think that they constitute the larger part of that balance.  I think that, in addition to that, the number of people who could pay and would not pay probably exceeds that, but, even assuming that half of the 70,000 who are left were people who could not pay under present circumstances, we are left, out of the 490,000 farmers in this country, with the small remnant of about 30,000 who have been influenced by the widespread campaign which has been carried on during the past four months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly certain that the great bulk of the farmers will do in November and December what they did in May and June&mdash;that those who can pay readily will pay and that, when the year closes, we shall find that we shall not have to provide for anything like so great a sum as £580,000 to meet the interest and sinking fund charges on the 4½ per cent.  Land Bonds.  The position, therefore, is that, at the end of the year, if some settlement is not arrived at before then, we shall have in the Suspense Account about £3,200,000, or we may possibly have withdrawn some of the money before that, if the position of the Exchequer requires that it should be withdrawn. As against that, we shall have to provide for the expenditure out of the grant-in-aid to meet the emergency <Col N="135" /> at present which, if continued at the present rates, would be £2,248,000.  If we add to that another £300,000 to meet the deficiency in respect of annuity payments under the 1923 Act, we shall have about £2,500,000 as a charge against the £3,200,000 in the Suspense Account.</P>
    <P>As to the reactions of the whole on the Budget position, I am not able to give any forecast at this moment, for the reason that, owing to the present circumstances, it has not been possible to form any authoritative estimate as to the produce of the revenue up to 31st March, 1933.  In that connection, however, there are some figures which, I think, are of peculiar interest.  I find that from the last return I have&mdash;the return for 19th November, 1932&mdash;the total revenue receipts into the Exchequer from 1st April, 1932, to 19th November, 1932, amounted to £15,031,837, while for the corresponding period last year, they amounted to £14,457,718, an increase in revenue this year over the same period last year of £580,000. On the expenditure side, the total issues out of the Exchequer from 1st April to 19th November this year amounted to £15,411,992 and, for the corresponding period last year, £15,078,604, or an increase of £333,000 over last year to be set against the increase in the revenue of £574,000 over the corresponding period last year, showing a net reduction&mdash;I am making mental calculation&mdash;of about £240,000 in the deficit as compared with this time last year.</P>
    <P>I have said that it was not possible in view of the possibility&mdash;I am not saying the probability&mdash;that there may be great changes in the surrounding circumstances to make any authoritative or dependable estimate of the position of the Exchequer at the end of the year. We can only make some attempt to gauge that by referring to the actual position as compared with our estimates, at the date when the Budget was introduced, as disclosed by the revenue returns.  On the Inland Revenue side, it was estimated that the various duties then imposed&mdash;Estate Duties, Stamp Duties, Income Tax, Excess Profits Duties&mdash;would show an <Col N="136" /> increase of £1,477,000.  In actual fact, to date the Inland Revenue has an increased yield of £559,000 and the most productive period of the year is yet to come.</P>
    <P>On the Customs and Excise side, it was estimated that the total increased yield would have been £460,000.  In actual fact, up to date, Customs and Excise have yielded an increase of £773,000.  It seems to me that, looking at those figures, it appears as if our anticipations in regard to revenue were going to be somewhat exceeded.</P>
    <P>While it is true that the revenue has been much more resilient than we anticipate it would be, there have, on the other hand, been disappointments. Senator Sir John Keane referred to one heavy disappointment &mdash;but not a vexatious disappointment &mdash;the fact that the new protective tariffs which we thought would produce £910,000, have shown a tendency to fall very considerably short of that, so that it is anticipated, at the present moment, that they will not bring in very much more than £250,000.  I have said that that, from the point of view of the Minister for Finance, is a grave disappointment, but, as I said, it also is not vexatious, because it does show that the duties have been effective in stopping the import of articles which could be made here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Or done without.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Or done without &mdash;possibly, in present circumstances, not a very undesirable thing, if they are articles of a purely luxury nature.  It does show, at any rate, that the new duties have been effective as protectionist weapons.  They have excluded from our markets a number of things which could be made here and it indicates, whether people are doing without them now, possibly because of the fact that it takes some time to build, equip and organise new factories, or possibly because some people are making up their minds to tighten their belts and spend as little as possible in order that they may see this thing through, that, at some time or another, the demand for these goods will grow up again and will be met, either by factories which are now <Col N="137" /> being organised and equipped, or by new factories which will be started as soon as the public demand warrants it.  I am not in a position to form any opinion as to what exactly has been the consequence of the stoppage of these imports.  From the returns given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce from time to time, I am inclined to think that the principal consequence has been that a considerable number of new industries have been started, or are in process or organisation, and, if started are providing employment for considerable numbers of our own people.</P>
      <P>Amongst the other points I think on which Senator Sir John Keane was anxious to have some information was the position with regard to &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; in salaries.  Frankly, that has been a much thornier problem than the Government anticipated.  We realise our obligations to the taxpayers, but we have also found that a considerable number of people regarded themselves as having very fixed and definite rights in this matter.  There was a great conflict of opinion as to what might be reasonably borne by one class of public servant as compared with what might reasonably be borne by another class of public servant, and in order to have some advice and some guidance in that matter the Government appointed a Committee to consider it.  That Committee has now reported.  I am at present considering the reports, and I hope the Government will be in a position to take such action as it considers the present circumstances justify, at a very early date.</P>
      <P>With regard to the savings in administration we have not been able to set up machinery owing to the fact that special measures arising out of the dispute had to be taken, and that the time of the Dáil and the time of the Government Departments has been fully occupied in formulating and in giving practical effect to the constructive policy of the Government.  It has not been possible for me to devise the necessary machinery or to secure the legislative authority which I think may be necessary in order to bring about these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think savings from <Col N="138" /> over-estimation will be affected at all by the present position.  The Seanad will remember that in preparing the Budget we took credit in that regard for a very much smaller proportion of the total estimates than my predecessor was in the habit of doing. I thought it might be necessary to do that, possibly in view of the special circumstances with which we may be faced this year.  I am satisfied that the amount for which I took credit in regard to over-estimation has not been encroached upon in any way, and that the real figures I gave in that regard still stand.  I am not going to conceal from the House that it is a serious, and a great disappointment to me not to have been able to make the economies in the salaries of public servants which I hoped I would be able to make.  I am very sorry it has not been possible to secure agreement with any branch of the service where agreement was required or asked, and that it may possibly be necessary for us, in view of the failure to secure that agreement, to take special steps to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>I am very sorry that I have not been able to set up the special machinery which I thought might usefully investigate and examine the administrative methods in Government Departments.  I hope when a satisfactory solution of the present dispute is found, that I shall be able to formulate these proposals and bring them before the Oireachtas in due course.  At the same time the fact that we have not succeeded in making these savings has not, I believe, shaken the fundamental soundness of the Budget.  If we have been disappointed in regard to these items, on the other hand, our anticipations have been more than fulfilled by the extraordinary resiliency that the revenue has shown.  The figures I have given you in regard to Inland Revenue show that there is a strong indication that our anticipations will be fulfilled, and in regard to Customs, there is every indication that our expectations will be exceeded.  I have shown you that this year, just approaching the critical period&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that included in the items of expenditure given are all the moneys put into the Suspense <Col N="139" /> Account&mdash;speaking roughly, the deficit is almost £240,000 less than it was at this period last year.  I should say, too, that if we have been disappointed by the yield from the protective duties, the Exchequer has benefited to a considerable extent by the Emergency Duties, and it is probable, as the British decide to pay more and more of these duties&mdash;and they have shown an increasing inclination to pay them&mdash;as that inclination grows stronger the yield from these duties will be increased, and that these will to some extent repair the deficiency which has arisen in connection with the protective duties.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is necessary for me to say very much more. I would have liked, if time had permitted, to have dealt at more length with the point raised by Senator Guinness in connection with the Local Loans Fund.  I think the Senator was stating an argument somewhat analogous to that made by the British Government in regard to the land annuities, that these were debts from private individuals due to the British Government. We say that they are the debts of private individuals due in the most part to the late Government of Great Britain and Ireland, and that as successors we are entitled to a fair share, and to a due proportion of the assets of the Local Loans Fund, including those advances made to Irish farmers.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I wish to refer to one point.  The Minister appears to be of opinion&mdash;at all events, he has made the suggestion&mdash;that those who are opposed to the annuities-cum-tariff policy of the Government, of which he is a member, have advised farmers&mdash; and have advised generally&mdash;not to pay the annuities.  I am as much opposed to that part of the Government's policy as anybody, and I do not regard myself as an exceptional person, but I certainly never gave such advice; would not approve of it, and would give precisely contrary advice. I do not believe I am exceptional in that.  I believe there are a great many of the same opinion.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister be in a position to give more detailed and precise information with regard to future annuity payments?  I am referring to annuity payments funded, because I think the Minister for Lands and Fisheries said the fund would be open to anyone, irrespective of income, while the Minister said it would be only open to those unable to pay. I would like if the Minister would be more precise about &ldquo;inability to pay.&rdquo; Is there going to be an investigation of the circumstances of each individual who professes inability to pay?  I suggest that that would be a most inquisitorial, a very arbitrary and a very dangerous power, or is it going to be based on Schedule (b) on the profits of the industry?  If you are going to investigate the whole of a man's private circumstances, to judge whether he is able to pay a charge on a farm which is losing money, you are entering on very big ground.</P>

      <P>I do not want to deal with the bigger questions under discussion, but Senator Gogarty commended, and quite rightly, Senator Counihan for quoting certain valuable figures.  I think it just as well to emphasise their importance.  They dealt with the agricultural returns of England and Wales and the numbers of live stock and Senator Counihan pointed out that in the years 1930 and 1932 there had been a very great increase in the cattle population in England <Col N="141" /> and Wales.  The Senator mentioned 500,000, and pointed to that as a warning to Irish stock owners as to the tendency in England, and to the danger there was for the Irish cattle trade of an increase in the number of live-stock in Great Britain.  It is important that the people of this country should take note of that tendency in England, and the fact that the Senator drew attention to it has some reference to the position of the markets for Irish cattle in England to-day.  The figures Senator Counihan gave, to the 4th of June in each year 1930 and 1932 show that they had no reference whatever to the existing dispute.  They show that there has been an increase in the number of cattle of one year and under two years old of 11 per cent. in those two years, and of calves under one year of 20 per cent.  Those figures, therefore, have nothing to do at all with the position that has developed owing to the dispute, and yet they contain the warning to this country of the danger of dependence upon this live-stock trade exported to England. I think it would be very well worth while examining if some authoritative estimate could be made&mdash;I do not know whether it would be possible&mdash;of what would have been the effect on the British live-stock prices if there had been a free flow of live-stock cattle into England during the last few months.  If there had been that free flow, would there not have been a still further decline in the price of live-stock?</P>

      <P>Senator Counihan may have reason for that interjection, but it seems to me to contravene all experience, and certainly to contravene all economic theory of the effect of an increase of supply on the prices in a given demand.  Is it to be assumed that, with an increase of supply in Ireland, there would have been concurrently an increased demand in England? I think that it would mean a still further decline.</P>

      <P>There is another matter that I think might be recorded. Two speakers to-day have referred, not definitely or positively, to the position of Canadian cattle in Britain.  I think it well to have on record a statement made by the Canadian Minister for Agriculture in August last.  There had been a good deal of boosting during the course of the Ottawa Conference as to the hopes of selling or exporting a large supply of Canadian live-stock to Britain, and the Canadian Minister for Agriculture tried to, and did, prick that bubble, because he said, even in August last, before the most recent slump in live-stock trade had occurred: &ldquo;As much as 25,000 head of cattle would be shipped to the United Kingdom next year from Canada, even if the restrictions now imposed upon the live-stock trade between Canada and Great Britain were lifted.&rdquo;  Those are the Minister's own words and they were emphasised in private conversation.  I am impressed with the importance in the course of this discussion&mdash;and I would ask the Minister for Finance to convey this idea at least to the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;of obtaining something reliable and accurate in regard to price movements.  I suggest that it would be of value for the purpose of assessing the worth or the extent of our losses or gains owing to the present <Col N="143" /> position, if we could have comparative figures as to prices in the North of Ireland.  Not in England, because English prices really are not very valuable for comparative purposes; but if we had comparative prices in the North of Ireland of the various classes of produce and live-stock, we would be able to have some real information on which we could build some conclusions as to the effect of the present tariffs or the present embargo policy.  The stories we hear from the North of Ireland are almost as doleful as the stories we hear from different parts of the Saorstát, but stories of that kind are not much good unless they are backed up by evidence of fact.</P>
      <P>I want to ask a question of the Minister on a matter which is very foreign from these matters we have been dealing with.  On two or three occasions in the past, I have asked Ministers if they would do for us what has been done for the Canadians, and that is to publish a copy, or to make available for public reading a copy, of the Governor-General's patent.  Latterly, I have seen extracts from the Governor-General's patent in the newspapers and I have not been able to find where they have been given publicity. I ask the Minister to convey to the right quarter that the patent issued in respect of the first Governor-General and of the second Governor-General should be made available to Deputies and members of the Seanad by having them placed in the library.  It is rather important to anybody interested in constitutional questions to examine how far these patents depart from the published patents of the Canadian Governors-General, how far, if at all, the second patent differed from the first and for the purpose of finding out whether there will be any difference in respect of the third patent, if there is to be one.  It is quite obvious that this record is available because on several occasions lately I have seen extracts in the public Press, but I have not been able to find the available document in any publication whatever.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that public business prevented me from <Col N="144" /> having an opportunity of hearing the speech of Senator Counihan, because on this question of cattle and tariffs Senator Counihan knows his subject just as Senator St. John Gogarty knows the particular branch of the surgical profession which he professes. But I did hear Senator Gogarty on bullocks.  I was amazed at the width of Senator Gogarty's sympathies and I could imagine while he was speaking that I heard the bullock saying &ldquo;Boo&rdquo; and Senator Gogarty saying &ldquo;Boo&rdquo; back.</P>
      <P>Senator Gogarty made some references to the President of this State and to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs of this State&mdash;serious men, honourable men.  I will not pay to Senator Gogarty the compliment of even appearing to resent what he said. I will, however, deal with two matters referred to by Senator Gogarty.  In the first place, he said that the President of the Free State and his Party were anxious for a quarrel with the English people.  I think he hinted that we bore enmity to the English people.</P>

      <P>I do not think that it is fair of Senator Gogarty to use an opprobrious term about the President or about the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I do not resent it, because I do not think that the Senator, apart from his position in this House, is of sufficient consequence to deserve a reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were, however, two matters to which Senator Gogarty referred. He did say that we bore resentment and enmity against the English people. I am a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I have long been associated with the Fianna Fáil Party.  I have been on their Executive since the Party <Col N="145" /> was founded.  So far as I know, no member of the Party has any feeling of hatred against the English people.  We wish them well, but Ireland comes first with us.  The rights of Ireland come first, and we are determined by every lawful means, by every honourable means, to assert the rights of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The next matter which was referred to by Senator Gogarty is this, that we are not paying our debts to Great Britain.  I would pass that by if it were merely an observation of Senator Gogarty, but when he said that it reminded me that Senator Jameson on a former occasion had said that these international payments, which are now in dispute, were debts due by Ireland to England, and it is Senator Jameson whom I am answering now.  I do submit to this House that these payments amounting to something between £3,000,000 and £5,000,000 a year are not debts due by the Free State to Great Britain.  They are claimed by Great Britain as demands lawfully due to Great Britain.  We deny that these payments are lawfully due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>We say that these payments are not lawfully due to Great Britain.  We have, in elaborate arguments, which I summarised in this House on one occasion, shown that in point of law we are not bound to make these payments, and a curious thing has happened, and that is that the British spokesmen have not denied the logic of our case.  They have not denied any proposition in law that we have put forward, but they have said: &ldquo;Your President, the President of your Executive Council, in 1923, agreed to make the payment of the proceeds of the land annuities to Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They do not deny that at that <Col N="146" /> moment the Irish Free State was entitled in law, by the law of England and the law of Ireland, to the proceeds of the land annuities.  They said that the spokesman of Ireland, the President of the Executive Council of the Free State, at the time made the agreement, and that we are bound by the agreement.  Let me take that. What I submit now is that we are not bound by an agreement made by the President of the Executive Council. The revenue of the Irish Free State cannot be alienated by any man or even by a Cabinet.  It can only be alienated by the vote of the Dáil and the Seanad, by an Act of Parliament.</P>

      <P>The English spokesman also said that it was an agreement made by the President of the Irish <Col N="147" /> Free State.  It was not.  It was an agreement made by the head of a Department, a great Department, the second man in the Free State, the Minister for Finance.  Therefore, they are absolutely wrong on every legal question connected with the annuities. They know it, and knowing they are wrong, they use the bludgeon.  If they thought they were right about them they would not have imposed tariffs which are injurious to them.  The plains of Meath, Westmeath and Tipperary were a great asset to the English people.  They were just as useful to the English people as if they had been joined to Lancashire, because out of the plains of Meath and these other counties the English people got their food and their supplies.  It was always our principle that these lands should go to the sustenance of men rather than cattle.  We find now that the plains of Meath can go to the sustenance of men and of cattle as well and that by a proper cultivation of these lands we can have more people and more cattle as well.</P>
      <P>My friend, Senator Gogarty, seems to be rather restive.  Restive for what?  Restive for his friend the bullock, is it?  Because I assure him that under a proper system of cultivation he will have as many bullocks as he likes.  These are the only comments to which I wished to advert.  I wish to speak of them not because Senator Gogarty in the course of his remarks referred to them, but because on a former occasion Senator Jameson, whom I have always found in this House to be a sensible, patriotic Irishman, referred to them also.</P>

      <P>We have asserted every time we got a chance that this Government are nothing more than defaulting agents.  They have no right whatever to get this money.  Neither has the British Government any right to the money.  They are only agents, both this Government and the British Government.  This money is due by the Irish farmer only to the people who lent it to him, and all Senator Comyn's eloquence, if he were to speak here for the next ten years, will not change that fact.  As far as cowardice is concerned, it is the present Irish Government that is cowardly.  They are afraid to go to arbitration, because they know that they have not the smallest chance, legally or morally, of succeeding.  I think the Minister for Finance has very little sense of humour.  He said that they would not go to the British Government and make any appeal to them on the score of the inability of the Irish farmer to pay.  At the same time, they have announced that they are going to make the unfortunate farmers come to them and allow them to conduct an inquisition into their private affairs, make paupers of them, make the Irish farmers acknowledge that they are unable to pay, otherwise they will be fleeced, brought into court and processed for the land annuities. The Irish farmer is not a fool, I should like to remind the Minister for Finance, and he will find that out very soon.</P>

      <P>To return to our muttons and get back to the Appropriation Bill I must say that I am glad that the Minister for Finance came here to-day because we were rather in a fog.  I have just been looking over <Col N="149" /> what I said on the last day and I find that I am reported as having said that I would have thought that the Minister for Finance would have come here to explain that the amounts which are mentioned in this Appropriation Bill are not the amounts which will be really required.  Until the Minister came here the explanation never dawned on me.  I was in the same position as Senator Guinness when he asked his question.  I thought that this was a Bill which was to apply certain sums out of the Central Fund to the service of the State and that it was an actual statement of the reasons why the moneys were required and why the taxes imposed under the Budget and elsewhere were put on to meet these liabilities.  Now I see that large items in these two or three millions are not required at all unless the Minister chooses to pay them.  If this were a business Budget, or a business balance sheet, I think that these amounts which the Minister says are in the hands of the Government of the day to pay or not to pay, should have been entered as special sums, as contingent liabilities.  We would have then seen what our own affairs cost.  We would have seen and would have known the size of the amount that was in dispute. We would have arrived at a very clear statement of what the whole matter is. Until the Minister came here and answered Senator Guinness and told him exactly what these things were, that these were only contingent liabilities, it was totally impossible for us to form an idea of what the figures in the Appropriation Bill were at all.  Now we have got our explanation and we know where we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does strike one that it is a very bad state of affairs for the country to know that the balancing of the Budget will depend on the keeping of these sums which are lodged to some Suspense Account and which are not really going to be met as far as this Appropriation Bill is concerned.  If they are applied to balance the Budget and to save us from further taxation that means that they are not going to be paid at all over to those who claim them on the other side of the water, <Col N="150" /> that we are face to face as long as that policy is followed with a continuance of this struggle.  Whatever Senator Comyn may say, anybody who has sat in this House the whole of the afternoon and listened to what we were told by people who know the business of farming thoroughly, who are themselves farmers, as to what will happen to the greatest industry we have in the country if this dispute goes on, must think that, if the balancing of our Budget means the continuation of this war, a balancing of the Budget secured by retention of these sums, then we are in a parlous condition.  I would rather see our Budget balanced by some methods other than those which propose the retention of the sums which are in dispute and the carrying of them into the Budget to meet our liabilities.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad is of opinion that it is time for the Government to return to a policy of love for Ireland instead of hatred for England.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a little unfair and a little lack-witted of Senator Comyn to seek to identify me with the subject of my speech on the loss of the cattle trade. It does not follow that one who speaks about bullocks should be bovine any more than that a barrister who defends a drunken man should necessarily be intoxicated.  Nor was it fair to say that I would not say before President de Valera's face what I may say now.  If he refers to the Hansard, he will see that I said some months ago to that gentleman's face that he was the most sinister silhouette that ever broke the genial light in our country. It is Senator Comyn now who has turned tail and cannot hear me repeat that with increased conviction. This motion which I put down is not an academical motion, but one that touches the cause of all the muddle, exasperation and misery that have come upon us since the return of the present Government.  How did this hate-fixation <Col N="153" /> arise?  It arose from a blunder, a misunderstanding, a false estimate of England's position and resources, and of the character, position and intentions of Great Britain.  It is not my concern to tell how this miscalculation of England's strength arose.  Great Britain was envisaged as going down-hill&mdash;the wish may have been father to the thought.  Anyway, with a supposedly sinking England, steps had to be taken to protect our country, to cut the painter to prevent it being dragged down with the Ruler of the Waves; so our geniuses scuttled their own boat!  The departure of the Fianna Fáil Party from the Chamber does not affect me, except that it cannot be thrown up against me that I speak behind their backs.  Nor am I speaking behind the back of President de Valera.  It was not I who sent him to discuss Manchuria at Geneva.</P>
    <P>Hate could not let the Fianna Fáil Party see anything good in England, not even a good market.  They have made miscalculations and it appeared wise to the Government, that is, chiefly Senator Connolly and President de Valera to take the precaution of anticipating hypothetic disaster in some future time by immediate ruin deliberately willed.  No one could say that they would sink with England. No one could say that they, the Government, let the country down.  Oh no, they would not go down with England next year or the year after. They would go down deliberately, and at once, and alone.  It reminds me of the proud toper who would not give it to his host to say that he had got drunk in his house but took the precaution of coming drunk.  Our Government approached the matter equally blinded.  But they found out their miscalculation.  And they proceeded to stir the wells of resentment and to racketeer the impulsive and indiscriminating patriotism of the most gullible public in Europe.  They did not hesitate to exploit the noble sentiments so roused for parochial, paltry and personal ends.  Patriotism was turned into a national poison, it became as pettifogging as those who misdirected it.  The noblest sentiment <Col N="154" /> of uncalculating and self-sacrificing love for the social unit, which is the nation, was turned into gall and hatred for half of our fellow-countrymen. For the first time in our history a wedge was driven in between patriotism and prosperity.  The identification of the patriot with the pauper was taking place.  The excitable voters did not see through the trick. It was simple for simpletons, and it was this: once get the poorer half of a nation to believe that their poverty gives them a sole right to patriotism, once get them to accept the suggestion that there is no good Irishman who is not a poor Irishman, and then you will not have much trouble catering for people who put up with poverty as their privilege.  The way was prepared for any amount of the intentional hardship which would ensue from the policy of our political Bombardier Billy Wells, who was about to endear himself to the great heart of the people as his prototype did by suffering still another knock out in another round with England.  A nation, or rather almost half a nation, devoted to failure, would surely accept him as its protagonist.  Hence, with values turned upside down he would not appear to be standing on his head. The slogan on all the (appropriately enough) dead walls &ldquo;Up, de Valera&rdquo; would suggest that he was only waiting to get up.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, what of the other half of Ireland which does not accept pauperism as its only title to patriotism? Ah, those who object to holy poverty are the enemies of Ireland !  Let loose your vials of invective on them; they are &ldquo;playing England's game.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I draw the attention of the Labour Party particularly to this interesting suggestion.  It is bad enough to try to cover up failure by telling us that the poorer people are the better patriots.  They are.  But there is a new monster, a new stage Irishman, the Plain Man.  The Plain Man has to be proud not because of his manhood, but because of his plainness, his shortcomings.  The Plain Man is intended to be our Irish version of the Communists, who for the first time in Europe claim rights because they are Communists, plain common men.  They proclaim the rights of the common place, rights of shortcomings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now when the Government took office there was never a time when the necessity of reviving outworn slogans and raising old alarms was less. Never was there a time when England was more ripe for friendship and never was this country presented with such an opportunity for gaining in honourable trade the place in the world for her families and children from which for centuries she complained that she had been thrust out.  Never was there a time when England had drawn more attention to her agreement with this country than this time.  She had called the world to witness that her word was her bond.  Never was there a time when we were safer or more ready to take advantage of the amenities and the arts of life and to use them as channels of the spirit of the nation&mdash; to escape from the curse of politics and demagogues.  But it was not to be.  There was to be no freedom for the Republican Ireland.  A man arose <Col N="156" /> bringing dark and evil days and black magic.  For his purposes the voters were to be kept in an atmosphere of political ferment: there was to be no genial Ireland of Liberality and the Arts.  The day was darkened.  He put a Cromwell in the soul of each of his dupes.  He made every man his own manacler, his own Cromwell&mdash;and the jailer he conjured up in him was hate. Hate froze the genial current and shrank the country's bravery and exchanged its national buoyancy for earnest dullness or impassioned claptrap. There was not a word about the country's livelihood.  That might do for the unromantic busybodies of the last Government whose extravagances and ambitions were satisfied by an income tax of 3/6 in the £.  There was not a word or a plan for what we could have had for half he cost this nation: a cultured Arcadia.  Not a word.  We were to follow him not to wealth but to war.  And he chose the time for his campaign, a privilege which was withheld from Marshals such as Alexander, Genghis Khan or Napoleon.  He could go to war when the enemy had gone away.  Oh, death, where is thy sting? It was we who got stung.  He is engaging Japan from Geneva, as he engaged England from Ennis.  But we are paying indemnities for these curious campaigns.  Our Celtic Calvin, predestined to failure, has gone to Geneva.  We must wait until the people find out that Meath is nearer than Manchuria.</P>
    <P>And our Postmaster has gone with him to &ldquo;face up&rdquo; to world perplexities while he turns his back to his own. This apostle and archetype of the worst stage-Irishman ever proposed for our acceptance, the Plain Man, is hobnobbing with very complex associates. We who are not lost in admiration are &ldquo;playing England's game.&rdquo;  What is England's game?  If it is tax collecting, President de Valera and Senator Connolly have won a victory.  The Irish nation was never so mulcted by all its external foes.  For the Senator's sinister &ldquo;Plain Man,&rdquo; and the poorest in the land, will have to pay taxes on indispensable commodities such as their half hundredweight of coal.  But hate <Col N="157" /> has gone one further than the notion that you must be a pauper before you can be a patriot.  Senator Connolly is the apostle if not the archetype of a new monster&mdash;the Plain Man.  This creature of his imagination is offered up for our acceptance as something to be admired.  &ldquo;The Plain Man will not stand for ... this or that.&rdquo;  In my case he will not stand for, as the Senator informed me&mdash;coming to this House in a motor car&mdash;that extravagant parade owing to taxes, and the Senator's exemption from them is now possible only for that dignity alone. The &ldquo;Plain Man&rdquo; is ugly, cantankerous, and conceived as being ripe for revolution at a moment's notice; particularly if the Opposition use their votes in some way,&mdash;unrevealed but left to the imagination,&mdash;that might not be acceptable to the Plain Man's traditious obscurities.  I think of the two, the pauper patriot and the Plain Man, the latter is the most sinister apparition that has ever emanated from spoilt ambition, spite and realised incompetence.  But examine the lure: Once you get a man to be proud of his shortcomings you can feed him on his own ordure.  The more shortcomings the more &ldquo;rights&rdquo;&mdash;a Belfast counterpart to the idea of the pauper patriot.  But it is no use telling the starving unemployed of Dublin to be proud of this translation unto plainness. That may do for the farmer's son who is getting poorer.  It was tried to some extent at the Ard-Fheis when the somewhat dissatisfied commons were told to turn their comments on glorious things such as the size of their gathering.  I may be solitary in my opinion when I think that we Irish are, deserving of a better destiny than a heritage of hate is likely to bring. We cannot be nourished on a diet of negations by the Spirit who Denies. There are others in the country who do not look to pauperism as a justification and who resent the implication of Plain Man.  If the country wishes to go downwards let us not forget that it can only do so by the co-operation of the Government, of Joseph's version of Pharaoh's dream, by the co-operation of the Seven Labour Members for the Seven Lean Years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="158" /> How is it to be remedied?  The first thing one should do is to make the country fool-proof.  Show up the bluff; and point out that they need not expect more from a machine than is in it.  The machines at the head of the State have failed signally and thoroughly in their two respective dimensions.  President de Valera has failed to show that he is a better man than Griffith or half as good.  And without entering Belfast to examine the fate of his enterprises Senator Connolly characteristically has at Edenderry added barrenness to the Bog of Allen!  Meanwhile, how have the Irish people fared?  The slums are with us still.  Already I detect a wail, a whinge. The Minister for Posts told us last Wednesday that the war was not of their own making.  It was not a &ldquo;second round.&rdquo;  It is to be presumed that it was thrust on them.  We know better.  But they want to enlist pity not for the country's but for their own plight.  If it was not of their own making there is the League of Nations and Mr. de Valera is Chairman.  What more could he want?</P>
    <P>It is a bad business to hate anybody but worse to hate England, not because of possible reprisals, for how could she possibly imagine that we have any hate left over when we have done so strangely by ourselves?  But England here has become identified with all that comes to us from Europe, all advances in civilisation, all advances in humanitarianism; those things which are indispensable for human life are pilloried in the general hate.  Everything becomes anathema save ruin and vulgarity.  We are to be fed on the negations of a progressive people&mdash; pauperism and plainness.  Is there no other way of not being English?  Is there no other way of being Irish? The cult of the Plain Man is Communism undisguised.  Plainness is its stigma.  It is this arrogance of this unambitious grasping iconoclastic brute that would do more damage to our religion than all the penal laws, the memory of which it is that doubtless is goading President de Valera to forget his advice to Nicaragua or Japan and refuse to deal amicably with our neighbours, with England now.  There <Col N="159" /> are no plain men in Ireland except one or two whose image and likeness, the Irish people will, I hope, never assume. There are poor men and weak men and badly housed and hungry men, but there is not one of those who if he were given a chance to be rich to-morrow would not be as respectable and as decent as the best in the land.  There is enough inborn nobility in the people who address themselves to a man's honour when they hail him to make a race of aristocrats the moment the hard frost of penury is thawed.  Has penury been put further away?  Have the people been given a chance to stand up and look the world in the face in their own right as Irishmen, members of the one race in Europe who were not stampeded standardised into mediocrity by the iron clogs and laws of Imperial Rome? No!  They are to be the Plain Men of this emigré from Belfast.  They are to revel in their plainness until, coupled with the discomfort of the still seething slums, they will find themselves defacing all that the nation held on to through years of real national struggles to preserve.  This is the real alienator, the real sender to Siberia of the genial people who are gifted to rise to heights of beauty and truth.  The makers of the Plain Men&mdash;&ldquo;I can be twice as ugly as you and we'll be great Irishmen then.&rdquo;  What death watch beetle has crept into the timbers of our roof-tree? What channering worm is under ground?</P>
    <P>If you once get those who look to you, those whose confidence you have engaged to become proud of their plainness because it gives them relief from the obligations and even the decencies of life, if you can cajole the people who put up with pauperism because it gives them a monopoly of patriotism and shortcomings become distinctions, you can feed them on their own ordure.  You may fool them for a time but not for a long time. This is a very well-stocked country. For a while the shop-keeper can consume his own shop; but he will be unable to relinquish it.  Next year those who look to him for even a small supply will find that he has not laid it <Col N="160" /> in.  It will be no use sending ukases to the farmer to raise stock to be communised. The inducement to a stock raiser is a market, not a commissar. A blow will have been struck at the immemorial wealth of Ireland.  Since history began the country's wealth, even its money, has been live-stock. The live-stock is worth many millions. We are told that the cattle trade is collapsing in foreign countries.  Its absence is most noticeable to Senator Connolly in those countries where it never existed.  And even if it did what would he know about it since where it does thrive he is bent on wiping it out.  The day of reckoning with the wreckers cannot be deferred.  They may attempt to side-step and evade the issue.  We may hear from them that they &ldquo;have gone as far as constitutional methods admit.&rdquo;  They may offer the ruined country to its &ldquo;rightful owners&rdquo; and expect to be included among its rightful revolutionary leaders.  But oh, no!  the specialists in failure will find it hard to escape in the smoke.  They may be reminded of their promises and asked where did they get a mandate from the country to beggar it and to betray it.</P>
    <P>Our Spartacus may lurk in an ashpit of extinct eruptions, but he, though he may ruin, is incapable of planning one single comely dwelling in his adopted land.  Now that he is in closer touch with the Japanese than the Irish he may learn from them a custom full enough of chivalry to be after his own heart.  It is known as &ldquo;honourable despatch,&rdquo; whereby a man who has served his country ill may pay by his valour for oblivion.  But like his tariffs he would pass hari-kari on to the farmers and we would fall even further short of the 17,000,000 subjects of his Imperial Irish dreams.</P>
    <P>It is too late to recapture a deliberately lost market.  But it is not too late to claim an Ireland that is not, in order to be Irish, necessarily a land of mist and gloom and bad feeling.  It is too late to avail ourselves of the British offer of trade facilities; but it is not too late to avoid bitterness and pusillanimity, the curse, not of Cromwell, but of Connolly.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House appears to me to have regard to issues of national importance.  With a great deal of what the mover of the motion said I am in agreement.  I should like to support the motion, but my difficulty is the form of it.  The motion, as it appears on the Order Paper, assumes that this economic war was launched out of hatred of Great Britain and not for love of Ireland. Now that is only a matter of opinion.  It is denied that it was launched out of hatred of England.  I do not know that it was so.  I do not know that it was launched for love of Ireland as one of these less advantageous forms of love.  It has certainly been a very expensive one and no doubt will prove to be.  If I talk about this, I am really speaking to the mover's speech and not to the motion. That does not seem to me to be a suitable one, and I do not propose to take any further part in the debate.</P>

      <P>Senator Gogarty's speech might have been appropriate to any of the items on the Order Paper to-day.  It could have been just as appropriate to the Pilotage Byelaw Confirmation Bill, or more particularly, to the Therapeutic Substances Bill. It will be interesting to the reader anyhow in a generation to come, but I do not think it had very much appropriateness to the motion.  When I first read the motion, indeed until the Cathaoirleach ruled it to be in order, I thought it was intended to be an insult to the Seanad, to the Dáil, to the Ministry and to the people who elected the Dáil, because it asks the Seanad to assume that the motive of the Government's policy was the morally degrading one of hatred.  If that is to be accepted, if that is to be the assumtion behind a motion which we are asked seriously to discuss, I had thought that it was clearly indicated <Col N="162" /> to be an insult to the various bodies that I have named.  On consideration I modified that view somewhat, and I was waiting for the Senator to tell us, in the course of his speech, at what point the change in the Government's policy occurred because the Seanad is asked to say that it is time for the Government to return to a policy of love for Ireland.  I take it from that that there is an admission that at one point in its career it had a policy of love for Ireland, but the Senator did not indicate when the change took place from which it should return.</P>
      <P>The motion can do no harm to Senator Gogarty.  It will be, if it is placed on the journals of this House, a sign to posterity that the House had no sensible regard for its dignity or its sense of the fitness of things, and I would hope that the Seanad would not allow such a motion to be placed on the journals of the House.</P>

      <P>When I read the terms of this motion it occurred to me, just as it has occurred to Senator Johnson, that it was an insult to this House. Now, knowing my sparkling young friend Senator Gogarty for a number of years, I take it that he did not expect the Seanad to take this matter seriously, as he does not take it seriously himself.  It occurred to me that it was a pity that you, Sir, have not the power to prevent the motion from appearing on the Order Paper.  In any deliberative assembly that I have ever been connected with, the Chairman had the power to prevent the agenda from being made the medium for ridicule by that body.</P>
