      <P>This Bill makes a number of alterations in some of the duties that have been in operation here.  Perhaps, a brief explanation of the changes is what the House desires. Sections 1 and 2 relate to the First and Second Schedules.  Section 3 imposes a duty upon lubricating grease. Lubricating greases are manufactured in the Saorstát in sufficient quantities to supply all the requirements of the Saorstát.  These greases are of first-class quality, and this duty is imposed for the purpose of excluding certain brands of grease imported here, not because of any special advantage either in quality or in price, but because of connections already existing and successful advertising.  Section 4 imposes a duty upon bread.  A duty upon bread, of course, is a necessary corollary of a duty upon flour.  The effect of the duty is to exclude all imported bread, with the exception that in certain districts in Donegal, where existing bakeries are not <Col N="366" /> adequate to supply all the requirements of the county, bread is being imported at the moment under licence.  That concession, however, is being gradually withdrawn.  A number of new bakeries have been started there and the existing bakeries are increasing the number of their ovens. As they become capable of supplying the districts around them, the importation of bread into this district is being prohibited.  In the other Border counties into which bread was imported there is no necessity for this concession because the existing bakeries are quite capable of supplying the demand and have been doing so since the operation of the duty.  In fact, the operation of the duty in certain districts has meant a decrease in the price of bread.</P>
      <P>Section 5 alters the duty on harness leather and harness.  Some time ago, following a report from the Tariff Commission, a duty was imposed on harness leather and harness, but that duty was found not to be adequate, mainly owing to large importations of second-hand harness which was sent in here for auction.  This harness could be invoiced at any price because the people were prepared to give any price for it.  This duty is now increased. Despite that increase, there will be considerable importation still, but the additional duty will enable the harness makers here to secure a larger part of the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 increases the duty on all shirts and collars and all component parts and accessories of shirts and and collars.  The duty on these articles was 15 per cent. and had been in operation for a number of years, and it was not increased when all the other duties on wearing apparel were increased on the occasion of the Budget this year.  Importation had practically ceased.  In fact, there was only one outside firm which was able successfully to maintain a footing here under the duty.  That firm has since opened a factory here and consequently the duty has been increased.  The trade is now able to supply all the requirements of the home market and some of them are looking for outside markets.  This section also alters the duty on embroidered <Col N="367" /> handkerchiefs and the component parts and accessories of such handkerchiefs.  The object of this duty is to give some help to Irish linen and to see that Irish linen hand-embroidered articles offered for sale will be Irish linen embroidered in Ireland.  There has been a large quantity of such goods offered for sale, described as hand-embroidered Irish linen, where the hand embroidering was actually done in China, Japan, Madeira and other such countries where a very low standard of living prevails.  The object of the duty is to keep that trade for Donegal.  Under this section, the duty is also increased on underwear of silk.  The value of the article in this case is very considerable in relation to the general level of prices and the existing rate of duty was not adequate to stop the importation of such articles here.  This also affects the hand embroiderers in Donegal, where very excellent work is done.</P>
    <P>Section 8 gives an exemption from cinematograph film duty in respect of films produced in the Saorstát, exported and subsequently reimported.</P>
    <P>Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 are the usual provisions contained in all Finance Acts.</P>
    <P>By the First Schedule duties are imposed, under Reference No. 1, upon hand-knitting yarns.  We had considerable difficulty in getting a definition which would include hand-knitting yarns and exclude other types of knitting yarns.  This definition was agreed to by everybody, including the hosiery manufacturers.  In certain cases, licences are being issued, but the purpose of the duty is to see that those that can be made here successfully will be made here.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 2 deals with articles made of gold, silver, electro-plate, platinum, copper, brass, bronze, or gunmetal, which articles are liable to duty under this Act or any other enactment, and which are engraved. The intention is to secure that the engraving of these articles, which can be done here and done very successfully, will be done within the country. <Col N="368" /> Reference No. 3 deals with date stamps and marking stamps made wholly or partly of rubber.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 4 deals with springs for mattresses.  Heretofore, assembled springs for mattresses were subject to duty.  Since that duty was imposed, however, a number of firms have installed machinery here for the manufacture of the component parts of these springs, and this Reference makes these parts subject to duty.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 5 deals with spectacles, monocles and other eye glasses. A number of firms here grind lens for eye glasses, and the object of the duty is to ensure that that business may be given to them.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 6 deals with cuff links, studs, hinge pins and ear-rings.  All these things, which are sold in considerable quantity, are being manufactured here.  A substantial increase in employment will result if the duty operates to exclude the importation of articles of that description.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 7 deals with certain articles of silver and gold.  The list was agreed to by manufacturers of certain articles, which articles are of a class made by hand.  The only silver and gold goods not made here are those stamped by machine.  Formerly, we had not only the whole home market here but a considerable outside trade as well.  That outside trade was largely based on sentiment, perhaps, but it is capable of being regained.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 8 deals with glue and size.  At one time we had quite a respectable export trade in these, which has been lost in recent years. In fact, even the home market was lost.  The principal of these firms undertook to re-start its factory if this duty were imposed and has, in fact, already done so.  There is a licence provision here because there is one class of size which is used by painters, which is a patented article and cannot be made here.  It was not possible to get a definition of that kind of size which would enable us to exclude it definitely.  Consequently, we have had to operate a licence provision.  It is quite easy for the Revenue Commissioners to distinguish that particular <Col N="369" /> size from all other types of size, but it has not been possible to get a definition of it.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 9 imposes a duty on fillers and flats for egg boxes imported separately.  There are two firms in the Saorstát&mdash;a third is about to start &mdash;for the manufacture of these fillers and flats.  They are equipped with the most up-to-date machinery and can produce them as efficiently as any firm in the world.  They were being subjected to competition of a dumping kind.  In other words, certain firms were selling these things in this country at considerably less than they were selling them in the country of origin.  Consequently, the duty was imposed to rectify that position. Reference No. 10 imposes a duty on clay pipes.  That duty was imposed as the result of a unanimous demand from all Parties in the Dáil.  Reference No. 11 imposes a duty on picture frames and on pictures in frames.  The necessity for that arose out of the fact that whereas picture frames, as such, were always dutiable it was possible to evade the duty by inserting a cheap print in the frame.  The imposition of this duty rectifies that position.  The exemptions from the duty apply to pictures imported temporarily for exhibition or to pictures which are imported for a public picture gallery. Reference No. 12 imposes a duty on coffin plates.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 13 imposes a duty on sheet lead and lead piping.  This is not a new duty.  In the main Finance Act of the year a duty was imposed on various articles of lead.  As a result of our experience of the operation of that duty it was decided to repeal the general duty and to impose this duty on sheet lead and lead piping alone.  In the Finance Act we imposed some general duties, duties which apply to all articles of a certain description with specified exceptions. Our experience of the operation of these duties has been such that we have decided to repeal them all and to substitute for them specified lists of articles to which duty shall apply.  We find that is preferable from the point of view not merely of those responsible for the administration <Col N="370" /> of the duty, but of those engaged in the importation of the goods.  The enactment of a specified list instead of a general duty will make it clear to everyone what is and what is not liable to pay the rate.  Reference No. 14 is of the same description.  There was a general duty on brass goods. That general duty has now been repealed.  This duty will now apply to the specified lists of brass goods set out in the Schedule.  The duty is unchanged, except in the case of church brasswork and component parts thereof, where it has been increased.  Reference No. 15 is again of the same description.  It imposes a duty on manufactured articles made wholly or mainly of tin, tinplate or tinned plate or a combination of any of them with the list of exemptions contained in the fifth column.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 16 indicates a change of the same description.  A duty was imposed on all articles of wood with certain exceptions.  We have changed that to a specified list of wooden articles to which the duty will apply with one or two additions.  The principal one deals with mouldings manufactured wholly of wood and planed or dressed wood.  This represents one of the biggest attempts we have made so far to change the nature of an industry in the country.  Heretofore, timber merchants imported timber in the planed and dressed state and then used it for whatever purpose it was required.  In most other countries timber is imported in the raw state. It is just simply sawn, and the planing or dressing is done where the timber is to be used.  By the imposition of this duty we are forcing the timber merchants of the Saorstát to instal the necessary machinery to do the planing and the dressing of the wood here.</P>
    <P>We recognise, in connection with this duty, that some time will have to elapse before it can be made properly effective: that those importing timber will have to get some period in which to instal the necessary machinery and arrange for supplies of simple sawn timber.  Consequently, there is a licensing provision at present in operation to allow normal quantities of <Col N="371" /> planed and dressed timber into the country, consigned to sawmillers who have informed the Department of their intention to instal machinery to do the planing and dressing here in the future.  The present licence is to operate until 31st December, but it may be extended beyond that date if the inquiries that are now being made reveal that there is in fact any substantial difficulty in getting supplies of timber before the spring when the ports of the main exporting countries are free from ice.  If the supplies of timber cannot be obtained at this time of the year it is intended to arrange that the present concession to timber merchants will extend beyond the end of this month.  We propose to give the timber merchants every reasonable facility so that there will be not only no interruption in supplies but that they will have ample time to make the necessary alterations in their works. These alterations may involve not merely the installation of planing machinery, but in some cases an extension of storing space.  There are some other alterations in the wooden duty affected by the list but they are of no particular importance.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 17 imposes a duty on the component parts of all wheeled vehicles intended to be drawn by animals.  Under the Finance Act a duty was imposed on the assembled parts of cars, omnibuses and motor cars of all descriptions.  This, however, imposes a duty on the unassembled parts of horse-drawn vehicles.  Road springs are excluded from the duty.  Reference No. 18 does the same for iron and steel parts for bodies of motor omnibuses, motor charabancs and commercial motor vehicles.  All these iron and steel parts can be and have been manufactured here, with certain exceptions.  There are no exceptions so far as the duty is concerned, but there is a licensing provision which has been operative in respect of one or two parts.  It is impossible to get a complete list of these parts until we have had experience of the duty in operation.  It may be found, in the course of the next six months or so, that some of <Col N="372" /> those parts which are very small and of a peculiar nature will have to be imported.  If so, we will propose an amendment in a subsequent Finance Act for the purpose of excluding them from duty, but at present they are being admitted under licence.  A list will be prepared.  This will be based on actual experience of the operation of the duty.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 19 doubles the duty on monumental, architectural or building stone which has been worked.  The necessity for that is two-fold.  In the first place, it was definitely our intention to secure that the working of the stone would be done in this country. There are a large number of firms engaged in the business, as well as a very large number of highly competent workmen to do the work.  The duty is designed to ensure that all worked stone will be excluded, so that the stone will have to be imported in the raw state and worked here.  There is, however, one country which exercises a more or less effective monopoly of a certain kind of marble.  When the duty on worked stone was first imposed the effect of it was largely nullified by an increase in the price of the raw stone consigned from that country to the Saorstát.  Those engaged in supplying stone to this country met the duty imposed here by increasing the price of the raw stone, so that in fact the protection was to some extent nullified.  We have met that by doubling the duty.  The increase in the price will have a dual effect.  It will induce people not to use that kind of stone, but native marble and other stone available here.  For various reasons the marble quarries in the Saorstát have not been in production recently.  The difficulties they had to contend with were of various kinds. We have been trying to solve them one by one, and I think we have now reached the stage when a number of our marble quarries will be in production in the near future: that not only will whatever marble that is required for church or building purposes in the Saorstát be Saorstát marble, but that it may be possible for us to regain some part of our export trade which we lost in recent years. <Col N="373" /> Reference No. 20 deals with flock. Flock is a material made from waste cloth.  It is used for stuffing mattresses.  It is a minor industry which gives a fair amount of employment, not, however, of a highly remunerative kind.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 21 increases the duty imposed by the Finance Act on roof felting and similar substitutes.  The necessity for the increase arose from the fact that dumping was being resorted to by importing firms, and that the firms engaged in the production of these things in the Saorstát had to meet that.  The importing firms were selling the materials here at a price less than they were selling in their own country.  Consequently, we decided to increase the duty.  Reference No. 22 increases the duty on cordage, cables, etc., which was imposed under the Finance Act.  It was designed to give assistance to an industry which had existed and flourished here but which had almost disappeared.  The duty produced rapid results.  There was quite a considerable development of that industry.  That development has not yet been fully reached.  Consequently, it was found possible to increase the duty.  We contemplate the full requirements of the Saorstát being met by the existing firms.  There are certain exceptions and these are provided for in the duty.</P>
    <P>Reference Nos. 23 and 24 impose a duty on certain jute goods.  As Senators are, I am sure, aware, there is in the Saorstát one jute mill which has an international trade.  It is one of the most efficient mills in the world.  There was another jute mill which had a considerable trade but not of the same character.  That firm met with certain difficulties in the international market. In any event, it was quite capable of increasing its production considerably for the home market.  We had the peculiar situation that by far the largest part of the produce of the principal firm in the industry was being exported while very large quantities of jute were being imported. In respect of the goods which this firm can produce, as soon as it can produce in the immediate future all that we <Col N="374" /> require, then the imported goods will be subject to the duty specified. Reference No. 25 imposes a duty on heel-plates for boots and shoes.  These are not being made in the Saorstát. Arrangements for the opening of factories to make them are under way. It was necessary, however, to impose a duty because it was felt that, as soon as an announcement of the intention to manufacture these things here was published in the newspapers, very large quantities would be imported; that the market would be flooded with them for two or three years to come, and that because of that the new industry to be set up would be considerably handicapped.  Consequently, the duty was imposed.  It is proposed to allow in the normal quantities of these things for the present to the firms that ordinarily imported them.  That will be done under licence.  There is consequently no hardship inflicted on any firm.</P>
    <P>Part II imposes other duties which are not <i>ad valorem</i>, but are assessed in relation to measure.  In the case of vinegar, there are a number of firms in the Saorstát manufacturing vinegar which were benefited to a large extent by the package tax and which increased production considerably, but it is felt that we should exclude vinegar altogether, particularly as the vinegar produced here, while no dearer, is substantially better in quality than some of the vinegar imported which is, in fact, deleterious to health.  Reference No. 27 imposes a duty on custard powders. There are a number of firms engaged in the manufacture of that also. Reference No. 28 imposes a duty on filled Christmas stockings, snowballs, Easter eggs and similar articles. Reference No. 29 imposes a duty on sausage meal.  That is a product of flour produced in bakeries and used for filling sausages.  The employment given is quite considerable and the competence of the firms here to supply the market has been established. The firms were not in a position to supply the full requirements of the market at the time of the imposition of the duty, but they undertook immediately to increase <Col N="375" /> their productive capacity to enable them to do so.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 30 increases the duty on compositions made of plaster of paris in sheets or slabs.  It was felt that we should definitely exclude the imported articles in consequence of the progress made in the production of these articles here.  Reference No. 31 imposes a duty on sparking plugs.  There is one firm in the Saorstát engaged in the manufacture of sparking plugs and, consequently, it was necessary for us to get some undertaking in respect of price before the duty was imposed.  That undertaking was secured.  Of course, all sparking plugs are sold at a fixed price of 5/- or 6/-.  The variations in the price take place in the wholesale price only, and very substantial profits indeed are made.  The price at which the plugs are sold is in or about 2/- each, varying according to the quantity ordered, but they are all sold at the same price of 5/-  The product of this Drogheda factory, which is quite as good as many of the 6/- plugs that are being imported, and of the same description, is sold at 5/-, and, although the wholesale price is slightly higher than the wholesale price of the imported article, so far as the consumer is concerned there is no change.  That wholesale price will be reduced according to a scale which has been agreed upon as the production of the factory increases. Reference No. 32 imposes a duty on empty sacks and bags made of jute. The purpose of this duty is twofold. There are a number of firms in the Saorstát engaged in the business of reconditioning sacks and bags.  Unconditioned sacks and bags are being allowed in free to these firms who undertake the process of reconditioning, and the duty is also part of the general duty which has been imposed on jute goods.</P>
    <P>In the Second Schedule, certain other customs duties are enumerated.  These do not impose any change.  They are all duties which have been in operation under the Emergency Powers Act and which have been translated into this Act as permanent duties and subject to <Col N="376" /> revision only by Act of the Oireachtas.  There have been one or two minor changes, all reductions, which were determined upon in consequence of representation made by interested parties and as a result of various consultations which were undertaken.  These reductions, however, are not of very great significance.  In the Third Schedule, the changes which are made are, in the main, consequential on the other duties which have been imposed. Reference No. 3 brings subject to the package duty malt extract and cod liver oil.  When the package duty was imposed on medicinal preparations, it was applied to malt extract and cod liver oil, and a number of firms established factories for the packing of these things here.  After a time, however, somebody decided to appeal to the Revenue Commissioners on the ground that these articles were intended mainly for consumption by children.  That was a ground on which the Revenue Commissioners were entitled to exempt articles from the package duty and the Revenue Commissioners, on consideration of the matter, decided that the articles were entitled to exemption on that ground and they consequently exempted them. The factories which were engaged in the packing of these goods closed down and we introduced the duty again specifically applying it to them and the factories restarted.  Reference No. 4 exempts from the package duty certain medicinal preparations which are packed in gelatine capsules.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 6 exempts cotton blankets from duty.  When the duty was placed on blankets in 1925, the Revenue Commissioners decided that cotton blankets would not be chargeable with the duty.  In the main Finance Act this year, the duty on blankets was increased and, in the Dáil, I gave an undertaking that the same interpretation would be placed on it and that cotton blankets would not be made liable to duty.  Subsequently to the passage of the Act, the Revenue Commissioners decided that, if cotton blankets were not blankets, they were sheets, and, if they were not liable to duty as blankets, they were liable as sheets.  The duty <Col N="377" /> on sheets was the higher duty and, consequently, they were again brought subject to the blanket duty, which was lower, until this Act was introduced when, by a specific enactment, they were exempted from all duties.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 6 makes a number of changes in the duty on linen goods. Following the change of Government, a report was presented from the Tariff Commission recommending the imposition of duties on various classes of linen piece goods and other linen manufactures.  At the time, following a consultation with the linen manufacturers and others interested, we decided not to act on the recommendation of the Tariff Commission so far as linen piece goods were concerned, and they were not made subject to duty by the main Finance Act when consigned from any of the States of the Commonwealth.  There was a duty of 20 per cent. imposed on non-Commonwealth piece goods but there was free entry for Commonwealth piece goods.  We have now adopted the recommendation of the Tariff Commission with certain alterations and modifications, and the duty is being applied to linen piece goods no matter from where they are consigned.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 13 varies the duty which was imposed on smoking pipes. The duty, as originally enacted, applied to smoking pipes and the component parts of smoking pipes.  It was subsequently represented to us that the principal firm engaged in this industry had ceased carrying out the entire process of manufacture in respect of pipe heads for various reasons, and that it would take some time to get that end of the business going again. As a result of representations made and of very careful examination into the whole matter, it was decided to permit the importation of partly finished pipe heads, that is, pipe heads not polished, not stained or not bored in the stem to an extent greater than 3/16ths of an inch in diameter.  The duty also applies only to pipes which are greater in value than 1/6.  Pipes under 1/6 in value are exempt from duty, and the duty imposed by the main Act is repealed.  The other alterations are, I think, consequential <Col N="378" /> on various changes which have been made, and do not require any explanation here.  They are difficult to understand in the form in which they are set out and, in that connection, I should like to say that a case has been made for the codification of the various duties which are in operation, so that persons engaged in the importing business will have an easily understandable list of what duties apply to particular articles and what articles are exempt from duty altogether.  That task has been undertaken, but it will be some time before it can be done.  In the meantime, the Stationery Office issues a booklet prepared by the Revenue Commissioners, which is available to anybody who wishes to purchase it and which gives all the information required without reference to any of these Acts.  These are all the changes effected by the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be possible to see a more futile exhibition of Parliamentary procedure than that we have just listened to.  I agree that, from the Minister's point of view, it is admirable.  He is a sincere and avowed protectionist, and he comes along with a multiplicity of articles, almost from a needle to an anchor, about which very few of us in this House know anything.  He tells us that these are being manufactured here or can be manufactured here or will be manufactured here and that, if they cannot, a licence can be given to get over the difficulty.  Naturally, we have to take it lying down.  How can we do otherwise?  We have that system in contrast to the scientific system of the Tariff Commission, which realised the difficulties and dangers involved in a policy of this kind and which tackled its job systematically, if, perhaps, slowly, and did the work in the only way in which it can be properly done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will realise the utter impossibility of discussing this question piecemeal.  How can you discuss general policy in terms of vinegar or Christmas stockings?  Yet that is the way in which we are asked to do it. We are not competent and I would ask the Minister to give us some justification for his policy.  He says it has been <Col N="379" /> successful.  What figures have we to show that it is a success?  What examination has there ever been made of the resultant effect of this type of policy.  We know that unemployment is rife, and we have nothing to set against it in the form of those placed in employment by this policy.  We know that these things may be made but I am afraid that we also know to our cost that there is no money to buy them.  What is the good of making these things, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, exhausting the purchasing power of the country?  You have only to look round the world to see the utter futility of this tariff policy in countries, big and small.  We, of course, have to grin and bear it, but I would ask the Minister to have regard to the plain people in this country&mdash;the people of leisure, I may say, who have just as much right to exist as the people who work.  They contribute to the taxes and to culture and they add to the amenities of life. The position of these people is growing, every day, more intolerable.</P>
    <P>Under this tariff policy, life is becoming more and more drab and people are becoming more and more sour and discontented.  Nowadays, any person with a fixed income who wants to enjoy life&mdash;and such a person has a right to enjoy life&mdash;has to think carefully before he can even buy anything. To give my own humble experience&mdash;I do not generally approve of people who recount their own humble experiences&mdash;I wanted to buy some small pieces of marble to repair some marble mantelpieces that had suffered in the Civil War.  I said to my secretary: &ldquo;I warn you that there will be a three months' job over this but I am in no hurry and I am prepared for a three months' job,&rdquo; and I think it has taken fully that time.  I have been in correspondence with the Revenue Commissioners and they asked what evidence I was prepared to give them that my house was under construction.  I said that I was prepared to give my own assurance or any other evidence they might want.  Finally, after a long time, they said: &ldquo;Very well; we will have the architect's certificate that the <Col N="380" /> house is under construction and your assurance that the articles will be used for the purpose for which they are intended and we will require evidence that they have been so used,&rdquo; and, mind you, I could have carried all these articles in my hands.  The whole thing is quite absurd.  I know you cannot make exceptions, but that is what happens.</P>
    <P>Under this tariff policy which the Government is now putting into practice, all the little things of life that matter so much are swallowed up in these big, pedantic principles and life is made more and more drab.  I will give the Seanad another illustration. A lady in Cornwall wrote to me&mdash;I expect she read something about what was going on here&mdash;pointing out that she was sending a photograph of my grandchild to a daughter of mine and the authorities here wanted several shillings to be paid on it.  There you have the whole philosophy of the thing summed up.  The conditions are such that if a man wants to purchase a heliotrope suit he cannot do so; but he can purchase a suit of real good Irish tweed and he will get better value. No doubt the Irish-made suit would be better, but if a man desires a heliotrope suit why should he not have it? It is these little things that make life worth living and it is really intolerable that a citizen of this country should be put in the position of not being allowed to have a heliotrope suit if he wanted to have one.  God forbid that I ever should be attired in a heliotrope suit; but I contend that if I wanted one I should be allowed to have one.  Why should the people be ground down to a drab existence? These things are invariably worse in smaller countries where the standard of living is lower, where the standard of culture is lower, where the public taste is lower and where the power of production is less developed.</P>
    <P>The Minister smiles.  So well he can smile.  He has all the cards in his hand.  He is helping, I submit, to make life in this country more drab, to discourage people of independent means from enjoying life in this country. This sort of thing will ultimately prevent people who want to enjoy life <Col N="381" /> from living here.  If that is the object of the Government, they are certainly going the right way about it. Anyone who wants to live a decent, free life will not remain in, or come to this country, because of all those little pin-pricks which tend to make life so miserable.  I maintain that there has been no case whatever made by the Minister.  He argued that we have been buying so many million pounds worth of material from abroad, and that we can make all those articles at home and absorb the unemployed in the various processes of manufacture. That is the old story, but it does not hold water.  The articles which may be made at home cannot be sold.  In addition to the poor people not getting anything out of it, the rich people will be getting more and more annoyed and discontented.</P>
    <P>The whole policy now being adopted by the Government is a dangerous one. At any rate, they have taken the step and we are going deeper and deeper into the mire.  I cannot really understand why the Government are so satisfied with that policy.  The Minister tells us that everything is going on beautifully; everything in the garden is lovely.  He endeavours to maintain that position without the slightest shred of evidence.  In my opinion, there ought to be some form of public inquiry into the effect of these tariffs. The matter should be thoroughly examined in order to see what has been the effect in the way of employment and what value has been obtained.  I submit that it is quite easy to see what are the drawbacks; it is very easy to observe the annoyances, the delays, the irregularities and the general condition of irritability resulting from the imposition of these tariffs.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister mentioning that he is going to issue some sort of a codification or schedule of the multiplicity of tariffs.  That is long overdue.  Just imagine a correspondence lasting over three months in respect of a piece of marble!  What would happen in the case of articles that might be very urgently required, and upon the receipt of which a good deal of employment would depend? A codification of all these tariffs is long <Col N="382" /> overdue.  As soon as we get it we will be in a better position to see where we are.  We will not have to go through a regular maze of inquiries and interrogations and all the rest of it to find out the exact position.</P>
    <P>I must certainly pay a tribute to the officials, whose patience, forbearance and courtesy are beyond all praise. The blame rests entirely with the Government.  The people generally have certainly been patient and long suffering; all sorts of annoyances have been thrust upon them.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us something about the licensing system. I look upon that as a thoroughly dangerous principle.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs admitted in this House that he was in favour of the publication of licences.  I regard this power as the most dangerous thing that could be put into the hands of any Government.  It is really giving them unlimited authority to pick and choose between individual firms.  It could well happen that the powerful combines would get the licences while the struggling people would be refused them.  There are very grave dangers involved in this licensing system; preferential treatment and other things must inevitably follow, and it will be very difficult to avoid chaos.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Minister to give us some clear undertaking in reference to the licensing system.  We certainly will be glad to know what he intends to do.  Senators can visualise the position of people in business here who discover suddenly that their competitors have got licences.  If those firms choose to cut up rough the resulting unemployment will become so serious that no Government could face it.  That would be a very undesirable thing and the Government should be very careful. I would like to emphasise that where individual firms get licences, those licences should be published.  I think the House should insist upon that and make it a concrete and definite demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not help admiring considerably the statement made by the Minister.  I have a strong suspicion that he is the only person <Col N="383" /> here who really knows what exactly is in the Bill.  I spent two long evenings examining this measure and I did my best to understand what exactly was meant by its various sections.  I do not pretend to have fully succeeded. I do not regard this measure from the same point of view as Senator Sir John Keane.  I look at it more from the point of view of absorbing the unemployed in the country.  While I do not suppose that the Government could very well have avoided it, I do feel that a Bill of this kind is just about as bewildering as it could be to the average trader who desires to find out the immediate effect of it.  It is quite true there are various publications relating to the tariffs that have been imposed, but I think the Minister will agree that it is almost impossible for a person to keep up-to-date in these matters.  There is nothing more aggravating than to have one publication which purports to specify certain things and then shortly afterwards to be furnished with a Bill, some provisions of which will come into effect on one date and other provisions which will come into effect on another date, after the Bill has been signed by His Excellency the Governor-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think in the main this Bill is definitely an improvement on the various duties that have come into force during the past six or eight months.  It is, of course, largely an amending Bill. There are some new duties imposed, but in the main it is an amending Bill. There are some of us who favour a certain amount of protection and there are others who favour a wider form of protection.  Those of us who favour a certain amount believe that the Government should make inquiries first and then put on a tariff.  The Government's belief is that it is more desirable first to put on the tariff and then learn by experience and by representations put forward by traders what is the correct duty and what exemptions should be made.  This Bill is almost entirely a Bill based on the experience of the last six months.  I should like to join with Senator Sir John Keane in his desire for the beatification of the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="384" /> and the various officials.  I have had a fair amount of experience of the effect of these tariffs and numbers of traders have come to me in the belief, apparently, that every Senator knows what is or what is not dutiable.  I am quite certain that the officials in the Revenue Department have done their very best and the officials in the Minister's Department have also done their best to meet the existing difficulties. I am quite sure the Minister also has done his best, but he is subject to that very doubtful policy of first putting on a tariff and then endeavouring to justify it afterwards.  I think it is very probable that the Minister is well aware of the chaos and the difficulties resulting from the Government's policy in respect of tariffs.  I am sure he thoroughly realises the annoyance and trouble caused to traders in finding out what is dutiable and what articles are exempt from duty.</P>
    <P>The Minister somewhat innocently went into an explanation of the history of the duty on cotton blankets.  Perhaps he will forgive me if I supplement his statement by something that occurred when he was at Ottawa.  I moved an amendment here and I drew attention to a statement of the Minister in which he assured the Dáil that cotton blankets were not to be dutiable. I pointed out that they were now held to be dutiable and the suggestion was made that cotton blankets and rugs should be exempted.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance ridiculed that, pointed out that there were plenty of substitutes and said quite definitely that cotton blankets were dutiable.  I am in a position to congratulate the Government.  What we wanted to do here four months ago is now justified and is regarded as quite reasonable and correct.  The particular continental blanket used by the poor in large quantities is something like a rug and I can quite conceive the Revenue Commissioners, conscientiously carrying out their duties, having difficulties in that respect.  However, that matter can be raised on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to know that some effort is being made to codify the Acts of this year.  I am not <Col N="385" /> at all certain that, until we have had three or four Bills setting the position right as a result of further experience, any codification will be very helpful to the public.  Of course, a codification of the measures relating to tariffs will be extremely helpful to the House.  At the moment, it is decidedly difficult to know exactly what is dutiable and what is not dutiable.  I should like to make a further suggestion to the Minister.  I will urge him seriously to consider using the Tariff Commission or some other body of officials for the purpose of holding a public inquiry into all the duties now in force for the purpose, not of recommending whether they should be continued or not&mdash;I recognise that is a matter of Government policy&mdash;but of hearing the various representations, particularly on the part of manufacturers, with a view to getting rid of the licensing system or minimising the total number of cases in respect of which licences may have been issued.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am satisfied that a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> effort is being made in regard to licences.  I feel it is the intention of the Government to be perfectly fair to every firm, where the conditions are the same; but I know that a great many people outside are whispering that licences will be unfairly given.  It would be well for the Minister to make clear what I know to be a fact, that if a licence is given to one firm, any other firm working under the same conditions will also be entitled to a licence.  That should be made perfectly clear.  If it is made clear beyond doubt, then there will not be much room for criticism.  It should, however, be made clear that if one trader gets a licence another trader working under similar conditions will also be entitled to one.  That is a matter that could be clarified.  I have previously in this House supported the provision for licences, but only because I did not see how you could adopt a policy of putting on a tariff to discover by experience what the details should be unless you provided some system of licensing.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a provision in one of these <Col N="386" /> Schedules&mdash;I think the second one. The provision is rather different from the licensing provision.  Under this provision, the Minister for Finance may, by order, remove the duty in connection, I think, with clocks, watches and musical instruments, where he finds that certain portions of it prove to be inexpedient.  While I would be totally opposed to giving the Minister power to put on duties otherwise than by Acts of this nature, I think that in many cases where the licensing system is at present in operation it would be far more expedient to have a provision by which the Minister for Finance could remove duties from those portions of articles which are not manufactured here and in respect of which the reason for protection does not exist.  There should be some such provision by which the Minister for Finance could remove these duties until the next Finance Bill comes along, which probably will not be very long. That, I think, would be better than the issue of licences and it would remove some of the genuine suspicion that exists.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is troublesome to get licences and there are difficulties with regard to them.  Some licences are given for a specified time.  Others are given only for a specific consignment. If the licence is for a specific consignment, you cannot find out whether you are going to get a licence until the consignment is actually here. In respect of another suggestion I shall probably be told that its operation would be expensive.  I have been wondering whether in the public interest it would not be possible to have a small office in connection with the Revenue Commissioner's Department, carrying a staff of two or three, to which members of the public could go and get definite information with regard to the latest rulings of the Revenue Commissioners in regard to tariffs.  You can get those rulings when you take in the goods but if you want to protect industries you do not want to have the goods coming in here and to be paying the duties.  You really want to prevent people bringing in the goods.  It is desirable that a member of the public, and particularly a <Col N="387" /> trader, should be able to go to some office and get a ruling in respect of a certain class of goods that would be definitely authoritative.  A friend of mine told me that he endeavoured by telephone to get some such information from the Revenue Commissioners. They told him quite properly that they could only answer him if he put his request in writing.  I am not blaming the Revenue Commissioners because it would be extremely difficult to give an answer by telephone to every query of that kind.</P>
    <P>It is well known that, after duties are put on, the Revenue Commissioners, following examination, issue notices to their officials giving them specific instructions.  In the case of parts of wearing apparel, they have had to issue notices as to what is to be regarded as a manufactured part. Efforts were made by certain people to evade the duty by getting in by the yard a practically completed article which only required a certain amount of stitching.  That was stopped.  But other things, such as frilling, were held to be manufactured, and they had to be dealt with.  In that particular case, I know that a paper was issued. I think that that paper, with details as to how the duty was to be interpreted, should be available for inspection by a trader and that there should be a small office set apart for that purpose. When the question of delay was raised before in this House, the Minister for Finance assured us vehemently that the whole trouble was due to traders filling in wrong forms.  I agree that probably 95 per cent. of the trouble in getting goods cleared from the Customs is due to filling in wrong forms and that only 5 per cent. is due to officials not being quite clear as to what duty is applicable.  But I submit that that is not the fault of the public. It is most difficult to discover under what section of the various Acts a particular article should be declared.  While the statement of the Minister for Finance is technically accurate, I suggest that the fault is not with the public.  Even if the adoption of my suggestion involved expense, I think there would be a corresponding <Col N="388" /> saving in other sections of the Revenue Department by having the forms filled in more accurately.  I make those suggestions because I think they are worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>As showing the difficulty of interpretation, a case came to my notice last Friday in connection with my own firm which I may mention.  A special order was sent to England on behalf of a special customer for a blouse case not manufactured here.  It came by post. When it arrived, the minimum duty was demanded by the Postal Department and my staff refused to pay. When a representative of the firm went down to the Postal Department, the parcel was opened and he was told that the key was made of British steel and was not part of the attache case or blouse case.  The lock was held to be part of the case, but the key was held not to be a part of the lock or the blouse case and, therefore, 2/6 duty was charged on the key.  That is not a funny story; it is a fact.  That is a genuine illustration of the great difficulty an official is in in trying conscientiously to carry out his duty.  The 2/6 was duly paid.  When the matter came to my notice, I wrote to the Secretary of the Revenue Commissioners asking whether this was a definite ruling, as, if so, we could get the keys over in lots instead of separately.  We would, of course, have to pay the duty of 2/6.</P>

      <P>I have not got it yet. I did not expect to get a reply in two days.  I think it would be unreasonable to expect a reply in less than a week. I have got the assurance that the matter is receiving consideration and I am quite certain that that is true. There are one or two questions I should like to ask the Minister before considering the putting down of recommendations for the Committee Stage.  Why does the Minister confine his film concession to standard-size films?  Why not allow people who produce films of 16 mm. size to avail of the concession?  In the United States, and to a small extent in England, there are a number of people who are utilising what were originally amateur societies for the production of films.  In <Col N="389" /> England, I think that did lead to an increase in the production of films.  A number of people may start off here with a 16 mm. film.  That is quite large enough to give a good picture.  A film of that size has often been shown in theatres.  You may get a number of amateurs and one or two people outside arranging to produce an Irish film.  As the Bill stands, they are excluded from any advantage.  Almost inevitably, they will have to send out the film for development and treatment. They will have to pay the duty on its return.  I think that an amateur society like that should get the benefit of the concession.  I shall deal with that matter in detail when we come to the Committee Stage of the Bill.  One small amateur film society did produce a picture in the Peacock Theatre.  It was of 16 mm. size and one of those who took part has since obtained employment as a film actor.  The difficulties were so great in the way of duty and cost that the society was not able to go any further. The expenses were considerably more than they could get by the letting of the theatre.  If the object is to encourage the production of Irish films, the Minister should encourage the productions of the small societies who will use 16 mm. or even 9 mm. films.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that particular section of the Bill there is a reference to &ldquo;nationals of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  I think I am correct in stating that there is a definition of &ldquo;national&rdquo; in the Finance Act different from that in the Control of Manufactures Act, and a slightly different definition in the Control of Prices Bill.  Which definition applies in this particular case, where there is no definition, I do not know.  We do not want to add, with great repect to my lawyer friends, legal expenses to the difficulties of the person endeavouring to produce films here.  With reference to the taking off of the duty on motor parts, I do not propose to criticise the provision in the Bill.  It is another change which the Government have made in their endeavour to get over the difficulties which have arisen.  I do not know whether it will be sufficient to enable the chassis to be made here or not.  If it is at all <Col N="390" /> possible to have that done economically, it would be desirable that it should be done.  If the Minister really wished to get it done, he might have gone the whole hog and not provided for a duty on the engine, which he admitted in the Dáil&mdash;if he was correctly reported in the newspapers&mdash; is not likely to be made here.  The same applies to some other parts on which 15 per cent. is charged.  In the case of mass production, it costs nearly as much to put all the parts together, pack them and send them over here as it does to assemble the car, when this work is done by a chain of men, one man attending only to one particular job.  If this is going to succeed, I think it is a pity that the Minister did not take his courage in his hands and go the whole hog.  There are one or two difficulties in definition in regard to this matter.  They will come up on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to cotton blankets.  There are one or two other matters about which I am not quite clear, possibly due to my own stupidity.  Are cord and twine definitely exempted or do they come in somewhere else?  The duty was previously ten per cent. and that is deleted in one of the Schedules.  I have a sort of feeling that these articles come in somewhere else but I cannot find where they come in.  Why is a new principle being adopted in refunding the duty in the case of bacon?  I am not much concerned with that matter myself but it is of some interest to us here.  Having examined fairly carefully the provisions of this Bill, I think I can say that nearly all the Schedules represent a <i>bona fide</i> effort to rectify errors made in the duties in the past few months.  Whether we approve of the general policy or not, I think the House should pass the Bill, as this action will be in the interest of the people generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>When Money Bills like this come before us, we cannot do anything effective.  All we can do is to try to affect the Minister's mind.  The Minister is a convinced protectionist and, no doubt, he looks upon me as a convinced free trader.  Consequently, there is not much use in my trying to <Col N="391" /> convince him of the error of his ways. It may not be any harm, however, if I direct his attention to one aspect of this question which is present to my mind.  This country is becoming a very dear country from the purchaser's point of view.  People may want something for which they cannot afford to pay the present price or even as much as they paid before.  The price may be very much more than they could obtain the article for on the other side of the Channel.  It goes against their grain very much.  They simply do not want to do it.  This is not confined to luxuries, but extends to articles of general use which tend to the efficiency of the country; practical things like tools, paints, varnish, and all sorts of things.  There is a great variety of these articles and there is a great deal of specialisation.  Some of them are known by experience to be much better than others for a certain purpose.  When a person wants a particular thing and finds that it is subject to a high rate of duty he simply does not get it.  All that is hampering trade.  Money is not used.  It induces a general attitude of &ldquo;let everything rip&rdquo;; do not do any repairs or bother about anything, just go without; let the standard of maintenance and efficiency of the country go down.  The only way I see to get away from that, if we must have tariffs to a certain extent, is to let the aim be to have lower tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Bagwell that the tendency is for efficiency, the standard of living, and the standard of existence altogether to go down as a result of these tariffs. While the Minister was reciting his litany and we were saying in our hearts <i>Ora pro nobis,</i> I noticed that he mentioned several cases where the price had gone down.  I could give him a list of ordinary things which the farmer cannot do without, although his purchasing power has practically disappeared, and he does not buy anything except what he cannot help, the duties upon which are hitting him very heavily.  He cannot, for instance, do without horse-drawn vehicles or harness leather.  These things have gone <Col N="392" /> to prohibitive prices, especially harness.</P>
      <P>There are all kinds of things contained in this list which are not luxuries, the price of which has gone up&mdash;things that the farmer cannot possibly do without.  I bought a milk can two days ago of the same kind that I paid 12/6 for some time ago and I paid 2/6 more for it.  That is only one instance.  Everywhere you turn you find the price of things has gone up.  The result is that the people are not buying things, except what they cannot possibly do without.  The whole thing is a condemnation of the system of tariffs.  We have often protested against them, but there is no section of the community which is feeling this pressure so badly as the farmer, because his means of living is being deliberately taken away and the price of everything he has to buy is going up.  Where it is going to end nobody can tell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might take some of the minor points raised first and get them disposed of.  Senator Douglas raised one or two points.  The first was in connection with films.  The wording of the Bill, which confines the concession given by the section to films of full standard size, was inserted in the Dáil on representations made there to the effect that the processing of films for less than normal sized cameras was being done in the country. Heretofore, exemption was granted to negatives of films produced anywhere when the organisers, producers and the principal artists were nationals of and ordinarily resident in the Saorstát. That concession was found to be valueless because of the fact that the processing of the films, the making of the positives was not being done in the country.  That was the reason why Section 8 was put into this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the 16 mm. film is processed here?  I am not.  The 9 mm. film is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement was made by a very responsible member of the Opposition in the Dáil and I took his word for it.  The section as introduced applied to films of all sizes. <Col N="393" /> The statement was made that the processing of these smaller sized films was being done here and strong objection was taken to giving the concession in respect of these films.  Consequently these words &ldquo;full standard size&rdquo; were inserted in the Dáil.  I will undertake to have that looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I can find out between this and to-morrow.  I know it was not done some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  In fact, one of the reasons for the concession was the fact that when people took these films here, produced the negatives here and sent them away to have the positives made, they were subject to duty on coming back into the country.  That was the reason why the concession was granted.  Cordage, ropes and twine are made subject to duty by Reference 22 of the First Schedule.  The duty has been increased to 20 per cent.  The other Reference deletes the old duty, which takes place simultaneously with the imposition of the new duty.  Perhaps it would be better if we left the other minor points over until we get to the Committee Stage.  I agree that it would be to the interest of merchants engaged in the importation of goods if more explicit information as to the operation of duties upon various classes of goods were available and we have the question under consideration as to the form in which more definite information can be provided.  The publication of the instructions issued by the Revenue Commissioners to the officials at the various importing points would hardly be desirable.  These instructions are frequently of a more or less confidential nature, in so far as they advise the Customs officers how to detect attempted fraud and other devices of that kind.  The publication might facilitate those who are seeking means of outwitting the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two kinds of instructions.  There is the other kind which simply sets out the exact classes that come under a general description.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  There is also a document of that kind sent out, but the document has no legal significance. Its publication might give rise to complication, in so far as it would not purport to be an accurate description of the classes of goods to which the duty applied.  It is issued for the information of the officers concerned.  He is told, for instance, that lubricating grease is generally of such a colour; that it is generally imported in certain sized drums and that, consequently, any grease of that colour imported in that sized drum must be carefully examined before being passed.  General information of that kind is provided for the guidance of officers.  However, the question of the publication of precise information is one that is receiving attention.  I hope we will be able to get over the difficulty, although it will not be a very simple task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of the main points raised, I have only to say that it is probably much too early to attempt to give any account of the results produced by the various tariffs imposed this year.  A factory does not open the day after a tariff is imposed or increase of productive capacity is not created by the very act of imposing a tariff.  Despite adverse conditions, despite a certain amount of political uncertainty, despite the fact that the world depression has produced its reactions here, and that consumption has fallen off to some extent, a very substantial industrial development has taken place in the past year.  The extent of that development will not be fully appreciated for, perhaps, another six months to come, but it has been quite considerable, particularly in connection with those industries the establishment of which was comparatively simple.  There are certain industries in respect of which development must necessarily be slow. If you take the flour-milling industry, for example, it takes perhaps from six to nine months to build and equip a flour mill.  I said some time ago that I hoped to be able to say in twelve months' time that all the flour required in the Saorstát was being produced in Saorstát mills.  There is every reason to believe that that will <Col N="395" /> be the case.  I fixed a period of twelve months, because it is going to take that time to build, equip and put into production mills in respect of which the plans have already been prepared.</P>
    <P>There are other industries, of course, which can be established much more quickly.  The packing industry is a case in point.  That is an industry which did not require anything in the nature of substantial capital expenditure. The machinery required was, as a rule, quite simple and most of the employment was manual; in fact, most of it was unskilled.  There are approximately, however, 1,000 people in employment in the packing factories established in the Saorstát as a result of the imposition of the duty.  These are, I admit, mainly juveniles; to the extent of about 60 per cent. they are juveniles.  It is, however, additional employment here and it means that additional revenue is coming into a large number of homes.  That industry still has in it the seeds of further expansion.</P>
    <P>There are other industries, such as the boot and shoe industry, in respect of which a fairly rapid development is possible.  I mean in so far as existing factories are concerned, the increasing of the productive capacity to the physical limit of the factory was quite a simple operation and has taken place. In addition to that, we have got three new factories established and a fourth one coming shortly into production.  At least three other factories are, to my knowledge, in course of planning, the construction of which will be undertaken in a short period.  Even when we have all these additional factories going, there will still be a lot of leeway to make up for as far as the boot and shoe trade is concerned, but the progress has been certainly as rapid as, and, to some extent, more rapid than, I anticipated when the duty was increased to 25 per cent.  There are other industries in respect of which the capital equipment is very heavy, and it will take a considerable amount of time, and certainly careful preparation, before these can be got upon their feet in a manner that will ensure successful operation afterwards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> As far as the general policy is concerned, it has, despite the conditions that have prevailed during the year, more than justified itself. Senators who are inclined to be critical of that policy, because it has not produced an unexampled air of prosperity in the country, should ask themselves what exactly the conditions would be here if that policy were not in operation.  If we decided here and now to remove these duties, and to allow the industries that have grown up in consequence of the duties to meet the full blast of foreign competition, particularly the kind of competition that they would have to meet in these days, would conditions in the country be improved by it?</P>
    <P>I think nobody can maintain that they would.  On the contrary we would have to contemplate a much greater volume of unemployment and a much more serious volume of unemployment because it would be more permanent and hopeless.</P>
    <P>It has been said that unemployment is growing.  To what extent that is true it is hard to say.  In certain parts of the country it is true that unemployment is much less than ever. In some parts of the country unemployment as such does not exist at all.  In other parts of the country unemployment is a serious problem and one that we are attempting to tackle by every possible device including the device of the direct provision of work upon State schemes.  There has been an amount said about the unemployment problem here by people who have not appreciated the fact that it is by no means as serious as it is in other countries.  I do not want to minimise the seriousness of unemployment at all.  We have taken drastic measures to deal with it.  The size of the problem is our justification for these drastic measures.  But not merely is unemployment less serious than it has been represented by certain people but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is true that certain figures were available and these figures gave the registered unemployed.  In the County Galway there were only two labour exchanges; in Mayo only one; in certain other counties there were only one or two labour exchanges and these were fifty miles apart.  For many of the unemployed workers of the country the existence of these employment exchanges had no significance at all.  The unemployed never attempted to utilise them.  So far as Government relief works were concerned there was in existence a certain system of preference for the supporters of the Party who preceded us in office. First there was a preference given to ex-members of the National Army who were married.  The second preference was given to the unmarried workers who were ex-members of the National Army.  These two preferences succeeded in monopolising all the relief work that was there.  Consequently those who were not ex-members of the National Army had little inducement to register at the labour exchanges.  In fact the exchanges were of very little significance at all to the majority of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We changed that system.  We made it at first conditional on all local authorities who received State grants in respect of work that they should recruit their workers from the labour exchanges.  We made it a rule that whatever works were to be provided there should be laid down and put into force a system of preference which precluded any system of favouritism entering into the matter.  We made it a rule that the relief work to be given in the case of unemployment should be determined first of all in relation to the number of registered unemployed in a particular county or district.  We established a system of registration of <Col N="398" /> the unemployed through the post office and the Gárda stations.  We secured that every unemployed person in the country should register.  The result was that in one week there were 40,000 unemployed persons registered who were not registered before.  Is it seriously to be suggested that 40,000 persons became unemployed in one week?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;A number of landowners and others seeking cart work in connection with relief schemes have registered as unemployed.  The figures as to the unemployed do not, therefore, represent those who normally get a livelihood by working for others but those who are at the moment seeking for work in order to get a livelihood. These landowners are looking for work for their horses and carts on the roads.  The figure of the unemployed now includes persons who have other means of livelihood.  We have holders of land, persons who are quite prepared to take work on the roads and quarries if offered to them.  We are trying to get these figures to meet. We have issued new instructions and new forms for the purpose of getting information which will permit of an analysis of the figures.  Owing to the <Col N="399" /> great pressure of work in the offices this is a very slow process.  The work in the offices has been intensified and the time available for the work is limited.  It will help the Senators to appreciate the change in the position when we have these figures analysed.</P>
      <P>Might I point out that in a normal year up to the present the number of vacancies notified to the labour exchanges and filled through the labour exchanges in this State was 16,000 to 17,000.  That is to say, that in twelve months 16,000 vacancies were filled through the labour exchanges.  That number had been notified to the labour exchanges and that number had been filled in the course of a year.  In the present year the number of vacancies being notified to the labour exchanges and filled by them is at the rate of 100,000.  That many forms are being filled up.  Senators who bear these figures in mind will appreciate the difference between the two sets of figures and they will also see the amount of value to be attached to the figures previously issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the policy of tariffs.  It was said that they were not imposed on a scientific basis and it was suggested that there should be a general relation between the tariffs imposed.  I would like to tell Senators that the Tariff Commission Act has not been repealed by us.  It is our intention to utilise the Tariff Commission in the making of a detailed examination in the matter of tariffs.  A detailed examination is desirable.  The term of office of the existing members of the Tariff Commission expired recently.  New members were appointed on the Commission, and in the near future they will take up the matter of undertaking the examination of the tariffs that have been put on.  This examination will be useful in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration has also been given to the advisability of having some general examination of the position undertaken with a view to rectifying any possible anomalies that may have arisen in the matter of the existing <Col N="400" /> duties.  We sometimes find that two duties apply to the same article and difficulties arise in that connection. The Tariff Commission may be called upon to undertake an examination which will ensure that any difficulties of that kind will be removed.  Senator Sir John Keane talked about a delay of three months in the importing of certain marble work that he required. I am sorry indeed to hear it was not more than three months.  I cannot see any justification whatever for importing into this country any worked or unworked marble.  We have in this country marble of a quality to suit all requirements.  The working of the marble could be done quite well here and if it is required to bring in marble from any other country in an unworked state it can be worked here.  I submit that if people want foreign marble they can find in this country workmen who would be able to prepare it. Senator Bagwell talked about the drab life that we were creating for certain classes in the country, and seemed to regret that heliotrope and colours like that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, it was Senator Sir John Keane.  If the Senator would go to the trouble of going down to Beggar's Bush Barracks and looking at the designs, patterns and colours of the fabrics there he will find that there is nothing drab about them and that he can by wearing the fabrics made in Ireland parade in any colours.  As to the matter of the granting of licences, I just want to say that I am anxious to shed all the licensing powers I have as quickly as possible.  It is not easy to do so.  There have been licensing provisions inserted in the Finance Act for three reasons:&mdash;(1) owing to the difficulties in the matter of definition. We had an example of that to-day in the matter of size where it was desired to bring certain stocks for paints and we found it was not possible to get a definition of that class of size.  We had the State Chemist and others on the job for weeks past&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="401" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>How do you manage to get a definition in the licenses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the particular size which it is desired to import is a patented article and sold under a patented name.  It is quite easy for the Revenue Commissioners to distinguish by a variety of devices that particular size from other sizes.  It is not easy to get a definition of it.  I will give another example of it.  We imposed a duty upon paint, but cellulose, which is used for painting carriages, is not made here and it was desired to allow cellulose into the country under licence.  We got the State Chemist on it and he took six weeks to find a definition.  Consequently we put a duty upon all paints with a licensing definition so as to allow in cellulose.  Certain safeguards are easily conceivable to prevent fraud.  There is this second type of definition which is operating to insure that the quantity of goods imported under it will be merely sufficient to supplement the home production.  We have been endeavouring to develop the manufacture of tins&mdash;tins for packing sweets, cocoa and the like.  We realised that the existing concerns were only making a limited range of these tins and that difficulty would arise in respect of certain types and designs, and that it would take some little time before the firms here would realise what they were up against and have machinery installed for their requirements.  Consequently we operated the licensing system. When firms wanted to import a particular type of commodity we established contacts with all the firms here making that commodity and before giving the licence to import we satisfied ourselves that these firms were not able to supply the orders.  It was only when we were able to satisfy ourselves as to that that we gave the licence to import.  There is a tariff or duty upon a noted well-known fabric. We had that duty because we wanted to guarantee that the development of that fabric would be on right lines. We have now sent notice to the firms importing this stuff and enjoying the benefit of this licence that we expect <Col N="402" /> them within a reasonable time to instal the machinery for the making of the fabric themselves, or to make arrangements with other firms in the Saorstát to do it.</P>
      <P>These licensing provisions are for the purpose of meeting unforeseen difficulties that may arise.  I admit that it is possible in theory to avoid the necessity for such licences by having a careful examination in advance of the effects of the proposed duties. But that is possible only in theory. It has never been found possible in practice.  I know that the Tariff Commission spent three or four years upon the consideration of some applications for a tariff on woollen goods.  But immediately they published their tariff they found that they had to change it within three weeks.  This tariff that had been put on woollens was under consideration, I think, for three years, and yet after it had been imposed the tariff had to be altered three times within six months, so that in practice it is impossible even by a long examination to prevent mistakes being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Miss Browne stated that the efficiency of our industries, and the standard of living of our people have gone down.  That statement is not correct.  On the contrary, the efficiency of our industries has not merely been increased, and demonstrated for the first time in recent months, but we have had foreign firms which established contact with industries here for the first time astonished at the efficiency that existed.  One well-known firm, to my own knowledge, have secured not merely the home market for their products, but because of the contact established here, following the imposition of certain duties, have established a substantial export trade.  One boot manufacturing firm got an order for shoes of a certain description from a firm with multiple stores here, and the supply was so satisfactory that that firm wanted to give an order for these shoes for sale abroad.  Other examples of the same kind are continually coming to our notice.  In fact, it has been frequently demonstrated that the efficiency of our firms engaged in a number of lines of industry is all that <Col N="403" /> might be expected and, in some cases, much higher than that normally prevailing elsewhere.  They have, to my knowledge, shown a commendable desire to bring their equipment up-to-date. A very large number of them have, during the last three or four months, overhauled their machinery and introduced the latest devices for the perfection of their products, and generally to make themselves quite competent to stand up to any firm in the world as far as the quality of their products is concerned.  I do not think it is correct to say that the standard of living of our people has gone down.  In fact, I would say that there are a very large number of people in this country who have eaten meat much more frequently within the last six months than they ever did before.</P>

      <P>They will not agree that the standard of living has gone down.  Although it is undoubtedly true that the index of business activity has shown some falling off, that is not confined to this country.  It is true of every country in the world.  But here, because of the policy we are now operating and the efforts we are making in an almost virgin field to develop our productive capacity, we are weathering the general storm as well as, if not better than most people. I said last week that so far as the abnormal conditions that were produced by the action of the British Government were concerned, we have got over the worst.  I repeat that.  We can confidently hope that whatever dislocation and hardship may have been created here, we may look forward to continually improving conditions in the future.  It only requires that those responsible for the direction of policy will not lose their heads, but will see clearly the road they are taking and follow that road and see where it will eventually lead.</P>

      <P>I am sure the members of the Seanad will learn with gratification and gratitude of the magnificent and princely gift which a member of the Oireachtas has made to the nation.  The gift originated in the princely offer that Senator Vincent was good enough to make to the President of the Executive Council on the 28th July last, which was confirmed in the following letter:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Right">46 Kildare Street,</P>
      <P Just="Right">Dublin,</P>
      <P Just="Right">28th July, 1932.</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. President,</P>
      <P>Re Muckross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to our conversation of to-day's date, the Muckross Estate was purchased by Mr. W.B. Bourn, of San Mateo, California, about 1910 from Lord Ardilaun.  In 1916 Mr. Bourn settled the estate on me for my life with remainder to my children as I should appoint.  During the last 22 years I have greatly <Col N="405" /> improved the estate in every way, including forestry.  It is now in what one might call perfect condition.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, Mr. Bourn and I have arrived at the conclusion that it is going to be too big an undertaking for any private individual under the changing conditions of the world.</P>
    <P>The Muckross Estate would make a public park such as any country might be proud of.  It surrounds at least one half of the Lower Lake of Killarney; it entirely surrounds the Middle Lake, and bounds certainly two-thirds of the Upper Lake, and this area, if preserved as at present exists, will for all time be one of the greatest beauty spots in the world. The total area is some 13,000 acres.</P>
    <P>Under these circumstances Mr. Bourn and I would much prefer to see the State in possession than any private individual, and I would therefore be glad to know whether, if all legal difficulties in the way be overcome, the State would be ready to become the owner.  As a preliminary step I would suggest that you and some members of the Executive Council should come and stay with me and go over the estate, when I would be able to put all matters before you.</P>
    <P>The President did not find it possible to visit the estate, but a few members of the Executive Council, including myself, did so.  I should like to say in that connection that I had seen Killarney many times.  I knew the reputation which it bore for peerless beauty, but I never realised before how much tender care and exquisite taste could enhance the beauty of that magnificent place.  I came back very enthusiastic that the State should accept the gift, and the same feeling was expressed by the other members of the Executive Council who visited it. I am happy to say that, all the legal difficulties having been overcome, we were able to introduce a Bill entitled: &ldquo;Bourn Vincent Memorial Park Bill.&rdquo; It passed through all stages in the Dáil and it is now before the Seanad for acceptance.  The Bill, which is unprecedented <Col N="406" /> so far as our legislation is concerned, is in four Parts.  Part I is preliminary and general, dealing with the short title, definitions and provision for expenditure.  Part II deals with acceptance of the gifts; Part III with the maintenance of the Park; and Part IV with the custody and use of chattels personal.  It is the intention under this Bill, if it is accepted by the Oireachtas, and when it becomes law, that the estate will be constituted as a memorial park and that there will be erected there a monument to the late Maud Chase Bourn Vincent, wife of Senator Arthur Rose Vincent, who was largely responsible for the gift.  The monument will be maintained in perpetuity. The park will be maintained in perpetuity and will be administered by the Office of Public Works, in very much the same manner as the Phoenix Park, Stephen's Green and other public parks are maintained.  Power is taken in the Bill to charge and levy tolls.  It is essential that such powers should be taken, because otherwise the burden of maintaining the estate might entail heavy expenditure.  We hope that as the more private attractions of Killarney are now available to the public generally, and to tourists in particular, that a very substantial revenue will be derived from tolls which will not be burdensome upon the people of the district&mdash;because, I understand they enjoy very great facilities, even at present&mdash;which will enable us substantially to reduce the cost to the Exchequer of maintaining the estate.  I do not think it is necessary for me to say anything more, except to commend the Bill for acceptance, and again to express on behalf of the Executive Council, and I am sure on behalf of our people generally, our gratitude to Senator Vincent and to Mr. William Bowers Bourn, for this magnificent gift.</P>

For us in the Seanad there is added a very real pleasure in that Arthur Rose Vincent is a member of this House.</P>

      <P>As one who has lived in the neighbourhood of Killarney and Muckross from childhood, I would like to associate myself with what Senator Brown has said.  I have seen Muckross at different times, when it was derelict.  I have watched its development to the standard at which it is to-day during the time I have been here, and Senator Vincent took it over.  It is an instance of what I consider to be money economically and advantageously expended in afforestation, in horticulture, in beautiful grounds, which are generally open to the public, in the breeding of our native cattle, and finally in high-class or mixed farming and good estate management, coupled always with the most careful thought for all the people on the estate.  I mention that because I think it is from examples such as this, not only natural scenery, but the development of that natural scenery, and the application of modern ideas to beautiful scenery that we get our idea of the smaller houses and the cottages and the idea of the development of beautiful homes in this country.  From that point of view Muckross is an example of the greatest value.  It is to be hoped that the Government and the people will appreciate their new property, and maintain that splendid example as a standard for all time.</P>

For reasons of sentiment it may be a matter of great regret, and in that way we all deeply sympathise.  One of the donors has taken part in the public life in this country from a sense of duty.  Anyhow that action has been taken and I think the Government, in accepting the offer, are entirely justified and, also, in incurring the expense of the future upkeep of the estate.</P>

It is so far as the history of our new State is concerned unprecedented, but one would hope it would prove an example that would be followed in future where valuable possessions of this kind have to be forfeited, that duty to the nation would be recognised as Senator Vincent has recognised it.  There have been quite frequently in the last 25 or 30 years fears arising out of public statements now and again made, of the vulgarisation and destruction of the beauties of Killarney and Muckross district.  It is a good thing to know that in the case of Muckross its beauties have been enhanced by the generous expenditure of its owner.  One hopes that all that has been done by the present owners will be maintained, and improved, and that there will be no risk of vulgarisation that sometimes is alleged to be the consequence of State management. One need not enlarge upon these things but I am proud and glad to associate myself and my colleagues, of the Labour Party, with the views that have been expressed to the donors of this splendid gift to the nation.</P>

      <P>Before calling on the Minister to reply in the debate perhaps I might be allowed to express my gratitude to the donor for this magnificent gift to the nation.  The scenery in this munificent gift of Mucross estate is among the most beautiful of its kind in the world.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A monarch's wealth may raise a Fontainebleau,</P>
      <P>But 'tis for Nature Mucross' pride to shew.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And it has inspired many gems of literature, both Irish and English, as for example Tennyson's finest lyric in <i>The Princess.</i>  Muckross means more than that, however, to the Gael, for in the ruined priory of its age-old abbey is the last resting place of the noblest warriors of the great clans of the McCarthys, the O'Sullivans and the O'Donoghues.  Here, too, in the chancel, lie two of the greatest of the Munster poets, Egan O'Rahilly and Owen Rua O'Sullivan, the Robert Burns of the native Irish.  As the knowledge of our mournful but proud history becomes more widely disseminated, as it will from year to year, our Irish people will view this &ldquo;quiet, watered land,&rdquo; which is now about to become their property, with the deepening affection which comes from knowledge; and when memories of old rancours, now dying, are long dead, our children's children will regard the gift, not as an act of restoration from Gall to Gael, but as a bestowal of part of our national heritage, which had at different times for centuries been in the possession of both Gall and Gael, upon a united people in which both elements are happily blended and which is informed with the virtues of both.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Act is to give effect to Article 41 of the International Convention for the safety of life at sea.  Article 41 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The contracting Governments agree that after midnight on 30th June, 1931, helm or steering orders, i.e., orders to the steersman, shall on all their ships be given in the direct sense, e.g., when the ship is going ahead an order containing the word &ldquo;starboard&rdquo; or &ldquo;right&rdquo; or any equivalent of &ldquo;starboard&rdquo; or &ldquo;right&rdquo; shall only be used when it is intended, on ships as at present generally constructed and arranged, that the wheel, the rudder blade, and the head of the ship shall all move to the right.</P>
      <P>As a result of tradition which existed since ships were steered by tillers, it has always been the practice that if it was intended that a ship should go to the right to give the order to move the helm to the left.  One could easily understand that as the tiller had to be moved to the left to get the head of the ship to go to the right.  As a result of the International Conference it has been agreed generally, among all countries, that the system of direct orders shall prevail. That system already prevails in the United States and for the ships of other countries.  The British Mercantile Marine adhered to the old system. But they have agreed now to bring the new system into operation from January next and so it is desirable that our system should work in conformity with theirs.</P>

      <P>I wish to take advantage of this Bill to refer to the last item on it, namely the Courts of Justice Act, 1929.  I am not going to go into detail as to this Bill as, probably before it comes up again, its provision will be reconsidered.  But I wish to impress upon the Minister the necessity of doing something to implement the report of the Courts of Justice Committee with which this Act will probably be incorporated, with a view to doing away with a great many of the evils that have grown up under the Courts of Justice Act.  This is not an occasion on which I need elaborate that matter.  But the expenses, at least on appeal, are such as to amount to a denial of justice inasmuch as a great many people will not go into the courts to seek their rights because of the expense that would arise if an appeal were to be taken.  I shall give just one example, and this may simply be regarded as applying to small amounts.  I am connected with a company that went into litigation in connection with an item of approximately £2,000.  The trial of that case occupied four days but when it went to appeal eleven days were occupied in the hearing&mdash;four days in the reading of the notes&mdash;and eventually costing more than twice the amount of the money involved.  In the case of both plaintiffs and defendants they lost as much as the amount at issue so that when the decision was given both sides had lost a sum equal to the amount they went to seek.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to provide for the grant and distribution amongst county councils and certain urban districts of a sum of £250,000 to be applied by them in relieving to a certain extent the rates leviable during the current financial year in respect of agricultural land.  The Bill proposes that the sum of £250,000 should be allocated in the proportions set forth in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the benefit of the grant should be given primarily to small farmers who, for this purpose, are taken to be persons in possession of agricultural land, the rateable value of which does not exceed £10.  Larger farmers in possession of land of greater value are not excluded from benefit but will rank as if they were small farmers in possession of land not exceeding £10 in value.  Other persons in occupation of agricultural land will participate in the benefit of the grant to the same extent as if they were small farmers.  The benefit to be given was fixed at approximately three-fourths of the current rates leviable on such valuations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly the proportion on which the grant is allocated is based on the aggregate of the number of valuation units of £10 or less in each county and urban district and the current rates leviable thereon.  For this purpose, with certain exceptions, a person in occupation of agricultural <Col N="413" /> land the total valuation of which exceeds £10 is treated as in occupation of land of a valuation of £10.  These exceptions are specified in Section 2 of the Bill and comprise land in respect of which owners, not being occupiers, are rated under the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928, or land acquired by local authorities under the Labourers Acts or held by the Land Commission.  Each tenement held by these persons and bodies is for the purpose of the Bill regarded as having a separate valuation unit and accordingly they get the benefit of the grant in respect of each holding.</P>
    <P>The sum of £250,000 has therefore been apportioned between each of the counties and urban districts in proportion to the total of the valuation units calculated as described in each such county and urban district and the rates leviable thereon.  Thus if each of the sums set forth in the Schedule is divided by the sum of the valuation units in each county and urban district, it will produce a rate in the £ equivalent to approximately three-fourths of the current rates leviable thereon in respect of agricultural land.</P>
    <P>The remission of rates which each person will obtain is therefore measured by the product of his unit of valuation and such rates as so ascertained. The remission on this basis would roughly be equivalent to three-fourths of the current rates on land on the basis of a valuation of £10 or less.</P>
    <P>At the time the Government announced their intention of making this grant, most of the rates in the counties and urban districts had either been made or were in process of being made and it was not considered practicable to have the rates revised on the basis of the grants to be made to each county and urban district.  It is accordingly proposed that the allowances to be made to ratepayers will be made by the issue of credit notes to the amount of the remission due to each ratepayer.</P>
    <P>On presentation of any such credit note in part payment of rates, credit will be given to the ratepayer concerned to the extent of the amount specified in the note.  Such credit note <Col N="414" /> may be presented in part payment of any rate due by the ratepayer.  Provision is made for the refund either in whole or in part to a ratepayer, who has paid all his rates for the current year, of the amount of a credit note issued to him.</P>
    <P>With a view to expediting the payment of rates it is provided that the benefit of credit notes must be claimed on or before the 31st day of March, 1933, the last day of the current financial year.  Any proportion of the grant which is not disposed of by the end of that year will be applied in the subsequent year in like manner as the ordinary agricultural grant would be applicable, and thus any balance outstanding will go in relief of the general body of persons rated in respect of agricultural land.</P>
    <P>It was necessary to give certain directions and instructions to county and urban district councils in anticipation of the provisions of this Bill, and accordingly by Section 10 of the Bill provision is made for their validation, and the validation of the acts done by those councils under such directions or instructions.</P>

      <P>Attached to this Bill there is a Schedule in which, if I understand it rightly, the various amounts are allocated to the different counties.  I should like to know on what basis that Schedule is prepared, because it seems somewhat arbitrary, in the absence of explanation, that a county of rather large holdings like Limerick gets proportionately such a large grant.  Personally, I do not see a reason for the Schedule at all if it is going to apply to holdings of a certain denomination.  One cannot see the necessity for making it water-tight in counties also.  On this whole question of our local finances generally could the Minister give the House any indication of how the current rates are being met?  Is there going to be any likelihood of a deficit in the current rates and, if so, how is that deficiency going to be met?  The Minister can understand that he cannot expect the ordinary commercial sources, such as the banks who ordinarily provide the finances, to continue to finance a situation where, apparently, the <Col N="415" /> rates are not being paid Where the rates are not being paid a totally different situation is being created, which would appear to need the aid of a central authority.  I should like to know whether the Minister anticipates any demand on the Central Fund in order to make good deficits on the rates?</P>

      <P>On a point of information, I should like to know from the Minister what is the effect of the Bill?  Many farmers with whom I am acquainted got a credit note for £1. Nearly everybody got it.  I should like to know whether the small man, up to £10, is getting the benefit of three-fourths of his rates.  I understood that rates on £10 of land are written off for everybody, but £1 would not be three-fourths of the rates of a £10 man.  My rates are about £280 and I got £1 relief, so I am doing well.  But am I correct in understanding the Minister to say that the small man gets three-fourths of the rates he would pay allowed now under this Act?</P>

      <P>Section 3 gives the definition that the Senator asked for, I think.  I admit it is an involved section, but I need not read it for you as you can read it for yourselves.  That section sets out the basis on which the money has been allocated and the desire was to give three-fourths of the net rate after taking into account the million and three-quarters on agricultural land that has already been granted at different times to holders of agricultural land, not in any case to relieve it to more than three-fourths of <Col N="416" /> the net rate due.  To give such relief, as I believe, would not be more than three-fourths.  That was the principle that was allotted as to how the money was divided between the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, with regard to the collection of rates, I may say that we would be pleased if the rates were coming in more rapidly and better than they are, but on the whole, taking the economic situation of the country as it is, we are not dissatisfied.  From some statements I read in the Press&mdash;newspaper statements and the statements of statesmen and politicians&mdash;I did think that at the end of the half year we would have been in a much worse state. I am glad to say, however, that we were agreeably surprised with the collection of rates in many counties. On the whole, we are not dissatisfied and we do not look upon the prospect for the end of the financial year as a bad one.</P>

      <P>Soon after the Government assumed office in March last representations were made from various parts of the country with regard to the scarcity of seeds for the purpose of the spring sowing and it was felt that it would be well to enable local bodies to meet necessitous cases in their areas by enabling them to promote schemes for the supply of seed oats and seed potatoes to small farmers in need of such facilities, the cost to be recovered subsequently after harvesting had been completed. County councils were requested to consider the position locally and, if satisfied that the need existed for enabling farmers to obtain seed supplies, to make arrangements accordingly.  The county councils were authorised to arrange with merchants for the supply of seed potatoes and oats on loan terms pending the harvesting of the crops.  When the application (which was required to be in the prescribed form), was accepted by the county council an order was sent to the merchant mentioned by the applicant, from whom the applicant arranged to take delivery, having first filled up the prescribed form guaranteeing to the county council the cost of the seed.</P>
      <P>The seed supplies were undertaken on this basis in about twenty counties.  The total amount of advances involved would be about £25,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supply schemes, being limited to necessitous cases, were fairly small in each area.  The supplies included barley, oats, potatoes and fertilisers. Forms of undertaking to repay the amounts involved were signed by recipients in all cases.  The recipients were liable for the full cost, including their share of any interest on moneys borrowed, or any administrative <Col N="418" /> expenses.  The undertakings provided for repayment on harvesting, or by the 31st December, 1932, but as it is anticipated that portion of the moneys will still be outstanding by that date it is desired to provide for recovery with the poor rate levies for 1933/34.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to validate the supply of seeds or fertilisers by county councils and to give legal authority to agreements with the local bodies made by any occupier or cultivator of land to obtain seeds or fertilisers.  The obtaining of a supply of seeds or fertilisers is not to be regarded as a disqualification for membership of a local body.  Various instructions and sanctions given by the Minister in furtherance of the scheme are proposed to be validated, and provision is made for the recovery of sums payable under the Act to local bodies in addition to the method of recovery already set out in the agreements.  It is proposed to validate the borrowing by local bodies of any sums applicable to the financing of the seed supply schemes. In point of fact no special loans were raised, the cost in each case being merged in the ordinary county overdraft.</P>
    <P>It is felt that legislation of a permanent nature would be desirable for the purpose of empowering local bodies to proceed with supplies in years when the necessity for supplementing individual effort might be necessary.  The matter is under consideration by my Department at the moment, and I may be in a position to introduce a Bill early in the New Year to give local bodies the necessary statutory powers in the matter.  I am, however, proceeding with the validating legislation at the moment as the necessity for giving legal sanction to the schemes of this year is urgent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a comprehensive measure, and its administration will fall partly to the Department of Industry and Commerce and partly to the Department of Agriculture. It is, consequently, a measure which perhaps could be usefully discussed in two stages, but it was considered desirable that all the provisions of the scheme should be embodied in the one Bill so that the danger of overlapping, which would be natural under these circumstances, would be reduced to a minimum.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide, first, for the encouragement of the growing of various cereal crops in the country; secondly, to ensure that there will be a market for any such crop grown; and, thirdly, to provide the industrial concerns for the utilisation of the wheat crop and the marketing of the other crops in the form required by <Col N="420" /> the Bill.  It is, I think, hardly necessary to expatiate on the desirability of securing increased production of the various cereal crops with which this Bill is concerned or the utilisation of those crops for feeding purposes by the breeders of live stock, in so far as that is practicable, in preference to imported cereals.  Neither should it be necessary to advocate at length the desirability of securing that the flour requirements of the Saorstát should be provided in full from mills established in the Saorstát.  Apart altogether from the question of the increased employment involved and the greater national wealth resultant from that employment, there is the broad question of national safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most civilised countries governments have been concerned to encourage the production of wheat and other cereals as well as to preserve the milling industry as a key industry. There is practically no European country in which State assistance of one kind or another to encourage wheat production is not given, or in which the flour-milling industry is not protected.  I know there are some people who believe that for some peculiar reason Ireland is the one spot upon the earth on which it is not possible to grow wheat, and the one country which, for some reason, might find it advantageous to depend on outside sources for its supplies of an essential commodity of food, namely, flour.  That view, however, is I am sure not generally held anywhere.  It has always been one of the points of the national programme here that State action to restore wheat as one of the main crops of the country, plus action to develop the flour-milling industry, should be undertaken.  That is the design behind this Bill.  It is, of course, possible to criticise the machinery that has been established to achieve these ends, but I do not think anyone can dispute the desirability of attaining these ends.  It may be that the machinery is capable of improvement.  It may be that alternative methods of achieving the same purpose can be devised, but the desirability of the purpose is, I think, beyond question.  If, therefore, we <Col N="421" /> accept that contention and examine the Bill from the point of view of its practicability and the machinery which it purports to create, I think we will find that whatever defects the machinery may have it is at least capable of working.  Senators will, perhaps, be enabled to appreciate that fact better if I go through the various Parts of the Bill and explain what they are intended to achieve.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill is mainly confined to definitions of one kind or another. Section 3 is a list of definitions all of which are, of course, important because the significance of the terms used in the Bill rests upon the phraseology of that section.  Sections 4 and 5 are designed to secure, in respect of the flour-milling industry, the operation of the principles which were embodied in the Control of Manufactures Act.  Senators will remember that the milling of wheat was expressly excluded from the scope of that Act because of the intention to introduce this Bill which makes special provision in the case of the milling industry.  Section 10 provides for the establishment of an Advisory Committee, the duties of which will be to advise the Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect of the execution of his functions under the Act.</P>
    <P>It is when we come to Part II of the Bill that we get to the vital clauses of it.  Part II provides for the control and regulation of wheat milling.  It is, perhaps, well at this stage to point out that to a very large extent the scheme outlined in this Part of the Bill is at present in operation, and that it would be possible in any event to bring the entire scheme of the Bill into effect by purely finance legislation.  To a large extent that has been done, but it was considered desirable and just that the details of the scheme should be set out in legislation and those affected by it given all the protection required. Part II provides that it shall not be lawful for any person to engage in the business of milling wheat without a licence.  For those who were engaged in the industry during any part of 1931 that licence is automatically available.  It cannot be refused <Col N="422" /> to them or made subject to any conditions except those that are set out on the face of the Bill.  In respect of concerns established after the passage of the Bill, or silent mills which were not in production in 1931 but which were in production some years previous to that, a licence may or may not be granted, and such licence may or may not be subject to special conditions. It is our aim to secure that the milling capacity of the country will be brought to a point somewhat in excess of the country's requirements. It may be considered desirable to allow milling capacity to grow, to an extent, after 100 per cent. of the requirements had been satisfied, but those who have been watching the experience of other countries, and, particularly, the experience of Great Britain, which, during the war, became very much over-milled, will realise that there are, in connection with this industry, very considerable disadvantages associated with too much competition.  Consequently, it would be the policy of the Government to be very reluctant to issue new licences for the establishment of additional mills after the point had been reached at which we could say that the entire requirements of the country were being met from existing mills, and something more, that something more being intended to ensure that the element of competition would enter and have its influence on price levels.</P>
    <P>Pending the day on which we will be able to supply all our requirements, flour must, of course, be imported.  At present, there is a 5/- import duty on flour, with a licence provision.  That licence provision is being operated to allow in that quantity of flour which is required to supplement the production of the existing mills, with a little more. On September 1st, that scheme came into operation.  The duty on flour was imposed in July but it was not made effective until 1st September.  On that date, the normal importation of flour was reduced by one half and it continued at that rate until November when a much more substantial reduction was made.  The reduction which was made in November was very <Col N="423" /> substantial because it appeared obvious, during the months preceding it, that we had, to some extent, underestimated the supply of flour in the country and over-estimated the quantity of flour required.  Consequently, although we reduced the importation by half as from 1st September, the existing mills did not come, as we intended they should come, into full production, and, in fact, some mills here and there had to close temporarily, for a week or so, in order to clear stocks.  We effected, on 1st September, therefore, a much more drastic reduction, although it is possible that, at the end of the next quarter, when the position is being reviewed, an increased quantity of flour will have to be allowed in. However, the intention is to get the existing mills to the point of producing to capacity and allowing in the quantity of flour required to supplement their production and to supply our requirements plus a certain percentage designed to ensure that the element of competition will operate.</P>
    <P>A number of applications in anticipation of the passage of this Bill for licences to erect new mills or to extend the capacity of existing mills have been received and we have, in fact, more or less planned out the flour-milling scheme as it will finally appear.  An intimation has been given to various parties that, on the passage of the Bill, the licence they require will be issued to them.  The purpose behind the giving of these undertakings was to ensure that there would be no delay in the construction of new mills or in the extension of existing mills necessary to bring production to the point at which it would meet requirements.</P>
    <P>If, and when, Senators are inclined to criticise this Part of the Bill and the measure of control which it gives over the flour-milling industry, there are some points I want them to bear in mind.  The first is that the flour-milling industry has been controlled in the Saorstát for a number of years. Senators will remember that, in 1926, after the establishment of the Tariff Commission the flour millers of the <Col N="424" /> Saorstát applied for the imposition of a protective duty against which the Tariff Commission recommended. Some time after that refusal of a protective duty, the flour millers of the Saorstát entered into an arrangement with the flour millers of Great Britain concerned with this market. An organisation called the Mutual Millers' Association was formed and the Saorstát market was parcelled out between the importers and the home producers.</P>
    <P>The arrangement permitted home producers to manufacture flour to half the capacity of their mills and to supply what were roughly half the requirements of the country and permitted the importers to supply the balance.  Any Saorstát flour miller who exceeded his quota under the arrangement became liable to a fine, and a more substantial fine than is provided for in this Bill.  The money secured from these fines went into a fund which was designed to facilitate Saorstát flour millers to get out of business.  The whole industry was rigidly controlled by flour millers, in the interest of flour millers, and those who will take the trouble of studying the movement of flour prices will note that, since the scheme came into operation, the movement has been continuously upward.  That situation was one which, in our opinion, was most undesirable.  It was complicated by the fact that a very big English combine was gradually acquiring a controlling influence over the industry and, at the time of the change of Government, somewhat more than one-third of the total milling capacity of the country was under the influence of that combine.  That position has not been disturbed.  It is true that the proportion of capacity which that particular group will control will diminish as the total capacity increases, but it is not intended to refuse a licence under this Bill to anybody who was, in fact, engaged in milling flour during 1931.  We are merely stepping in to prevent the position becoming worse but we do not attempt to go back over anything that has been done although certain action has been taken voluntarily by people concerned <Col N="425" /> which has, to some extent, redressed that position.</P>
    <P>The scheme here provides for the issuing of quotas in respect of each licensed mill.  It is intended that these quotas will be fixed on the full capacity of the mill during the year 1931.  A miller may mill less than the quota to the extent of 10 per cent.  If he fails to mill this quota by more than 10 per cent., he commits an offence under the Bill and is liable to punishment, but, apart from the legal punishment provided, he becomes liable to a reduction in his quota.  If he mills more than his quota, he has to pay a fine of 3/- per sack on the excess. Three shillings is, of course, a fairly substantial amount, but a fluctuation of 3/- in the price of flour, in the course of a year, is not unusual and it is quite conceivable that certain mills in the country may find it profitable to sell in excess of their quota, paying a fine of 3/- per sack and still be able to compete with other mills, and there is nothing in the Bill to prevent them from doing that.  The inefficient flour miller is not safeguarded by the Bill. There will be, apart from any other consideration, a surplus of flour; that surplus will have to find a market and it will find it at the expense of the most inefficient miller.  That miller will not be able to sell flour to his quota, consequently, and, in the following quota year, his quota will be reduced, and, step by step, he will go out of existence.  Apart from that, there is always the possibility of the other factor operating, that the more efficient miller may be able to undersell him in his own district, despite the 3/- fine, in which case he will be unable, to a much greater extent, to mill to his quota.  Quotas are liable to variation as circumstances require but, generally speaking, it is our intention that quotas will be fixed at the capacity of the mill and will only be increased in consequence of the operation of our definite plan.  There are certain mills in respect of which we have already given an undertaking that, in the event of the Bill becoming law, an increase in the quota will be permitter, and these firms, in anticipation of the passage of the Bill, <Col N="426" /> and on the strength of that undertaking, are, at the moment, installing the additional machinery required.</P>
    <P>It is not intended that the whole of the difference between present capacity and requirements will be filled in that way because there are a number of districts in the Saorstát in which there are no mills at present and in which it is eminently desirable that mills should exist.  I might mention the northern part of the country as an example.  If we draw a line from Dublin to Galway we find that there is only one flour mill, near Sligo, north of that line, and, in view of the number of bakeries in the eastern part of the country, in North Dublin and also in Donegal and other places, it is obviously desirable that we should have flour mills in these districts.  It is intended to hold some part of the quotas for mills which have been established there or in respect of which steps have already been taken. Similarly there are other parts of the country in which any one glancing at a map of the country on which the location of flour mills is marked, will note that it is desirable that mills should be established, and steps to this end are being taken.  Companies are being formed and capital being raised. In other places, the situation can easily be met by extending the capacity of some existing mill and that also is being done.</P>
    <P>It is our desire that, to whatever extent is possible, the mills should be established in rural areas rather than at the ports.  The whole tendency recently, of course, has been to concentrate flour mills on the quayside at the larger ports because of the savings effected in the unloading of wheat from ships, but if we are going to have a wheat promotion scheme and any considerable quantity of wheat available in the country, the principal advantage of a port mill does not operate and, in fact, it becomes, on balance, desirable to have the mill in rural areas rather than in port areas. There are, of course, some flour millers who are very strongly of opinion, and who have given voice to their opinions in the Press, that, in any event, a rural mill has a substantial advantage <Col N="427" /> over a port mill and that it can produce more economically and sell more cheaply, but that opinion is not widely held.  The tendency, however, has been, in recent years, towards the erection of huge mills with tremendous capacity on the quayside.  I do not wish to say that I would favour, to any great extent, the establishment of very small mills, but mills with a capacity smaller than some of the larger port mills, situated in rural areas, under the new circumstances, would appear to be quite as competent to mill and to sell as cheaply as any port mill. In pursuance of our general policy, the licensing powers conferred by this Bill will be operated to that end.  Of course, we must always bear in mind that the large centres of consumption are the cities and, consequently, the necessary provision to supply the requirements of the cities must be made.</P>
    <P>Section 29 requires that every licensed flour miller shall mill in each year a fixed quantity of home-grown wheat.  The quantity will be determined by the Minister for Industry and Commerce after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, having regard to the reports received of the quantity of wheat grown in the country.  A definition of millable wheat will be made, but it will be necessary in the initial stages to work upon some rough and ready calculation in fixing the quota of home-grown wheat to be milled by each miller.  Power is taken to vary that quantity from time to time during the season as it is found we have underestimated or overestimated the supply.  Power is also conferred upon any flour miller to arrange to have his quota of home-grown wheat milled on his behalf by another miller.  It is not unlikely some flour millers will arrange to have a large part of their capacity devoted entirely to the milling of home-grown wheat on behalf of those flour millers whose mills are not at the moment sufficiently equipped to handle home-grown wheat in an efficient manner. There are mills in the country which <Col N="428" /> milled home-grown wheat in the past. These mills are equipped with the necessary kilns for drying wheat and they possess facilities not possessed by other mills.  Some arrangement of the kind I have referred to may be made with flour millers and this section makes adequate provision in that respect.</P>
    <P>Part III provides for subsidies to inland mills in certain cases.  When the Bill was being drafted, we had in mind that it might be necessary to provide some inducement to millers to remain in rural areas until such time as the supply of home-grown wheat was available and this Part was inserted in the Bill.  During the period between the drawing up of the Bill and its introduction in the Dáil we went into the matter with very great care and in very great detail.  We discussed it on a number of occasions with the organisation of the flour millers and with individual millers.  Finally we came to the conclusion that, on balance, there was no case for a subsidy for inland mills. Whatever disadvantages they had <i>vis-a-vis</i> the port mills, they had also compensating advantages and most of them could hold, and were in fact very successfully holding, their own against port mills and could be expected to do so.  We did feel there might be isolated cases of mills in particular districts suffering from particular disadvantages which, in the general public interest, should be preserved and we felt that some subsidy arrangement might be necessary in their case.  Consequently, we amended Part III of the Bill during its passage through the Dáil so as to give us power in certain cases to provide, for limited periods, subsidies to mills so situated. I do not anticipate that power will have to be exercised to any extent.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill provides for the registration of flour importers, distillers, wheat importers, wheat dealers, wheat growers, maize millers, maize importers and manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs, It also imposes a restriction on the carrying on of certain businesses.  It is necessary that not merely should flour and maize milling be brought under supervision and control, but that <Col N="429" /> certain consequential provisions should also be made in respect of other industries. Distillers must be secured their supplies of wheat and it is also necessary to ensure that there will be no possibility of the State being defrauded by any part of the subsidy available for the encouragement of wheat growing being expended in respect of imported wheat.</P>
    <P>The scheme for the subsidisation of wheat-growing is, I think, easily understandable.  All wheat-growers are required to register with the Department of Agriculture.  When the farmer offers his wheat for sale he offers it to whatever flour miller is prepared to take it.  A record of the sale is made and transmitted to the Department of Agriculture.  At the end of the year the officials of the Department determine what has been the average price paid for home-grown wheat.  There is then paid to each grower, to each farmer, the difference between that average price and the standard price set out in the Second Schedule of the Bill.  The standard price varies for different periods of the year and the variation is designed to encourage farmers not to market all their wheat at once but to hold it till after the turn of the year and then offer it during that period.  Farmers who can keep it are induced to hold it.  If a farmer cannot keep it, he can market it at once. There are certain farmers who may be able to hold the wheat and the higher price operating in the second part of the year is designed to induce them to hold the wheat.</P>
    <P>There is every inducement to a farmer to get the highest price possible from a miller.  If a farmer has wheat of first-class quality and succeeds in getting an exceptional price from the miller, a higher price even than the standard price, the subsidy will still be available for him.  Then there is the case of the farmer who grows a low quality wheat and who gets a low price.  The farmer with the low quality wheat may get less than the average price, while the farmer with the better quality wheat will get the standard price.  If you can imagine all the farmers combining <Col N="430" /> and entering into an arrangement with the flour millers and fixing a price for wheat, the State might be made to pay substantially more than we anticipate at the moment; but we do not think that is likely.  The individual farmer will always have a substantial inducement to get the best price possible and the better the price he gets the higher will be the average price and the lower will be the subsidy payable.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal with any of the points made from time to time in public speeches, in newspaper reports and newspaper articles about the difficulty of growing wheat here.  The Minister for Agriculture will, presumably, answer any criticism on that point, although I think the whole subject has been so debated that there is very little that is new to be said. We have the concrete fact that wheat was grown here.  In the year 1847 there were 750,000 acres of wheat grown.  That is the first year for which agricultural statistics are available. I know some people get the impression that we are taking the year 1847 because it has some relation to the Famine.  That is not so.  We are taking it because it is the first year for which we have agricultural statistics for this country.  We have also the records of the various bodies responsible for these things, which show that there has been no change in our climate since then.  There is the same average amount of rainfall and sunshine.  We have also the fact that there have been improved methods of agriculture brought about.  We have artificial manures and a number of other advantages which the farmers in 1847 had not got.  We have also the fact that the farmers in 1847 got an average yield of 16 cwts. per acre, which is much higher than the average yield in Canada, France or Germany to-day.  We can, I think, anticipate that farmers at the present day will be able to get a higher average yield with the improved methods of agriculture now available.</P>
    <P>Wheat can be grown successfully in this country, and it is our belief that the only inducement which the farmer requires to grow wheat on a much more <Col N="431" /> extensive scale is the advantage of knowing that a market for his wheat exists and that he will be able to ascertain in advance what price he is likely to get for it.  A guaranteed market is much more important than a guaranteed price, but we are proposing to give him both.  In the immediate past the farmer had no certainty if he sowed wheat that he could turn it into cash and he had no opportunity of foreseeing what amount of cash he was likely to get, because the price of wheat in recent years has been falling very rapidly.  It has fallen to such an extent that the Canadian Government has recently had to resort to a scheme for the subsidisation of wheat production.</P>
    <P>The position is that if wheat is not grown, then there is no harm done. No subsidy will be paid and we will be just exactly as we were.  If wheat is grown to any substantial extent, although it will involve the State in the payment of the subsidy it will also mean increased employment on the land and a much better utilisation of the land from the national point of view.  It will also mean a substantial diminution of what is probably the largest single item on our import list. We spend approximately £7,000,000 upon wheat and flour.  Assuming flour imports cease, we can anticipate a substantial increase in wheat imports during the next few years until we can get to the point where that import will begin to diminish with the increased production of wheat here. I do not know if any of us will see the day when we will be able to supply entirely our home requirements, but we can get a considerable way along that road with definite advantage to the nation.</P>
    <P>There are other sections which can be more usefully discussed on the Committee Stage, because they relate entirely to the details and the machinery.  There is, however, one provision which must be dealt with and that is the part of the Bill which requires that when any maize meal mixture is offered for sale there must be contained in it a stated quantity of home-grown cereals.  There is a <Col N="432" /> prohibition on the sale of maize and maize meal and it is intended that those who grow oats and barley will also be given some security as regards a market, although they are not getting the same guarantee as regards price that the grower of wheat will obtain.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure a guaranteed market and also to make a start upon the substitution of home-grown grain for imported cereals for the feeding of stock.  There is a very large annual sum exported for maize and it is, I think, generally admitted by all those who claim to talk as experts in the matter that to a great extent maize can be substituted with advantage by the native grain. The means of getting to that end proposed in this Bill is the compulsory admixture scheme.  Other devices are, of course, feasible or conceivable but this is the one that appeared to us less likely to cause any dislocation and most likely to produce the result desired.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision in the Bill which has aroused some comment and with which it is necessary to deal. That is contained in Part VII, which provides that under certain circumstances the Minister for Industry and Commerce may acquire and operate a flour mill and that the Minister for Agriculture may acquire and operate a maize mill.  It is not anticipated that the powers conferred by that part of the Bill will have to be called upon at any time.  They are merely provided by way of safeguard.  It is conceivable that, in some eventuality, the flour millers of the State might decide to cease milling flour and leave us in the position of having to depend entirely on outside sources, which might not be able to supply our requirements.  It is obvious that there must be authority in somebody to come in and work the mills in those circumstances for the benefit of the people.  Apart from that consideration, special circumstances may arise in particular districts which may make the conferring of that power upon the Minister desirable.  It is intended more as a deterrent than anything else and, as I said, it is not anticipated that the power will have to be used. I, for one, sincerely hope that the <Col N="433" /> circumstances under which it would have to be used will never arise. These are the main features of the Bill.  It is, undoubtedly, a major measure but it is one which must have been anticipated as soon as the result of the General Election was known. I think that quite a number of farmers proceeded to take the necessary steps in anticipation of the introduction of this measure as soon as the change of Government took place.  The Party composing the present Government had been advocating a proposal of this kind for some years and had committed itself to embarking upon such a scheme.  We think that it will be found by experience that this is a policy which is desirable in every way. If it is successful&mdash;and we must all hope, even those amongst us who are doubtful, that it will be a success&mdash;it will effect a very considerable change in the life of the country.  It will mean that the land will be utilised in the production of wealth to a greater extent than heretofore, that much more employment will be given upon the land, that the necessity we are now under of exporting a large quantity of agricultural produce in order to pay  the importation of a smaller quantity of agricultural produce will have been removed and, consequently, that there will be a substantial increase  the standard of living of our people.</P>
    <P>It may be that our hopes are unduly optimistic.  It may be that those who have been taking the pessimistic line will prove to be right.  But, in that event, as I have pointed out, this Bill will do no harm.  It can only do good and we, on our part, have no doubt as to what the results will be.  There is already an indication that it is likely to be a success.  We anticipate that some 65,000 acres of wheat will be grown this year.  That figure is based upon reports received in the Department of Agriculture from their inspectors throughout the country. That, as a start, is not too bad.  It represents an increase of substantially more than one hundred per cent. on the acreage.</P>
    <P>In the present financial year, it is anticipated that the cost of operating the Bill will not be very heavy.  In a <Col N="434" /> full year, the cost of the additional staff required for the operation of the measure has been estimated at about £5,500.  In the present year, only about £1,800 will be expended under that head.  In the year 1933-34, it is anticipated that the wheat subsidy will amount to £120,000.  It will, of course, vary from year to year with the quantity of wheat grown.</P>

      <P>The current price&mdash;15/- per barrel.  It is proposed, in the present year, to make advances to seed dealers to enable them to sell seed wheat on credit and provision for a sum of about £40,000 is being made in that connection.  Of course, that amount will be repaid in the next year when the wheat will have been grown and the subsidy will come to be paid. It is not anticipated that there will be any expenditure in respect of subsidies for inland mills.  I have explained the circumstances in that connection.  From the point of view of statistics, the requirements of the country in flour are taken at 2,900,000 sacks.  The capacity of the existing mills is roughly 2,200 sacks and the balance has got to be provided by new mills.  The requirements of the country in wheat can be supplied by roughly 800,000 acres but it is not anticipated that we will have 800,000 acres of wheat next year.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal as a practical tillage farmer with this Bill. I have several years' experience of farming in the best tillage county in Ireland.  I believe that this Bill is a thoroughly bad one and that it will be a hopeless failure.  I base that opinion not on my own knowledge but on the authority of every practical farmer with whom I have spoken concerning it.  As the Minister said, the arguments against this measure have been stated <i>ad nauseam</i>, but there are a few points which I did not hear mentioned before. In a year or two, I believe that there will be a number of very disillusioned people in this country as the result of their attempts to grow wheat.  We have had this year, a remarkable year <Col N="435" />&mdash;one of those years which come once in 25 or 50 years.  It may have led some people who would have had doubts otherwise to think that they can grow wheat.  Of course, wheat can be grown in very special land in a good season.  Given these factors, you can produce fairly good wheat but not at all as good as the wheat from Manitoba, which is the best in the world.  The Government are certainly setting out on a big scheme when they go out against nature and seek to change the whole taste of the people. I admire their courage although I cannot agree with their methods.  The people are going to be taxed to pay the subsidy and to raise the price of wheat to 25/- per barrel of 20 stones. At the present time, the price of the very best Manitoba wheat is about 30/-.  That is the best wheat the world can produce.  Why did not the farmers of Ireland grow wheat during the war, when there was a very big price for it? Why did they not grow it during the eight years recently that the price was maintained at about 30/-?  Will a price of 25/- induce them to grow it now?  I believe that the only people who will try this experiment is the down-and-out farmer, who does not mind whether he wins or loses, or the person without experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like to touch upon the vexed question of climate, because so much has been said about it.  The only thing the Minister mentioned in connection with climate was the rainfall. It is not the amount of rain that matters, it is the time the rain comes&mdash;in the spring and harvest.  It is the foggy, damp atmosphere and the humidity of the climate that count.  We are in the Arctic latitude&mdash; the same latitude as Labrador, which is snowed up for the greater part of the year.  The Gulf Stream comes along here and changes what could be snow and ice into vapour, making this climate specially suited for certain things.  It provides us with the best grazing in the world and makes the land suitable for the production of any green crops and unsuitable for the production of grain generally. My father was a large tillage farmer <Col N="436" /> and grew from 70 to 80 acres of corn every year.  He never grew wheat in my time.  I asked him why he did not grow wheat.  He told me that it would not pay him to do so.  Like many a foolish person, starting out I had sentimental ideas about the growing of wheat.  I thought it was not right that we should be importing such a large amount of flour and wheaten meal and that we should not attempt to grow wheat for ourselves. My experience of wheat sown in the spring was that it was a most precarious crop.  I ploughed it up more than once and sowed barley where it had been, losing the seed and labour. The soil in my part happens to be a heavy, clay soil.  It is difficult of cultivation and unsuitable for the growing of any winter crops on account of the dirty condition in which they leave the land.  I tried the growing of winter wheat.  Winter wheat has ten months in the rain-sodden earth.  I have sown it and it succeeded fairly well until the month of July or August.  I have seen it then sprouting up&mdash;the second crop&mdash; and being an absolute failure, time and again.  These are things for which the farmer who wants to grow wheat will have to be prepared.</P>
    <P>There is one matter to which I should like to call the attention of the Minister for Agriculture.  Perhaps he will be able to give me an explanation of it.  What is the cause of the extraordinary growth of rushes all over the country during the last five or six years?  It is quite phenomenal and people have not been able to explain it.  Even on high land, we have this growth of rushes, showing that it is waterlogged.  I know land which was thoroughly drained&mdash;some of my own land was drained in my grandfather's time&mdash; and which never grew a rush within anybody's memory until recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it is proposed to grow rushes under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody but a lunatic would attempt to grow wheat where rushes grow.  The increased tillage during the war, followed by a <Col N="437" /> succession of wet years, is put forward as one cause of it.  It is well known that tillage increases the growth of rushes.  If you have a field where you can get very good grazing and if you use certain fertilisers of the lime variety&mdash;there may be a few rushes here and there&mdash;you will get very good grazing.  Till that field and put it into pasture after the third year and for every bunch of rushes you had before, you will have twenty now.  That will go on increasing year after year and if you go on tilling that field you will have a waste and a swamp.  Many other things besides rain have an effect on climate.  Great masses of trees attract rain and, at the same time, they absorb the moisture of the air and of the bogs.</P>
      <P>I have the figures here of the acreage under woods in Ireland.  It is very much less in the Free State than it was half a century ago.  It is 40,000 acres less now.  I do not know whether that has very much to do with the climate or not.  It may have a little.  We have heard that a lot of wheat was grown in 1847.  Is it possible that the Government want to go back, is it possible that the Labour Party want to go back to the awful conditions of 1847? I do not mean in connection with the famine only but to go back to the general conditions under which the people then lived.  At that time the people lived on potatoes and buttermilk.  I have seen in my own time people eating barley bread.  The worst sort of bread was a real luxury to them then.  The taste of the people has since then changed.  It is the working people now who buy shop bread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man who grows a little patch of wheat for his own use is the small farmer.  I know hundreds of them who grow little patches of wheat.  They bring it in small quantities to the mill where they get it ground into flour. If you have large quantities of wheat you will find that after it has been kiln-dried it will re-absorb the moisture and become mouldy.  I foolishly tried getting wheat ground into flour but it was not a success.  I know that people use wheaten flour but as a rule in very many cases they mix it with the <Col N="438" /> good flour made from foreign wheat. This lightens it and makes it less heavy.  The wheat that I made into flour was very bad stuff indeed.  It was a dark heavy glutinous substance which we found impossible to make into good bread.  We tried it with yeast, buttermilk and other things. In the end we had to use it for feeding calves.  The flour got mouldy and lumpy.  I might mention that this was of course kiln-dried wheat.</P>
    <P>With regard to the wheat which was grown in 1847 it is well to know that this was only grown in certain parts of the country and not over the whole of the country.  There were large areas in the country in which wheat was never grown.  The vast amount of the wheat was grown in a few areas.  I think it was the Minister for Agriculture who mentioned in the Dáil debate that we had not had a heavy frost for a long time.  Now a heavy frost is one of the most valuable assets to the tillage farmer because it puts the land into good condition for tillage.  In this country we have not had a heavy frost for thirty years and we have had very many wet years.</P>
    <P>As to the employment provided by the growing of wheat I should say that no practical farmer believes it will increase employment.  It is really the mixed system of farming which increases employment.  The growing of beet now is quite a different thing from the growing of wheat.  I was amazed at hearing the Minister say &ldquo;Why not pay a subsidy on wheat as well as on beet?&rdquo;  I wonder somebody did not advise the Minister before he made that statement.  The Minister ought to know that sugar beet gives more employment than any other crop. From the time it is put into the ground until the beet is loaded on to the railways it has to get constant care.  I have grown beet every year since the factory was established at Carlow except last year when there was a dispute with the Sugar Beet Company. There is no crop gives more labour than beet.  The crop has to be weeded three or four times and it has to be given much more care than mangolds. The clay has to be kept around the beet all the time.  If beet were treated in the same way as mangolds it would <Col N="439" /> die.  However, from the very start beet was an assured success as a paying crop and everybody knew that.</P>

      <P>What I mean is that in general the experiments with regard to beet had been successful, and from our knowledge of green crops like mangolds and turnips, which are closely allied with beet, we knew it was going to be a success.  We always had heavier crops of mangolds than were grown in England.  There was a certain amount of risk of course. That was mainly in the difficulty of getting people to grow a new crop but there is no risk now in the matter of beet.  Wherever tried it is a success and of the greatest benefit to the people.  There is only one thing to be regretted and that is that beet is only grown in ten counties while the rest of the State has to pay the subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance came into this House and mentioned that sugar beet was one of the four white elephants which the late Government had placed on the country.  The Minister mentioned that one of the greatest of the white elephants that had been imposed on any country was the Carlow Beet Factory.  Now I want to say that the Carlow Factory is one of the bright spots in the agricultural life in this country to-day. Only for it many of our farmers would be very badly off indeed.  That is the case in my own county for instance. There is just a little story I heard lately and I cannot refrain from telling it.  A short time ago the incident happened.  A man was sowing a bit of wheat in a part of his field.  A stranger came over the fence and discussed wheat-growing with this farmer and he said to him, &ldquo;The only mistake you are making is that you do not sow this whole field and your whole farm in wheat.&rdquo;  The farmer said &ldquo;I do not know who you are or what your business is, but you know very little about wheat when you speak foolishly like that.&rdquo;  It happened that the stranger was the County Agricultural Instructor.  That man I must say knows his business well but he is <Col N="440" /> carrying out his orders from the Minister in recommending the people to grow wheat wholesale.  Who is going to be the scapegoat if that farmer did not know his business and if he was foolish enough to sow that big field in wheat?  Who is going to be the scapegoat when the farmers find a lot of musty wheat on their hands?</P>
    <P>There is only one good feature about the wheat scheme and that is that it is left to the farmer to act voluntarily in this matter.  Nobody is going to make a fool of the farmer unless he wants to do so himself.  But it is different with the maize mixture.  The farmer has to take that maize mixture. He will have to pay more for the mixture than for the barley.  If the mixture were to be entirely of oats it would not be half so objectionable in my county.  I come from the county where more than half of the barley produced in the Free State is grown. In the County of Wexford we grow a great deal of barley.  Barley has about the same feeding value as maize but its results are very different from maize.  I speak of its food value to farm animals.  Barley is an indigestible food and it is unfit for young animals. Barley is usually fed to grown animals, bullocks and stall fed cattle whereas you can use maize with great success for everything from the smallest chicken to the biggest animal on the farm.</P>
    <P>I do not know of anything more valuable to the farmer than flaked maize.  It was a veterinary surgeon first recommended that food to me for horses and it is a most valuable food. For the future we cannot buy maize unless it is mixed with barley which makes it an unfit food for a great many animals on the farm.  Already every good farmer mixes his home-grown grain with the maize but he does not give the same kind of mixture to every animal.  Now all animals on the farm must get the same mixture and take it or leave it.  As a result of the mixing the price is at least one shilling a cwt. higher than the price of the pure maize.  Of course large farmers have given up the custom of boiling Indian meal.  People at one <Col N="441" /> time used to think that the animals could not do as well on the food in its raw state.  Of course it is as good in its raw state and farmers who use a great deal of it did not cook it on account of the additional expense. Still the small farmer who loses less of it is accustomed to boiling the maize.  Possibly it is more palatable for the animal in its cooked state. But nobody would cook oats or barley. They are fed in the raw state.  Now you have a mixture one part of which is better in the cooked state and the other better in the raw state.  The whole thing is a muddle from end to end and it is going to cause great hardship to people.  The result is that people are not feeding at all and people who used to feed are giving it up.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that people were getting very cheap food this year. I can tell him that they will get very little of it next year.  At present the stuff is on the people's hands and they have to throw it away for any price they can get for it but they will not feed next year.  At the time this mixture was introduced I could buy whole maize, grind it at a little mill in the neighbourhood and have it home at £6 per ton.  I was in the habit of getting some of it crushed for horse feeding and some of it made into fine meal.  Last year the meal had to be mixed with the oats that we had grown because the oats was of such a bad quality that the horses could not live on it.  Now everything is upset.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the policy of the Department of Agriculture is to increase employment by tillage.  That policy is absolutely foolish.  The growth of wheat will not increase employment.  One man with a pair of horses can plough a considerable quantity of land and when he has the wheat sown he can lock the gate and need not go near the field until the following September.  It is the mixed system of tillage where cattle, horses, sheep and pigs are raised that gives the extra employment.  It seems to me that this policy of grain growing is dictated by a small group of fantastic theorists, people generally know who they are, where they exist, and where their ideas are being fostered.  But <Col N="442" /> the practical farmers of the country on the whole know that this is a vast wanton proceeding like a great deal of the rest of the Fianna Fáil legislation&mdash;meddling in business. The farmer knows the possibilities as to what is best to be done by practical experience of what he has learned in recent years.  I prophesy that this scheme will be as great a success as the heifer scheme has been and that is the worst that could be said of it.</P>

      <P>I will not now.  I will give it you another time.  That was said in beautiful Gaelic 200 years ago by a poet about wheat, barley, oats and rye grown in Ireland. I am in favour of this scheme but I may say that my support is what, to use another language, I might call <i>sub modo.</i>  We will give it a chance.  I think the Minister is right in concentrating on wheat.  I will tell you why. Senator Miss Browne knows well that you have to put down winter wheat in October if you expect a crop.  You can wait until March and put down spring wheat, but as the Senator very properly said you will have a lot of weeds.  You will have to weed the land but that is good for you and it is good for the land.  After the weeding you can have the other crops in regular rotation.  Wheat is the pivot of Irish agriculture and that is the reason why I give the Minister my full support, purely temporarily and <i>sub modo.</i> Senator Miss Browne said that barley was indigestible.  Take the culms off the barley and it is all right.  Cut it well and it is all right.  The Senator said that beet could not be thinned like mangolds because if one beet was pulled another one was loosened and would not grow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation.  I am being misrepresented. I said it took a great deal more care to thin beet than mangolds. You cannot go along fast.  It takes twice as many people to thin an acre of beet as to thin mangolds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that in the thinning of beet you must be careful, but my advice is that when you pull one beet you should put your thumb or your finger on the other beet that you want to stay where it is.  I am afraid I am giving professional advice. That was the system I learned long ago when I was a farmer.  The arguments put forward by Senator Miss Browne are capable of being <Col N="444" /> answered.  I think tillage is absolutely necessary for this country in the circumstances in which it is placed. We want more employment.  The best way to get employment, and the best source of employment, is tillage and the soil of Ireland.  Whatever method is proposed with that object will have my full approval.  The proposals in the Bill have been carefully thought out by the Minister and have my approval at the present time.  The Bill may have its defects, and may have limitations, as what may be suitable for one area may not be suitable for another area, but I think on the whole the proposals are sound and are promoted by the patriotic desire to get employment and be remunerative to the people, remunerative to the farmers and of advantage to the entire country.  I think that is the impulse, and that being so&mdash; although I could be critical&mdash;I am inclined to give the Bill my full support and encouragement.  I think the Minister will succeed.  I hope he will succeed.</P>

If there is, as we hope, good wheat, it can be &ldquo;raised&rdquo; with barm.  Let an additional piece of yeast be put in and, as Senator O'Hanlon says, if it can be properly raised the Minister's proposals will be the success that I I hope they will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered this matter with much sympathy, because it is a well-meant effort to relieve our unemployed population by means which are calculated, rightly or wrongly, to be remunerative to the State.  Much of the opposition to the Bill has been sketchy and uninformed, and the support accorded to the measure has been&mdash;if possible&mdash;of less advantage to the Minister's ideas.  At the outset I agree that if 50,000 men are employed to carry out the various processes connected with the growing of wheat, they will grow 1,500,000 acres in 300 <Col N="445" /> working days and will earn £3,000,000 in wages.  The figure does not take machinery into account and is on the high side.  As it is, however, it suffices for the purpose of argument.  As to the estimated saving of £9,500,000 I see from the Statistical Abstract that our imports of wheat and wheat products of every kind total just on £5,500,000, and even if you add 10 per cent. as being deducted from the maize imports, the saving still appears to be under £6,000,000.  Allowing, among a host of other incidental items, for the loss of labour at the ports, and the port dues which would be consequent on this policy, and adding to that the capital exported for the purpose of purchasing new milling machinery, the interest on which will be a first charge on the industry, then the saving would appear to become smaller still, and I do not think that the House should accept the figure given without some detailed explanation.</P>
      <P>There is also an important point in connection with the figure given as to potential employment.  I am prepared to agree that the operations in connection with setting one statute acre of corn, and thereafter handling it into the stack without reaping machinery, would occupy one man for ten working days or rather for two periods of four days and six days. This is the result of practical experience on which the Minister lays stress. In view, however, of the general impression which has been created both in the Oireachtas and on public platforms&mdash;and which has not been corrected&mdash;that 50,000 men will get constant employment, it should be made clear that the ultimate scheme would employ 750,000 for two periods of four days and six days in each year, and that without the work afforded by our participation in the trade created by the British live stock market, these workers would have to stand idle for the remaining 290 days of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to believe that some of the public statements of some prominent members of the Government&mdash;and the Minister's own statement in the Dáil &mdash;are responsible utterances, those 750,000 are going to be maintained <Col N="446" /> during the 290 days of idleness at a cost of 1/- a day for each person or £37,500, making the total cost over that period £10,875,000.</P>
    <P>The figures appear extremely fantastic but that is really what the scheme without the British market means.  It is extremely regrettable that the possibility of success of what is a big conception should have been prejudiced at the outset by the Government's ill-considered policy in other directions.  Unlike another critic of the Bill I do not want to see it tried out in its present form at the expense of the country.  I would prefer to see it improved so as to make it of real advantage when it comes to be operated.  I am not so much concerned with this aspect of the Bill as I am with Part V and I will only deal with that question shortly.  Provided there is proper inspection, at an economic cost, I see no objection to admixture.  In fact I think that the percentage of home-grown cereals could be increased to 25 per cent. without any disadvantage.  But I do object to any regulation which increases the cost of living and the cost of the raw material to the producer, at a time when prices are at bed rock and world competition was never more intense.  A short time ago in my own district I was able to buy 20 stone of fine meal for 17/6, but now I pay 19/- for the admixture or a tax of 12 per cent.  If I buy fine meal for household use, I pay at the rate of 23/- for 20 stone or a tax of 33 per cent., which is a colossal increase. On the whole of our imported maize we are paying a tax of 12 per cent. or some £444,000 and on a portion of it we are paying a great deal more. Is that reasonable?  I am not aware that the figures have been presented in this way before, and I submit that they show very clearly what the housewife and the producer are paying as a result of the Government's policy in this matter.</P>
    <P>As to Part V of the Bill, I can speak as one of those whom the Minister classes as the best type of farmer&mdash;in fact better than his best&mdash;because I not only feed my own grain to my stock but I mill it and feed it to my household <Col N="447" /> as well.  Strictly between ourselves I admit that there are occasional complaints as to the millable quality of the flour, but as I am in the happy position of being able to make my own regulations, without consulting the Minister for Industry and Commerce, they have to grin and bear it and eat it without effective remedy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy The McGillycuddy">
      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I admit generally the statistical aspect of the figures given in regard to climate and yield; but in all his utterances the Minister has been meticulously careful to avoid committing himself to any statement as to the quantity of millable corn which has been grown in past years.  The farmers' bounty under the scheme depends entirely on that factor.  For that reason I lay stress on the question of milliability.  Except in sheltered spots in the West, much of the wheat will be laid.  When it is cut and stacked, the laid portions will not be separated from the better corn and, in the result, the whole sample will be spoilt and the farmer will get no bounty.  As an example, I have used my binder only once in the last four years and some sixteen acres of corn have been cut with the scythe.  Wind in the West of Ireland is almost as much trouble as rain, and a neighbouring raingauge records 69 inches per annum over a period of 14 years and 212 days on which rain fell in each of these years. You cannot provide that all these days will be in the winter months.  Nor has the Minister spoken of the extremes and their effects.  As one instance. In the years 1872 and 1879 the yield fell by 29 per cent. below the normal.  If that was to happen next year there would be more disappointment than millable wheat.  It is not the bumper years which matter; and with the rapid and constant changes in world economics which modern civilisation produces, recovery from a bad year is a difficult matter.  Again, the mention of '47 struck me as being somewhat ominous and the statement by a Minister in the other House, that <Col N="448" /> the failure of the wheat crop in Canada left 35,000 families in one province alone to be supported by the State, does not encourage the adoption of a policy which puts all our eggs into the one basket.</P>
      <P>The Minister has quoted an average figure of 16 cwt. and no doubt he will say, and many will agree with him, what better figure than an average could I take.  But any set of similar figures can be averaged and there is the very greatest danger of misleading ourselves unless averages are very carefully handled.  The average of one and ninety-nine is fifty, but it is easy to see that a very wrong conclusion could be drawn from the use of an average of two elements differing so widely.  An opposite instance of this is provided by the large scale wheat experiments of the year '26-'27.  In this year 259 plots were sown, but for various reasons only 176 were eventually weighed.  The best material was provided and supervision was exercised by skilled agriculturists. The best result was 42 cwt. and the worst, which, as will be seen, was by no means an isolated instance, was Zero. But the average of these two figures is 21 cwt.  Out of the 176 plots of approximately two acres there were 29 complete failures, which means that, if these experiments are of any value as a guide to wheat growing, 16 farmers out of every 100 who grow wheat, with every possible care and the benefit of experience, will fail to get any produce whatsoever.  Is it wise to propose a scheme of this kind to this country without more examination?</P>
      <P>The acreage on which these experiments were carried out amounted to 1/179th or 1.2 per cent. of the total wheat acreage; if we apply the figure of 16 per cent. to the acreage we find that 58 acres out of 358 were unproductive and presumably 4,560 acres of the total wheat area in the country gave no return either.  We have only to carry the argument a little further to find that 240,000 of the additional 1½ millions must be unfruitful. Although the estimate the Minister has made of 16 cwt. is to my mind conservative, it is going to be obtained at the expense of a large number of casualties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" /> So far I have dealt mainly with the figures given in explanation of the Bill; the remainder of my argument deals more directly with the difficulties inherent in the measure as it comes before us.  The three types of farmers have each of them a different position in relation to the working of the proposal.  The tillage farmer can turn over from one cereal to another and can generally increase to the extent of the housing he has for the extra stock he will require&mdash;he has the implements and he has the experience. The mixed farmer is such both from wisdom and from necessity; his land generally varies and he knows that there are only portions of it which can be profitably tilled.  He has the experience but he will find himself short of housing and even if he has the land he will find it difficult to increase tillage at a reasonable cost. The grass farmer has no implements and little housing.  He has no capital to start with or cash to wait with and no experience.  In the first two cases, therefore, most of the wheat area will be substitution and in the last case results will be long delayed.  I think substitution will do little more than to absorb those who would otherwise be thrown out of employment in the coming spring, but normally it would have forced up the price of other cereals in proportion to the amount of wheat substituted and so provide a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the man who could not grow wheat.  But if the Government's isolation policy is pursued the position will be that only sufficient livestock to maintain 3,000,000 people will be produced.  Add another million of people in which case you would require another 66,000 tons of beef which is only one quarter of the fat bullocks alone, to give every man, <Col N="450" /> woman and child half a pound of beef throughout the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  When you really get your oats and barley they will become a glut upon the markets and gradually will cease to be ground.  I see, therefore, nothing but a loss to the man who cannot grow millable wheat.  I am doubtful as to whether the House fully realises how this bounty is going to operate.  There are five counties which have a rateable value per acre of under 10/- and of these three are as low as 5/-; the remaining counties run from 10/- up to 22/-.  I admit that if a revaluation was to be made, much unprofitable land would be put on a higher basis than Griffiths thought it worth, but nevertheless he gave us a pretty general idea of where the wheat land lies.  Reasonable confirmation of this is provided by the Statistical Abstract which states that in 1929 only 2,400 acres were grown in those five counties which cover an area of approximately five million acres against 26,000 which were set in the 11 million acres which comprise the remainder of the Saorstát.  It seems, therefore, fairly clear that nearly all of the bounty will go to the 1¼ million living on what I call the ploughable lands at the expense of nearly half a million souls who are existing on the spade areas, and the admitted injustice which accompanies the distribution of the agricultural grants will be intensified.</P>
