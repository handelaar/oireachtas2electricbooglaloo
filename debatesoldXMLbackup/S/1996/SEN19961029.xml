      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Sullivan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to ensure adequate funding for health boards to maintain and develop the home help service.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>That the Minister for Education provide the necessary funds for the construction of a new national school at Cloontuskert.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide a new classroom, toilet block and ancillary accommodation at Kilmurry national school, Ennis, County Clare, and if she is aware of the necessity of having the finance for this project included in the capital building programme.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Enright of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Government to introduce additional safety measures in relation to crowd control in view of the recent serious accidents at concerts and sporting events.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senators O'Sullivan's and Finneran's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Taylor-Quinn and Senator Enright may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The first item on today's Order of Business is Committee Stage and, I hope, Final Stages of the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1996. <Col N="78" /> Since that Bill does not have a number on the Order Paper I will discharge the order at the appropriate stage with the permission of the House.  The Bill will be taken until 4.15 p.m; there will be a sos from 4.15 p.m. until 4.30 p.m. when there will be the address by Commissioner Neil Kinnock until 6 p.m.  If the Health (Amendment) Bill has not been completed, it will recommence at 6 p.m. but I suspect it will be completed in the time allocated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>How long does the Leader expect the Commissioner to speak.  How will the question and answer session be dealt with?</P>
      <P>The Leader was asked by several Members last week and by me over the last number of weeks about the credit union Bill.  With 1.6 million members and 400 plus units, politicians on all sides are being lobbied at this stage.  The concern is that, if this Bill is not initiated before Christmas, it may not be dealt with before a general election.  When does the Leader expect it to be initiated so that we will have a chance to play our part in ensuring it is enacted before any election?</P>
      <P>I am sure the Commissioner may allude to the debate on Luas.  The former Taoiseach and Fine Gael Leader, Garret FitzGerald, has, in recent days had major articles published on the issue. He said it would be indefensible not to have a full debate on the tunnelling and on-street options.  I ask, as many Members of this House have done, that the Leader, irrespective of today's debate, offer us a chance, as he has in recent months, to debate the issue of Luas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two issues.  We had a good debate last week on the agriculture industry about which many different views were expressed.  That indicated the need for focus in that area.  I ask the Leader to consider taking that debate a stage further and not just have a broad and general debate as we did last week.</P>
      <P>There is a growing concern, not only in agriculture but also in industry and trade unions, that jobs associated with the agriculture industry are not being created.  I would like a debate on the associated industries of agriculture, such as wool &mdash; there is no wool processing plant in Ireland &mdash; developing farming to be labour intensive and to provide employment and adequate reward for people.  I would like a debate focusing on the jobs potential in the agriculture industry.  That would draw different views from people on both sides of the House.  It is significant that talks are beginning today on a possible successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  I hope this issue will be a key part of those talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have discussed crime and punishment, law and order and various aspects of the prison system at great length during recent months. People may have become aware over the weekend of the problems being experienced by schools and their inability to enforce discipline. <Col N="79" /> Schools, school authorities and teachers have been &ldquo;disabled&rdquo; when it comes to enforcing discipline.  There is a real need to examine the fact that the link between schools and society is unbreakable and the need for schools to be given the authority to impose discipline in a manner acceptable to society and which has the force and power of legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is envisaged in the Minister's views on an education Bill.  She could be informed by debate in this House on the importance of discipline at an early stage in schools which would have a carry over effect on society at large.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When is it proposed to have a debate on the fishing industry, including the ongoing EU ministerial negotiations?  When is it proposed to have a discussion on the Irish language?  Such a discussion should tie in with the conclusions of the Constitutional Review Group which recommends a change to Article 8 of the Constitution.  I do not agree with that.  We must have a mechanism for a discussion on that group's recommendations which include a proposal to abolish the Seanad.  That has serious implications for us.  The group's conclusions regarding Articles 18 and 19 were that a review group should be set up especially to deal with the Seanad.  The group said that, if such a review does not resolve the issue of representation and other substantive issues in a satisfactory manner, serious consideration will need to be given to the abolition of the Seanad and the transfer of its role and functions to another political system.  The Seanad should make its views known to the Constitutional Review Group now.  I commend the group for its review which is overdue but we have had very little input.  It should be brought out into the open with a full discussion on the implications that this review has for the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Leader will agree that a congratulatory message should be sent to the Garda Síochána for its excellent work at the weekend in discovering a large quantity of arms in Donegal.  This highlights once again the nature of some republican organisations in this country who are stockpiling weapons and using them in training camps.  The incident in Donegal emphasises that.  Does the Leader agree that the seizure by the Garda Síochána of such illegal weaponry sends an important signal, particularly to some elements of the loyalist community who have questioned the determination of this State to deal effectively with such acts of terrorism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's call for a further debate on Luas.  This matter has been raised a number of times and in the last week or two the Leader indicated that he would be prepared to provide time.  This is important for <Col N="80" /> the reasons Senator Wright adumbrated.  People are increasingly concerned that the Minister is deliberately or unintentionally appearing to subvert the public inquiry that is to be held by indicating that the matter has already been decided with the underground option being ruled out in defiance of all the evidence that has been mounted, including the debate in this House.</P>
      <P>On an earlier occasion I voiced concern and sought a debate on the fact that the Department of Justice appears to be on the point of opening a centre for young offenders in the old Kennedy's bakery in Parnell Street.  I have had correspondence with the Minister about this and it was supposed to be for 12 young female offenders.  However, I understand from another public representative for the area, Deputy Ahern, who has had contact on this subject also, that the response being given now is that there will be some kind of centre for the rehabilitation of general offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Senator can find a more appropriate way of raising that matter than the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader convey the strong concern of people in the area?  I have just come from a meeting where local business people are outraged at the way in which their long term efforts to rehabilitate a difficult part of the city are threatened by this development.  If it is so socially beneficial why not have it in Foxrock or the Minster's back yard?  Why is everything problematic always dumped on the north side, while good institutions are ruthlessly and continuously stripped from the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When will we have an opportunity to debate the allocation of funding to the National Roads Authority?  I have raised this issue a number of times, as did the Leader when he was on this side of the House.  When I last raised it the Leader agreed on its importance and undertook to deal with it soon.  The north-west has been neglected by the authority.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the North-West Border Group which hopes to raise with Commissioner Kinnock the dangerous condition of the road from Dublin to the north.  Given that I will not have an opportunity to meet the Commissioner other than this afternoon, may I ask if he will consider providing funding to upgrade the road from Dublin to Strabane, Lifford, Derry and Donegal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Senator will have an opportunity to do so this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wish to do so with permission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole's remarks about the debate on agriculture last week.  It was positive and constructive, although a couple of items were addressed which it would have been better not to mention.  There should be a debate on agri-industry and its employment potential.</P>
      <P>Last Saturday on RTÉ the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, said that the Minister for Health is preparing legislation to allow for consumer representation on a body to be established by the Government.  I am sure this legislation will be supported by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In addition, farming and consumer organisations are very interested in the proposals.  Will the Leader arrange for a debate so that we can have an input into the legislation which may perhaps be initiated in this House?</P>
      <P>I have an Adjournment matter on the necessity for safety measures at concerts and sporting events.  In recent times there has been death and injury at such events, despite the implementation of safety improvements.  I am pleased that the Government has appointed the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Alien, to have responsibility for reviewing standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You have submitted this matter for the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of such importance that it should be debated in the House.  Perhaps the Leader will consider one because it may assist the Government in preparing legislation or regulations on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also asked for a debate on the National Roads Authority some time ago.  If Senator McGowan considers that the north-west is starved of resources he should try to get in and out of Waterford any morning.  There is unbelievable gridlock there.  The National Roads Authority refuses to meet the county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a meeting with them in County Limerick last Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must have an urgent debate on the national roads.  There is enormous spending at present on roads in the Dublin area. The policy seems to be to get people in and out of Dublin but to forget about them once they are in the country.  Unless something is done about it we will have a transportation system around Dublin but complete gridlock five or ten miles outside the city.  Those who travel to Cork, Donegal, Waterford or Kilkenny experience that now and something must be done about it.</P>
      <P>The Leader promised such a debate in the last session but it has not taken place.  Due to the lack of communication between&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing the matter today; the Senator has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="82" />
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the National Roads Authority and elected representatives, that debate should take place in this or the other House.</P>
      <P>We should also have a structured debate on financial institutions.  Because of the recent controversy about the take-over of the TSB and various people doing a runner in financial institutions, we should discuss the regulation of financial institutions.  That debate might centre on the nationalisation of financial institutions or it could be widened to encompass the regulation of their structures.</P>
      <P>It might not seem important in certain areas, but there are about one million refugees in the African lake area in Zaire, Rwanda and elsewhere.  During our Presidency of the EU it is imperative that we use all our influence at EU, African or UN level.  Everyone is running away from this problem at present.  At least 500,000 people are in danger of being killed in the next few days or weeks.  We cannot run away from this.  If we address nothing else during our EU Presidency we should address the question of refugees.  Let us do something about it by starting the debate here and addressing the matter positively.  It is easy for us to say the problem is an African one but the problems of Africa will affect Europe unless we address them soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of concern among consumers about the standard of food being sold in shops and other outlets.  Will the Leader find out what progress, if any, is being made in the dispute between the Minister for Health and the environmental health officers? The dispute has been going on since the beginning of the year and should be urgently resolved so that we can make some progress on the surveillance of food in such establishments rather than relying on the Consumers' Association to do it for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader convey to the appropriate Minister the unease felt in the North of Ireland at present at the growing evidence that the IRA intends to carry out some sort of strike imminently?  I wish to be associated with Senator Hayes' congratulations to the Garda Síochána on its splendid work in Donegal.  It may be that it is part of an intended strike but the evidence is clear that the IRA is carrying out dry runs through loyalist areas in addition to the ever present risk of the destruction of commercial property.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Mr. John Hume promise that Sinn Féin will be brought speedily into talks following a ceasefire, but surely this does not include a ceasefire following an atrocity.  Will the Leader ask the Tánaiste to take this point into account? I seek assurance that an atrocity carried out in the North of Ireland by the IRA or others would be regarded in this jurisdiction in the same way as an atrocity carried out here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to reassure my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, about the role and status of the Seanad in relation to the examination being conducted by the all-party review committee.  The committee has accepted my proposal that Senators should be written to and asked to submit their views on the role and function of the House and how it can be enhanced if possible.</P>
      <P>Another matter I wish to raise has grave implications for the House.  Last week, during the debate on the meat industry, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry stated that he was glad to have an opportunity to discuss the recent events in the Russian market.  He went on to say: &ldquo;I am happy to tell the full story which Senator O'Kennedy requested&rdquo;.  Senators want the House to be respected but the Minister deliberately withheld the full story from the House which he said he would be glad to tell at my request.  This is a serious and deliberate deception.</P>

      <P>I do not want the Senator to deal with last week's business.  Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a question.  In that debate the Minister said in response to a point made by Senator Kiely that: &ldquo;The Senator seems disappointed that there is not another scare going through the heart of Munster.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <P>It appears that some Members had it.  I do not want the Senator to go back over last week's business.  Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Members must attach importance to the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas and there is a need for honest, credible answers.  The House should not be used to libel a Member.  If the Minister's statement had been made outside the House, Senator Rory Kiely, who was elected on the Agricultural Panel, would have been libelled.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ensure that the Minister who used privilege to deceive the House and to make a statement which would otherwise have libelled a Member returns to the House, apologises and withdraws his statement <Col N="84" /> and clears up the deception?  If not, the House and its status will be demeaned.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on agri-business which perhaps could include how farmers could be encouraged to return to traditional or organic farming.  This is the only way people may be reassured that they are getting good, fresh and properly produced food.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, to come to the House and explain why Teilifís na Gaeilge will get its weather forecasts from a foreign source and bypass Met Éireann in Dublin?</P>

      <P>In case Senator McAughtry's remarks when he asked that this House would condemn with equal emphasis an atrocity <Col N="85" /> committed down here or in Northern Ireland are misinterpreted, let me assure him that politicians on all sides of this House have never differentiated between a bomb in London, Belfast or Dublin.  I assure him that whether it is a Pakistani shopkeeper or a loyalist on the Shankill Road, this House will always utterly condemn, without equivocation, any such atrocity committed by anybody of any political persuasion.</P>

I understand that in the Western Health Board area no funds have been provided for three months for any extra applications.  That cannot be allowed to continue.  I ask the Leader of the House to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Health.  It should be dealt with urgently and I hope it will get a positive response.</P>

I also ask him to consider soon, although not immediately, a White Paper published today on science, technology and innovation.  It is very worthwhile and we should find time to consider it.</P>
      <P>I tried to find RTÉ's annual report for 1995 only to be told that while the board of RTÉ handed it to the Department in April this year, it has still not been published.  If we are to set an example as far as speed and urgency is concerned, we should not allow any Department to sit on a report.  I have tried to have included in every Bill coming through this House in the last couple of years a date for publication of the annual report of any State body.  When RTÉ was set up, no time limit was set for the date of publication of the annual report but it now seems to be necessary. The board of RTÉ is not at fault, the Minister is at fault for not having published this annual report yet.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise two matters with the Leader.  The first concerns refugee legislation which was mentioned by Senator Lanigan.  The Leader will be aware that this House passed all Stages of the Refugee Bill, 1996, just as we rose for the summer recess and the Minister indicated to us then the Bill was urgent.  As I understand it, the Refugee Bill has been signed by the President but has not yet been brought into force.  Could the Leader explain why that is so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter relates to riots and dangerous activities at concerts and other large events which was also raised by other Senators.  I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, has been given responsibility to draw up a voluntary code of practice but anyone reading the <i>Evening Herald</i> on Saturday, 26 October will have been shocked by a description of the concert the previous night at the Point Depot when, <Col N="86" /> according to that newspaper, even the gardaí present were shocked at the violence.  I ask the Leader for an urgent debate on this subject.  Is it not time to consider a statutory legal framework for these concerts?  There will be more deaths&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is there any truth in the rumour that this is a personal vendetta against the Goodman group by the Minister?  I do not say this lightly but the Minister is on record in the Dáil as stating he would shed no tears if Mr. Goodman left the beef industry.

It appears almost 500,000 people will die there shortly unless action is taken.  There appears to be no urgency at UN or EU level to <Col N="87" /> deal with this disaster &mdash; and I speak as someone who dealt with overseas aid in Africa for some years.  The situation is very dangerous and likely to spread throughout Africa.  It demands more action than we are seeing from the UN refugee agency or the EU.  I ask the Tánaiste to indicate how the EU propose to play their part in dealing with the disaster which is likely to happen there in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader draw the attention of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to the proposed closure of the freight line from Ennis to Claremorris?

      <P>The most important matter mentioned on the Order of Business was that raised by Senators Lanigan and Daly on the impending famine and slaughter in Africa.  All Members want minds to be focused on drawing attention to that and I will try to have an early debate on that disaster.  We may not be able to do very much but at least we can focus attention and greater urgency from the EU on the matter. I thank the Senators for raising the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright asked about the format of the address by the Commissioner this afternoon.  If we know in advance how many Senators intend to ask questions we could have either individual questions or questions grouped in order, if they relate to each other.  The Commissioner intends to speak for 40 minutes but brevity was never his outstanding quality so he may speak for longer.  I suspect his speech will take between 45 minutes and an hour and there will be questions for about 30 minutes afterwards.</P>
      <P>The credit union Bill was raised by Senator Wright.  It is a matter of urgency to which the Government has given priority.  My understanding is that a number of new sections, which are warmly welcomed by the credit union movement, arrived late for inclusion.  It is intented to publish the Bill before Christmas but, one way or the other, it will be given priority on the legislative programme either before or after Christmas.  All Members who have been approached in recent times by representatives of the credit union movement about this matter can give them that assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Wright also sought a debate on Luas. I would be happy to have such a debate and I will try to organise it in the next couple of weeks. Senator O'Toole and Senator Enright asked for <Col N="88" /> a debate on job potential in agriculture.  Other Senators, including Senator Henry, raised the equally important question of food safety standards which are of concern to everybody at present, particularly in view of the report over the weekend on the level of antibiotics in pork.  There is a need for a debate on all aspects of agriculture, whether it be guarantees of food purity or potential employment.  I will discuss the structure of such a debate with colleagues.</P>
    <P>I do not have information for Senator Fitzgerald regarding the debate on fishing.  I did not contact the Minister over the weekend but I will endeavour to do so shortly.  I will try to organise a short debate on the Irish language next week to coincide with the inauguration of Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Senator Fitzgerald and Senator O'Kennedy, whom I thank for his help on the matter, raised the Constitution and the references in it to the future of the Seanad.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges agreed last week that the House would debate in the near future how Members see the future role of the House.  It is important that the debate is taken seriously and that Members are positive and critical in their contributions.  I will consult the leaders of the other groups about the structure of the debate and it will take place soon.</P>
    <P>I join Senator Hayes in his congratulations to the Garda on their important find in Donegal last night.  It puts a huge question mark, if such were necessary, over the <i>bona fides</i> of the IRA and the future intentions of that organisation with regard to peace when hideous weapons of murder are found primed and ready to be used.  Senator Magner answered the point made by Senator McAughtry when he said an atrocity is an atrocity no matter where it happens and all atrocities will be met with equal condemnation.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the matter of young offenders.  I do not have information on that matter.  With regard to Senator McGowan's question, I will try to organise a debate on the National Roads Authority although I cannot say when.  I also do not have control over what questions he will ask Commissioner Kinnock. Senator Enright referred to food safety standards and I agree with his sentiments.  I also agree it is urgent to hold a debate on safety standards.  I have dealt with the questions asked by Senator Lanigan.  Senator Henry referred to the ongoing dispute with environmental health officers.  The Minister for Health will be in the House shortly so perhaps the Senator might raise her question with him then and get a direct answer.</P>
    <P>I remind Senator O'Kennedy that there was a full debate on the beef industry last week.  Hard things were said, as were said on all sides in both Houses over the past week.  The matter was raised in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and a certain course of action has been proposed which will be taken.  I do not accept that the Minister deceived the House last week.</P>

      <P>On section 2, the Minister said on Second Stage that voluntary hospitals and mental handicap agencies will be funded by the health boards rather than the Department.  I refer specifically to the question of public voluntary hospitals.  We know that for years there has been a failure to have a common selection procedure. How does the Minister propose to bring this about under section 2?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I will reply to Senator Finneran on the issue of co-operation between the local authorities and the health boards.  He also referred to health boards providing accurate information when asked.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Local Government Act empowers local authorities to represent the interests of local communities in such manner as they think appropriate, and to ascertain and communicate to other public bodies, including the health boards, the views of the local community in relation to functions of those authorities.  Section 2 of this Bill imposes a statutory obligation on the health boards to co-operate with local interests and, in particular, to co-operate with local authorities and co-ordinate their activities with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> It seems that the local authorities acting under section 5 of the Local Government Act and the health boards acting under this Bill will be placed in a position where they will have little choice but to formalise their relationship because, once the statutory obligation is put on the health board to co-operate, it must find some mechanism for formalising that obligation.  It seems we could easily move back to what Senator Sherlock requested on Second Stage, that is, the reestablishment of a committee which would be the vehicle for the local authority to fulfil its statutory obligations under section 5 of the Local Government Act and the vehicle for the health board to fulfil its statutory obligations under section 2 of the Bill.  I do not want to get involved in dictating the detail but it seems very likely that this obligation will need to be delivered by the health boards in a structured way and that an informal liaison arrangement would need to be formalised because, as the Senator mentioned, the present informal liaison arrangement does not always work.</P>
    <P>In terms of providing information, a majority of health board members are local authority members and we are all familiar with the manner of the appointment of health board members and the different constituencies.  I have no plan in changing the Eastern Health Board, for example, to diminish that majority position of the locally elected members.  When a locally elected member puts down the question under the standing orders of the individual health board, there is a legal obligation on the chief executive officer to provide accurate information.  There is an interest wider than simply the membership of the board and it runs back into the wider local authority, which is the level of government closest to the people.</P>
    <P>The combination of the two sections to which I refer under the Act and the Bill will make it very difficult for a health board not to have some form of arrangement.  I would advise Senators to take up the matter locally either through the health board or the local authority once this Bill passes through the House because this is quite a strong section.</P>
    <P>On Senator Sherlock's question about voluntary organisations and the new relationship, the present position is that when it comes to funding health services the health boards are given block grants which they carve up and subdivide into the different areas of their activity, including the acute hospitals under their remit. However, the voluntary organisations for physical or mental handicap, for example, and the big voluntary hospitals are not funded through the health boards but directly from the Department of Health.  Outside Dublin and Cork, that comes down to arrangements being made with the Sisters of Charity, the Daughters of Charity. various voluntary groups, section 65 loans, etc., with which Senators will be familiar from their work on health boards.  When it comes to Dublin, <Col N="92" /> the Mater Misericordiae, St. Vincent's Hospital, St. James's Hospital, and all the big hospitals not funded from the Eastern Health Board, they are funded vertically from the Department of Health with which they must negotiate.</P>
    <P>The policy enunciated by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Howlin &mdash; and this is also my policy &mdash; is the health strategy which states that we will change the funding arrangements so that everybody will be funded through the local devolved authority.  In most cases, that will be the health boards as they exist at present, although I have made a commitment to change the structures in respect of the Eastern Health Board and I will do so.</P>
    <P>That is the big change.  Many voluntary organisations which had a good relationship traditionally with the Department of Health asked if they will be disadvantaged.  Relationships have been built up over the years with hospitals run by health boards.  Hospitals, such as St. John's in Limerick, Portinuncla, the Bons Secours in Cork or the other large hospitals in Dublin, could say it will take time to build those relationships and that they need some protection.  I accepted amendments in the Dáil to ensure the voluntary organisations had statutory rights under this section.</P>
    <P>When I amend the legislation governing health boards, part of it will be to ensure the voluntary sector is represented on the boards as another constituent part in the way other groups are represented.  That is a major change which will take time to implement.  There is no such thing as a Minister saying we will do all this on 1 January.</P>
    <P>At present, in respect of the organisations for mental and physical handicap in the Mid-Western Health Board and the Midland Health Board areas, pilot projects have been developed to see if we can change the funding arrangement in 1997 but they have not been finalised yet.  We started to look at Portinuncla Hospital and St. John's in Limerick as being the first in which we could negotiate a position where they would be funded by the health boards rather than by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The objective is that the vertical relationship which exists would end over a period and that there would be lateral relationships with the health boards.  It is easy to do this in health boards other than those in the east.  The problem in the east is that there are huge voluntary hospitals in Dublin and we will have to handle this carefully to ensure every one is brought along with the change.  That will result in the Department of Health being responsible for policy and it will have more time to dedicate to it.  It will also be responsible for measuring the outcomes of the different hospitals to see if the taxpayer is getting value for money.</P>
    <P>At present there are 66,000 people working in the health service while the number of staff in the Department of Health is approximately 320. Much of the time they are managing crisis situations.  If there is a bout of flu in winter, all <Col N="93" /> hands are on deck to sort it out.  Insufficient time and resources are given to policy formation, another area which is vital is the measurement of outcomes.  We can say a hospital is good but we do not have a way of measuring one institution against another.  It frequently comes down to the quality of the bedside manner which might not necessarily be a valid measurement of how the hospital is performing.</P>
    <P>I would like the Department to have the resources, time and focus to continue to develop policy based on the measurement of what is happening, particularly the measurement of outputs.  We must recognise what the voluntary sector has done over the years.  Fortunately it will continue to exercise a valid role.  It is simply the funding relationship which is being changed and the voluntary sector has asked for the statutory provisions we have happily included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister said in that the relationship between the public and voluntary hospitals and the health board hospitals will be closer as a result of pilot projects. I was a member of the Southern Health Board for years where public and voluntary hospitals were funded directly by the Department of Health. Nobody had the authority to ask how that funding was expended and at the same time, the health board could have been broke.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Government policy is that the voluntary and the statutory sector will be funded through the health boards, but it will take time before we can establish the necessary relationships.  Because of the long tradition of the voluntary sector being funded directly by the Department of Health they have understandable concerns.  One of those concerns is that there will be a statutory obligation on the health boards to consult with the voluntary sector.  However, I do not believe that will be enough on its own.  There are a number of representatives on health boards and we will have to give representation to the voluntary sector, which will include the large hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I raise the question of openness and the availability of information is that a practice has crept in where there is one spokesperson for a health board who, in most cases, is the chief executive officer.  I am not sure that is the way it should operate.  I would prefer if the chairman of the board were the spokesperson.  There is also a requirement on board members and medical practitioners, including nurses, restraining them from commenting in a number of cases.  Although every chief executive officer does not implement this policy, it should be discouraged in all health boards.  Surely, a practitioner on the board should be in a position to speak from a professional view point?  A board member who is a member of a local authority should be entitled to speak at his local authority at a later stage.  This practice <Col N="94" /> should be discouraged.  It is not helpful and it gives the wrong signals.  The public is sceptical when such an approach is adopted.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The board should speak for the health board.  Sometimes that is the chief executive officer, the chairman or individual members in debate and when they reach conclusions, that is the policy of the board.  Those on the board or who represent interests, such as union leaders, should be free to speak.  However, these issues can be worked out.  There was a concern in some health boards that unlike in any other organisation people felt free to criticise in public the organisation for which they worked. While we cannot have that there must be an outlet for legitimate criticism.  Health boards are very democratic and all interests are represented.</P>

However, they found a loophole and got other bodies to acquire the buildings which they leased back.  Many local authorities have been getting a nice income from that, including my own.  It is wrong to spend large amounts of money leasing premises which could be used for other purposes.  If a health board needs extra space for administration or whatever, capital funding should be provided.  This would stop health boards using their budgets as is happening at present.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Finneran.  I raised this matter some years ago because this situation makes no sense.  In Cork city and in the northern division, where I could from, the health board leased premises.  However, premises could have been provided through capital investment which would have saved the health board money. The health board's leasing arrangements were too liberal in that it agreed to long leases which was a bad policy.  Capital expenditure should be introduced.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This situation is similar to that in local authorities where there are executive and reserve functions.  The executive functions are vested in the chief executive and the reserve functions are vested in the authority.  The main reserve functions are for members and include the adoption, supervision and amendment of service plans, the appointment and removal of the chief executive officer, the purchase and disposal of assets and the borrowing of money and decisions to discontinue the provision and maintenance of any premises.  It is <Col N="95" /> a reserve function of the board to decide what premises should be provided and maintained.  The elected members, rather than the chief executive, would have the primary function in the situations referred to by Senator Finneran and Senator Sherlock.</P>
      <P>Senators should also be aware of the provisions in section 18 when discussing section 3 because the Department will no longer be involved in the purchase and sale of land by the boards.  At present, if a health board decides to dispose of a building or land not required, like a local authority, it will be included on the agenda at the health board meeting and it will be nodded through as the last item because, although everyone believes it has been done properly, it still must be done in public as it relates to the disposal of an asset.  The legal section of the health board will then send it to the Department of Health which advises the Minister on whether it should be signed.  The Minister then signs off a health board asset worth £3,000 or £4,000.  That practice should be discontinued and the health board should make the decision in public.  As it would be a reserve function of the board, it would have to be included on the agenda.</P>
      <P>This situation arises when a house, which is no longer required for staff, is being disposed of near a hospital or tracts of land are being disposed of in a certain area.  As we make more progress in relation to the appropriate placement of persons with psychiatric illnesses, assets, usually large obsolete buildings with large tracts of development land, will become available to most health boards.  The health boards must decide how to dispose of that.  There is no point in a Minister for Health second guessing local members who are already carrying out the function.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the net expenditure of health boards which may cause difficulties in the future.  While this Bill gives health boards more authority in that there will be <Col N="96" /> less interference by the Department, the Minister is directly involved in their expenditure.  If he is not happy with a health board's plan, he can ask for it to be amended and if that does not happen, he can ask the chief executive officer to bring forward a new plan.  Everything will be fine while there is plenty of money available but in times of recession the Minister will ask for plans to be amended.  This could lead to conflict because members may not be willing to support a plan which is less than what is needed because the amount the Minister has provided is not sufficient.  A situation could develop where the Minister for Health and the chief executive officer would run the health boards any time there was a shortage of funds.  Since this matter arises in a number of sections, perhaps the Minister could clarify it.  Health board staff have told me that many health board members would find it difficult to tailor their plan to suit the amount of funds provided by the Minister.</P>

Perhaps he could clarify that.  At this time of year many people may need dental treatment, as is the case in the Cork health board area.  However, I understand there is a restriction on the amount of funding available.  If circumstances change and it is obvious to the health board and the Minister that the budget is not sufficient to meet requirements, is there a provision in the Bill to allow the Minister to make extra funds available?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Senators may be interested in the background.  The provision was deemed necessary because of the situation which had emerged from the period 1986-89 when there were general cutbacks in Government expenditure affecting the health budget.  When this was applied to health boards, instead of cutting back the service they ran overdrafts. Massive overdrafts were incurred by the health boards with no possibility of them being cleared; they totalled over £100 million by 1992-93.  They had existed since the days of cutbacks in the late 1980s. had accrued large amounts of interest and there were no visible means of dealing with them because, by and large, health boards do not have <Col N="97" /> other incomes.  They rely on a block grant from the Department of Health and no allocation was made to clear the overdrafts.</P>
      <P>It will be recalled that the second tax amnesty was successful in obtaining money which would not have been otherwise obtained.  In the spending of this money, the previous Administration decided that £100 million would be allocated to clear the health boards' overdrafts.  Part of the deal agreed at the time with the health boards was that accountability legislation would be enacted and that the possibility of running overdrafts as had happened in the late 1980s would be removed.</P>
      <P>The position is that the Minister will make a determination at the start of the year and indicate how much money is available to each health board rather than allocating it in a piecemeal fashion as has been done in the past.  The health board will be obliged to compile a service plan which provides the range of services the members of the board believe is necessary and matches it with the money available in the Minister's determination.  It will be similar to local authority estimates.</P>
      <P>There will always be rows about roads, water services and which sewerage schemes will be implemented.  However, either by vote or by agreement, the local authorities will eventually agree the budget and the range of services to be provided.  Until now health boards would know in general with a few specifics what the range of services would be, but there was always the feeling the Minister had more money and that a second allocation would be made in the middle of the summer and if all else failed, they could have an overdraft.  The Bill is about better accountability, better financial management and a clearer definition of reserve and executive functions of the board and the chief executive officer with miscellaneous tidying up provisions.</P>
      <P>What the Senator says is correct: there will be a determination from the Minister at the start of the year and a service plan will be drawn up in the knowledge of the determination.  When money is available this will not cause grief, but if the economy were not doing as well as it is and cutbacks were needed, debates on the service plans for health boards would be fraught.</P>
      <P>There is a provision in the section to cover points raised by Senators.  Subsection (2), for example, empowers the Minister to make a determination in respect of a period other than the financial year. This would allow the Minister to make a new determination of expenditure to be issued to health boards if a mid-year review of expenditure were deemed necessary by the Government.  It would also help for multi-annual budgeting.  If the need for extra funding arose, subsection (2) will allow the Minister to make a second determination in the financial year so that money can be allocated again among the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) empowers the Minister to amend the determination by varying the amount <Col N="98" /> of net expenditure the health board may incur in respect of a financial year.  That would allow additional funds to be made available, for example, to meet an agreed pay increase.  If a major pay claim was being negotiated and, at the time of the determination in January, a Minister was not sure how matters would turn out but would know by June, there would be a second determination or a variation on the first.  It would be unfair not to point out that subsection (3) also allows the Minister to reduce the determination if a major fiscal crisis occurred mid-year.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not think so because they will know their allocation and their service plans.  There is much scope within service plans to allocate money.  It could be argued in some health boards that more resources should be allocated to acute hospitals.  These are the issues which individual members of boards will raise.</P>
      <P>I wish to return to the reserve function and clarify a point made by Senator Finneran.  The particular reserve function in question is section 38 of the Health Act, 1970, which states:</P>
      <P>A health board may, with the consent of the Minister, provide and maintain any hospital, sanatorium, home, laboratory, clinic, health clinic, health centre or similar premises required for the provision of services under the Health Acts, 1947 to 1970.</P>
      <P>It is the opening and shutting of the business rather than the purchase or leasing of the property which is the issue of the reserve function.  It would be a reserve function of the health board to say that a hospital or home cannot be shut or opened without its agreement. That is where the emphasis is rather than on the provision of accommodation.</P>

      <P>I still require clarification and I will explain why.  During the period 1988-89, the far sighted officers and members of the health boards, and perhaps some people in the Department, wished to close smaller hospitals and made a good attempt at it; they obtained a decision from a general hospitals subcommittee of the board to that effect.  However, because they printed the minutes of that subcommittee, they were shown to be in breach of section 38 of the Health Act, 1970.  We were able to go to the High Court with a very good barrister and argue that what was being done was <i>ultra vires</i> the Health Act, 1970, and that saved the general hospital.  They had put into print what they proposed to do without reference to the Minister or to section 38 of the Act.</P>
      <P>I am concerned we are now disposing of the Minister's power and that the board could make a similar decision.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I raised the matter because purchasing and leasing were being discussed.  Section 18 of the Bill makes purchasing the function of the local authority, not the Minister.  In case I misled the Senator, I wish to clarify that the provisions of section 38 of the Act are a reserve function and it will be the elected members who will make the arrangements.  The essence of the reserve function to which I referred is not purchasing or leasing but that a service will continue to be provided from a particular location or premises.</P>
      <P>Under section 3 that is explicitly maintained and stated as a reserve function.  The Senator is right but I wanted to clarify it in case there was any doubt about the position.

      <P>I spoke about this on Second Stage.  There was terrible abuse in this area in the past because when health boards had extra money in December, in some cases many thousands of pounds, they went on a spree so as to spend it all by 31 December.  It was crazy and a total abuse of taxpayers' money.  If the intent in this section is to stop that type of nonsense then I welcome it.  The Minister should clarify whether such money can be carried forward without penalty.  Moneys due to the board should come to them irrespective of whether they have brought forward moneys they did not spend.  If there is a penalty, it will act as an incentive to spend the <Col N="100" /> money before 31 December.  If the intention is to exclude that, I welcome the section.  However, I want to hear from the Minister that a health board can bring £100,000 from 1996 into 1997 without fear of penalty from the Department when the following year's allocation is made.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is a double-edged sword.  When a health board incurs a deficit it will be the first charge on its determination the following year, so if it is down £1 million rather than running an overdraft it will start minus £1 million the following year. However, if it generates savings or has cash in hand at the end of the year, when traditionally health boards rush out to spend, it can carry forward savings without penalty, which will be credited to the accounts for the following year. The deficit carries forward as a charge and savings carry forward as a credit.  Neither of them will influence the determination made by the Minister for funds for the following financial year.</P>

      <P>I had tabled an amendment which was ruled out of order because it would prove to be a charge on the Exchequer.  If the section only referred to local health committees I would vote against it.  However, there are other areas in this section so I will not be voting against it on that basis.  It is a bad decision to remove from law the opportunity of having county health committees which was the intent of my amendment.  While such committees have not been operating in recent years they should be left on the Statute Book.  We do not know what matters may arise later in which local health committees could play an important role in the provision of our health services.</P>
      <P>Health committees would give an opportunity for debate on local issues.  One criticism of health boards is that in the past, two larger counties, which had the voting numbers, took decisions at the expense of a weaker county.  There was no forum at county level to discuss such matters and there will not be in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exclusion of local health committees from this Bill is a mistake.  Will the Minister explain the grounds for this?  I do not want to hear that they are being removed because they have not been in operation in recent times.  Much of our <Col N="101" /> legislation is not used on a daily basis but it is there to be used if the need arises.  Similarly, there should be an opportunity for a health committee to meet, perhaps not this year or next year, but whenever the need arises.  Thus, if there were a crisis they would be included in legislation and members of such committees could meet to discuss matters pertinent to their own counties.</P>

      <P>I expressed strong views on this matter on Second Stage but the fact that the Minister said section 5 of the Local Government Act can be used with section 2 of this Bill will help me to change my mind.  I represent the North Cork health district comprising two electoral areas as big as County Limerick.  It includes a general hospital, a psychiatric hospital and geriatric hospitals as well as many other services.</P>
      <P>Local health committees were provided for under section 7 of the Health Act, 1970 but they are now being dissolved.  I will accept it if the Minister says that issues can be debated under section 5 of the Local Government Act and that the board will have a statutory obligation to respond.</P>
      <P>Regional health boards can be unwieldy. Health boards that meet monthly have subcommittees and, in addition, you have the Cork and Galway regional hospital boards as well as Dublin.  At one stage we were told about pan-hospital structures.  I will not say they were concocted because they obviously served some purpose, but one had to look carefully at what was being proposed.  While I accept the section, the Minister should, when looking at the new structures of public voluntary hospitals, ensure that boards of management for general hospitals are an effective way of dealing with the matter.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In July 1987 the Government decided, as part of an expenditure review, that local health committees should be abolished.  An appropriate reduction was made in the health board allocations from 1 January 1988. While some local committees met for some time afterwards without drawing any expenses, the majority of the local advisory boards finished up in the spring of 1988.  They have not met since. We are abolishing these bodies under section 16 and we are now making it a statutory obligation on the health boards to co-operate with the local authorities.  A combination of that obligation and section 5 of the Local Government Act will bring about a situation where arrangements will be made and formalised which would best meet the needs of local areas.  It is better to include the general provision and allow the local authorities and local health boards make the formal arrangement necessary to best meet the need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By leaving redundant legislation on the Statute Book there is always the problem that one may end up in the High Court or the Supreme Court. A case may emerge where the provisions of a specific Act which was never repealed and which <Col N="102" /> would not have a practical application could become an issue in the High Court because it would still have a legal mandate.

      <P>We have a responsibility to put money back into the psychiatric services.  While there has been planning for the future and the larger institutions have been dismantled, replacement services have not been provided to the level and extent desired by carers in the services.

      <P>Will the Minister confirm it is his intent that money accrued from the sale of land and buildings will go back into the psychiatric services to provide the back up community care that is now being provided mainly by units attached to general hospitals?

    <P>With regard to the sale of land attached to psychiatric hospitals, it is my intention that we will continue to fund the changes that have taken place, that we know are taking place and that will <Col N="103" /> continue to take place in delivery of the psychiatric services.  It is also my intention to introduce the mental health Bill next year.  Given that we are modernising the policy and the provision of the services, it is time we modernised the legal framework which underpins their delivery.  This will be done next year.</P>
    <P>If land which was traditionally attached to a psychiatric hospital is being disposed of and there is a need in the area &mdash; for example, for a hostel for patients who are being displaced &mdash; there is a strong moral obligation on health boards to use money from the disposal of assets of the psychiatric services to further enhance the servicing of these needs.  It would be wrong for me as Minister to make this a statutory obligation because a health board could find that, having disposed of land, its priority may be the development of a geriatric hospital or to appropriately place persons in accommodation more suited to their needs, for example, adults with mental handicap who may be found in many psychiatric hospitals, including the one in my city.</P>
    <P>I wish to leave the situation as set out in the section where, given that they would have to be spent on enhancing the health services, it would be a matter for the boards to decide how the receipts would be allocated.

      <P>This section provides that it is an offence to carry on a nursing home that is not registered under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  I spoke at length on that legislation when it was debated in the House.  There is a crisis in the funding of the nursing home business and in subventions to nursing homes.  I have been informed in writing in the last few days by my health board that it has not received any money from the Department of Health for new applications since last July.  This is inappropriate.</P>

    <P>If the health board goes through the process of dealing with an application and decides that a <Col N="104" /> subvention of £70, £80, £90 or £100 is applicable in a specific case it cannot proceed because it does not have the necessary forms.  Health boards do not easily dispose of money on nursing home subventions.  In view of this we should meet their ongoing demand for money for applications.</P>
    <P>It is a traumatic time for the family and the person concerned when lie or she must leave home to enter a nursing home.  Matters are not helped with added worries about funding and finance.  We either fund the legislation or we do not have it at all.</P>

      <P>I welcome this legislation.  The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, provides that the money will be paid to the management of the nursing home.  That is being implemented in circumstances where families have already paid because they came under pressure to do so and there was a delay in getting a decision from the health board.  I am not aware of many such cases but I am aware of some.  That is not good enough because families might not always be able to come to an agreement with the management of health boards.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister have a good, hard look at the expenditure on private nursing homes which is in the region of £15 million to £16 million?  Spending that money on developing services within the public hospital system would give better value for money.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Section 20 was necessary because there was a loophole in the Nursing Homes Act.  While the Act made it possible to impose penalties on a person who committed that offence, it did not state it was actually an offence.  That loophole had to be amended.</P>
      <P>On the question of subventions, Senator Sherlock is right about the cost of this fairly recent scheme.  We estimated at the beginning of the year that it would cost £15 million but the cost is now £16 million.  We had talks with the health boards and have given a commitment to provide them with that extra £1 million.  I do not know what the state of draw down is in the Western Health Board, but I understand the issue has been resolved.  We must budget at the start of the year on the basis of the best estimate we can make in terms of subventions.  I would not favour nursing home subventions being a demand led scheme funded at the end of the year by way of supplementary Estimates.  There must always be some controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sherlock has opened an interesting debate.  This money was not available to private nursing homes until two years ago and suddenly they are receiving £16 million of taxpayers' money.  Are we getting the best value for that money?  Much of the subventions are swallowed up by nursing homes increasing their fees.  Some would say they were justified in doing that because they had been carrying certain patients <Col N="105" /> for a while.  We are all familiar with those arguments.</P>
    <P>It is a significant amount of taxpayers' money and we should be aware of the continuing need to measure how that money is spent.  We cannot have a free for all for people involved in private business for profit, as are proprietors of nursing homes.  We should not necessarily have to fund everything.  They are private businesses with private fee paying patients.  The State has been very generous to provide subventions of £16 million in such a short period of time.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of public nursing homes such as Sacred Heart homes and welfare homes, which are far ahead of private nursing homes in terms of therapy.  Private nursing homes provide grade A hotel facilities but patients either sit in chairs all day or walk about.  Public nursing homes provide a range of services and activity therapy throughout the day, particularly at weekends. They are to be complimented on the excellent service they provide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my great pleasure and honour on behalf of the Members of Seanad Éireann to welcome the Rt. Hon. Neil Kinnock to Seanad Éireann and to thank him for accepting our invitation to address the House today.</P>
      <P>Before his prestigious appointment to membership of the Commission, our distinguished guest earned a special place in the political hearts and minds of his own people.  He was first elected to Parliament in 1970 and was Leader of the Labour Party from 1983 to 1992. Having served the Labour Party and the people of Great Britain with honour and distinction, today his portfolio in Europe is as Commissioner with responsibility for transport, including the trans-European network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His Excellency, Helmut Kohl, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, in his address to Dáil Éireann on 2 October 1996 emphasised the need for the new Europe in which we share to be based on foundations of peace, freedom, democracy, human rights, stability and prosperity.  Central to the success of the European Union, and even more so for an enlarged Union, is transport, and Commissioner Kinnock's portfolio gives him a special insight <Col N="107" /> into the infrastructural transport demands of an evolving Union.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Kinnock, your task is not easy and you have our heartfelt best wishes for success in your responsibilities.  At present, Ireland is approximately half way through its Presidency of the Council and the House fully appreciates the major policy issues which confront the member states in the immediate future and that these issues call for much political skill, vision and resolve on the part of our political leaders and Community institutions.  Therefore, it is our prayer that wisdom and prudence will inform whatever decisions are taken regarding the future shape and direction of the Union.  It is my privilege to invite Commissioner Kinnock to address the House on the enlargement of the Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Commissioner Kinnock Commissioner Kinnock">
      <NameTxt>Commissioner Kinnock</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is an enormous privilege to be invited to address this distinguished House.  I am conscious of its history and that this, apparently, is only the second occasion on which the House has permitted somebody the privilege of addressing its Members in this fashion.  My feelings of humility and pride are even stronger than they would be in other circumstances.</P>
      <P>I am also intrigued by the fact that here I am speaking to an Upper House of a Parliament in the English language especially since your counterpart in the United Kingdom is a House which I, in common with many other politicians, spent the first half of my political life trying to abolish and may in the second half of my political life seek to join.  Things change.</P>
      <P>Enlargement, as I hope I will make clear, has immense implications for the current Union, the countries seeking membership of the Union and consequently the entire continent.  As epitomised yet again in the course of a very efficient and effective Presidency, this Republic is central not only to the activity of the Union but its thinking. Without flattery and with complete accuracy, it must be said that no member country of the Union in its political institutions and among its people so faithfully carries forward not just the day to day reality and obligation of Union membership but the spirit of community in the Union.  This may be, of course, evidence of a deeper character of the people of Ireland, or it may be the success in adaptation to fresh political challenges.  Whichever it is, I hope the spirit engendered in and by this country in the Community eventually becomes endemic because it should act as a benevolent, communicable antidote to disease in one or two other corners of the Union that suffer from rather more cynicism and rather less effectiveness than does this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my conversations ten days ago in an official visit I made to Cyprus in my capacity as Transport Commissioner, repeated emphasis was <Col N="108" /> given to the critical link between joining the European Union and finding a political solution to the agonies of that island where so many Irish soldiers have served with distinction in the United Nations forces over the years of division. Ten days before that, the Transport Ministers of the central and Eastern European countries that are applying for Union membership repeated their countries' wish to join the Union in order to consolidate the modernisation of their political and civil institutions, to underpin the new democracies and bring fresh opportunities to their businesses and peoples.</P>
    <P>For all those applicant countries the benefits of accession could be very substantial.  With membership, they will have access to the Single Market and opportunities in world markets on terms negotiated by the Union.  They will have closer cultural and social links with other European peoples, the prospect of increased financial and technical support, participation in powerful, well established and stable institutions and the opportunity to influence the actions and decisions made by the world's largest trading bloc, the European Union.</P>
    <P>The existing Union members also have much to gain &mdash; bigger and growing barrier free markets for capital goods and expertise, greater opportunities for the movement of people and the prospect of an even stronger European voice in the councils of the world.  Above all, and this is in the interests of every country, enlargement could secure liberty and stability right across this continent for the first time in history.  In our generation, the prospect of gaining those objectives is moving from one of idealistic desire to practical reality.</P>
    <P>The task of preparing the existing Union and the applicant countries for enlargement is, of course, huge and, to any sensible person, daunting.  Despite the welcome enthusiasm for progress, it must be carried out in the most careful and systematic way in order to ensure minimum disruptions and maximum benefits.  The applicant countries are responding to the challenge by making the huge structural and political changes that are necessary to comply with the preconditions set down by the European Council in Copenhagen in 1993.  Those relate in particular to the creation of stable institutions which guarantee democracy, civil liberties and the rights of minorities.  A further precondition is the establishment of market economies able to compete within the Union and, of course, there is the precondition that they are able to take on the obligations of membership.</P>
    <P>The scale of the task of the applicant countries is &mdash; I make accurate use of a word that is often used inaccurately &mdash; historic.  Average GDP in the ten potential member states of central and Eastern Europe is estimated currently to be about 30 per cent of the European Union average, whereas that of the four so-called cohesion states, of which Ireland is one, is now just under 75 per cent of the same average. <Col N="109" /> Ireland's GDP is, of course, way above that figure.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that there is a great deal of catching up to do among the candidate countries. Even if the ten potential member states were to enjoy annual economic growth rates that were 5 per cent per year in excess of the average arrangements between the European Union and the candidate countries.  Obviously that is an achieved by the European Union it would take them over ten years to reach 50 per cent of the EU average and 16 years to achieve 75 per cent of the Union average.  The speed and quality of development differs between the ten applicant states and, therefore, while it is convenient to speak of them as a grouping for the general purposes of describing their performance gap that is clearly not the basis on which their individual capacity to become members will be assessed when the possibility of admission comes to be considered.</P>
    <P>While those countries are striving to achieve advances which would satisfy the conditions set at successive European Councils, the Union is following the pre-accession strategy outlined in the Essen summit in December 1994.  It has implemented the structured dialogue between the associated states and the institutions and ministries of the European Union and it is working with the candidate states to ensure adjustment in three practical ways.  It is offering technical and financial assistance through the FAR programme which provides about 1 billion ECU per year to the Eastern and central European countries and the Baltic states.  In addition the European Investment Bank, together with some member states and other international financial institutions are investing significant sums.</P>
    <P>The second adjustment mechanism is through the gradual integration of the associated states into the day to day work of the Union.  I will give an instance.  This year I established a Transport Infrastructure Needs Assessment, or TINA, as everything has to have an acronym in the European Union.  I sat next to a man at a lunch some months ago and had a very interesting conversation with him.  On his card at the table were written the four letters &ldquo;LODZ&rdquo; and I wondered what on earth that stood for.  I tried to work it out and thought of &ldquo;Logistical Organisational Development Zone&rdquo;.  Then I realised it was the name of the transport Minister of Hungary.</P>
    <P>I established this infrastructure needs assessment, or TINA, as a joint initiative based on the recognition that for enlargement to generate maximum benefit for all of Europe, the development of safe, efficient, environmentally friendly transport between all the member states of an enlarged Union is absolutely fundamental. The contacts and the development taking place through that process is, of course, a natural and practical means of ensuring the operation of effective adjustment between the way in which they run their affairs and meet their needs and <Col N="110" /> the way in which we are seeking to meet our needs and run our affairs.</P>
    <P>The third adjustment activity is taking place through the negotiation of market access arrangements between the European Union and the candidate countries.  Obviously that is an essential accompaniment to the applicant countries' action to align their legislation with ours and it is an area where the Union must show imagination and generosity if the ideals of enlargement are to become a reality.  In my sector, we have a liberalisation agreement on inland waterways, a mandate to begin the process of liberalising road haulage, which is of crucial importance to the central European states, and a couple of weeks ago in the Transport Council, largely thanks to the efforts of the Irish Presidency, I was granted a mandate to negotiate a civil aviation agreement with the countries of central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic states.</P>
    <P>In all of these areas practical development is taking place.  There is always a connection between access to our market and the achievement and maintenance of high standards of personal and environmental safety, again propelling forward the achievement of modern and efficient conditions.</P>
    <P>These are useful beginnings although it has to be said that market access is one area in which the rhetoric of enlargement, colourful though it is, sometimes starts to come into collision with the lack of sufficient political will in some quarters to turn the objective of integration into reality.  When the commercial interests of the applicant states start to bite, or seem to bite, into the commercial market of some of the member states, you will start to hear the squeals of pain even before the bites are felt.</P>
    <P>Clearly that has to improve because if business and trade are not encouraged as a gradual but sustained process in the associated states, then the development of strong market economies able to compete in an enlarged market will simply not take place with the speed or on the scale that is necessary.  In addition to the action being taken by the associated states and jointly between the existing Community and the applicant members, the Community must obviously evolve ways that, in future, facilitate the increase in membership. Clearly, that must involve changes in custom and practice, challenges to established interests and political and economic adjustments that will sometimes be uncomfortable.  My watchword as I anticipate all of that and the potential for disruption and agreement is from a Woody Guthrie song: &ldquo;Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Preparations for change are, of course, under way.  The first focus of effort is in the current intergovernmental conference.  The Commission made clear in its opinion to the Intergovernmental Conference that if there was to be successful enlargement, three crucial issues would have to be addressed.  First, the institutional implications of having an increased number of <Col N="111" /> member states; clearly there has to be balance and adequate representation of the new member states &mdash; indeed, of all member states &mdash; and of their population in the voting arrangements in the Council.  There also has to be a representative electoral procedure for Members of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Second, existing decision making procedures which require unanimity could frequently result in stalemate in an enlarged Union.  We, therefore, need to move to a situation where qualified majority is the general if not the universal rule.</P>
    <P>Third, we need to tackle the sensitive but important issue of flexibility.  Thought needs to go into developing a system in which some member states can move ahead faster in some fields without undermining the political and economic fundamentals of the Union and without weakening the cohesion between member states. The Commission has already made it clear that, after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, we will present a number of major documents to prepare for enlargement in line with the conclusion of the recent European summits of Madrid and Florence.</P>
    <P>First, we will submit separate opinions on the application for accession from each of the individual candidate countries.  Second, we will present a general document setting out a comprehensive approach to the whole enlargement issue.  In doing this, we will make a detailed assessment of the impact of Union policies in such areas as agriculture and structural and cohesion funds.  Clearly these are issues of direct and great significance to this country.  Most importantly, the Commission will have to incorporate the dimension of future enlargement into proposals for the future financing of the EU.</P>
    <P>The formal opinions that we produce will need to provide much more than a photograph of the applicant's current situation.  There will have to be a realistic assessment of the progress they can expect to make before accession, taking account of the evolution of the Union's <i>acquis</i> and of the changing situation in the applicant countries.  In preparing the opinions, the Commission clearly has to respect the injunction of the Madrid Council to ensure that the applicant countries are treated on an equal basis and that each country will be considered on its own merits in a scrupulously objective way without prejudging the results of the assessment.  The recommendations in each opinion will naturally have to depend on the situation and prospects of the country concerned.</P>
    <P>The task of adapting Union policies meanwhile will obviously involve significant changes that would have to be made, in many respects, even without the prospects of enlargement and most certainly have to be made when the prospect of a Union of 20 to 30 states in the next decades is contemplated.</P>
    <P>The imperative for reforming the Common Agricultural Policy, for example, reflects the need <Col N="112" /> to compete successfully and fairly in world markets, the need to enable developing countries to improve their agricultural sectors and trading prospects, the requirement to reduce fraud and waste, the obligation to ensure low food prices for Community consumers and the food industry and the requirement that spending be focused on these areas and on the groups most in need of assistance.  These are all good reasons in themselves for continuing the reform process.</P>
    <P>In its agricultural strategy paper to the Madrid Council last year, the Commission concluded that the 1992 CAP reform process begun by Mr. Ray McSharry had to continue with sustained and gradual movement toward more market orientated policies with reduced reliance on price support, greater integration of environmental concerns and development of a broader based rural policy to maximise the cohesion effects of the agricultural policy.  It goes without saying that the necessary adjustments to the agricultural sector have to be carried out in an orderly, methodical manner which protects the proper interests of rural communities and gives ground for confidence to the farmers themselves about the future.</P>
    <P>In addition to agriculture, the Union's policy on economic and social cohesion will also have to be closely scrutinised.  The Commission is setting the scene for future discussions by publishing the first three-yearly report on the progress toward achieving cohesion as required by the Maastricht Treaty.  The report centres on current and past trends in cohesion and how member states and the EU's policies contribute to reducing the gaps in social and economic development.  Against this backdrop we will have to assess what enlargement will imply in terms of future development policies and in funding effort as well as the need for a process of transition towards a new policy and financial framework that will involve progressive integration of the new member states and appropriate adjustment of the cohesion effort within the existing member states.</P>
    <P>Some of the enormous sums that have been postulated as being necessary to fund cohesion in an enlarged Union are clearly completely unrealistic.  The absorption capacity of funds of any state is not infinite.  Funds made available to new members will be limited by the amounts they can use, the amounts they can co-finance and the amounts the Union can afford.  The disparities across the enlarged Union are likely to be large. Figures I gave earlier demonstrate that clearly.</P>
    <P>There will be an urgent need to attack the major structural problems of some of the new member states alongside continuing efforts within existing member states to promote cohesion and the closing of economic and social gaps.  If the Union is convinced of the effectiveness of its cohesion effort within the existing Union, there is every reason to think that cohesion policies will occupy a substantial place in the objectives and the budget of a Union which will ultimately be an <Col N="113" /> economic and monetary union as well as the form of union we have now.</P>
    <P>It is essential to emphasise that support to regional development and social regeneration are not sweeteners to the disadvantaged. This is a view I hold with particular passion because of where I come from and the knowledge I have of the way in which the funds provided from the European Union and from taxpayers throughout the remainder of the United Kingdom have assisted in securing a transition from one culture and structure of economic development to a completely different structure and culture of economic development in my homeland of Wales. I deeply resent, therefore, the representation of fiscal transfers, cohesion funds, Structural Funds and so on, made in some quarters as some kind of first aid system for wounded economies.  Those transfers are fundamentally necessary if we are to sustain in anything more than the wildest rhetoric the idea of a balanced, cohesive Community that is advancing together and enjoying mutual opportunities in that strength.</P>
    <P>The support mechanisms and the structural and cohesion funds are crucial for wider economic development, strengthening the periphery, decongesting the centre, controlling costs, combating and preventing unemployment and for achieving greater competitiveness in a union of economies in a single economic area.  One thing is certain: a defensive, introverted attitude to enlargement will bring weakness.  Those who take the view that enlargement will inevitably deprive assisted areas of support are defeatist and wrong. I hear the voices, not in a rising crescendo, but more frequently than I did four or five years ago. The reason they are wrong and defeatist is straightforward.  This generation is the first in the history of this fragmented and war torn continent to get the chance to create a level of economic and political interdependence from east to west and north to south that will offer an unprecedented guarantee against despotism and strife in a continent that has had a surfeit of both, even in recent times.  That opportunity for this generation must be taken.</P>
    <P>Enlargement to include countries that have seriously under-developed economies and systems of management and administration cannot be a great and glorious leap of faith inspired simply by political will.  Some would even have us think that all the difficulties can be eradicated or at least sufficiently obscured if we only have the political determination.  Life anywhere, including in the European Union, is not like that.  The process, therefore, must be gradual, measured and deliberate but absolutely determined and certain.  Both the condition of the member countries and, even more, the state of the potential member states require that we take that determined but gradualist view.</P>
    <P>Recognising that reality does not diminish in any way the belief that enlargement can and will <Col N="114" /> be a mutual advantage, a fresh opportunity and a historic necessity.  With the collapse of the communist bloc in Europe we are confronted by the need to develop and apply new concepts of security.  There are obvious and changed sources of insecurity such as economic deprivation, poverty, unemployment, social exclusion, extremism, racism and evironmental degradation. There is a danger that the marginalisation of social groups and regions can give rise to fear, intolerance and conflict.  In the European Union and in the countries of central and eastern Europe there is a widespread recognition of those realities which gives a sense of urgency to the need for enlargement.  Our response must be imaginative and practical for there is acute awareness that enlargement must not, in its very act of application, lead to new strains, tensions, resentments and rivalries.</P>
    <P>Speaking in Finland last month the Tánaiste said that what Europe will become tomorrow depends to a large extent on what happens in the next few years in central and eastern Europe.  For that reason, enlargement which is both a challenge and an opportunity for Europe, must be a focus of all policies in the Union.  In practical recognition of the fact that enlargement will enhance stability and confidence throughout the continent, your Government rightly made preparation for that development a priority for its Presidency.  I commend the strenuous efforts of Ministers and civil servants for that objective. That energy must be maintained.</P>
    <P>As the deliberations, which inevitably will sometimes be heated and hard, proceed, one reality must be remembered above all others.  Just seven years ago, before the Iron Curtain crumbled, many western European countries were paying a huge proportion of their national wealth to ensure that the anticipated threat from an unfree and undemocratic eastern Europe was contained and deterred.  As those same nations are striving to sustain and strengthen their new freedom and democracy in the most demanding economic conditions, western Europe must see the practical advantage of investing a much smaller part of its wealth in fostering those advances.  There is not a family, firm, city or country in Europe, east and west and north and south, that will not benefit from the serenity that can be achieved by such partnership.  We can attain that if we work for it and, because we can, we must.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I extend a special welcome to the Commissioner. As a member of the committee who welcomed him, I made it my business to find out more about his love of rugby and choral singing.  I made inquiries from my colleagues in the Leinster <Col N="115" /> rugby union.  To a man they said they were glad, having seen the Commissioner referee for London Welsh, he stayed in politics.  With regard to the Commissioner's singing ability, I was assured that he is very welcome in Kitty O'Shea's public house.</P>
      <P>On a serious note, I wish to make three points. I come from a constituency which includes Dublin Airport and is affected by the major debate on the Luas project.  Ireland is the only island nation in the EU and I ask the Commissioner and his colleagues to bear that in mind in the many decisions to be made about resources.  In economic and social terms it is extremely important for us to have a level playing pitch with regard to transport costs.</P>
      <P>We welcome the Commissioner's support for the Aer Lingus restructuring programme.  The Commissioner is very much involved in the deregulation of airlines and so forth.  What plans has the EU to deregulate air traffic control?</P>
      <P>As regards light rail and Luas, I ask the Commissioner, as his colleagues have done recently, to stay loyal to the fight.  The resources are now available and there is a social and economic need for light rail and rail transport to be extended north of the Liffey.</P>

      <P>I extend congratulations to the Commissioner on a wide ranging speech.  I agree with him on total enlargement.  Ireland has a significant problem as it is the only island State. Infrastructural changes have taken place, particularly since the implementation of the Cecchini report, which mean that politicians and those involved in business, trade unions, services and any Europe wide movement, are at a disadvantage living in this country.  The cost of travelling from Dublin to Brussels puts every business person, trade unionist, educationalist and politician who is travelling on business at a disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now reaching the end of this round of Structural Funds and we are looking to the future.  Unless the Commissioner will consider having a tunnel under that other island between us and Europe, he might give some consideration to how Europe would view a subsidy on the <Col N="116" /> transportation costs between this country and the golden triangle at the centre of Europe.  We are, and will be, at a considerable disadvantage.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I welcome the Commissioner and thank him for his address.  I apologise for being late, as I have come from a lively discussion on regional policy, organised by the Institute of European Affairs.  Arising from that discussion, I am interested to hear the Commissioner's view as to how we widen the Community in terms of its enlargement and deepen it in terms of its institutions.  It will become increasingly difficult to deal with the institutional side in terms of countries we expect to join us.  I was going to ask the Commissioner whether he thought J.P.R. Williams hit Mike Gibson late in whatever year it was but we will not go back that far.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome Commissioner Kinnock.  As I live in Limerick City, I would be happy to talk rugby with him because we have a fine record.  As he may be aware, Munster recently defeated the Wasps in Thomond Park in Limerick where we also defeated the All Blacks.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Commissioner gave us his thoughts on social cohesion.  He referred to the fact it is not just a sweetener but is very much a central aspect of enlargement.</P>
      <P>There is a conflict between meeting the economic requirements of GDP for the ten countries and the requirement to maintain social cohesion and not to create a greater gap between the haves and the have-nots.  I am concerned about the time leading up to their entry, rather than afterwards and the dilemma Ireland has in relation to European Monetary Union.  It is a particular dilemma for countries that are trying to fulfil the economic requirements for joining the EU.  Is the EU monitoring this matter and assisting in maintaining social cohesion prior to the various countries fulfilling the economic requirements for joining the EU?</P>

As a fellow Celt, the Commissioner is particularly welcome.  The Celtic language is our common expression which I know the EU greatly treasures, and will make him feel even more at home, despite some of the things that have been said about Welsh rugby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to comment on three separate elements of the Commissioner's comprehensive address. As a former Member of the college, I am happy to have the opportunity of learning the update on <Col N="117" /> policies the Commissioner is proposing and developing at this point.</P>
    <P>I am sure the library of the Berlaymont is well stocked with reports such as the Ortoli report, the Tindemans' report, that of the Committee of the Three Wise Men and others which addressed the institutional implications of enlargement at various times.  Ireland greatly treasures the Commission as the guardian of the treaties and the initiator of so much which has been positive for Europe.  The constant theme running through those reports was that each member state should have one Commissioner.  I would like the Commissioner's observations on the views of the Commission on this issue.  As he pointed out, as the Union enlarges, it will not be possible to maintain the current situation.  I would like a reassurance that the Commission in examining this will veer towards reducing the number of Commissioners.  There are now two Commissioners for each member state, which runs contrary to what we hear in reports about reducing the number of Commissioners from the smaller member states.</P>
    <P>I had responsibility for administration and personnel in the Commission.  It is clear that even now approximately 60 per cent of the time and resources of the Commission are devoted to translation and linguistics.  Is the Commission thinking of reducing the number of working languages as distinct from official languages?  The marathon sessions of the Council of Agriculture I suffered for almost five years are mostly like that because of the time it takes to translate the documents into all the working languages.  Has the Commission any view on the institutional reform of this area?</P>
    <P>I suppose cohesion would be the latter day translation for convergence, which was a term brought into vogue by Commissioner Kinnock's distinguished former colleague in the British Labour Party and former President of the Commission, Lord Jenkins.  With any enlargement, the states at the centre, such as Germany, Holland, Belgium and probably France, gained inevitably by being at the centre of the market in terms of the freeing of trade and access to markets.  That has been the pattern which we welcomed but the balance to that in those days was what was called the convergent policies of applying economic benefits to the infrastructural development on which Commissioner Kinnock has dwelt at very reassuring length.  Will the Commissioner assure me that the same twin track approach will be pursued now in that Germany, which we admire greatly, is bound to benefit considerably from an enlargement towards countries which are much closer to it as distinct even from Spain, Greece and Portugal?</P>
    <P>I was touched by Commissioner Kinnock's reference to the different Europe and the security situation.  It is true, of course, and it is something we endorse and support.  He mentioned the reduction in expenditure on security.  Is the <Col N="118" /> Commission giving serious thought to the scandal of the armaments industry in Europe?  It may be significant to member states' financial security but it is causing havoc and suffering throughout the world as we speak.  Does the Commission see a direct role for itself in that regard?</P>

      <P>I suppose it was inevitable, as a Welshman attending this distinguished House, that I should come in for a degree of mockery about the recent performance of Welsh Rugby Football team.  We take it in good heart.  As I had occasion to say again this year when I was in Dublin for the match, we can take generous and poetic instruction from the irish Rugby Football Union which has graced the bottom place in the table on more than one occasion with such elegance and passion that there have been occasions when we were top of that table year after year that I almost envied the Irish.  Now we are getting a taste of it.</P>
      <P>I will say on behalf of my very good friend, J. P. R. Williams, that he was late in his tackle on Mike Gibson but he got there as soon as he could. It also must be said that there would be a fundamental error if anyone thought I had ever refereed for London Welsh.  It may have been that opponents of London Welsh from time to time thought I was refereeing for them but I assure the House I was not.  At least, that is my story and I am sticking to it.</P>
      <P>To respond to the questions raised, first, I am immensely encouraged by the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  I spoke about it earlier this afternoon because it connects with both the philosophy and the practical approach which the Commission sought to apply in the Green Paper <i>Citizen's Network.</i>  What is really encouraging is the fact that here is a city and country directly tackling the practical problems of congestion and developing blueprints and a practical proposal for escaping from what otherwise will be transport thrombosis in this city with devastating effects on commerce, the economy and employment.  That is the fate which awaits many European cities if they do not undertake the kind of development which is proposed in the DTI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A critical part of that is the light rail system and, while it must be for Ireland and Dublin to determine the order of events to meet the various pressures of various problems, it is also clear that part of the scheme over the years must include effective connection to the airport in Swords, County Dublin, simply because what is now determining the efficiency of civil aviation, which is even more critical for connection to Ireland than many other parts of the Union, is not the infrastructure, it is the ground infrastructure.  In many parts of the Union a person can travel 500 <Col N="119" /> miles in an hour, which is roughly the time it takes to travel the last five miles to or from the airport, especially when there is heavy traffic.  If we wish to avert the absolute nonsense of that imbalance of transport inefficiency, then clearly among the other purposes of effective local networks, including those to the south and west of Dublin, thought must be, and is being, given to that connection to the northern suburbs and on to the airport.</P>
    <P>Second, Aer Lingus has done extremely well because it met all the conditions set by the European Commission at the time of application for State aid.  It has gone through a huge restructuring, including the divestment of part of its operations, and even the area of Aer Lingus which gave cause for grave concern, that is, the TEAM Aer Lingus maintenance subsidiary, has started to come into its own.  I give full credit for that.</P>
    <P>The requirement, of course, is that Aer Lingus can compete fairly and that is one of the reasons, especially having gone through the travail which the company and its workforce has gone through, I am so insistent when other countries and companies elsewhere in the EU make application for permission for their Governments to provide state aids, I make it clear to them that the least I expect from them and the least I will accept from them is that they show the same fastidiousness in meeting conditions as Aer Lingus did.  It is not always easy to persuade them to do that but we are achieving success and I am very confident that by the end of my term as Transport Commissioner at the end of 1999 there will be no further state aids allocated in the civil aviation sector in the European Single Market.  We are working our way through them.  The last application has been received by Alitalia, which never made an application before.  Once we have dealt with that the line will be drawn, apart from those particular routes which will never be commercial and must be maintained for the purposes of social cohesion, access to islands and remote areas, etc.  State aids will always be allowable in a measured amount in those cases for the social purposes but we will see the end of them as a general provision.  Aer Lingus will benefit from that but clearly it must compete with rivals from other sources.  I will come to that in a moment.</P>
    <P>So far as air traffic control is concerned, we have put forward a comprehensive but very practical proposal for the reorganisation and reform of air traffic management and control in the European Union.  The airlines and many of the people who work in the civil aviation industry are on our side.  The users are very definitely on our side and some of the member states, including Ireland, show a progressive and intelligent attitude towards reform.  However, that does not apply to all member states.  I am persuaded that when one is at 31,000 feet and the captain of the aircraft says the turbulence one is <Col N="120" /> experiencing is due to meteorological conditions, he is telling lies.  What one is actually doing when one bounces around at 31,000 feet is crossing the borders of sovereignty into another member state.  That can be the only real explanation for the amount of fuss some member states are still making about the way in which their independence and sovereignty would be compromised if they were to participate in the operation of a single air traffic management area for the whole of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The change must come and the sooner, the better.  It will benefit every air traveller in terms of less congestion, delay and cost.</P>
    <P>Congestion and cost amount to about 10 per cent or 11 per cent of final costs for air travel in the European Union.  With increased congestion, better management of an organised area is necessary for safety reasons.  This is one of the safest parts of the world in which to fly.  That is a credit to the quality of controllers and pilots operating in the European Union.  However, that task becomes more demanding every day as congestion builds up so reform is necessary for that purpose as well.</P>
    <P>On the question of what lessons might be learned from the unification of Germany, the answer is few.  The reason is that this was the unification of a country which always existed as constituted post war.  Therefore, the people of the western lander of Germany connected nationally and in familial terms with the lander of east Germany even during the years of totalitarian rule.  They wanted and were willing to underpin the costs of unification which was done with dramatic speed and at substantial cost.  In making the Deutsche Mark the universal currency and providing a parity of one to one with the so-called Ostmark, there were bound to be huge pressures on the economy.</P>
    <P>What is being proposed in terms of enlargement of the European Union is not as dramatic nor does it have the same potential for pressure.  What we understand more graphically, possibly it was understood before, is that there must be substantial investment in terms of skills and physical and technical infrastructure if the incoming parts of Europe are to stand a real chance of competing.  That is the reason I make the point that we must be imaginative and generous in our attitude to the preparation for and the follow through of enlargement.  If we are to learn anything from the unification of Germany it is that if the receivers, the hosts as it were, are not prepared to make generous provision for the newcomers then the period of transition to good performance will be extended by many years with consequent unemployment and alienation which are difficult for any civilised society to support.</P>
    <P>As far as the cost of connection with Brussels is concerned, I sympathise greatly.  Because so much civil and commercial business must be done between the capitals of the European Union you suffer particular disadvantages being at the <Col N="121" /> periphery.  The ticket in my pocket is worth £500 &mdash; it is a return ticket from Brussels.  That is virtually unsupportable for private individuals even if they are very prosperous.  It is difficult to bear for a medium size company, especially if it has to send two or three trade representatives to a conference or a delegation.</P>
    <P>We all have a vested interest in the reduction of air travel costs.  We produced a report last week on the effect of civil aviation liberalisation which has been going on since 1993.  In some respects the report was very encouraging.  There have been new entrants in ten of the 15 domestic markets in the European Union.  There has been an increase in the number of companies operating in civil aviation and on the number of routes. About 55 per cent of those who fly in the European Union go by charter and 71 per cent of those who fly on scheduled flights have the advantage of pax, apex or special fares.  However, if people want to buy fully flexible fares in business or economy class in European civil aviation, they still pay fares which are too high and, in some cases, excessive.  We will investigate those excessive fares which affect between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of all civil aviation users in the European Union.  If we can prove those fares are excessive taking into account the costs which must be met to put that person in the air, we will use the powers of the relevant laws which already exist to require a withdrawal of those fares.</P>
    <P>Having said that, there is only one way to bring fares down and that is to have three or more carriers on a route.  All the evidence of our report and our experience suggests that we only get substantial falls in fares, including flexible ones, on European routes if there is intense competition.  I do not have to tell anybody in Ireland what the effect of competition has been on major routes in and out of this country.  That experience is mirrored throughout the European Union.  Where there are three carriers on a route, there is real competition and there have been huge reductions in prices.  Where there are two carriers on a route, we see the development of duopolies or coincidences where fares are within a couple of pounds of each other.</P>
    <P>To reduce costs, we must foster the development of competition as much as we can. We are taking other actions such as that on civil aviation and airport charges and ground handling liberalisation which is underway in Ireland and are making a number of other changes, including the reform of air traffic management to reduce the non flight costs to carriers to make the more able compete with lower fares.  There is no question of subsidy nor will there be.  The most efficient and effective way to bring prices within the reach of the mass of people is through competition not through subsidy which could have the opposite effect, as it has had for most of the past 60 years in the civil aviation system of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I find the question of widening and deepening fascinating.  It will be evident to this House that <Col N="122" /> there are people and interests who will use the ambition to widen as an argument against deepening.  There are some who will use the arguments in favour of deepening as an excuse for not widening.  Both are completely insincere and entirely cosmetic arguments.  The truth is that in order to widen we must deepen.  The case is made by the size of the Commission, for example, that we must deepen the European Union by ensuring that every State, no matter how big the size of the Union, has a Commissioner.  We made that point in our submission from the Commission to the intergovernmental conference.  It also means that in the Council there must be a deepening in the form of wider use of qualified majority voting.</P>
    <P>It is unthinkable that a tiny state which might have an exclusive interest could hold up the process of beneficial and benevolent legislation simply because it requires a unanimous view or, indeed, a big state with vested interests in the status quo doing likewise because the change proposed does not suit its immediate convenience.  The only way an enlarged Union becomes manageable is if its procedures, constitution and actions are deepened.  That does not mean the destruction of sovereignty.  If sovereignty is in jeopardy in the modern world it is not from an alliance of democracies which constitutionally and deliberately develop mutual and joint actions, but from the operation of unaccountable markets which comes as a consequence of circumstances over which single nations have little or no control.  International crime, drug trafficking, environmental pollution, employment and various forms of migration are irresistible and uncontrollable as far as single nations are concerned.</P>
    <P>The truth about modern sovereignty is that, if it is to be effective, it must be pooled.  Deepening and widening are not the perils of sovereignty as some would have us believe.  They are ways of exalting the effective power of people over the changes and influences that can control and influence their lives.  This will continue to be a fundamental argument which should be taken head on.  What we are trying to pursue both through widening and deepening is the addition to the power of people to control their own destiny.  That needs, among other things, the implementation of an effective and responsive union of democracies working in alliance.  Any excuses about not deepening because we are busy widening, or not widening because we are busy deepening are side-shows which fail to address the basic issues of concern to the people of the Union &mdash; unemployment, tension, insecurity, the environmental threat and whether there is a future for their children.  We need the combined strength of the Union to try to provide many of the answers as possible.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of cohesion in the approach to entry to the Union will be difficult in any circumstances, but the advance towards monetary union will mean extra pressures.  That is why I <Col N="123" /> make the argument and use the term fiscal transfer.  I am not suggesting there should be an explosion in the budget.  A feature of all successful monetary unions, whether we talk about the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany or France, is that they are national monetary unions.  What is evident in those monetary unions is that there must be arrangements for fiscal transfer to ease shifts, to compensate for major industrial changes and to stimulate the development of peripheral areas. This is totally justifiable in the interests of the country and now in the interests of the Union.  In the approach to membership of the Union and for some time after, we must make the commitment to cohesion in forceful and practical terms and not simply in rhetorical terms.  There is a danger sometimes that it is only rhetorical.</P>
    <P>I answered one point made by the last truly ginger member of the Commission, Senator O'Kennedy.  When I turned up at the Commission, the officials thought he had come back but they said he was bigger and better looking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Commissioner Kinnock</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the institutional question, which is the Commission's opinion, there cannot be fewer than one Commissioner per member state.  The distortions that would arise in the sense of injustice if anything else was tried would be insupportable.</P>
      <P>I have a similar view as far as the burden of 11 working languages is concerned.  I can see the rationality &mdash; I say it from the point of view of an English speaker &mdash; of having fewer working languages and, consequently, a reduction in the use of time and money.  Some 4,000 out of 16,000 people who work for the Commission are in the translation and interpretation services.  This is not a great sprawling democracy as some would have us believe, but a small administrative bureaucracy where approximately 25 per cent of the people are employed because we have 11 languages.</P>
      <P>There is a price worth paying, although it is substantial.  However, if we want to reach out to people and make the European Union transparent and meaningful, language is fundamental and it may be symbolic in some cases.  In Finland 85 per cent of the people speak English and 65 per cent speak more than two languages, including Swedish because a substantial part of the population of Finland is Swedish.  Perhaps the use of Finnish is symbolic. However, the symbol is of crucial importance and it is a cheque we must be prepared to write for a long time unless and until countries take the view that they do not require their language to be a working language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know the history of this country well enough to understand if this country has made a conscious decision as regards its language.  If it has, that demonstrates a degree of co-operative <Col N="124" /> maturity which is exemplary.  However, we cannot impose such a decision on others; it is a conclusion they must come to themselves.  I am conscious it might imply that Latvian, Lithuanian and Romanian should become working languages.  However, we will have to write a cheque in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Convergence is a better term than cohesion but it is being used for another purpose.  Convergence implies a moving together at a higher standard and it is a much more accurate use of the term. However, it was used for other purposes and cohesion is a second best, especially since people in greater numbers understand its implications. We must sustain and strengthen the commitment to cohesion not only because of the self-evident reasons that we need to support and assist in the development of the periphery, of areas which are going through significant structural change or of areas hit for any number of reasons by poverty, but also for the purposes of decongestion.</P>
    <P>I speak from a transport standpoint but it is also true in terms of employment, the expense of land and development, access to science, the application of research and development and the defence of the environment.  We must ensure that not only do we have a spread for the purpose of benefiting the periphery &mdash; that has merit in itself &mdash; but that we secure a greater spread in order to avoid the ruinous implications of congestion in the centre.  Even since Mr. Roy Jenkins was President of the Commission 20 years ago, the movement in the direction of congestion as a major impediment to effective and sustainable economic development has been huge.  Traffic volumes have gone up by 80 per cent in those 20 years and they will double in the next 20 years.</P>
    <P>Last night I was with a group from a German land, the capital of which is Stuttgart, whose major problem is that it is a transit land between Switzerland, France and the rest of Germany and the congestion there is such that it is one of the first three concerns mentioned by electors who are asked what worries them most.  They will not take kindly to the idea of people from Ireland or Wales asking them for three Siemens plants, two ABB plants and a machine tool industry in return for assistance with decongestion.  I do not think they will volunteer for that.  We must continue to argue that part of the reason for a cohesion strategy is decongestion &mdash; the rescue of substantial parts of the European Union from thrombosis.  The fact that the relocation will be of benefit to the periphery is a bonus as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the European Union does not have a defence policy or common foreign and security policy of the kind which permits an easing of expenditure on defence and armaments. If we did.  I presume we would extend the existing strategy.  The Konver programme, for example, which could do with further assistance, assists those parts of the European Union heavily dependent on defence industries to apply such skills to other industries and services.  I would like <Col N="125" /> to see that happening on a continental basis.  It would be a huge economic gain if that were the case.  The responsibility for it lies elsewhere, with national governments, NATO and so on, not with the European Union.  While we can ruminate about and become passionately engaged in the arguments, we do not have any kind of responsible authority in these matters and it may be many years before we do.</P>

      <P>I join with my colleagues in welcoming Commissioner Kinnock to Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>My first question is about transport in an enlarged Union.  Most of the ten potential member states are located in mainland Europe and to the east and south east of Germany.  We are on the periphery and while we appreciate the importance of cohesion, enlargement and improved access to markets &mdash; the Commissioner referred to the EU responding to enlargement by improving access to markets &mdash; enlargement is laden with much danger.</P>
      <P>As previous Senators have stated, we are the only island member state.  We do not receive funding for mobile assets such as ferries and cargo planes.  We are at a huge cost disadvantage. Transportation costs, particularly from the west, to the UK or the continent are prohibitive and this puts us at a huge competitive disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner said that State aid for social cohesion would still be available and that Aer Lingus would benefit.  We need State and EU aid for mobile assets which will enable us to transport our goods easily and cheaply to mainland Europe. I ask him as Transport Commissioner to recognise that we are on the periphery and not to lose sight of us.</P>
      <P>The other issue is the reduction in the number of Commissioners.  There are arguments for and against that.  We say that small member states should retain their Commissioners and, if there is to be a reduction, let it be from those member states who have two Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The third issue is the European Monetary Union.  That is also important for Ireland.  What is the Commissioner's view on the UK's position on European Monetary Union?  How might it affect the economy and markets in this part of Europe?</P>

      <P>There is an organisation which may not be well-known because it would not have been prudent to advertise its existence.  For 20 years, there has been a north-west cross-Border group, the only one which comprises elected Members on both sides of the Border: three local authorities in Northern Ireland and one in Donegal where I come from.  It covers all political persuasions which is unique.  Despite the fact that the Commissioner only receives bad news, we have managed to stay together without making embarrassing statements about each other.</P>
      <P>We recently met Minister Moss in Northern Ireland and submitted a specific proposal about a road.  The road is the N2 in the Republic of Ireland and the A5 in Northern Ireland.  The cross-Border group unanimously has this as its top priority.  After meeting Minister Moss, he suggested we would not make much progress until we had the blessing of Commissioner Kinnock.  This is an opportunity for me to present a copy of the submission made to Minister Moss to the Commissioner, in the hope that he will recognise that this is a genuine cross-Border project and not a flag of convenience.  I would appreciate his assistance in having the N2 and A5 upgraded so that more people from north and south could travel and visit each other.  Perhaps it would contribute to a better understanding on the island.</P>

      <P>I also compliment the Commissioner on a Green Paper he launched earlier this year on the negative side-effects of transport which he estimated is costing the Union 250 billion ECUs per year.  Will he indicate what progress if any has been made on this and how he sees it developing?</P>

      <P>I welcome our guest as a friend not just to me for almost two decades but also to <Col N="127" /> this country.  It is proper that present and former illustrious people are here &mdash; former Commissioner O'Kennedy, Commissioner Kinnock and the former Cathaoirleach, Tras Honan, who is in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned maritime peripherality, Commissioner Kinnock is probably aware of a crisis in relation to the Rosslare link with calls by that company for a subsidy.  There is built in disadvantage for this island given that French or German trucks can travel directly to their markets while Irish trucks are queueing up to board ferries in Dún Laoghaire or Rosslare. Commissioner Kinnock will have to address that problem.</P>
      <P>Another matter I raised with Professor Dooge, a distinguished former Minister for Foreign Affairs, related to the vision of Europe. Economic benefits will not retain the interest and idealism of the youth of this wider community. Professor Dooge said that he was not sure whether Europe had this vision.  Perhaps it is enlargement but I do not think so.  Europe is seen as a club that does not exert itself too much on behalf of the grievously disadvantaged, such as those in Zaire.  Senator Daly raised that point. Such a wealthy and powerful institution should be addressing these issues as a matter of priority.</P>

      <P>I regret that my earlier responses were so long as to have excluded Members from asking questions.  I hope, however, that there will be opportunities less formal than this for us to exchange views on future occasions.</P>
      <P>I want to correct what appears to be a misinterpretation.  I am sure the record will show what I said was that there will always be a place for public subsidies for air and other transport services that serve as straightforward social needs.  That includes services to remote island areas.  I did not mention Aer Lingus or any company or country by name.  That will continue to be a system that will need to be operated in a variety of places in the European Union.</P>
      <P>As far as the financing or support for mobile assets is concerned, I recognise the obvious and deep Irish concern about the problem.  The only areas that have comparable grounds for concern are those edging up towards the Arctic Circle in Finland and Sweden where distance is a huge inhibition for their commerce and people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we moved to the policy of supporting mobile assets, however strongly we attempted to be discerning and to differentiate in particular circumstances, we would be entering an area <Col N="128" /> where the sky truly is the limit.  I recognise that this is a matter of basic concern.  It was first put to me a long time ago, before I became a Commissioner, by Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  He said it was all very well for the European Union to support the development of motorways into southern Spain, which Ireland supported, but since transnational motorways to and from Ireland would have to run across the Irish Sea, comparable support would be needed for them. Put in those straight forward terms it is a difficult argument to rebut.</P>
    <P>The only basis on which the Union can afford to act is a complete refusal to support the purchase and maintenance of mobile assets because the implications of moving beyond that would be gigantic.  We have come close to doing it.  I have been active in trying to ensure that we have effective investment to provide support for essential equipment and skills to maximise efficiency of interconnected transport services. That is why a couple of weeks ago I put it to the Council, with their agreement, that we should expand our so-called project actions for combined transport to the maritime sector &mdash; one of the instances I had in mind was the Irish case &mdash; so that there will be access to funds to assist in the purchase and development of equipment that assists in the shore to ship and ship to shore transfer of goods.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that is the same as helping with the purchase and maintenance of a ferry but it is as near as we can go towards assisting the development of particular combined transport modes which will have significant application in parts of the Union that are dependent on sea traffic, which Ireland patently is.  If we step beyond that towards support for the purchase of mobile assets there are countless numbers of cases in which the same argument could be put &mdash; that in order to mitigate the effects of distance it would be fair to support the purchase of assets. Efficiency in the operation of communication and transport is the only way of reducing the disadvantages, some of which come from distance and some from congestion.</P>
    <P>The other question concerned the proposition we put for fair and efficient pricing.  Fundamental to the idea is that the full costs of transport, including those inflicted upon the whole of society in the form of congestion, pollution and accident costs, are borne by transport users and that the charge is levied on a heavily differentiated basis.  In that way a clean truck costs less than a dirty one and travel on an uncongested mode or route costs less than on a congested one.  The effect of the implementation of such a policy across the Union would be that while movement in congested areas would carry additional costs, because we are after fair and efficient pricing, movement in uncongested areas would cost relatively less.  We are a long way from getting that kind of idea implemented but the beneficiaries would be the people and businesses operating in congested areas which now bear the <Col N="129" /> major threat of external transport effects.  Also benefiting would be the people and businesses of more peripheral areas who now pay the same costs to put a wagon on the road as they would if they were in the overdeveloped centre of the Union.  That is neither fair nor efficient.</P>
    <P>Account should be taken of the relatively smaller impact made in terms of congestion, pollution, infrastructure costs and accidents as a consequence of operating in different areas. Hopefully, through those kinds of policies, some of the differences can be smoothed out and efficiency encouraged by the operation of Community policies.</P>
    <P>I will not go into detail of my view of the United Kingdom's position on monetary union.  I would simply say that whatever the pros and cons they are obviously serious.  My great friend, Cledwyn Hughes, from Anglesea, used to say there are pros and cons for, and pros and cons against.  This is one of those arguments.  I am an enthusiast for monetary union.  Countries that are deliberately not seeking participation in the so-called first wave must consider what life and the conduct of their economies will be like outside when, not if, a monetary union is formed.  This is a pressing question.</P>
    <P>I recommend an excellent book which has just been written on the implications of British policy so far as Ireland is concerned.  Many of the best answers to your questions are to be found within its covers, and if you have ever heard a politician dodging a question this is it.</P>

      <P>So far as the rule in the north-west is concerned, I am familiar with the proposal but not from Mr. Moss. Nevertheless, he is a nice man.  He knows that under Article 129(c) of the Treaty we can do nothing except on the nomination of the member state.  That is how it should be.  It is an effective safeguard on subsidiarity.  It would be foolish for someone like me to work out the traffic network of the Union.  It is right that we rely on local initiative and national nomination.</P>
      <P>On the question of supporting the development of a road through County Derry and into County Donegal connecting with the transport systems of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland we will be happy to judge any proposal on its merits. However, I first need to get a letter from Minister Moss.</P>
      <P>With regard to deregulation in ground handling, the impact in the short term can be to put pressure on jobs, resulting in losses.  This is not universally or necessarily the case.  In several instances, not least in the UK, it has meant that an initial loss of jobs was quickly recovered from and the net consequence of more efficient services in the context of an expanding air market &mdash; the Irish air market grew by a phenomenal 15 per cent last year and will continue to grow &mdash; is an increase in jobs because the services are more efficient and the companies operating them are more competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> I can see why those engaged in ground handling will respond with anxiety when asked to change practices and to restructure.  However, if it is done on a co-operative basis, which appears to be the case with regard to Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus ground handling, the outcome in a short time can be positive.  I hope this will be the case.</P>
    <P>I mentioned negative external costs.  None of us pay the full costs of the effect of our use of the transport system on the rest of society.  While we pay taxes, charges, revenues, etc., these do not even pay for the infrastructure.  This is true across the Union.  They do not pay for the major external costs of congestion, pollution and noise. The OECD estimates, and nobody has seriously quarrelled with it, that in a modern industrialised economy pollution inflicts a cost which is the equivalent of 1.5 per cent of GDP, noise inflicts a cost equivalent to 0.6 per cent of GDP while congestion inflicts a cost equivalent to 2 per cent. These three external costs amount to 250 billion ECUs across the EU.  That sum is what it costs every year.  It does not produce anything.  We must reduce these costs not only on grounds of economic and social sustainability and environmental protection but economic common sense.  One way to do this is to charge them to those who generate them, in other words, ourselves, so that we can be more efficient in our transport choices.</P>
    <P>A maritime conference is being convened under the Irish Presidency in Dublin next month and it will try to deal with whether maritime employment has a future in the EU.  Several of the points touched on by Senators are central to this.</P>
    <P>With regard to idealism, there is the EU humanitarian organisation.  We are the biggest donors to those attempting to relieve the agonies of Burundi, Rwanda and now Zaire.  We also have DG 8, external funds, the ACP and a host of effective activities in various parts of the world. They are an appeal to practicality as well as to idealism.  If this enterprise loses its appeal to spiritual values and idealism and simply relies upon its commercial values and competition we will fail in our task.  Europe has got to mean more than a Single Market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister is aware of the importance of the home help service in the various health board regions, particularly in relation to the aims of health and social gain outlined in the Department of Health's strategy document, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future.</i>  There is, as the Minister is aware, quite a divergence in the payments made to those who carry out the home help service, the amount of the budget and the extent of the scheme in the various health board areas.</P>
      <P>All health boards allocate a certain amount of money for the scheme but there is a great demand for it.  In my health board region, with which the Minister is very familiar, in the financial report for the third quarter of the year, which is the most recent one we received, the vast majority of the budget had already been spent. There might not be any finance to meet new cases in need of the service.</P>
      <P>I accept it is primarily a matter for the individual health boards and I have raised the issue with my health board.  However, it is also a national matter in so far as it would be desirable to have a more co-ordinated scheme throughout the country.  The home help service has both economic and social gains.  There is a growing number of elderly people in our communities and it is more cost effective if they can stay at home. The home help service is valuable in that regard. In addition, it is a better social solution for the vast majority of individuals involved.  Most elderly people would prefer to stay at home if they possibly could.  It is more costly to maintain people in nursing homes or other health board institutions than at home and it is not the desired choice of most people.</P>
      <P>The remuneration of those working in the home help service can vary from as little as £1.40 an hour to £4 an hour in parts of the Eastern Health Board area &mdash; there is not a set figure in that area.  The work clearly receives very low remuneration in some health board areas.  People who work in the service often put in more hours than those for which they are paid.  They develop a genuine rapport with those whom they look after and sometimes give their time without any remuneration.</P>
      <P>It is essential to look at the scheme at health board and Department level to ensure its advantages for the individuals concerned and the economy and that we get the best possible options for meeting individuals' needs.  Staying in their own homes with a home help, in addition to the other necessary services such as nursing, will prove to be the preferred option of many people. The home help service is greatly valued and under used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" /> Unfortunately, due to financial constraints some home helps find themselves without patients.  In my health board area the yearly allocation is £511,000 and because the budget is practically used up new cases are not being taken on.  Consequently, some home helps who have worked with the service are considering working privately.  It would be a shame to lose their services because the health board cannot afford to employ them.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have outlined, I would welcome the Minister taking whatever action he can at national level to ensure this valuable service can be continued and, more importantly, developed in accordance with the growing needs of elderly people, in particular, and the desirability of keeping those people in their own homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank Senator O'Sullivan for raising this matter.  As the Senator is aware, for many years the main focus on care of the elderly has been to enable older people to continue living in their own homes for as long as they wish and are able to do so.  It is recognised that the home help service contributes enormously to the maintenance and dignity of frail and dependent older people at home.</P>
      <P>The National Council for the Elderly recently published a report entitled <i>Home Help Services for Elderly People in Ireland.</i>  The research undertaken points to the strength and value of the home help services.  For example, the report finds that the number of home helps increased from just over 5,000 in 1978 to more than 10,500 in 1993.  The report also records that the satisfaction of clients with the home help service is overwhelming, while a further strength of the service is the speed and flexibility with which a person in need can be supplied with a home help. While it is acknowledged that the report also draws attention to problems with the home help service, we should not underplay the very real strengths and benefits of the service.</P>
      <P>Under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards may make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of persons who, but for the provision of such a service, would require to be maintained otherwise than at home.  The section empowers, without obliging, health boards to provide or support services such as home help, laundry and meals.</P>
      <P>Health boards are not limited in the categories of persons they can assist at home and may charge for the service.  However, the services are usually provided free or at a nominal charge.  The health boards consider individual cases on the basis of need and in the light of resources available to the scheme.  In practice, about half of the home helps and the vast majority of meals are provided by voluntary organisations with funding from health boards.  The remaining home helps are employed directly by health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance between voluntary and health board input to the home help service varies from health board to health board.  Home helps are predominantly part time, though a number of <Col N="133" /> full-time home helps and home help coordinators are employed by some boards. Voluntary involvement also strengthens the sense of neighbourly obligation towards the elderly and encourages the self-development of the home help.</P>
    <P>The underlying philosophy governing the operation of the home help scheme is that it is a community based good neighbour scheme which would attract people primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community services. Accordingly, the remuneration of volunteers does not come within the realm of conventional employment.  Volunteers who work as part-time home helps are paid a stipend or gratuity for the service they provide.  As operated in many areas, this is meant only as a contribution and is not intended to compensate fully for the task undertaken.  The service is essentially local client based.  The rate paid to part-time home helps employed throughout the country varies from place to place and is related to the particular requirements and type of task undertaken in each case.</P>
    <P>The issue of funding for the home help service has been raised on a number of occasions in the recent past.  My Department, in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards, has under consideration a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within health boards for its provision.  A discussion document submitted by the chief executive officer group forms the basis for this examination.</P>
    <P>Following these discussions, I decided to have an examination of the operation of the home help service carried out by an independent body which will advise on measures to ensure the equity and high quality of the service in respect of providers and recipients.  I am pleased to say that my Department has invited tenders for this review and it is expected that it should be completed in three to four months.</P>
    <P>I wish to add that in the recently published health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future,</i> the role and potential of the home help service in adding to social gain is acknowledged.  The strategy states that over the next four years priority will be given to strengthening the role of the general practitioner, public health nurse, home help and other primary care professionals in supporting older people and their carers who live at home.  I assure Senator O'Sullivan that I am committed to this aim.</P>

      <P>I started to make representations on behalf of the teachers, pupils and parents of Cloontuskert national school in January 1994.  While things have moved somewhat since then, the most important matter, the provision of funds for the new school, has not been addressed.</P>
      <P>The parents of children at Cloontuskert national school want me to draw attention to the deplorable conditions there.  The buildings, originally constructed as shop units in 1955, were not designed for use as a school and the Western Health Board and the INTO have condemned them in recent surveys.  The structure of the buildings, internally and externally, is deteriorating rapidly.  The children use external toilets, which are unsanitary, unhygienic and primitive, in all weathers conditions.  There are no facilities for hot or cold water inside or outside the school and the water tank is placed directly above the main power supply.  The surface of the yard is rough and uneven and likely to cause injury to the children.</P>
      <P>The interior of the school causes concern for the health and safety of the children.  Classrooms are undersized, inadequately heated by old storage heaters and the lighting is very poor; two classrooms share one light switch.  Cloakroom facilities are seriously lacking and floor surfaces consist of a hotch potch of various tiles which are uneven and extremely hazardous in wet conditions in particular.  Doors and windows are rotting, even disintegrating in places, and plaster is falling off the walls in some classrooms.  Large patches of damp are clearly visible.  Rodents, old fashioned desks and lack of facilities are among the many problems encountered daily in the school.</P>
      <P>The parents are very distressed by the conditions under which their children are being educated.  Funds should be provided immediately for alternative facilities so the children can be taught in safe and comfortable surroundings.  This is their constitutional right.  The position has not changed since February 1994 other than that the local people have moved a long way themselves. A site has been purchased and planning permission has been granted.  The local contribution was raised in full with great enthusiasm.</P>
      <P>The parents, teachers and pupils demand action from the Department of Education.  They feel it is unfair and unjust that their children are being educated in inadequate buildings which were not designed for a school.  They are not prepared to tolerate the position any longer and they want a definite commitment regarding the day and date on which the building project will commence.  I support them; they have a genuine case and there is a responsibility on the Department of Education to bring forward the necessary funds to provide this facility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">

      <P>I support the case made by Senator Finneran and join him in appealing to the Minister for a definite date for the commencement of work on the new national school at Cloontuskert, which has been approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> As Senator Finneran said, Cloontuskert is situated in the electoral area I represent on Roscommon County Council so I know the area very well.  The area came into existence as a Bord na Móna village.  The houses in the estate where the school is located were built originally by Bord na Móna for the board's employees in the Mountdillon works.  The estate has evolved into a beautiful village and this year it won the county award in the Tidy Towns competition, finishing ahead of Keadue which won the national award two years ago.  This indicates the great community spirit which obtains in Cloontuskert.</P>
    <P>The building which currently serves as the local school was designed and built originally as shop units to service the Bord na Móna houses; two houses adjoin the school building.  The need for a new school in Cloontuskert has been obvious and accepted for many years.  Existing buildings and facilities are extremely substandard and have been condemned by the Western Health Board, the INTO and the chief fire officer of Roscommon County Council.  The INTO representative who visited the school informed the staff that it was easily the worst school building he had ever inspected.</P>
    <P>The area of each of the classrooms is less than two thirds of the average sized classroom.  There are no sinks in classrooms and the heating system is completely inadequate because it is provided by old storage heaters and the ceilings are very high.  As Senator Finneran said, there is insufficient natural light in the classrooms.  There is no grassed play area attached to the school; there is only a small rough stoned clay area and this increases the risk of an accident.  There are outdoor toilets and there is no electricity, heat, light or hot water in any of them.  There are only two cubicles for almost 60 boys which is way below the required or the recommended provision which I understand is one cubicle for every 15 pupils.</P>
    <P>The Department has taken the view over the years that no money should be spent on updating or improving the old school as it would be a total waste of money, and I agree with that.  It came to the conclusion very early on that a new school was the only solution.  The continued existence of the old school is costing the Department because there is a fourth teacher in the school, a position which is not warranted by the numbers in the school but which has to be maintained because of the inadequate classroom facilities.  If the new school were provided there would be an immediate automatic saving to the Department of the salary of that fourth teacher.</P>
    <P>The parents have acquired a site for the new school at a cost of over £17,000.  They have raised in the region of £25,000 which is equal to the local contribution the Department has indicated will be required for the new school.  I was delighted <Col N="136" /> to support some of the fund raising activities of the very enthusiastic parents' committee who raised not alone the funds to purchase the site but also the £25,000 local contribution.</P>
    <P>Planning permission has been granted and, as Senator Finneran has pointed out, the parents are becoming increasingly annoyed and disillusioned that no progress has been made for some time now.  They demand to be informed of a definite date for the commencement of work on the new school and they are adamant that their children will not spend another winter after this one in the old school.  For the new school to be available to their children for next winter, work would need to commence in the very near future.  I appeal to the Minister to give very sympathetic consideration to the case Senator Finneran has made on behalf of the parents and pupils of Cloontuskert.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Education.  I thank the Senators for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to outline the Department of Education's current position regarding Cloontuskert national school, Lanesboro, County Roscommon.  At present the school has a staffing level of principal and three assistant teachers, one of whom holds a temporary concessionary post. The school's enrolment was 80 pupils on 30 September 1995.</P>
      <P>The existing building which is in poor condition contains four classrooms with detached toilets. The classrooms are undersized by present standards.  A building project at the school was included in the Department's 1995 capital building programme.  The inclusion of the project in the programme enables the project to progress through the architectural planning process.  The plans provide for a new three classroom school with appropriate ancillary accommodation. Planning permission for this project was received in September 1996.</P>
      <P>The current position in relation to the project at Cloontuskert school is that the Department's architectural staff are in the process of preparing the tender documentation.  In parallel with this, the Department will be inviting contractors and subcontractors to apply for inclusion on a pre-qualification tender list shortly.  When this documentation is complete, a decision will be taken on the timing of the tender and contract process in the light of available resources.  Every effort will be made by the Department to ensure the project is progressed at the earliest opportunity.</P>
