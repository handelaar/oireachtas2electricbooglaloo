      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Members will have learned of the death of Gerry L'Estrange, a former Member of this and the other House, which occurred at Easter time.  Gerry L'Estrange was a Member of this House from 1954 to 1965 and of Dáil Éireann from 1965 to 1987, 33 years of unbroken service in the Houses of Parliament, a formidable achievement. To know Gerry L'Estrange was to like him.  He had strong views and deep convictions, which he expressed strongly, vigorously and colourfully.  He said what he had to say, but once it was said that was that.  There was no malice or rancour in Gerry L'Estrange and he made lifelong friends on all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gerry L'Estrange was a great servant of the Fine Gael Party.  He first ran for <Col N="2" /> the Dáil as a member of Clann na Talmhain in the 1940s.  He later transferred his allegiance to Fine Gael.  Once transferred, that allegiance was total. He served under Dick Mulcahy, James Dillon, Liam Cosgrave, who paid him a warm and eloquent tribute at the funeral in Multyfarnham, and Garret FitzGerald.  To all he gave his total and enthusiastic loyalty.</P>
    <P>It was, however, much more than a passive loyalty.  Enthusiasm was the hallmark of Gerry's personality.  In addition, he had enormous energy and an enormous capacity to help people.  I never saw Gerry in bad humour or without that smile which usually meant that a practical joke or a good story was on the way.</P>
    <P>Gerry loved the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He was the most conscientious attender.  He knew the rules and the procedures inside out and was not too shy about bending them if it served <Col N="3" /> his purpose.  He could be, and was, irreverent.  He could mix it with the best and, like all good politicians, he could take it as well as give it.</P>
    <P>Gerry L'Estrange was a great public representative.  He loved and understood people.  He fought hard for them and if, in the process, he was expelled from the House or offended a Minister, official or some interest group, so be it. The rights of the ordinary people were more important to him and he was prepared to fight to the end for their vindication.</P>
    <P>Gerry L'Estrange was a wonderful, warm, friendly, humorous, mischievous person.  It was a privilege to have known him.  The Fine Gael Party and these Houses have good reason to remember him with respect and affection.  To his widow, Aileen, and his family I extend the sympathy of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I extend condolences to the family of Gerry L'Estrange.  Growing up, one always read of his efforts in the Dáil and the Seanad.  He was a dedicated and hard working public representative, a tremendous representative for County Westmeath.</P>
      <P>Gerry L'Estrange served in this House and in the Dáil for 33 years, a tremendous record.  He enjoyed the cut and thrust of politics.  One of the most important things said about Gerry was that all was forgotten when we left the House, which is as it should be.  To leave politics with no enemies is no mean feat.</P>
      <P>Again I express our condolences to his wife and family.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Independent group I add my words to the sentiments expressed by Senator Manning. Gerry L'Estrange was part of the personality of this House while he was a Member.  He was always available and committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall briefing, lobbying and talking to him on many occasions during campaigns in the 1980s.  He never gave an inch when his party was in Government. <Col N="4" /> He always left a meeting with a commitment to take up the matter discussed with the party or the House and return. For those of us who dealt with him at that level, before I was a Member of this House, he was somebody who did the business, came back straight from the shoulder, did what he said he would and in that way commanded respect.</P>
    <P>I last met him two years ago.  He was still interested in everything that was happening around the House, and wanted to know the latest gossip and discussions.  He was always part of what was going on.  He was available and accessible and a committed public representative who cared for those he represented. He also cared for the image of public representatives and of the Houses.  We extend our sympathy to the Fine Gael Party and to his family.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I extend my sympathy to the family of the late Gerry L'Estrange and to the Fine Gael Party.  He was a committed public representative.  His record of 33 years public service is worthy and one that would be very difficult to achieve today.  I did not know him personally but I had often heard of him and the fact that he was a great fighter, both for what he believed in and for his party.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I add my voice to the expressions of sympathy on the death of Gerry L'Estrange.  As others said, he was a vigorous and passionate debater both in this House and in the other House.  He held and expressed his views very strongly and he was much loved by everybody in both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reading tributes to him in the newspapers over the last week or two, I was taken by a number of examples of his wit.  There was one in particular which struck me.  When his party was in Government and was being attacked by Fianna Fáil on that old chestnut, the draining of the Shannon, he is reputed to have said back &ldquo;If you can suck as well as you can blow, the Shannon will <Col N="5" /> be drained by teatime.&rdquo;  I thought that was a good example of a quick witted Deputy who was able to stand up for his party in a clever way.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I join with the expressions of sympathy to his wife.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party, Democratic Left, I join in the tributes to the late Gerry L'Estrange.  You might ask what I knew about Gerry L'Estrange. In 1982 I was invited to Longford to speak on the hospital issue because we had a similar problem in Mallow in north Cork.  Gerry L'Estrange heard I was heading for Longford that evening and decided he would follow to hear what I had to say.  It was quite a good meeting and afterwards he said that if I was going back to Dublin he would give me a seat.  I was delighted.  The journey seemed very short.  From the discussion we had, as he related his exploits as a public representative, it does not surprise me that he had such a long innings in public life and that he was such a dedicated public representative.</P>

      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the late Gerry L'Estrange.  He represented the constituency of Longford-Westmeath and I had the honour of doing that myself after him.  I knew Gerry very well for many years.  He was a great athlete in his youth and, like all athletes, he was always on his toes.  He certainly was on his toes here, in the Dáil and as a Member of the European Parliament.  He kept everybody else on their toes as well, even the ushers.  He will be missed by many people.  He was a dedicated constituency worker.  He understood politics and he gave everything he had to his constituents, his party and the country.  May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to make representations to the Incorporated Law Society to continue to have the primary degree of law students considered when they apply for exemption for further law courses.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to give the reason Mulhuddart national school has been refused the services of a remedial teacher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1 and item 15, motion 30. There will be 20 minutes per speaker on Item 1 &mdash; statements on the White Paper on Foreign Policy.  This debate will not conclude today.  Item 15, motion 30, will be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Order of Business.  However, it is disappointing <Col N="7" /> that there is no legislative programme this week.  Approximately eight pages of legislation were promised a couple of weeks ago.  There is no legislation on the Dáil Order Paper either.  I hope the Leader is using his good offices to ensure that important legislation is brought forward sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>Before the recess I and many other Members made it clear that we would make this House available for a debate on crime and other important issues. Unfortunately, the gangland executions we spoke about before Easter are continuing in Dublin.  As I said, I am disappointed there is no legislative programme on the Order Paper this week. I hope the Leader will use his good offices with the Ministers and the Taoiseach to ensure that we have an opportunity to discuss legislation as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright, although I did not know he was going to raise this matter.  The lack of legislation is an embarrassment.  I am not saying this to criticise the Leader of the House but to criticise the Chief Whip's Office for its organisation of legislation and business.  We are waiting for three or four pieces of legislation from the Department of Education but we have not even seen the heads of Bills.  Outstanding legislation has been promised but there has been no movement in this regard.  Just because we are now in the final year before a certain election does not mean the House can do its business quietly without rocking any boats or creating problems.  There is no doubt that nature abhors a vacuum. The structure of this House means that it might become necessary to table a series of amendments to the Order of Business on a weekly basis in order to discuss other business, particularly if the Government does not do so.  I want to give the Leader a strong hand when discussing with the Government the need for a proper amount of business because <Col N="8" /> if the Government does not provide it, the Opposition will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright and Senator O'Toole.  The Minister for Health signed the health insurance regulations on 28 March and they will become law after 21 sitting days of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, they discriminate against the psychiatrically ill.  This issue was debated in the House last July and it was agreed that the Minister would discuss it with the people involved and with the EU to sort out this discrimination because it was not approved of by this House.  I was disappointed to learn that this discrimination still exists and I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to outline the reasons for his action.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister for Justice inform the House when a Bill will be introduced to deal with the antiquated and largely unworkable criminal provisions relating to insane people?  The need for such legislation was highlighted again this week by the latest chapter in the Gallagher case.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to the House to outline the efforts being made by the State agencies under his control to secure a buyer for Butlers Engineering Limited which has been in receivership for the past eight weeks?  The last 130 workers were made redundant last Friday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not allow today to pass without noting that it is the tenth anniversary of the huge explosion in Chernobyl.  The Government should ensure that efforts are made to clean up the antiquated plants in eastern Europe and Great Britain. Cleaning up the nuclear energy industry should be the priority at United Nations, EU and national levels.  On the tenth anniversary of Chernobyl we should not forget the millions of people who will suffer as a result of that explosion and the potential for further disruption in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> There was a disturbing news article yesterday regarding a young man in Galway who is reaching the age where his elderly parents can no longer look after him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good tradition in the House of understanding and co-operation in a common purpose regarding the expression of Members' concerns across a range of areas. Nobody has played a bigger part in this regard than the current Leader of the House, Senator Manning.  The Government is doing a grave disservice by undermining, not just the role of the Leader but the Seanad itself, at a time when many pressing issues need to be addressed.  We are all aware of the cynicism about politicians and the feeling that we are irrelevant.  Matters can be discussed on radio programmes and elsewhere but not where it counts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a large range of issues on the Order Paper, covering crime, drugs, health issues, the beef industry, the tourism industry and Northern Ireland. Although I have not discussed it with the Leader, I am sure of his views but for some reason best known to itself, the Government has decided to reject and repudiate the role of the Seanad.  It has decided not to allow the House to <Col N="10" /> address today any of the matters I mentioned. How will Members explain to young people that politicians are relevant?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>A question to the Leader on today's Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader convey to the Government our total and utter rejection of this cavalier approach to the Houses of the Oireachtas and particularly the Seanad?  We have not been burdened with work and we are ready to serve.  If this is to be the approach, we should be honest and say we have no function.  However, the Seanad has a function which it has discharged well.  I hope the Leader will convey to the Government our total repudiation of its action.</P>
      <P>A discussion will be held today on the White Paper on Foreign Policy.  We have waited a long time for this debate. What type of discussion will we have because, by the time we get to it we may be lucky to have two speakers from this party and the debate will be adjourned until the next day?  This is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I take up the point made by Senator O'Kennedy, but in a slightly different way.  I welcome this discussion on the White Paper on Foreign Policy, which I believe Senator O'Kennedy also welcomed.  I am pleased the Leader indicated that we would not finish the discussion today.  I am sure Senator O'Kennedy and other Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs would agree that this is important because there is a meeting of the bureau of the committee at 3.30 p.m. and at 4 p.m. and we will have a serious discussion with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burton, on chapters eight and nine of the White Paper, which concern human rights.  For people like myself and I am sure Senator Lanigan, Senator O'Kennedy and the other Members of the committee, it is more important for us to attend that meeting than to be present in the House.  If we did not have <Col N="11" /> the opportunity to come back to this in a week or two, some Members of the committee would be automatically precluded from taking part so I welcome this arrangement.</P>
      <P>We had a useful and valuable discussion on LUAS and the possibility of introducing an underground element. This question has become a matter of controversy in the other House, which I regret.  I would prefer if future traffic planning and the future of Dublin city did not become a political football.  That was not my intention in raising the matter. It is a key area for the capital city and I would like the Leader's advice in this regard.  Having raised this matter a few weeks ago, does that prevent this subject from being raised in any other fashion for six months or whatever?  I hope that is not the case but I remember a rule that if a subject is raised, it cannot be discussed again for six months.  I would like to return to this on the Adjournment or at another time.</P>
      <P>Is it the Leader's intention to entertain a discussion on the Goldenbridge orphanage affair?  Many people feel it is a subject which would be relevant for discussion in this House.  If the Leader is contemplating a discussion, I suggest that it be broadened.  From my experience, brutality and the ill-treatment of children was not the exclusive domain of nuns, Christian Brothers or the Roman Catholic Church.  I went to an upper class Protestant boarding school&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the amount of damage done to the children in that school was incalculable.  It was part of the ethos of that era and I would welcome it being exposed, but not in a sectarian way which seems to be happening at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Honan's call for the Minister for Health to come to the House or to provide an opportunity to discuss the health insurance regulations.  Psychiatric patients are being discriminated against and this is a serious matter.  All people seeking health cover and treatment should be treated equally.  It is unfortunate that the Minister has signed regulations which give varying degrees of support in terms of health insurance. Psychiatric patients have been singled out and will receive less cover than others in need treatment.  The House should have an opportunity to debate this issue.</P>
      <P>When we can debate the White Paper on mental health.  This is all the more urgent because of recent court cases.  The issue of care of the mentally ill has entered the public domain and is being debated outside this House.  Such matters should be debated in the Oireachtas because a White Paper on mental health is already in existence.  Members have been requesting a debate on this issue for nine months.  I ask the Leader to provide time on a specific date for such a debate.  The public debate on important current issues relating to this matter should be taking place in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, introduce legislation to prohibit IMRO from charging schools for the use of music?  This issue has been referred to in the past number of days and we are aware of the problems which exist.  There is need for legislation in this area.  I do not believe anyone would deny musical artists from collecting their fair share of royalties.  However, I do not believe it was ever their intention to charge primary schools for this particular service.  It is important to engage in a debate on this issue because those who collect such funds are paid commission and have no objection to travelling great distances to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" /> When my party was in Opposition two years ago I recall many days when legislation was not introduced in this House and no Ministers attended.  I remind the current Opposition Members that they were no different when their party was in Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House arrange for a debate on job creation?  When the Government was formed, its stated policy was to make it more attractive for people to work than to remain unemployed.  That has not happened and there is complete disillusionment among young students as a result.  They are given leaflets and offered six weeks work.  There is no concerted effort to inform young people about how they might obtain employment. The situation is one of complete disorganisation.  There are large numbers of officials in the Departments of Enterprise and Employment and Social Welfare who are trying to provide advice in a piecemeal manner.</P>
      <P>I ask that this House engage in an open and honest debate on this issue. We must recognise the plight of the thousands of young people who do not know whether to travel to America or England because they cannot gain employment in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is not very busy today.  Young people in Ireland expect more from the Oireachtas.  Their future is important to the nation.  I ask that there be a debate on this issue to give solid direction to school leavers.  I believe the Leader will have no difficulty in this regard because the collective views of Members will be of value to those who are concerned and confused at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's and Senator O'Toole's comments on the absence of business for this House.  I suggest that the time may have come to reconsider Standing Orders.  The Leader will be aware that there are a number of Private Members' Bills in the pipeline which could be debated when Government business is not forthcoming.  There are also other Private Members' Bills which could be placed before the House if the opportunity arose for an early debate.  The Leader might consider Standing Orders to discover if the House might deal with such matters.</P>
      <P>I also wish to draw the Leader's attention to the dispute in the public service which is creating hardship in relation to the payment of benefits and entitlements.  This is particularly relevant to farmers receiving grant aid, many of whom have not received their blue cards.  This is an escalating and serious problem and one we should discuss.</P>
      <P>Members will be alarmed by the recent report by Barnardos which indicated that more than 30,000 children live in poverty or are homeless in this country.  While there has, rightly, been public debate on events that took place 40 years ago, there is a crisis at present in relation to children and time should be made available to discuss the Barnardo's report here.  The Minister with responsibility for this area might indicate what he will do about the very serious crisis facing so many very young children because there appears to be very little Government action on this issue.</P>

      <P>I add my voice to that of Senator Farrelly when he referred to the position regarding copyright and ask the Leader of the House if we can have a discussion on it in the very near future, in view of requests made by IMRO for primary schools to pay fees.  Schools are hard pressed as it is and if the artists, writers and so on knew where the money was being demanded, I feel they would not want it.  We badly need a discussion on this matter.  Very shortly we <Col N="15" /> will not be able to open the windows of our cars when the radio is on in case we are liable to pay fees as public broadcasters.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the crisis in agriculture, especially in the beef sector. Where is the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry?  He failed dismally in discussions with the European Commission lately.  He could only get 5,500 tonnes of beef into intervention when we needed a lot more. Beef is selling at 92p per lb at present compared to £1.08 per lb last year. These prices will put up to 5,000 beef farmers out of business.  This is very serious.</P>
      <P>A new system of bovine disease eradication was introduced which I said was a disaster.  It will prove to be a disaster&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister for Justice saying in the other House yesterday that she intends bringing in legislation early next year to update 150 year old legislation dealing with those brought before the courts who are deemed to be psychiatrically ill. The legislation in the Department of Health which would be needed to complement that legislation is only 50 years old.  I hope, like Senator Finneran and Senator Honan, that there will not be a substantial delay before this legislation is brought forward.  The delay on the discussion of the White Paper on Mental Health is very serious for those working in this field.  My colleagues in forensic psychiatry are constantly brought before the courts and their opinions and actions challenged.  I ask the Leader of the House to convey some sense of urgency on this matter to the Minister for Health.  I was contacted again yesterday about a problem in this field.  While I realise I cannot discuss cases which are <i>sub judice</i>, serious cases are being brought forward and because of the lack of legislation in this area, my colleagues are being left in a serious predicament, as are psychiatric nurses. In this country constitutional challenges on their actions are almost indefensible.</P>

I understand the Minister is considering setting up a 30 megawatt biomass electricity power plant.  I would like to see processed offal being used as an additional power source for this plant.  Renderers <Col N="17" /> have an important role to play in this issue; they have a nationwide network. It would be helpful if a way of disposing of this offal, meat and bonemeal could be found.

      <P>My question, which I raised before, is in connection with the implementation of the law by the Garda Síochána in regard to the seizure of untaxed cars.  While I fully agree and admit that the Garda is within its rights in seizing untaxed cars &mdash; it is implementing legislation passed by this House and the Dáil &mdash; the law needs to be changed.  Two ladies made representations to me on this matter.  One of them was left stranded beside Connolly Station while the other was left in County Westmeath; they both come from County Offaly.  Both ladies were left in difficult situations.  There is a real danger that the person involved &mdash; a lady in most cases &mdash; could be injured, raped or maimed if left stranded in this way.  The way the law is framed is wrong and needs changing.</P>
      <P>Any Member of this House or any Minister of State who wishes to make representations on behalf of a citizen to any authority has a right to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I will first address the point made by Senator Wright, Senator O'Toole, Senator O'Kennedy and a number of others about the alleged dearth of legislation.  It has always been my policy as Leader of the House to have a mix of legislation and major issues discussed.  We sat more often in the past year than in the last ten years and we covered a wide range of issues. Many Senators will agree that when they made requests, I was able to accommodate them for the most part. We have been on course so far this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I circulated our programme for the next three weeks to the leaders of the Opposition parties.  Next week we will be discussing the Defence Implementation Report, which Senator Lanigan <Col N="18" /> has been requesting for some time.  We will also discuss the Refugee Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Leader circulate this information to parties or to groups?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It was circulated to groups.  Next week we will also conclude the Fianna Fáil Party's motion on tourism which we adjourned unprecedentedly to allow people, who had an interest but could not be here, to take part.</P>
      <P>On 7 May we will be dealing with the Justice motion which will provide plenty of time to discuss matters raised by Senator Wright.  The Finance Bill will be before the House that week and we will sit three days.  I hope the light rail Bill, which will be a Seanad Bill, will be introduced here the following week. The health debate, to which Senator Finneran referred, will take place on 16 May and I will discuss the format it might take with him later.  In addition, there are other pieces of legislation which we will take.</P>
      <P>That said, I welcome Opposition comments about the need for an even heavier workload for this House and I will do everything I can to accommodate Senators.  I would point out also that there is a problem which has not been addressed, that is, rather than legislation going through the new committee system in the other House more quickly, it is remaining longer on Committee Stage there.  This means sometimes there is a delay while we are waiting for legislation to come before this House, but I can promise colleagues a substantial load of legislation from now until the end of the session.  I look forward to their enthusiasm and desire for legislation being translated into the usual co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Honan raised a number of issues on the Order of Business.  Basically, the health insurance regulations would be best raised on the Adjournment. Likewise, I understand her concern for the situation in Portarlington, County Laois, with the closure of Butlers Engineering Limited but, again, an <Col N="19" /> Adjournment debate would be the speediest way to raise that matter with the Minister.</P>
    <P>A number of people addressed the question raised by Senator Honan on the need for legislation to deal with the possible release of Mr. Gallagher and the circumstances arising therefrom. The Taoiseach said in the Dáil yesterday that the relevant legislation would be ready by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised the question of Chernobyl.  If we could find time, I think it would be appropriate to at least spend an hour discussing that issue sometime in the near future and I will see if that can be done.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised a number of issues.  I would not propose to have a discussion on the Goldenbridge case <i>per se</i>, but if it could be broadened out, I think it would be an appropriate topic. If the Senator puts down a motion, I would be willing to entertain it and see whether time could be made available.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly raise the question of IMRO.  I think we would all agree with the Minister who said this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that this is an issue which should be capable of resolution in a way favourable to the schools.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly raised the question of the public service, an issue which is being addressed at present.  I should remind him that item 11 on the Order Paper can be resumed at any moment which allows a discussion on the wider aspects of child care and problems arising from it.</P>
    <P>Senator Rory Kiely raised the crisis in agriculture.  I am sure all Members would join me in congratulating the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry on the vigorous approach he has taken in dealing with the crisis which is not of our making, which was caused in another jurisdiction, and where it is absolutely essential that the sort of unity we saw in the House in the early stages is continued in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with Senator Henry's question on legislation.  I will refer <Col N="20" /> Senator Townsend's views on energy to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Enright on the issue he raised, and especially on the publication of details of the case which should certainly have been confidential. Whoever released that information did no service to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <Title>White Paper on Foreign Policy: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Mitchell) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Mitchell)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak in the Seanad on the White Paper on Foreign Policy.  One of the Government's primary objectives in publishing the White Paper was to encourage and stimulate a process of discussion and reflection on our foreign policy and the views of the Members of the Seanad will be an important contribution to that process.</P>
      <P>I have been encouraged by the reactions to the White Paper since its publication. While there are clear differences of view in certain areas and I am happy to debate those differences, there is a general consensus that the publication of the White Paper was an important and constructive undertaking and that it gives greater coherence and clarity to our foreign policy than any previous document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper also aims to speak directly to the public to explain the policies and positions adopted in its name in the field of international relations.  Our foreign policy is ultimately a reflection of the values and principles of the Irish people.  In order to foster this sense of public ownership, copies of the White Paper have been distributed widely to educational institutions, libraries, local authorities and the media.  The Government has also given a commitment in the White Paper to organise further seminars on aspects of foreign policy so as to carry forward the process of public <Col N="21" /> consultation which was such a successful feature of the preparations for the White Paper.</P>
    <P>A central element of the White Paper is the chapter on the European Union and the new Europe.  As the White Paper points out our membership of the EU and our participation in the process of European integration have been crucial to Ireland's development.  Chapter 3 of the White Paper also demonstrates the breadth of issues affecting the lives of every person in Ireland encompassed by our membership of the EU.  There is hardly any area of Government activity that does not have a European dimension.</P>
    <P>As the White Paper demonstrates, at the same time as our GDP has grown closer to the EU average our membership of the EU has offered us an opportunity to influence decisions on a larger scale.  After 23 years of membership it can be said that Ireland has sought to engage constructively in the process of European integration.  It is fair to say our experience within the EU has been very largely positive.</P>
    <P>If foreign policy is a statement of the kind of people we are, our membership of the EU forms a large part of that statement.  I do not propose to dwell on this issue on this occasion but, on examining this chapter, Senators will keep in mind the varied dimensions of our membership of the EU.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also considers the link between foreign policy and foreign trade.  This is examined in chapter 11 of the White Paper.  A small country such as ours, which has an open economy depends for all its well being on a stable and peaceful international environment, where major investors are sufficiently confident to commit themselves to projects overseas and where exporting firms can develop a long-term relationship with their customers abroad.</P>
    <P>Against this background, we have been developing relations bilaterally with countries with which Ireland can hope to do business.  By the end of 1995 we had established diplomatic relations with 93 states, including the 38 in which <Col N="22" /> we have resident embassies.  The promotion of trade and investment in conjunction with the relevant State agencies is a major obligation of our overseas missions.  The recent crisis in the beef industry illustrates the extent of our dependence on foreign markets and the importance of our relations with other governments.  In countries which import large quantities of beef and cattle from Ireland, especially countries outside Europe, Irish embassies were able to use their established channels of communication to assist this vital area of our trade.  I am glad to be able to assure the Seanad that following prompt and energetic action of this kind, in close co-operation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and An Bord Bia, the prospects for Irish beef now look much more encouraging than they did a month ago.</P>
    <P>The environment in which Ireland's foreign policy is formulated has been radically transformed by the ending of the Cold War.  The post-Cold War environment presents numerous challenges to the security of Europe and the world.  The threat of global nuclear destruction may have receded but new risks of nuclear proliferation have appeared.  We have seen war and ethnic cleansing return to the heart of Europe, genocide in Rwanda and a number of open and bloody conflicts in parts of the former Soviet Union.  The risks to the environment, the rise of international crime, the scourge of drugs, these and many other problems are cited by governments throughout the world as issues that cannot be addressed by nations acting individually.  They can only be addressed in a meaningful way by co-operative action.  The issue of security must be looked at in its broadest sense.</P>
    <P>Chapter 4 of the White Paper identifies the central elements of Ireland's security policy over many years, including our policy of military neutrality embodied by non-participation in military alliances.  Our approach to the formulation and expression of our security policy will continue to be in <Col N="23" /> harmony with our outlook and traditions and, at the same time, responsive to the new and still evolving challenges that face us in promoting peace, security and progress at European and global levels.</P>
    <P>The White Paper acknowledges that the majority of Irish people have always cherished Ireland's military neutrality and that this policy has served Ireland well.  The Government will not propose that Ireland should seek membership of NATO or full membership of the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>At the regional level, we will seek to strengthen the OSCE as a permanent organisation for European security co-operation and to further develop its capacity for preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping.  The OSCE has endorsed the pursuit of systematic and practical co-operation between European and other regional and transatlantic organisations that share its values and objectives.  Both NATO and the Western European Union have gone beyond their core functions as defence alliances and announced their willingness to contribute to conflict prevention and crisis management tasks at the request of the UN and the OSCE. This reflects a developing feature of the new security landscape &mdash; the concept of mutually reinforcing co-operation between these institutions.</P>
    <P>There is an emerging consensus that the EU should be better equipped to make a contribution internationally in such areas as peacekeeping and humanitarian operations &mdash; the so-called Petersberg tasks identified by the Western European Union.  It is envisaged that Western European Union involvement in such operations would be at the request of the UN, the OSCE or the EU under its common foreign and security policy.  The White Paper states that it is desirable and right that Ireland should be prepared to make a contribution in areas where it has proven capacity and experience.  Our other EU partners which have remained outside military alliances &mdash; Austria, Finland and Sweden &mdash; are, like us, observers at the <Col N="24" /> Western European Union.  They have also shown interest in Western European Union peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks.  The Government has decided to discuss with the Western European Union the possibility of Ireland taking part, on a case by case basis, in humanitarian, rescue and peacekeeping tasks under the Petersberg Declaration and to consider such changes as may be necessary in the Defence Acts and Garda Síochána Acts to enable Ireland's Defence Forces and Garda to take part in such operations.</P>
    <P>The intergovernmental Conference which began recently in Turin is expected to consider how the CFSP provisions, including through the EU-WEU relationship and the handling of the Petersberg tasks in the framework of that relationship, can best be developed to enhance the EU's contribution to European and global peace and security.  This is the challenge that faces all members of the EU, neutral or allied.</P>
    <P>The White Paper restates the Government's commitment that the outcome of any future negotiation that would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy would be put to the people in referenda, thus ensuring that Ireland's policy of military neutrality will remain unchanged unless the people themselves decide otherwise.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace &mdash; PFP &mdash; has already attracted much attention.  I regret that some of it has been misinformed. I invite all Senators to read the White Paper closely.  The White Paper sets out the reasons Ireland should consider participating in this co-operative initiative which the vast majority of OSCE member states have already joined.  PFP has already assumed an important role in European security co-operation, particularly in such areas as training for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, environmental protection and drugs interdiction.</P>
    <P>PFP does not involve membership of NATO, the assumption of any alliance commitments or any commitment to future membership of NATO.  Austria, Finland, Sweden and Malta have all <Col N="25" /> joined on this basis.  Participation in PFP in no sense impinges on our policy of military neutrality.  PFP is a flexible arrangement which allows each participating state to focus on its own interests in the security area: ours are those of peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, and environmental and drugs issues.  It is incorrect and misleading to suggest that PFP is somehow a backdoor for Irish entry into NATO.  The Government has decided that a final decision on participation should be taken on the basis of further consultations, including consultations with the relevant Oireachtas Committees, and that such a decision should be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Efforts by the European Union and the international community to promote peace and stability in Europe have been significantly influenced by the experience of the conflict in former Yugoslavia. The crisis in former Yugoslavia graphically illustrates the potential for ethnic conflict and territorial disputes which are far beyond the capacity of individual states to handle effectively.</P>
    <P>In recent months we have seen dramatic developments in the peace process there through the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement.  The agreement lays the foundation for lasting peace and stability in the region, and in Bosnia and Herzegovina in particular. The agreement, and the separate agreement on Eastern Slavonia, give rise to optimism that four years of conflict and suffering have given way to an era of hope and reconciliation.</P>
    <P>However, the international community must now meet the new challenges generated by this process.  Recent events have shown that the peace in former Yugoslavia is a fragile one; the international community must maintain its concerted efforts patiently and persistently to sustain and develop it.  This issue is one of the greatest challenges facing the EU's common foreign policy now, and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future and during Ireland's EU Presidency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> Free and fair elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina are a cornerstone of the peace process.  The Dayton Agreement stipulates they should be held in September at the latest.  It is important that that timetable is respected.  A major part of the burden of preparing for and monitoring these elections falls to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  Ireland is making a number of personnel available to the OSCE mission.  The OSCE will also be assisted in this task by the European Community Monitor Mission.  During Ireland's EU Presidency, we will have the leadership of the ECMM and will be providing 80 staff.</P>
    <P>Another major challenge for the European Union, and Ireland as next Presidency, will be to provide continued support for the peace process in the Middle East.  The White Paper reiterates Ireland's support for the Middle East peace process which aims to resolve a conflict which has been one of the greatest challenges to regional and world peace for the past half century. Unfortunately, even in recent days, we have seen the awful consequences of that continued conflict in Lebanon.  The tragedy of Lebanon reinforces the obligation on the entire international community to redouble its efforts to work for a just and lasting peace settlement to the Middle East conflict.</P>
    <P>The Government has been intensely involved in efforts to bring about an end to the current violence in Lebanon and northern Israel and to ensure the safety of the Irish UNIFIL battalion.  This involvement stems, on the one hand, from our involvement in the EU troika and, on the other, from our role as a UNIFIL troop contributor.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste strongly condemned the attack on the UNIFIL base in Qana on 18 April and the Government has repeatedly made clear its concerns about attacks on civilians and UNIFIL personnel in south Lebanon.</P>
    <P>We have been in constant contact with the Irish UNIFIL contingent and <Col N="27" /> have been closely monitoring the situation in south Lebanon.  We have also monitored and contributed to diplomatic initiatives which have aimed to end the current crisis.  I made a substantial contribution to the debate on the situation by EU Foreign Ministers on Monday in Luxembourg and ensured that prominence was given to the safety of Lebanese civilians and UNIFIL personnel in the declaration issued by the Union on that day.</P>
    <P>The priority now is to convince all parties in the conflict in Lebanon to contribute to an immediate halt to hostilities and acts of violence so that peace negotiations can resume.  We should not forget the progress made in negotiations between Israel and Jordan and between Israel and the Palestinians.  It is imperative that the parties build on this progress and move forward to establish a just and durable settlement throughout the Union.  We recognise the sacrifices made by all sides in the peace process and the difficult negotiations that lie ahead.  The Government will continue to do everything possible, in the context of our EU Presidency and through all other available channels, to bring the current violence to an end and to support and consolidate the Middle East peace process.</P>
    <P>While the challenges which we must address grow ever more complex, the fundamental principles underlying Ireland's foreign policy remain the foundation on which policy responses are elaborated.  One of the essential principles upon which we have sought to base our foreign policy is the promotion of respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>A human rights unit has been established in the Department of Foreign Affairs to co-ordinate the Irish approach on human rights issues including, where necessary, other relevant Government Departments.  Promotion of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights are major policy objectives of the common foreign and security policy under the Maastricht Treaty.  We will seek to ensure that our <Col N="28" /> concerns on human rights are given full expression in the common foreign and security policy of the European Union. We will be intensifying our efforts at the United Nations to achieve agreement on a draft statute for a permanent international criminal court.</P>
    <P>In its chapter on development co-operation, the White Paper emphasises the interconnection between the economic and social well being of all nations and the maintenance of international peace and security.  Irish aid and development co-operation are practical expressions of Ireland's foreign policy commitment to peace and justice in the world.  We have long known, both intuitively and from mounting empirical evidence, that lack of development is a fundamental cause of conflict.  Today, the extent of that connection is a shocking but easily observed reality.  While conflict is not confined to any one region, conflicts are more likely to occur in developing countries.</P>
    <P>As stated in the White Paper, this situation poses new challenges for donor countries.  New approaches must be identified and gaps in existing responses bridged.  The White Paper unequivocally sets out the Government's commitment to the prevention and resolution of violent conflict through peaceful means.  Conflict prevention measures include support for the institution of civil society and the promotion of democracy and human rights.</P>
    <P>These measures will, of course, continue to be reinforced by Irish aid development policies which have been moulded and adapted over the years in response to the new realities of international conflict, poverty and exclusion. In that context the White Paper commits Irish aid &mdash; which this year amounts to a record £106 million &mdash; to addressing poverty by focusing in our bilateral programmes on the basic needs of poor people: primary health care, basic education, safe water supply and sanitation and income generating opportunities.  It also contains a strong emphasis on capacity building to ensure <Col N="29" /> that, wherever possible, development activities can be contained and expanded by the relevant authorities and the communities in partner countries. The capacity building efforts of Irish aid will be increasingly concentrated at local and community level and focused on the basic needs sectors.</P>
    <P>Irish aid will continue to concentrate its resources on sub-Saharan Africa.  At the same time, however, we will endeavour to extend the geographical reach of Irish aid through several mechanisms. At the bilateral level, we are committed to a programme of direct bilateral support for development projects in other developing countries, co-operation with non-governmental organisations and the provision of technical assistance.  At the multilateral level we will maintain our support for the activities of international development organisations. This involves our contribution, through the European Development Fund, to the aid programmes of the EU and our contributions to the UN development agencies.</P>
    <P>One area of the White Paper which has perhaps received less public attention than it deserves is the chapter on the Irish abroad.  The tens of millions of people throughout the world of Irish descent are an asset which we tend to take for granted but whose importance should not be underestimated.  Many of them assist the Government, directly or indirectly, in the pursuit of our national objectives, for example, in the political sphere by supporting the Government's efforts to achieve a lasting peace and reconciliation on this island and in the economic field by helping investment, exports and tourism.</P>
    <P>That there are so many people of Irish descent abroad is a consequence of emigration which has been a feature of Irish life for generations.  The Government objective is to keep emigration to a minimum by promoting economic growth and job creation so that as many of our people as wish can remain in Ireland.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of the Government's policy regarding emigrants, as set <Col N="30" /> out in the Government's programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, is to make provision for the election of three Members of Seanad Éireann by emigrants.  The House has recently debated this issue. Its views will perform a very important contribution to the consultation process which is under way.</P>
    <P>In a statement of this length it is not possible to cover every subject in the White Paper.  I hope, nevertheless, that Senators will be wide ranging in their comments and that they will give the other areas of the White Paper on which I have not touched the attention they deserve.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, there are differences of view on certain areas of the White Paper and I respect these differences. It is important that we discuss the issues openly and sincerely.  Ultimately, what we are discussing in the foreign policy field is our common future.  The White Paper sets out the Government's vision of where Ireland's place in the world should be and how we should go about taking that place.</P>
    <P>If there is a common thread running through all areas of the White Paper it is the inevitability of change in the international system.  The world will not stand still as it moves into the next millennium and we cannot hope to defend our interests and make the best use of the opportunities arising unless we are prepared to adapt our policies and approaches to the changing circumstances. As the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs remarked in a statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs last week, this does not mean abandoning traditional principles or values.  On the contrary, by spelling out these principles and values in the White Paper, we will more easily be able to ensure that our future policies conform to them.</P>
    <P>I am honoured to open this debate and to participate in the opportunity by the Government to hear the views of Senators so that we can reflect on them and ensure we approach the new millennium preparing a vision for Ireland's foreign policy for the next century.</P>

      <P>1.  Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.</P>
      <P>2.  Ireland affirms its adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination.</P>
      <P>3.  Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States.</P>
      <P>If people from Ireland or any other country read this Article and abided by the principles set down in it, many world conflicts would not have escalated and the world would not be in such a state of confusion.</P>
      <P>In the past, foreign policy was of little concern to the public.  It was concerned with our role in the UN and how we voted there on specific issues.  However, following our entry to the EU and because of our involvement in peace keeping roles abroad and the inter-relationship between problems in Ireland and in other countries &mdash; the internationalisation of drugs and crime &mdash; matters have changed.  For example, there is no doubt that the rise in crime in this country has an international basis and must, therefore, be addressed in our foreign policy documents.</P>
      <P>There is much in the White Paper with which people will agree but there are also points of disagreement.  There are disturbing elements in it suggesting change.  The Minister mentioned the Partnership for Peace.  The problem as to whether this is a backdoor into membership of NATO must be resolved. Since the heads of the Partnership for Peace are also NATO heads, it must be assumed that the organisation is basically NATO driven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> What are the foreign affairs concerns of people in Ireland?  The situation in the Lebanon is of major concern.  In addition, over the past number of months the issue of human rights has been taken up.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about a foreign policy and our involvement in Europe, we must see how we can solve some of the problems facing us as a member of the European Community.  Unemployment is one area that the European Union has not been able to tackle with the concern it deserves.  Somebody said to me recently that the most successful industry in Europe has been the production of unemployment.  It is stated that in Ireland more people than ever are employed.  However, we are creating employment for a certain group of people.  The European Union has failed utterly in its efforts to get long-term unemployed people back into the workforce.</P>
    <P>We are supporting the long-term unemployed in every way possible from a social point of view but we have not addressed the question of getting them back into employment.  It looks as if the European Union has written off people who are over 40 and have been unemployed for over 18 months.  They are trying to increase the support services for these people and leave them on the shelves while putting their efforts into creating jobs for the younger, more mobile people who come on to the jobs market.</P>
    <P>A large number of Irish people have come back from serving with APSO or from serving on a voluntary basis abroad.  They have seen real poverty and the lack of effort the world is making to solve that real poverty.  We have relative poverty in Ireland, but the poverty in sub-Sahara Africa, certain parts of Asia and South America could not be equated with what is considered to be poverty in Ireland.  We have the sight and sound of poverty in the media <i>ad nauseam</i>, but the day a third sense, that of smell, can be introduced, people might begin to address the problems of <Col N="33" /> deprivation and real poverty in the world.</P>
    <P>One of my colleagues, who is a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, will deal with the European aspects of the document.  As I said on the Order of Business, our foreign policy should include a very strong statement on the nuclear industry.  This industry has a major impact on us and the other people of the world.  We can look at what happened in Chernobyl ten years ago.  We should never again allow an industry, which has such negative effects on the human population of the world and our ecology, get into such a state again.  It is not only Chernobyl about which we must worry.  The European Union must examine the ageing and out of date nuclear industry in Great Britain.  We keep shouting about this and it can become emotive and a political football at times.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Irish nation, the White Paper on Foreign Policy should include a strong anti-nuclear policy.  If the same energy was put into the destruction and elimination of the nuclear industry as was put into bringing it into being, we could resolve the problems associated with it.  I visited Scotland recently and it is quite noticeable that many of the trees in Scotland are affected very badly by acid rain.  It is surmised that the acid rain is as a result of Chernobyl and not just the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; acid rain we have had throughout Europe over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>Ireland's place in the world has been enhanced to a large degree by our bilateral, rather than multilateral arrangements. There is no doubt that the work of NGOs is not recognised as strongly as it should be.  Countries in Africa and Asia have had the benefit of our NGOs, which are working hand in hand with those living in the area to solve problems at a local level.  The people with whom they are working see them as Irish NGOs.  In many countries, Ireland was mistaken for Holland or thought to be attached to Britain, but the NGOs have brought an awareness of Ireland to these countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> The work of the NGOs illustrates the value of aid on a one to one basis rather than putting it into the pool of the WHO, the World Bank, the United Nations or the EU.  If one were to give a pound to an NGO, generally speaking in Ireland about 99p of it will go to the support for which it is intended.  There is a support industry in the United Nations which becomes a sector in society between the well off and the very well off.  If one goes to countries, which are very poor for many reasons, one finds this United Nations aid society which in many cases does not help the people to whom it is offered, but it is very valuable for those who work in it. The NGOs must be supported.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the White Paper states that accountability in our overseas development aid programme will be of major importance.  In the past we did not examine the end results of the moneys contributed.  Some £106 million has been contributed this year &mdash; hopefully that will increase next year &mdash; and it will be accounted for.</P>
    <P>Do we look at the results of such programmes when monitoring spending? Many programmes have been a waste of time.  It is inevitable that there will be dropouts and failures in some of the countries to which aid is sent.  However, that is no reason to stop sending aid to them.  There must be accountability to ascertain why certain projects failed and others succeeded.  The success rate is higher if there has been a hands on approach through the NGOs rather than through multilateral operations.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone would consider it unusual for me to discuss the negotiations which are taking place this week in the Middle East on the situation in Lebanon and northern Israel.  Mr. Eoghan Harris of <i>The Sunday Times</i> thinks I am out of touch with the situation in Lebanon.  However, I am probably more in touch than he is with the people who live and work there and who are not members of the Hizbullah or any other organisation.  Some of these people are Irish, American and <Col N="35" /> English.  I tabled a motion at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs last week condemning the Israelis for their unprovoked attacks on the civilian population of south Lebanon.  I was then told I was a spokesperson for the Hizbullah.  Mr. Eoghan Harris and other journalists did not read the motion because it also asked the Hizbullah to stop its attacks on Israel and it asked the Israelis to stop their attacks on Lebanon.  However, that did not happen.</P>
    <P>In 1993 at the United Nations there was an agreement between the Hizbullah and various other factions that it was legitimate for the Hizbullah to attack an occupying power, the Israelis, in south Lebanon.  I am not sure where that stands now.  If negotiations succeed over the next few days, we hope that resolution 425 of the United Nations, which states that the Israelis should withdraw, will be implemented.  The European Union should help to broker a peace in that area.  We are more concerned than many other people about this situation. The French have become involved on a bilateral basis because there are historical links between them and the Lebanese. However, the EU should try to stop the conflict, which is claiming the lives of the south Lebanese who have no connection with the war.</P>
    <P>Mr. Warren Christopher is trying to negotiate with President Assad of Syria and people wonder why he is not able to broker a peace in the short term.  We hope there will be peace.  The United States is seen as the arbiter of the Israelis' foreign policy in the same way that President Assad is the arbiter of what happens in Lebanon.  We must ensure that the EU plays a major role particularly in that area and that we do not try to broker a peace, as the French have done, because of past or future self interest.</P>
    <P>I had a postcard from Beirut two days ago which described the situation there as horrific.  The schools are filled with refugees and the food is running out.  I am glad the United Nations is sending 30,000 tons of food to Beirut.  This highlights <Col N="36" /> the scale of the problem.  ESB International had just finished working on an electricity transformer to give people electricity 24 hours a day when the Israelis blew it up last Tuesday.  That is not attacking the Hizbullah but the people of Beirut.  We must realise that a number of conflicts will not be resolved on a bilateral basis.  I ask the EU to become more involved that it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>An international criminal court was mentioned to deal with criminal conduct in various areas of conflict.  An international commission on war crimes was set up to deal with what happened in Rwanda.  Although the Government said it would send people to that commission, no lawyer has yet left Ireland to serve on it.  There are thousands of people in jails in Rwanda and although some are guilty of war crimes, others are not.  If we give commitments to international bodies, we should stick by them.</P>
    <P>I hope the debate on this matter continues because it covers many areas of concern to us, such as employment, human rights and peacekeeping.  It does not impact on what happens outside our shores.  The White Paper on Foreign Policy not only gives us the opportunity to discuss where we are going, but it also gives the people the chance to comment on it.  It is a good discussion document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Tanáiste for introducing the White Paper on Foreign Policy, <i>Challenges and Opportunities Abroad.</i>  It is the first White Paper on Foreign Policy to be published in this country.  It sets out our approach to other countries and it tries to formulate a policy on different areas. It is long overdue.  The Tanáiste, the two Ministers of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell and Deputy Burton, the staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the diplomatic service deserve our thanks and congratulations for their work to date.  It is a comprehensive document which should be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and those involved in the preparation of this document are <Col N="37" /> anxious that the people and Irish people overseas would also have an input into our foreign policy.  Part of the aim of the White Paper is to encourage people who may not have considered helping to formulate policy up to now, to consider such an approach.  This is most important.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the overseas development aid subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. Ireland's approach to overseas development aid has been positive and constructive. The Irish aid programme was incepted in 1974 and, as the White Paper points out, virtually every family has had an involvement with Ireland's overall aid effort.  In every locality somebody has had an interest or involvement in some way, perhaps through relatives, with work in developing countries.</P>
    <P>Since 1982, Ireland has spent £612 million on official development assistance and almost £106 million will be spent this year, the highest ever Irish contribution to the developing world.  Ireland is making a special effort to try to reach our ultimate aim of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  I do not know whether that figure will be achieved but we should make a genuine effort to reach that target.  It is in everybody's interest to do so.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my concern, and that of most people, about the continuing huge debt crisis which is causing such horrific problems in developing countries. Many emerging countries, particularly in Africa, are crippled by overhanging debts.  Ireland is a small country with a national debt.  If there is a surplus and the Government tries to reduce the debt by withholding tax concessions, it is highly unpopular with the electorate. This is understandable, but Ireland's democracy is strong &mdash; it goes back to the foundation of the State, and most countries in Europe have equally strong systems.  However, no country in Europe has the overhanging debt crisis facing some African countries.  If the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank continue to seek the repayment of these loans, the small chance of <Col N="38" /> democracy emerging in these countries will be wiped out, existing democracies will be crippled and eventually suffocated and tyrannical governments will take over.  This is not good enough: this issue must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank took place in recent days.  They considered a joint proposal to tackle the problems of severely indebted low income countries.  However, we should be clear about what precisely was on the agenda of those meetings.  There was no proposal to wipe out some of the debts or reduce them considerably but rather to restructure the loans.  However, refinancing the loans is not desirable at present and the choice of one of two options is urgently required.</P>
    <P>The first option is a considerable write off of the debts due, while the second &mdash; which is a resolution of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs &mdash; is that the IMF sells part of its gold reserves for debt cancellation.  This might seem highly unusual to some people but it received the backing of a number of governments.  However, the strong governments of France and Germany opposed the proposal.  It is essential that this matter is examined because if it is not, there will be anarchy in a number of African countries.  It is essential that the debts are renegotiated and, when this is done in terms of the provision of finance, that an effort is made to assist and target the areas and people most in need and provide them with the essentials for living.</P>
    <P>The accumulation of debts has restricted the freedom for new economic initiatives in those countries.  We know the way it has worked.  I visited a number of these countries and saw the conditions in which these people live.  I was horrified at what humans could do to fellow humans.  I visited Africa in the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s and I regret to say that the situation there appears to be worsening rather than improving.  The level of poverty is emotionally upsetting and alarming, particularly when one considers how <Col N="39" /> little is being done about it.  Europe and some of the developed countries should consider, even on the basis of selfish motives, that if African countries and the other nations were assisted now, they might be of benefit to us in the future.  However, if the current situation continues and organisations continue to call in debts, problems will be caused for everybody in the future.  Justice and equity must be adhered to and these debts must be examined in a new light.</P>
    <P>The White Paper mentions the need for a permanent international criminal court; the Minister also mentioned this point today.  President Robinson has been a strong advocate of such a court for many years.  She is right when she talks about the need for such a criminal court given the level of crime in a number of countries, particularly Rwanda where genocide has been freely practised. The perpetrators of these crimes must be brought before a court and tried.  The tribunal has been slow to bring indictments against the people it knows committed these crimes and Rwanda has a poor human rights record.  This matter must be examined and Ireland should strongly support the concept of an international criminal court.  It is essential that we do so and are seen to be actively involved in it.</P>
    <P>In the introduction to the White Paper the Minister for Foreign Affairs refers to Northern Ireland and the fact that no section deals with it or Anglo-Irish relations.  I believe that approach is correct.  He states:</P>
    <P>At the time of writing, the situation brought about by the cease-fires with all its challenges and opportunities, is gravely imperilled.  The golden opportunity to build a new political order on the island and to improve the material well-being of all Irish people, North and South, is in danger of being lost due to a resumption of violence. It is the absolute resolve of the Government to pursue every avenue through which peace might be restored and to move the peace process <Col N="40" /> steadily towards the goal of all-Party negotiations.</P>
    <P>In the context of this White Paper, however, I do think it is appropriate to say two things about Northern Ireland.  Since 1969, the engagement of our diplomatic resources in all aspects of this issue has been pronounced and intensive.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that action taken by many public servants has been of benefit to the people and the nation.</P>
    <P>Since 1969 there has been all party agreement on our approach to Northern Ireland and party leaders have been thoughtful and generous to each another in their statements.  I hope that approach will continue.  No party has sought to gain political advantage over another in dealing with Northern Ireland and I hope this common-sense approach will prevail.  I am worried by remarks made last weekend by the Leader of the Opposition.  We must be careful and prudent in our thoughts and when expressing our views.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs mentioned 1969, which I remember well.  We were fortunate in the person we had as Taoiseach at that time &mdash; Mr. Jack Lynch.  We were in Opposition and the then Taoiseach and Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, had a great relationship.  They were two people of like mind who worked together and saw the seriousness of the situation and the turmoil which could have been caused throughout the country. However, because of their common-sense approach that was prevented. Even today we must be careful about what we say and do and we must be generous to each another.</P>
    <P>The document also refers to former Yugoslavia, where I holidayed in 1972. It was one of the most magnificent countries a person could visit and I went to many of the places which have since been bombed and where there has been such death and destruction.  We must be careful and prudent in what we say and maintain our generous approach to each other.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> The Minister dealt with BSE, its effects on cattle exports and taking cattle into intervention.  I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Tánaiste and other Ministers on their work in this regard.  This country still faces a major crisis as regards live cattle exports and the placing of beef in intervention.  The European Union has not been too generous in increasing the amount of beef we are being allowed to place in intervention. Thousands of farmers, who are unable to sell their livestock into intervention or to Libya, Egypt or to other countries, face ruin because of heavy overdrafts and commitments.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we use diplomatic means to ensure a ready market for beef exports.  This beef scare could have a detrimental effect on our economy because of the number of farmers who face ruin.  I urge the Tánaiste and all Ministers to continue their hard work. This crisis came upon us suddenly, although we had taken positive steps by slaughtering cattle infected by BSE. Thankfully, incidents of this disease have been negligible, only .0002 per cent, and we have slaughtered the animals concerned.  Diplomats in our embassies and overseas offices still have a job to do assuring people about the safety of this wonderful product and our farmers have a lot of work at home.  We must work to protect this important industry.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to nuclear power stations, about which I am concerned. We have seen the threat to the east coast from the nuclear power station and reprocessing plant at Sellafield.  The accident at Chernobyl, which had horrific consequences for those living there, will bedevil that area for many years. We must ensure greater safeguards are taken.  There are no nuclear power stations in Ireland and I hope that policy will continue.  European nuclear stations should be regularly monitored to ensure safety.  I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I wish him well in proceeding with this White Paper on Foreign Policy.</P>
    <Col N="42" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important and historic debate.  Our foreign policy has served us well over the years and it has produced a number of benefits which we now experience.  Given the pivotal importance of foreign policy, it is surprising that this is the first time a Government has published a White Paper on Foreign Policy.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring has transformed the area of foreign policy.  The publication of the document <i>Challenges and Opportunities Abroad</i> is a reflection of the Labour Party's commitment to foreign policy and its belief in the central role it plays in the lives of the people.</P>
      <P>When the publication of a White Paper on Foreign Policy was first proposed, the Minister was told if it works do not fix it, which totally misses the point.  The publication of this White Paper does not mean we believe present foreign policy is failing us.  As I stated, the Labour Party believes our foreign policy has served us well over the years. Discussion regarding foreign policy should be cultivated because of the important role it has played in Ireland's national and international affairs.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste stated that he had two main motivations when he first mooted the exercise of publishing a White Paper.  First, he wished to stimulate greater public debate on, and understanding of, foreign policy in order to produce a deeper sense of public owner-ship of that policy.  The second initiative behind the White Paper was to enable our foreign policy to take its bearings in the rapidly changing environment created by the ending of the Cold War. This led to the emergence of a radically different political configuration in Europe, with implications for the European Union and Ireland's place within it.  It is for these reasons that the publication of the White Paper was imperative. <i>Challenges and Opportunities Abroad</i> represents an effort to get the best out of Ireland's foreign policy.  It effectively deals with the challenges facing Ireland within the context of a changing Europe and a changing world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> Membership of the European Union has been integral to Ireland's development. Through that membership we are in the mainstream of European decision-making and this will be reflected in our forthcoming Presidency of the European Union.  During that Presidency, priority must be placed on the fight against drug trafficking and crime.  Europe as a whole has a much better chance to solve this cancer which afflicts the entire world.  I believe that the White Paper should place more emphasis on attacking the problems of crime and drug trafficking.  Ireland has underdeveloped facilities at its airports and ports which allow drug barons and criminals to extend the cancer of the drug culture into society.</P>
    <P>Most Irish people associate foreign policy with the Northern Ireland peace process.  However, the White Paper does not address the question of Northern Ireland as the situation there is evolving on a daily basis.  This does not take away from the fact that securing a peaceful and prosperous Ireland within the European Union remains the main focus of our foreign policy.</P>
    <P>Ireland's contribution to world history is probably disproportionate to its size.  At present, the contribution of Irish people in developing countries is well documented and respected throughout the world.  Ireland's relations with developing countries remain one of the fundamental planks of our foreign policy.  This relationship is multifaceted and is an example to many other countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also made a significant contribution to the area of peacekeeping. The White Paper points out that since 1958 over 42,000 members of the Defence Forces and Garda Síochána have served with distinction as UN peacekeepers. Our record on peacekeeping is something of which we can be proud and represents a major contribution to international peace and security.  I had the pleasure to visit Somalia when the Irish Army contingent was present and I also visited Lebanon with the current <Col N="44" /> Minister for Defence, Deputy Barrett. We visited the Irish soldiers on behalf the UN subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  It was a pleasure to see the way in which Irish troops and gardaí were accepted in those countries.  They seemed to find it easy to communicate with the people there and created an environment which facilitated the solving of problems.</P>
    <P>Members of Ireland's Defence Forces, Garda Síochána, NGOs and nurses and doctors who travel to such countries must be commended for the very important role they play in their development.  In support of the current Minister for Defence, Deputy Barrett, I must state that he was an excellent ambassador for Ireland at all times in this communication with ordinary people in those countries and also the members of the Irish Defence Forces and Garda whom we met.  I commend him for his attitude.</P>
    <P>These are two well publicised aspects of contemporary Irish foreign policy but, important as they are, they do not represent the full depth of that policy. Irish foreign policy goes far beyond these two aspects.  It also embraces issues of human rights, international co-operation, cultural relations, arms control, Irish citizens abroad, etc.  That is why it is important to foster a debate on foreign policy and a sense of public ownership of that policy.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to the section of the White Paper which deals with the Common Fisheries Policy.  I live in the constituency of Donegal North East where fishing is a major industry.  As implementation and development of the White Paper progresses, more emphasis should be placed on the fishing industry. This problem is now being experienced on a world scale.  With regard to Ireland, many of the difficulties involved relate to external threats to the Irish fishing industry.  The Spanish fishing fleet, which is the world's third largest, poses a threat to the Irish fishing community because it has overfished its own waters. The Spanish fleet has turned its attention <Col N="45" /> to Irish waters to meet Spain's immense demand for seafood.</P>
    <P>Under EU regulations, only 40 Spanish vessels are permitted to fish in the Irish Box at any time.  This law is enforced by seven Irish patrol vessels and through co-operation from other EU nationals.  The Irish Government has acknowledged the need for more patrol vessels.  The Departments of Defence and the Marine are committed to adding another such vessel to the fleet.  During the past ten to 12 years, Ireland received a bad deal in relation to fisheries.  The relevant Act will again be ratified in the year 2,000 and it is important that this matter be rectified in favour of the Irish fishing industry in which major potential exists to create employment.  The White Paper outlines, in a small number of paragraphs, Ireland's attitude to the Common Fisheries Policy.  However, we must be more gregarious, serious and demanding in our approach to this situation.  There is tremendous potential, of which Ireland has not availed to date.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some remarks on what has become one of the most contentious and misconstrued issues in the White Paper.  I refer to the section dealing with the Partnership for Peace.  This was launched at the NATO summit in Brussels in January 1994 as a co-operative security initiative designed to intensify political and military co-operation in Europe, promote stability, reduce threats to peace and build strengthened relationships by promoting practical co-operation among its participants.  To suggest that involvement with this partnership is tantamount to joining a second class NATO is simply a gross and absurd exaggeration.  Countries with a long and proud record of neutrality, such as Sweden, are members of the Partnership for Peace.  Surely no one would suggest that Sweden has abandoned its neutrality by joining that partnership?</P>
    <P>The White Paper reaffirms Ireland's neutrality and states that Irish Defence Forces will be involved in humanitarian, rescue and peacekeeping operations.  It <Col N="46" /> is within this context that the Government intends to explore the possibility of participating in the Partnership for Peace.  However, the Tánaiste has already stated that in Ireland's case the central plank of involvement in the Partnership for Peace would be the enhancement of peacekeeping capabilities. The Government will not propose that Ireland should seek membership of NATO or the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>Another welcome aspect of the White Paper is the recognition of the fact that the tens of millions of people of Irish descent throughout the world are an important asset which should not be underestimated.  These people are proud of their Irish lineage and many of them assist us in the pursuit of our national objectives.  An example of this is the contribution some of these people have made to the achievement of lasting peace and reconciliation in our country. While foreign policy has been viewed in a somewhat narrow way in the past, its effects are becoming more prevalent in contemporary Irish society and its effects on all our daily lives are recognised.</P>
    <P>Our development as a nation over the last number of decades has been seriously affected by our membership not only of a European community but also a global community.  It is to be hoped that the publication of this White Paper will generate a public debate on foreign policy.  It is important that this debate takes place since foreign policy is a significant part of our sense of identity. In addition, other EU member states have brought forward or intend bringing forward, policy statements regarding the European Union.  These challenges and opportunities will make for an invaluable contribution by Ireland to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. This is the first time I have had the pleasure of being in the House with him. Media coverage of the White Paper has focused on Ireland's security arrangements. My colleague, Deputy Kathleen <Col N="47" /> Lynch, comprehensively stated Democratic Left's views in this regard during her contribution in the other House. Security arrangements, however, account for just one chapter out of sixteen. It is extremely depressing that the media and the political establishment alike have largely ignored issues such as development co-operation, human rights and the environment, as well as justice co-operation within the EU.  The White Paper challenges us as a society in these areas.  It builds on a tradition of solidarity which is evident among the Irish people every time a humanitarian catastrophe strikes.</P>
      <P>I especially welcome the section dealing with international human rights.  The priority which this Government accords to the development of human rights was emphasised by the formation of a human rights unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This focus is copper-fastened by the decision to establish an interdepartmental committee on human rights and to form a permanent standing committee which will include NGO representatives.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, high ideals are often made subservient to economic considerations. In this regard, I urge the Government to seize the opportunity to impose strict human rights conditions on trade agreements.  One need only think of our growing trade with Indonesia and the growing human rights crisis in East Timor to realise the importance of such conditions.  I particularly welcome the White Paper's emphatic reaffirmation of the principles contained in the 1993 Vienna Declaration which implicitly rejects the idea that human rights are culturally specific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The universality of human rights and the parity between individual and collective human rights must be at the centre of Irish and European human rights policy.  Among the most fundamental human rights are the right to freedom from hunger, the right to a clean water supply, the right to health care, the right to education and the right to work.  They are rights which we in Ireland take for <Col N="48" /> granted, but which are still aspirational for many in the developing world.  The chapter on development co-operation sets out a number of welcome goals in this area.  They can be summed up by the statement in paragraph 9.6 of the White Paper, which outlines the Government's aim to &ldquo;reduce poverty and promote sustainable development in some of the poorest countries in the world&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Sustainable&rdquo; is the key word here.  We cannot allow the developing world to become a social and environmental dumping ground for the developed world.  I also welcome the commitment to establish a humanitarian liaison group which will co-ordinate the response of Government and NGOs to humanitarian emergencies.</P>
    <P>There is one omission in this chapter. While reiterating the Government's commitment to reaching the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP, the White Paper does not specifically endorse the commitment in paragraph 83 of the <i>Programme for a Government of Renewal</i> to increase development assistance by 0.05 per cent of GNP each year.  I hope that this was a simple oversight, and I would welcome the Tánaiste's clarification on this point.</P>
    <P>Aid and trade are, of course, closely linked.  Much of the developing world is currently trying to cope not only with an ever increasing debt burden but also a world trade order which is skewed in favour of the north rather than the south.  At a time when political democracy is making slow but measurable advances, international financial institutions are found to be profoundly undemocratic.  Developing countries have, in effect, been forced to transfer their economic sovereignty to two remote and unrepresentative bodies &mdash; the World Bank and the IMF.  Their policies are dictated by the developed world.  It is ironic that the World Bank and the IMF should continue imposing neo-liberal economic policies on the developing world at a time when Reagonomics and Thatcherism have been discredited in the developed world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" /> In exchange for balance of payment loans, the structural adjustment policies imposed on developing countries require them to reduce their budget deficits, liberalise imports, deregulate internal markets and promote exports. The inevitable result of the monetarist corset imposed on such a large part of the developing world has been declining public investment in economic and social infrastructures.  The investment shortfall has also hit employment intensive industries.  At the same time, the export led strategy has been a two pronged disaster.  Developing countries have been forced to export foodstuffs in order to attract hard currency while increased commodity exports have, in some cases, led to a sharp fall in commodity prices.</P>
    <P>The brunt of the structural adjustment policies has been borne by the weakest sections of the societies concerned. The net result of these policies was to cause average incomes in Africa to fall by around 20 per cent during the 1980s while unemployment rose to around 100 million, and the continent's share of world markets dropped to just 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>Oxfam termed the 1980s as the &ldquo;lost decade&rdquo; in development terms.  There is a very real danger that the 1990s will be seen as another &ldquo;lost decade&rdquo; unless the governments of both the north and the south insist on a radical transformation of development policies accompanied by a root and branch overhaul of the World Bank and the IMF.  In this regard I welcome the acknowledgement in the White Paper that the option of debt cancellation must be examined.  I hope this Government will press in international fora for such a cancellation.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper, the Tánaiste, his Government colleagues and the officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs have produced a set of innovative and challenging policies.  Many of those policies, especially in the area of development co-operation, will strike a chord with the Irish people who have consistently demonstrated their commitment to issues such as human rights, development <Col N="50" /> co-operation and the peaceful resolution of conflicts.</P>

      <P>I welcome the White Paper on Foreign Policy.  Many people wonder what is foreign policy?  Some of them think it only consists of Third World countries, the Lebanon, etc. However it affects our relations with European and other countries.  Foreign policy with our nearest neighbour is slipping at the moment.  The peace process seems to have come to a standstill and the Minister should work harder in this regard.  We seem to have three Taoisigh speaking on foreign policy.  Only one of them should do so because, as the old saying goes, too many cooks spoil the broth.  All three Government party leaders are setting themselves as an authority and that does not create confidence.  Only one man should be responsible for foreign policy.</P>

      <P>If we want to appoint a woman, then we should do so on a full-time basis.  We should not have pressmen contradicting one another and twisting what each said before they read it.  This aspect needs to be attended to immediately.  Since Deputy Albert Reynolds and John Major stopped talking directly to each other, matters seem to be on a slippery slope.  If this matter is not resolved, we will all be in for a rude awakening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our soldiers are doing great work in UN peacekeeping duties.  However, many of them may be suffering from stress of one type or another after finishing their duties.  Soldiers coming back from the First and Second World Wars used to call it shell shock; it is now called post traumatic stress disorder.  An international insurance scheme should be set up to deal with that problem.  The <Col N="51" /> taxpayer should not have to pay for this. While these soldiers are entitled to treatment if they have suffered traumatic experiences which has affected their health, payment for this treatment should come from an international fund and not from the taxpayer.  It should be part of our foreign policy to establish such an insurance fund.</P>
    <P>If people on the street were asked about the meaning of foreign policy, one might get some varied answers. However, they would all know about foreign trade.  We should be pushing this aspect to a greater degree.  Ireland is a small country and there is no reason why we should have unemployment. There is only a handful of people living in this country in comparison to other countries, all capable and able of using their hands, heads and ability to make products; but we are not selling our products actively enough abroad.  We have embassies abroad but we do not have salespeople.  We are not maximising our potential to sell our products. Many small firms can make a product but they do not have the money, expertise or ability to sell it.  While State agencies like Forbairt are doing their best, our population base is too small for our volume of sales.  Therefore, we must export our products and we need salespeople to do this.</P>
    <P>We have been educating our children for safe jobs in the Civil Service.  That practice is now a thing of the past.  Our children must be taught to earn their living. Our foreign policy should be developed in such a way as to have facilitators who could put firms in contact with important foreign agencies.  It may be easy to get into foreign markets, but a guarantee system should be put in place for these small firms.  I used to run a small firm that could get good orders for its product.  However, when a customer was deciding which product to buy, there was no one there to take the risk of helping the firm to sell its product.</P>
    <P>We have insurance for our beef exports and that is a good thing.  Were it not for one man, who was badly <Col N="52" /> maligned in the Houses of the Oireachtas, the west would be full of paupers.  If he had not found markets abroad, we would not be able to give our cattle away.  However, a producer who loses out in a foreign business deal has no such security.  That aspect should be part of our foreign policy.  We need people who will sell our producers' products.  One cannot expect our businessmen to be manufacturers, salespeople etc.  They might be able to sell in this way at home or in Britain, but they cannot do this abroad.  Provision should be made in our foreign policy to encourage more small units to come together and facilitate each other to put our products into foreign markets.  We want foreign currency to come in and the raw materials to go out.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright said earlier that we would be in a bad way were it not for our embassies working on behalf of our beef industry.  This shows how dependent we are on our foreign markets.  We must keep our cattle exports at a high level because otherwise this country will become a wasteland.  Are we doing enough to sell our beef?  We are the only country which rears our agricultural produce from a natural grass base but that aspect has not being marketed enough.</P>
    <P>Intensification has damaged our agriculture industry.  On the continent herds of cows go into a building and, as the late Deputy Blaney said, they never see daylight from that day until they go to the knacker's yard.  They are fed with imported meals from America and elsewhere and are dealt with on a rotational basis all day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  In the past we conducted what is now called organic farming.  We called it traditional farming and produced traditional goods.  I have no doubt intensified farming is causing many health hazards.  These animals are put into intensified units and are fed <Col N="53" /> with drugs and chemicals.  This cannot be good.  We should make an all out effort to promote traditional farming.  In that way our small farmers could get back into production.</P>
      <P>We should put more emphasis on environmental protection in our foreign policy.  We are losing many of our birds and much of our wildlife because there is no food for them.  When every small farmer was ploughing and sowing corn and potatoes, there was food for wildlife and natural food for our animals.  If we are to get people to move back to the west, if we are to be able to produce quality products, it is time our foreign policy started to promote natural produce and that we move away from using slurry and so on which pollutes the country and get back to solid organic manure and used bedding straw. We did not have as many problems with diseases and so on in the past.  In our foreign policy and in other European countries we should be promoting ourselves as the only country that produces natural products.</P>
      <P>We should encourage more production of free range eggs.  You could not sell a dozen free range eggs today anywhere in this country but on the farms where they are produced.  They cannot be sold in shops because there are so many regulations and rules.  It is time we had a good look at this and intensified the production of free range eggs, bacon and beef.  This should be all part of our foreign policy because we would reduce our problems here and we could export the goods with a label on them to say that they were not chemically produced.  Chemical farming has been imported into this country.  It has been a disaster and it will continue to be a disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the way I see foreign policy and foreign trade affecting the ordinary man in the street.  I know Cambodia, Lebanon and so on are very relevant, but that is from a different perspective. The man in the street wants to know how it affects him.  I hope I am making it clear here how it affects the ordinary man in the street.  Part of our foreign policy should be to ensure that we get our produce abroad and market it as <Col N="54" /> quality natural produce, produced as it has been down the centuries.</P>
    <P>Sales people should be facilitated and there should be some system of guarantees for small industry so that at least there is some insurance policy until they are making sufficient profits to export without help.  Otherwise we will have to pay these people dole.  The State will have to pay them and there is no return on the State's money.  It would be far better to take a chance on putting that money into a surety system for small industries to encourage them to keep people working at home.  It would be better for morale.  This is the way I see foreign policy affecting the man in the street.  I appeal to the Minister to look at it in that light because at the end of the day what we want from foreign policy is a return and money coming in for goods we produce here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>conscious of the need to ensure that all schools have access to trained <Col N="55" /> and qualified substitute teachers and aware that children may be at risk and schools unsafe through the casual employment of untrained personnel or the short-term employment of teachers without an appointments procedure;</P>
    <P>demands that the supply panel scheme be extended on a nationwide basis to provide a comprehensive system of coverage for approved teachers' absences in primary schools; and</P>
    <P>further demands that this be done through the provision of teachers additional to those currently in the service, who will be required for the reduction of class size and, consequently, that student numbers in colleges of education both the graduate or normal courses be increased.</P>
    <P>This issue is of crucial importance to teachers at primary level in all parts of the country.  It is one of those issues of which people are not aware.  Schools are finding it difficult to get trained and qualified teachers at the moment.  There is a shortage of qualified substitutes in the primary school area and this is raising serious questions about safety implications, etc.  I was in contact with an INTO representative from a midland county who said that, in a cluster of schools in one catchment area which had five teachers on maternity leave, not one of them was being replaced by a qualified and trained teacher.  The implications of that are extraordinary.</P>
    <P>While I recognise that the Whip applies to my Government colleagues, they should recognise that this serious issue has been around for a long time.  I know what I say will not only be shared by those on the Government benches but also by the officials and inspectors in the Department of Education and the Minister herself.  I also know there will be financial constraints.  I am trying to put forward a proposal that would make life easier all round and give the Minister <Col N="56" /> a certain strength in dealing with the Government and the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>This matter has now reached crisis proportions.  School principals and boards of management are unable to ensure the availability of an adequate number of teachers to cover for colleagues who are ill, on maternity leave or other approved absences.  Schools &mdash; and this could apply to the board of management, the chairperson of the board, the school principal or whoever is in charge &mdash; have stark choices to make.  Sometimes the class is divided among other classes, resulting in disruption throughout the school with every class being affected.  Other times the remedial teacher, if there is one in the school area, is drafted in to take over the class, resulting in that service being unavailable.  While nobody agrees with this, choices must be made.  That class needs a teacher, the principal may be at his or her wits end and may take the remedial teacher away from their duties to take over and this creates its own problems.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the class is taken over by an administrative principal, if there is one in the school, resulting in important administrative and curricular work being neglected and the school loses out.  Sometimes unqualified and untrained personnel are employed to supervise the classes, giving rise to the most serious questions regarding safety and education.  I stress the safety aspect. I will certainly shout &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; if this arises again.  Who would take responsibility if a child was abused or misused in any way by an untrained person given charge of pupils without any appointment or filtering procedure, which is what is happening at the moment?</P>
    <P>I am not pointing the finger at the boards of management.  Although I do not agree with their actions, I sympathise with them.  They have run out of alternatives or options and they can only get an untrained person or responsible adult to supervise in these situations. Other times &mdash; regrettably this is <Col N="57" /> a growing trend &mdash; pupils are staying at home because there is no teacher, which gives rise to a child's constitutional right to primary education being suppressed.</P>
    <P>The teaching community and the INTO are fast reaching a stage where we believe the only way to draw public attention to this matter would be by taking some form of industrial action where, if there is no proper attempt to supply qualified substitute teachers, we will refuse to cover for absent colleagues. That is bound to happen sooner or later.  Nobody wants to go down that avenue, particularly as we are trying to agree on a matter on which there is common consensus.  The Primary Education Review Body in 1989 and every report since then have thoroughly supported such an arrangement.  Every official I know in the Department of Education also supports some element of improving substitution and the Minister has also said it time and again.  It is a matter of putting pressure on the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The situation is critical.  We ran into a problem last year &mdash; it was covered extensively by the media &mdash; when a teacher from Australia working in this country was discovered to have been guilty of offences relating to paedophilia there.  This person, who was a qualified teacher, had passed through our system, which did not have a filtration process. This shows the need to be careful.  This person was appointed for a short term but children were still at risk.  That caused extraordinary difficulties and worries for parents, the teaching staff, the principals of the schools where this person taught and the boards of management of those schools.  Thankfully, nothing happened to the children on that occasion but it will happen some time.</P>
    <P>People talk about the Kilkenny report, the Kelly Fitzgerald case, where the system falls down and where we should put in support structures.  This is one of those areas.  While I do not want to sensationalise it, this is one aspect of <Col N="58" /> safety that is becoming more worrying to us.  It is unfair on pupils, parents teachers and school management, all of whom are struggling to provide an education service in Europe's most under funded primary education sector.</P>
    <P>My proposal would involve no additional cost to the State.  Last year the State spent more than £3 million employing untrained and unqualified personnel to supervise primary school classes.  That money alone would employ enough full-time, qualified teachers to meet one-third of the needs of primary education.  The Department of Education estimates that the average number of substitutes required in any one day for the 21,000 teachers around the country is 800.  The £3 million a year which the Department is spending on untrained and unqualified personnel would allow for the employment of over 200 qualified teachers who could then be assigned to areas, regions or schools where they would be available for substitute work for a cluster of schools or if there was no need for a substitute on a certain day, they could do remedial or curricular work; it is not a matter of having people standing around doing nothing.  This is a no cost beginning of a resolution to this problem and it should be implemented immediately.</P>
    <P>It is only a matter of time before schools begin advising pupils to remain at home because of a lack of teachers. Schools will be faced with a clear alternative. Their legal advice will be that on the one hand children have a constitutional right to education, while on the other management have a legislative duty to ensure the safety of their pupils. If they cannot vouch for the safety of the pupils by having trust and total confidence in the person they put in to supervise, they must then make a choice: do they risk exposing the school board to a liability or risk depriving the child of his or her constitutional rights? That is an impossible choice for school boards to have to face and there is a <Col N="59" /> clear responsibility and duty on the Department to deal with it.</P>
    <P>There is a shortage of teachers at present too and the motion asks that the graduate course be continued and the number of students in the normal teacher course increased.  People would say immediately that pupil numbers are dropping.  This can be explained by a simple calculation.  The Department reckons there will be more than 400,000 pupils at primary level in whatever number of years they are prognosticating at present.  Let us say there will be 420,000 pupils.  If one divides that figure by the 21,000 teachers &mdash; an easy calculation &mdash; in the system, it results in a pupil/teacher ratio of 21, which is still the highest in Europe.  That means that with the fall in pupil numbers and using every teacher in the system continuously, Ireland will still not reach the European average class size.  Neither does it provide the 400 or 500 additional teachers which the Department reckons would be needed to give nationwide remediation cover.  Certainly, it does not make any teachers available for the education of children with special needs.  I read a terrible story recently of a child with autism who has no recognition whatsoever within the system.  I know the child and the child's family.</P>
    <P>I do not want to stand here and say that the Department of Education is uncaring, unfeeling or whatever; it is not.  The people in the Department would share the views I am putting forward. They are being stymied by the Department of Finance which will not give them the money to implement what I am proposing here.  Therefore, I would ask the House to recognise that the motion does not propose that all this be done immediately.  I am saying use the £3 million which is going to untrained personnel immediately to begin this process, extend the supply panel of teachers immediately to cover a third of <Col N="60" /> the country and let us move on gradually after that.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to seize the opportunity to resolve this problem.  It is an issue which is becoming more and more problematic throughout the country.  It is no more than our duty and the Minister's to address it, a duty which has the force of a constitutional imperative.  I ask the Minister to give thorough thought to what we are proposing here, that the Government's amendment not be moved and that the Government concede the motion as proposed.  I ask that it be recognised that the motion is progressive, responsible, budget neutral and in the best interest of pupils, teachers, parents and those running schools.</P>
    <P>The views I am articulating are not just the narrow views of teachers.  Parents would feel even more strongly than teachers do about many aspects of this matter.  Put the two groups together and both parents and teachers are absolutely <i>ad idem</i> on the matter.  Catholic management, Church of Ireland management, Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together have all been in contact with teachers asking us to make a move on this issue.</P>

    <P>I want to look at this matter under a number of headings.  First, I will take up <Col N="61" /> the issue of the current shortage which everybody agrees exists.  I want to trace it back to a question which was asked on 20 February this year by Deputy Síle de Valera, who I see is rather charmingly described as &ldquo;Miss de Valera&rdquo;. She &ldquo;asked the Minister for Education the number of days worked by substitute teachers, both trained and untrained, on a county by county basis in primary schools for the school years 1994/1995 and to date in the 1995/1996 school year; the steps, if any, she proposes to take to deal with the shortage of trained primary substitute teachers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.[3657/96]&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Following is the reply:</P>
      <P>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach): The information requested by the Deputy is as follows.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that primary schools in some areas have recently been experiencing some difficulties in securing the services of trained substitute teachers.</P>
      <P>A pilot project for a supply panel of substitute teachers was introduced in 1993 to cover short-term teacher absences on sick leave.  I propose to extend the project to include new locations as soon as resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to remind the Deputy that, since taking office, I increased substantially the number of <Col N="62" /> entrants into colleges of education, to 429 in 1993, 460 in 1994 and 462 in 1995.  This represents a dramatic improvement on the 1992 position, when only 275 students entered the colleges of education.  Furthermore, in January 1995 I introduced a special 18-month post-graduate course for 180 students in the colleges of education. This will mean that a total of over 600 additional newly-qualified teachers will be available for employment in schools for the 1996-97 school year.</P>
    <P>The initiatives outlined above, together with the projected reduction in overall pupil enrolments at primary level &mdash; from over 478,000 at present to approximately 444,000 in 1998-99 &mdash; will alleviate the difficulties in 1996-97 and will give rise to a surplus of teachers in subsequent years.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the present difficulties are of a temporary nature only.</P>

    </table>
    <P>I am most grateful.  I want to look at the figures quickly, particularly the table &ldquo;Days worked by substitute teachers to date in the school year 1995-96&rdquo;.  If I look at a number of counties in particular, in County Donegal, for example, there were more days taught &mdash; as far as I understand it &mdash; by untrained supply teachers than by trained; in Dublin, they numbers are almost exactly equal, that is, 9,124 trained as against 9,077 untrained; in County Kildare the numbers were also roughly equal; and in County Wexford and County Wicklow the number of untrained teachers was greater.  That is an astonishing situation &mdash; more teaching was being done by untrained people than by trained.  I simply do not regard that as acceptable.  I do not know how any Minister for Education can assume it is acceptable.  For that reason I would say that the Minister's reply, which followed the predictable lines &mdash; that since taking office there had been an increase in the intake into teacher training colleges, that there <Col N="64" /> was a very welcome development in the form of a pilot scheme and that the projected demography of education indicated there would be a drop-off in pupil numbers and all these matters combined would cure the situation of themselves by 1997 &mdash; is overoptimistic.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the reply to that question on 20 February is inadequate.  It is quite clear that we are in a difficult and unrealistic situation.  Out of a total number of 167,317 days worked by substitute teachers for the school year 1994-95, 59,248 of them were worked by untrained teachers.  That is 35 per cent &mdash; over one third of all teacher absences were covered by untrained substitute teachers.  As a result the State is clearly seen to be spending millions of pounds of taxpayers' money on unqualified substitute cover for approved teacher absences.  This, as my colleague, Senator O'Toole, said, is obviously an investment which is not paying dividends, but this is what is clearly revealed.</P>
    <P>In many instances no cover whatsoever was provided for teacher absences and in such cases schools concerned had no option but to put children into other classes in the school.  This affects the education, not just of the pupils whose teacher is absence but it also has a kind of displacement effect so that it spreads throughout the entire situation in the school.</P>
    <P>What is the reality at present? Senator O'Toole has indicated some of it.  The reality for principals is that they are forced into a situation where they must take up a variety of options.  These include: dividing the pupils willy-nilly around other classes, that is, the displacement effect to which I have already referred; persuading retired teachers to return &mdash; I must say I would take a lot of persuading &mdash; to the classroom; finding someone with other qualifications; employing an untrained person to supervise classes; and redeploying the remedial teacher.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole made a clear and passionate plea, for example, in a situation where an autistic child is disadvantaged because there is no remedial <Col N="65" /> teacher.  Does the Minister want to spread this effect throughout the educational system?  The establishment of panels of supply teachers is the only responsible way to deal with this situation, as children are entitled to have a qualified teacher working with them on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the safety of children and we would all agree that this is absolutely paramount. He mentioned the case of an Australian man and I remember it being brought up on &ldquo;The Pat Kenny Show&rdquo;.  I was horrified to learn that somebody had managed to penetrate the educational system with a record of sexual offences in Australia.  It involved not only convictions for specific sexual offences but also for being in possession of pornographic films and photographs demonstrating him in <i>flagrante delicto</i> with some of these children.  That is a clear source of worry to any parent.  Of course, I cannot speak as a parent but I can speak as an uncle.  I am glad to say most of my nieces and nephews have now matured beyond the clutches of such people.  We must take responsibility to ensure this situation is not allowed to continue and it will continue as long as we have the large scale employment of untrained personnel.  I remind the Minister of State that in my quick analysis of the figures I was able to demonstrate that in four or five counties there are more untrained than trained teachers.</P>
    <P>A pilot project for a supply panel for substitute teachers was introduced in 1993 to cover short-term teacher absences on sick leave in three areas &mdash; Castlebar, Dublin and Limerick &mdash; with approximately 30 teachers between the three schemes.  It is imperative that this scheme be extended &mdash; and I look forward to the Minister of State announcing that this evening &mdash; as a matter of urgency on a nationwide basis to cover for approved teacher absences in primary schools.  It is vital that such schemes to extend panels of supply teachers should be achieved by the provision <Col N="66" /> of teachers additional to those currently serving.  If such schemes were to be staffed by teachers redeployed from the demographic surplus, the pupil-teacher ratio would not decrease and there would be no improvement in the remedial service for primary schools.</P>
    <P>The financial implications need to be examined.  The substitute teacher needs of primary schools average between 800 and 900 a day &mdash; a large figure.  Currently, the budget for substitution is £10,376,654 per annum, or 167,317 days at £62 per day.  However, approximately £3,673,376 is spent on unqualified personnel to supervise classes.  If this money was used to employ young teachers 229 could be appointed immediately without any additional cost to the State.  This would relieve the problem enormously.</P>
    <P>The proposal from the INTO and the management authorities seeks 800 teachers on panels nationwide.  This would eventually cost approximately £13 million which is only £2.75 million more than the cost of the present unreliable, inadequate and inefficient system. If the teachers were taken from the current stock of teachers it would be at the expense of class size, remedial teachers or special education teachers. An increase in the intake to the colleges of education is vital for a number of reasons which Senator O'Toole will outline.</P>
    <P>I thank the INTO for the way it briefed me.  It is a union for which I have the highest respect, not only because my colleague Senator O'Toole is involved in it but also because a former pupil of mine, Sally Sheils, occupies a very significant post in it, which shows the value of a good education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;conscious of the need to ensure that all pupils attending primary schools have access to trained and qualified <Col N="67" /> substitute teachers notes the measures which have been taken by the Minister for Education in this regard; and calls on the Minister to continue to take the necessary steps to ensure that the required number of trained and qualified teachers is available.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This evening's motion is unnecessary because everybody is aware of the steps taken in the last two or three years in this area.  The Minister of State will reiterate what has been done and will set out proposals for the future.  I am confident that what is required by the Senators supporting the motion will be delivered &mdash; not today or tomorrow but within a proper timescale.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with some of the language used in the motion.  It could be construed that boards of management are inclined to take risks with safety through the casual employment of untrained personnel.  We all know constituents who have served for years as untrained teachers in the system and have become good teachers.  All they lack is a qualification.  They are good people, teaching in a competent fashion, whose training has been on the job.</P>
    <P>This is not a new problem and three years ago the Minister took steps to sort it out.  A pilot project was put in place in three centres and it was very successful. The results of the project which are now available will form the basis for the nationwide extension of the scheme.  A debate on the matter is useful because it gives us a chance to look at the aims and objectives of the system and to see if the goals are being achieved.  The national system is delivering the goods although, naturally, there are hiccups here and there.</P>
    <P>I do not think the aims and objectives we set for the national system are adequate to meet the needs of today's society.  We are members of the EU yet most Irish people are not able to have a basic conversation with 70 per cent of their fellow EU citizens.  The Irish education system is not responding to that <Col N="68" /> deficit.  No attempt is being made to become full members of the EU.  It should be a national objective to start teaching languages in national schools as soon as possible.  Since young children deal with languages easily and naturally, the obvious approach would be to start teaching languages in national schools.  Less time might have to be given to other disciplines but that could be accommodated in the system; it might require a redrawing of syllabi at post-primary level.</P>
    <P>To complete the package we could ask the universities, which embody the intelligentia, to set up their own entrance exam for their system once and for all.  They have never bothered to try to do that.  They put undue pressure on the secondary school system.  The use of the leaving certificate as the entrance examination for the next stage in education distorts post-primary education. The universities need to get their act together and devise a system, other than the leaving certificate points system, to offer places for their own system in their own way.  The post-primary sector could then respond to the natural needs of its clients.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for something necessary and good.  The 1993 pilot project was based in Ballymun and Finglas, Limerick city and north Mayo.  Two schools in each area were used as feeder schools for the others.  In each of those schools five temporary teachers were appointed.  If a problem arose in a school's catchment area, one of those teachers met the need.  It worked extremely well; boards of management, principals, teachers and parent associations were happy with it.  We now have the basis for a national scheme.  It has been found to be a good system and we must now look at extending it.  My party, the Minister, the Minister of State and the Government are committed to it; when we hear from the Minister of State that will become clear.  However, the Government must act is a responsible and efficient manner and the Minister will hardly announce that this will happen tomorrow.  He will be cautious <Col N="69" />&mdash; the scheme will be introduced in accordance with a plan and the cost will be absorbed in a normal and organised fashion.  I am glad Senators drew attention to this as it is an important matter and I am confident the Government will put in place a scheme to deliver what is sought throughout the system within a reasonable time.  I hope this will not be a contentious debate and that we do not have a division because that would be unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and am glad of the opportunity to speak on it.  Part of my work as a guidance counsellor is to link with six primary schools north of the Liffey.  I rang the principals to ask their professional opinion &mdash; I do not know their political opinions &mdash; about trained and untrained teachers in their schools.  Each principal gave me examples of what he or she had to do to find a teacher &mdash; ring the INTO or scour the highways and byways to find someone to work as relief when a teacher was absent.  One school, St. Gabriel's, is employing a 70 year old teacher because it could not get a qualified teacher.  The teacher in question is excellent and doing a good job but she is dealing, in one classroom, with a range of ability across three classes &mdash; different reading stages, different sums, different learning styles, etc.  I do not think the Minister would agree with that for one moment, nor would anyone who deals with education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper stated that, as a result of new projects coming on stream, there are various ways teachers are being sucked out of the system &mdash; home/school links, teacher counselling, in-service training, remedial teaching, early start programmes, etc.  Where are the replacements for those teachers? There is no back-up.  The INTO has accepted the early retirement scheme; if that is introduced, how will it affect the setting up of the panel?  The pilot scheme is in only three areas &mdash; Dublin, Limerick and in the west.  The supply panel for Dublin has only ten teachers, as I found from my contacts with primary <Col N="70" /> schools.  Something is wrong here because this does not stand up.</P>
    <P>If something happens in the school when this untrained teacher is in charge, it will be the principal rather than the teacher who will take the blame.  It has been said that there are many excellent untrained people but is it suggested that we should take untrained as against trained teachers?  There is a great difference between them, such as knowledge of course content and the experience faced in the training programme of going into the school system and dealing with problems as they arise.  There are many problems with which untrained teachers cannot cope, particularly those that arise from lack of support in the home and the area.  Teachers and principals must then act <i>in loco parentis</i>, taking over the role of the parent and dealing with every aspect of the child's upbringing from the age of four.</P>
    <P>During discussion on the White Paper we talked about the cost of the various schemes that were to be introduced throughout the education system.  I thought we would start at the beginning but the White Paper did not do that.  It introduced novel ideas and new untested concepts, yet early start programmes in all areas lack the support to help teachers deal with children from an early age.  Nothing is worse than not getting help from the beginning.  If we do not allow trained teachers to work with young children from four years old upward, we have no chance of dealing with discipline, pupil-teacher ratios, reading ability, slow learners or any aspect of their learning when they reach the age of 12, at which stage there is huge variation.</P>
    <P>To suggest that, because numbers in primary schools will decline we will not need extra people coming into teacher training is rubbish.  The pupil-teacher ratio should be lowered.  At present classes in disadvantaged areas have 25 to 30 pupils.  I cannot understand why we get it so wrong.  I would rather the Minister dropped the regional education plan for the vocational education committees and started to get it right at <Col N="71" /> the bottom.  Young children need all the support they can get and if we had got it right, there would be no difficulty dealing with the colossal problems which now arise at age 12 when the children enter second level.</P>
    <P>This motion is timely and I ask the Minister of State to review the matter. There should be an increase in numbers going into teacher training colleges and there should be a supply panel to cover all Ireland.  If we had that, we might stymie problems which arise later.  It will be worthwhile if the Minister takes this message away with him to the public.  If things continue, the confidence of the teaching profession will be undermined and none of us wants that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 28 February 1995, acknowledged there are difficulties in securing the services of trained substitute teachers in the current school year.  However, as the Minister went on to point out, the current shortage is of a temporary nature only.</P>
      <P>It is hardly necessary for me to say that all of us who are involved in the provision and delivery of education are committed to ensuring all pupils attending primary schools have access to fully trained and qualified teachers. This demonstrates the enormous value which both the Government and the Irish people attach to education.  It is acknowledged that education makes a fundamentally important contribution to the quality and well being of Irish society.  Education will play an even more crucial role in the social, intellectual, cultural, economic and political life of the country as it faces into the new century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has a long and distinctive educational tradition incorporating important values.  Throughout our history, education has drawn to its service many gifted individuals of great dedication and commitment.  Parents have made great sacrifices to obtain the benefits <Col N="72" /> of education for their children.  The quality and depth of this educational tradition, the achievements in expansion and development of the education system in recent decades and the informed awareness of, and interest in, educational issues among the public is a source of great confidence to Irish society as it charts its way forward towards a new era in Irish education.</P>
    <P>The State's role in education arises as part of its overall concern to achieve economic prosperity, social well being and a good quality of life within a democratically structured society.  This concern affirms fundamental human values and confers on the State a responsibility to protect the rights of individuals and to safeguard the common good.  Education is a right of each individual and a means of enhancing the well being and quality of life of the whole society.  The State must, therefore, seek to create, promote, and support the conditions within which education can realise its potential in society.  The democratic character of Irish society requires education to embrace the diverse traditions, values and beliefs of all its people.</P>
    <P>The development of the education and skills of people is as important a source of wealth as the accumulation of more traditional forms of wealth. National and international bodies have identified the central role of education and training as one of the critical sources of economic and social well being in modern society.  This is the logical outcome of the increasing centrality of knowledge and skills in shaping economic organisation and national competitiveness. Interlinked with this is the emerging economic necessity for lifelong learning, given the speed with which knowledge and skills become outdated. For these and many other reasons, expenditure on education and training is a vital investment in economic growth and improved social cohesion.</P>
    <P>Links between education and the economy at national and institutional level are important.  This has been recognised by successive Governments, <Col N="73" /> the social partners and various expert bodies.  The contribution of education and training to economic prosperity has been underlined in successive national understandings with the social partners and in independent studies carried out by, for instance, the National Economic and Social Council and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  These developments have placed education at centre stage as part of more broadly based economic and social policies.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to continuing this process.  The Government's concern with this key dimension of education complements and reinforces the fundamental contribution of education to individual and social development.  Enhancing the contribution of education and training to economic prosperity requires an independent and dynamic education system which is systematically linked to the economic planning process.</P>
    <P>Students within the educational system are, accordingly, entitled to the highest standards of teaching and to be facilitated in the attainment of the highest quality of learning.  Thus, this Government is committed to ensuring and promoting the highest standards of education.  This encompasses a variety of interdependent factors, including the quality of the curriculum, teaching and teachers in schools.  In this regard, effective school and institutional management and planning processes are also vital.</P>
    <P>It is my personal view, and indeed that of the Government, that no other element of the education system has a greater influence on high standards than the quality of our teaching profession. The contribution of the teaching profession to the education system is fundamental. The commitment of the teaching profession is central to the quality of Irish education.  Irish teachers provide a first rate service to the young people whom they teach daily.  The White Paper on Education supports this view. It enshrines this position in official Government policy and it stresses that <Col N="74" /> the status of the teaching profession is of central importance to the continuing development of a first class education system for the decades ahead.</P>
    <P>A profession, as traditionally understood, is characterised by the following principal characteristics: its members have technical competence acquired through long education, training and practice and they adhere to norms of professional behaviour and service commitments that are agreed with colleagues. The White Paper, which was published in April 1995, acknowledges the importance of teachers' education and training.  It acknowledges that, in line with other professions, initial teacher education cannot be regarded as the final preparation for a lifetime of education.  It recognises that, because of changing social and economic circumstances, the professional development needs of teachers have increased sharply in recent years, a trend which is set to continue and intensify in the future.</P>
    <P>That is why the Minister for Education is developing a national policy on a comprehensive programme of in-career provision relevant to all teachers. This is why the Minister established the in-career development unit in the Department of Education in 1994.  With the assistance of the European Union, an expenditure of almost £40 million is committed to in-career development for teachers until 1999.  As the Minister has already promised, commitments in the White Paper for ongoing training to meet the professional needs of teachers will be delivered.</P>
    <P>A feature of the teaching profession which has been recognised nationally and internationally is the commitment of teachers to service.  This is recognised by the Irish people.  For example, an <i>Irish Independent</i> survey last January showed that Irish people value the contribution made by teachers to the community more than that of any other profession. The Irish people have a high level of confidence in teachers which carries with it high expectations.  With this very positive endorsement of the teaching profession, it is, of course, a <Col N="75" /> cause of considerable concern that in the current school year there has been an inadequate supply of trained substitute teachers.  However, it is important we do not lose sight of the reality, which is that these difficulties are of a temporary nature only.</P>
    <P>Let me outline the main factors which have led to the current temporary shortage of trained teachers.  First, a total of 980 permanent posts, which would otherwise have been lost as a consequence of declining enrolments nationally, have been retained in the system over the past three years.  Of that total, 570 new posts were established in the special education and disadvantaged areas, while the balance of 410 posts was used to effect substantial improvements in the pupil-teacher ratio and maximum class size guidelines.  As a result, the pupil teacher ratio has been reduced from its 1992-93 level of 25.2:1 to 22.9: 1 in the current school year.  The second factor contributing to the current shortage has been the increase in the number of teachers who have opted to avail of voluntary retirement.  The number of teachers opting for this form of retirement has increased substantially from 138 in 1992 to 273 in 1995.</P>
    <P>Another factor is the number of teachers on career breaks, which in the current year is over 900.  This represents almost 5 per cent of the total primary teaching profession.  When the career break scheme was originally introduced for primary teachers, there was a significant oversupply of trained teachers.</P>
    <P>There has also been a noticeable increase over the last three years in the requirements for substitute teachers.  In 1994-95, for example, a total of 950 substitute teachers were required to cover for sick leave, maternity leave, secondments and study leave.</P>
    <P>Since taking up office the Minister for Education has increased substantially the number of entrants into the colleges of education each year.  The number of students entering the colleges increased from 275 in 1992 to 462 in 1995.  In addition, in January 1995 the Minister <Col N="76" /> introduced a special 18 month post graduate course for 180 students in the colleges of education.  All this will mean that a total of over 600 newly qualified teachers will be available for employment in schools this September.  While decisions have not yet been taken regarding the number of entrants to the colleges of education for the 1996-97 academic year, I assure the House that all factors which impinge on the teacher supply/demand balance will again be thoroughly reviewed before final decisions will be taken.</P>
    <P>Late last year the Minister announced that teachers trained for the primary school system in Northern Ireland and the EU, who have secured the appropriate recognised teaching qualifications, may teach in the Irish primary school system at full salary for a two year period pending their successful completion of the scrúdú cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge. This is a considerable advance on the previous situation where such teachers could be employed but were classified and paid as untrained substitutes.  This initiative should lead to an increase in the number of teachers from Northern Ireland and the EU available to teach in our schools.</P>
    <P>Detailed aspects of the initiative are being finalised at present together with the arrangements which will be put in place to assist such teachers to prepare for the scrúdú cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge. The revised arrangement will be fully operative for the start of the 1996-97 school year and details will be notified to the schools and other relevant interests in the near future.</P>
    <P>Turning to the issue of the supply panel, the general consensus among the education partners is that the existing scheme, which was confirmed as a permanent scheme in September 1995 following a two year pilot phase, works very satisfactorily.  The scheme will continue to be reviewed with a view to its expansion in the future in the light of the available resources.</P>
    <P>The development of a national supply panel with a ratio of one substitute teacher to 35 ordinary teachers would <Col N="77" /> require the appointment of an additional 600 teachers.  The House will doubtless appreciate that existing resources do not allow for the appointment of this number of additional teachers for this purpose at present.</P>
    <P>In addition, the House will be aware that in planning for the future we must take account of declining pupil enrolments. The projected reduction in overall pupil enrolments at primary level from over 478,000 at present to approximately 440,000 in 1998-99 is very substantial. This reduction will have a significant impact on the number of posts which will become surplus to requirement over the next number of years.</P>
    <P>I call on the House to commend the Minister for her swift response to the current temporary difficulties.  In light of the many initiatives which the Minister has introduced or is about to introduce and which I have detailed here, I know the House will share my confidence in the Minister's ability to provide an enhanced and better educational system, one that will serve us well into the next century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make some general comments about the funding of education in the context of this motion. In his speech the Minister of State stated:</P>
      <P>The Irish people have a high level of confidence in teachers.  This carries with it high expectations.</P>
      <P>Many of us who have this high confidence and high expectation have been shaken to learn, as I have only learned in the past couple of days, that a large number of substitute teachers are not trained or qualified.  It is clear from the Minister of State's speech that he is also worried, as is the Minister, and is taking action in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion highlights a problem that cries out for resolution.  Teaching is a professional activity that can be done only by professionals.  This applies whether the teaching is being done at primary, secondary or at any level.  To have unqualified people acting as substitutes, <Col N="78" /> except in the most exceptional of circumstances, is to confuse the difference between teaching and baby-sitting. However, the facts show that unqualified people are substituting on a scale that is unacceptable.  Indeed, the national figures mask a situation that is much worse in many local areas.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the figures county by county it will be apparent that the number of days worked by non-qualified substitutes far exceeds those worked by qualified teachers.  I doubt if the nation is aware of this, which is why we have been stunned with this information.  In some counties it would appear that qualified substitutes are hardly to be found at all.</P>
    <P>I compliment my colleague, Senator O'Toole, for raising this matter and in the manner in which he did so today.  I know it is an issue of great concern to parents, and rightly so.  However, we must be realistic in terms of our expectations for putting things right.  In this context, is the motion realistic?</P>
    <P>This problem is not being ignored by the Department; this is clear from the answer the Minister has given tonight. The pilot scheme has been in operation and is to be extended.  The number of student teachers has been increased over the past number of years.  We would all like the problem to be solved overnight by a further massive injection of resources.  However, we cannot reasonably expect this to happen.  The Minister has clearly made the case for this.</P>
    <P>My colleagues will be aware that I have imposed a discipline on myself in the House over the past three years.  I refrain from calling for anything that will cost money unless at the same time I suggest where the money is to come from.  This is my problem here.  To resolve matters would cost a lot of money, which in practice can only come from two places &mdash; from the existing education budget or some other Department budget, or from asking the taxpayers to contribute more.</P>
    <P>If we were to divert resources from elsewhere to education, where would we <Col N="79" /> begin?  The more I learn about education the more I hear about many worthy projects that are starved of resources.  It would be very difficult to find somebody or something to cut back on to free up resources.  However, if we decide to increase the education budget we create a different kind of problem. Education must fight its corner for demands on the public purse from every direction in addition to demands from the taxpayers to reduce taxation.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is the vast amount of money we already spend on education. It may well be underfunded from the point of view of people within the profession. However, it already swallows up a sizeable proportion of our overall national spending.  It is not surprising, therefore, that in view of the huge sums involved, education is constantly under pressure to reduce its budget in real terms.  Given all the other spending priorities and our overriding need to keep public spending under control, it is not surprising that it is so difficult to increase the budget.</P>
    <P>The best chance of making improvements in education is by using the resources that will be freed up by the drop in student numbers brought to our attention by the Minister tonight.  As that works its way through the system, there are two ways of responding to the fall in numbers.  The Department of Finance wants to cut the Education budget expenditure and spend less on education as the student numbers drop. That would shut the door forever on the prospect of improving the current system, which the Minister himself recognises is open to criticism.  We would be shutting the door forever on the prospect of tackling problems such as that which is the subject of this motion.</P>
    <P>The alternative approach is to use the resources which are freed up to do the things we should be doing anyway and which the Department puts on a long list headed &ldquo;when resources permit&rdquo;. These include improving the pupil teacher ratio.  This is the correct <Col N="80" /> approach and it is not too early to start making the case.  If the Department of Education does not stake a claim to these resources it will find that they will be hijacked for other purposes.  We all know there is no shortage of worthy causes across the spectrum of public spending.</P>
    <P>It is pretty unrealistic to look for significantly more money for education, apart from increases to deal with inflation.  However, it is both realistic and necessary to fight hard to avoid any drop in those resources when the falling student numbers could be used to justify such a drop.  That is where we should focus our attention.  We should resolve now to use the opportunity provided by the falling student numbers, as evidenced by the Minister, to improve the quality of Irish education.  Education cannot go on living forever in the twilight world of those Department of Finance words &mdash; when resources permit. This is especially true of the primary sector which for many years has been the cinderella of education.</P>
    <P>It is in the primary sector that the fall off in student numbers will show first. The figures were drawn to our attention by the Minister, who said that enrolments at primary school level will fall from 478,000 at present to approximately 444,000 in the year 1998-99.  It is only right therefore that the benefits resulting from that fall off should go to the primary sector and not be siphoned off elsewhere.  As the fall in student numbers works its way through the primary sector and eventually to third level, we should replace quantity with quality and not look for ways to make cost savings at the expense of education.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the development of a national supply panel with a ratio of one substitute teacher to 35 ordinary teachers would require the appointment of an additional 600 teachers.  This motion calls only for the appointment of 229.  I suggest that this motion is aimed at being budget neutral. Its objective is to ensure that the first step towards solving the problem of substitutes should be taken now.  It proposes <Col N="81" /> poses that the money currently being spent on untrained teachers should be spent differently and I urge the Minister to give that every consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument in creating a hype about all these untrained teachers is slightly misleading.  The impression is given that one is taking off the street somebody who has absolutely no idea about education.  That is not quite true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a valid point and I would appreciate if Senator Norris <Col N="82" /> would let me do so.  The people who are regarded as untrained are not quite people off the street with absolutely no idea of education.  Most of them &mdash; Senator Cotter alluded to another group &mdash; have been trained in a different jurisdiction or a different discipline.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I recognise there is a problem, as does the Minister.  It is being examined and I hope it will be examined more seriously even than in this motion tonight.  Contrary to what the Minister has said, the problem will not go away.  It has existed for quite some time.  If teachers can avail of early retirement, a substantial number of them will do so.  I believe it will be more than has been estimated and that will cause a drain on the existing number of trained primary school teachers.</P>
      <P>We are offering in-service training to primary school teachers.  When are they going to do that training?  I do not think it is very fair to expect every teacher to give up their vacation time to engage in in-service training.  A week or a fortnight is not enough for a decent in-service course.  If we are serious about upgrading the quality of our existing primary school teachers, we will expect more and more of them to take substantial school time off in order to avail of in-service courses.  That is another drain on the number of trained teachers available.</P>
      <P>There are two categories of substitute teacher, short-term and long-term.  The latter take the place of teachers who are on career breaks, some to this and the other House.  It surprised me that the Minister's speech mentioned that 5 per cent of teachers &mdash; in other words, &mdash; one in every 20 &mdash; are on career breaks. Their places have been taken by temporary teachers.  To the outsider they may not look like temporary teachers because they are all young, qualified teachers who are delighted to get a whole-time job.  It is not a permanent job but it carries all the responsibilities of permanent post except they do not get the recognition for that year, to which they would be entitled if permanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> The demand for career breaks and long-term substitution will cause a drain on the number of substitute teachers available to the schools.  It may not be a major problem in city schools which have an administrative principal or a remedial teacher.  However, what happens in a small two or three teacher rural school if one of the teachers is sick, breaks a leg or is involved in an accident? This is devastating in a two teacher school where one teacher is trying to control everybody from four years old up to sixth class.  That is an enormous responsibility for any teacher and I would not like to be in that position. Perhaps the problem is a little more serious and needs to be examined more carefully.  We cannot rely too much on the fact that pupil numbers are falling because other factors exacerbate the problem.  While falling enrolment numbers may ease the situation, it will not help in the long term.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment and I urge the Minister to continue her examination of this problem and to try to find solutions to it.  However, this problem, which did not arise overnight, will not be solved quickly or easily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is of great concern to parents, teachers and school management authorities in every part of the country.  The present position in relation to substitute teachers in primary schools is far from satisfactory. The difficulties have been outlined in great detail by Senator O'Toole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These problems and difficulties did not arise today or yesterday; they have always been there.  Some years ago, when there was a high level of unemployment among teachers, it was often difficult to obtain the services of a trained and qualified substitute.  This was almost invariably the case when a substitute was required at short notice or for a limited period.  The position today is even worse than it was at any time I can remember.  The situation was much better when I was going to primary school than it is now.  At that time <Col N="84" /> trained and qualified substitutes were freely available from among the ranks of the many female teachers who had to retire from teaching as a result of the marriage ban which was then in operation.</P>
    <P>At present there is a shortage of trained and qualified applicants for permanent positions.  It is understandable that qualified substitutes are almost impossible to find.  In most parts of the country the only hope of getting a trained and qualified substitute lies in being able to persuade a retired teacher to take up a substitute position.  In many cases retired teachers who agree to take up such positions only do so because they feel obligated to former colleagues or to a board of management.</P>
    <P>If the services of a trained and qualified substitute cannot be obtained, then the school principal or the board of management has little choice but to distribute the pupils among the other classes in the school or to employ an untrained person to supervise them. Both these solutions are far from satisfactory. Distributing the pupils among other classes can cause major problems for the classes and for their teachers. These classes are probably overcrowded already and the teachers are under enough strain without having additional pupils entrusted to their care.  Any teacher knows that such an arrangement has a disruptive and upsetting effect on the whole school.</P>
    <P>The employment of an untrained person to provide substitute cover for an absent teacher is also unsatisfactory. Apart from the other risks involved, it is unfair to the pupils who are entitled to be taught by and in the care of a qualified teacher while they are in school.  For these reasons there is a growing demand from teachers, parents and boards of management that arrangements should be put in place to put an end to the employment of untrained personnel in substitute and temporary positions in primary schools.</P>
    <P>This motion calls for the extension of the supply panel scheme on a nationwide basis to provide a comprehensive <Col N="85" /> system of coverage for approved teacher absences.  I support this call.  The present scheme should be extended until all schools have access to trained and qualified substitute teachers.  The motion also demands that this should be done through the provision of teachers in addition to those currently in the service. Teachers currently in the service who become available for redeployment as a result of demographic change or declining pupil enrolments should be used to reduce our high pupil teacher ratio.  The provision of additional teachers who will be required to put in place the nationwide network of supply panels should be addressed through the recruitment of qualified teachers who are currently employed in temporary positions or who are not currently employed in permanent positions and through substantially increasing the intake in the colleges of education over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The main argument which will be made against the nationwide extension of the supply panels will centre on cost. That argument is contained in the Minister's contribution.  However, it should be remembered that the payment of unqualified substitutes costs millions of pounds of taxpayers' money each year from which the State and the education service get a poor return.  Senator Norris pointed out that of a total of 167,317 days worked by substitute teachers in the school year 1994-95, 59,249 of these days were worked by untrained teachers at a cost of almost £3.5 million.  This situation should not and cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the proposals in this motion would solve the problem sooner rather than later.  Parents, teachers and boards of management would welcome a commitment from the Minister to the implementation of these proposals.  I understand the Minister has acknowledged that the supply panels, which are currently in operation on a pilot basis, are working satisfactorily and are providing an excellent service in the schools in their areas.  School principals and boards of management in these <Col N="86" /> areas are saved time and the hassle of trying to locate suitably qualified teachers to act as substitutes.  Pupils are happy to see familiar teachers returning to their schools as substitutes.  Parents are happy in the knowledge that their children are being taught by and in the care of trained and qualified personnel. When the supply panel network is in operation on a nationwide basis, parents will also be reassured by the fact that all teaching personnel in schools will have come through a recognised selection and appointments procedure, thereby ensuring that every class in every school is in the care of somebody who is capable, responsible and suitable to be left with young children.</P>
    <P>The last part of the motion calls for an increase in the student numbers in both graduate and normal courses in the colleges of education.  I support the arguments made in favour of that.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. I have great regard for the INTO. I remember a general secretary of the INTO who was most influential in the North.  He was a leader of thought and someone whom I admired.</P>
      <P>I cannot address this motion properly because I do not have a teaching background. However, I have visited approximately 150 primary schools in the North of Ireland and I know how teachers feel.  I come from a jurisdiction where the teaching profession has been under sustained and vicious attack for the past 17 years, and the attacks are mounting.  However, the only area of the teaching profession under attack is the one which deals with disadvantaged working class pupils.  I am glad Senator Quinn quoted the document, because if the Irish people have a high opinion of their teachers, they should hold on to it as strongly as possible.  As a consequence of the debate, whatever its outcome, I hope the INTO view will prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am similar to a listed building, because if someone looks through my windows, all types of strange old fashioned things will be revealed.  One <Col N="87" /> aspect I wish to reveal, although I am not sure it will be good news for the INTO, is that when the war ended and the 1947 Education Act was introduced in the United Kingdom, teachers were recruited on an emergency basis because of the proliferation of new schools, particularly grammar schools, but also many refurbished primary schools.  An emergency teacher training school was set in motion and the educational standard laid down for it was that the people should have had continuous education up to the age of 14 years.</P>
    <P>They were taken to Larkfield College and these teachers took the brunt of the early days of the new education age under the Labour Party Government in England.  Up to the late 1950s they coached pupils in conjunction with formally trained teachers and they did a splendid job.  I do not know whether there is any room for such a solution now, as a temporary measure, but these people were recruited in that way. When I signed on at the labour exchange, they asked me if I wanted to be an emergency trained teacher.  I said no because I still had money and I wanted to sit and drink for a while before I thought about working at all. Although I had a limited education, I was offered that opportunity.  I came to know emergency trained teachers very well and they did a splendid job.  I support the amendment but I hope the outcome will please both sides.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and I am pleased to contribute to this important motion.  We all accept the situation regarding substitute teachers is a total mess at present and needs to be urgently addressed.  As previous speakers said, at present 35 per cent of all teacher absences are covered by untrained teachers, a position nobody should accept.  As parents many Members have experience of what happens when a teacher is absent.  We are aware of the confusion caused by the use of untrained substitute teachers and <Col N="88" /> that, often at short notice, principals must resort to a variety of options, including splitting the classes and distributing the pupils among other classes in the school.</P>
      <P>From my experience, retired teachers must sometimes return to teach classes as substitute teachers.  On other occasions the school principal is forced to use somebody who is not a fully qualified teacher or to redeploy remedial teachers in the school to teach ordinary classes.  Children in primary schools are entitled to have a qualified teacher working with them all the time. The establishment of panels of substitute teachers, as proposed in the motion, is the only way to deal with the current unsatisfactory situation.</P>
      <P>In the past totally unsuitable people have been brought in as substitute teachers just because they were the only people available.  It is three years since a pilot project to supply substitute teachers was introduced in Castlebar, Dublin and Limerick.  This project proved that the substitute system can work and it is now time to extend the scheme nationwide.  Given the additional resources which would be required, there are financial implications.  For example, it will cost money to bring additional teachers onto the substitute panel.  The proposals outlined in the INTO briefing document show that establishing panels nationwide would cost approximately £13 million, which is approximately £2.75 more than the cost of the current system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one considers the total education budget, which was £2.1 billion last year, that is a small price to pay to end the current unacceptable system.  If one considers that it was possible to abolish third level fees with a stroke of a pen, it should be possible to find the small amount of money within the Department of Education's large budget to introduce an acceptable system of substitute teachers.  The entire primary education sector is important.  We are aware of its problems, not only in relation to substitute teachers but also regarding a shortage of remedial teachers; but we all <Col N="89" /> recognise that the primary sector is the most important in the educational system. If children are disadvantaged in any way when they leave this sector, they find it difficult to ever catch up and they will often enter the slow lane at second level.  They face permanent disadvantage for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>Resources should be targeted at the primary sector and for a small fraction, approximately 0.1 per cent, of the total education budget, it would be possible to bring about the situation proposed in the motion.  I accept that many substitute teachers have been in the system for a number of years and it is important appropriate training is made available to them.  Given the importance of the primary sector, I support the motion.</P>

      <P>One of the best things about Private Members' motions is that it provides Members with an opportunity to respond to issues as they arise. I am completely appalled by the cheap reactionary headlines which some Members continually put on the shoulders of teachers.  As a representative of my party &mdash; I suspect I speak, as Richard Nixon once said, for the silent majority in my party &mdash; we greatly admire the work of teachers throughout all sectors of the educational system. The good thing about the motion is that it gives me an opportunity to make that point.  We recognise that teachers are professionals working in situations which are more difficult than they were ten or 20 years ago.  They need our support, not just as legislators, but also through the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Making this point sometimes affords others the opportunity to make the type of reactionary statements newspapers like to pick up in their headlines. However, if this point is not made and the role of teachers is not valued in society, we will quickly go down the road, as Senator McAughtrey outlined, which was taken in Great Britain where teachers are pilloried weekly.  The services teachers must provide now are much more difficult than 20 years ago. They face the plethora of society's problems <Col N="90" /> daily and we must recognise this aspect and their professionalism.  We must also congratulate them on their role and function in society.</P>
    <P>I must declare an interest in this area. Five years ago I came through Trinity College, Dublin, where I completed a H.Dip. course and the one year training I received as a secondary school teacher was not adequate.  I know there are detailed proposals in the White Paper to change the system in which teachers are trained, particularly in the secondary education sector but I was not given all the knowledge I should have had during that year.  The time provided to acquire the Higher Diploma in Education is far too short.</P>
    <P>Many school managers exploit students studying for the Higher Diploma in Education.  I know of a school in this city where 12 higher diploma students were used during one academic year.  There were 32 teachers in that school.  The higher diploma students were not paid a penny for their time or effort.  The system in that school has gone on for far too long.  We must also ask probing questions about the management of some secondary schools, an area about which I know something.</P>
    <P>Before this debate I telephoned eight colleagues with whom I studied five years ago and learned that only one is teaching.  Questions must be asked by the Department of Education and by us, as legislators, why that situation pertains. Why are we training teachers when there is no employment for them? I do not accept the argument that the demand for teachers has been reduced over the past number of years because of the demographic change.  That is nonsense. The demographic change provides us with a great opportunity to right the wrongs of large classes and to prevent teacher burn out at a young age. I welcome comments by colleagues who have addressed that situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education must be congratulated.  Progress in politics is slow but one of the endearing achievements of the Minister has been the constant reduction of the pupil-teacher <Col N="91" /> ratio from 25 pupils per teacher to 22 pupils.  It is a substantial achievement and the Minister should be congratulated. From my contacts with people in the third level sector, I know there are hundreds of disappointed 21 and 22 year olds who cannot get into the departments of education in the universities. There is a huge supply of willing and able young teachers who want to work in our first and second level sectors. With the policy being pursued by the Government over the past number of years and with increased resources being made available for the primary sector in particular, I hope they will be given a chance.  The stipulation made by the Higher Education Authority a number of years ago of 700 is unrealistic and will not meet the demand for teachers which exists in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>For too long we have paid lip service to putting children first. We must provide properly qualified teachers in primary schools.  The day of asking a 6th class student to look after infants is long gone.  Too many people have been criticising teachers who are doing a good job.  There has been much criticism on radio programmes over the past few days about Senators retaining their teaching posts while being Members of this House.  I hope people will read in today's newspaper about a professional on £64,000 plus a private practice who also holds a seat in this House.  People should not attack just one section of the community who are doing a fine and difficult job.  An English politician once said that the wrong people were running the country and that bus drivers, council workers and hairdressers should be doing it because they always seem to have the best ideas.  It is easy for people to tell teachers how to do their job but if they had to go into a classroom it would be a different story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we need smaller classes, we should also have smaller schools.  Two hundred or 300 children in a school is too many.  It was easier to maintain discipline <Col N="92" /> in smaller schools because there would be no more than 70 or 80 pupils in one playground, which is manageable, and the percentage of difficult pupils would be smaller.  It is almost impossible to control children of primary school age, particularly in a school with up to 300 pupils.  We should revert to smaller schools.  In the past there were inter-school competitions and every school had a team.  Now only the top 15, an amalgamation of two or three schools, compete.  That was a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>Too much pressure is placed on teachers by parents.  Recently I heard a psychologist say the biggest problem students faced was parent expectation. Parents want their children to get honours in every subject, to be able to do the long or the high jump, to play the guitar, the violin or, to use an old term, the melodeon.  They want their children to be the best at everything; this is wrong.  When speaking in schools I often say that pupils should remember there can be only one, two or three places in any race.  As someone once wrote, in the race all honour lies, in the striving not the prize.  It is better for children to do things in their own way and in their own time.</P>
    <P>Years ago a teacher could give a child a lift home in a car or on the back of a bicycle, but today they are liable to be charged with sex abuse.  Teachers are blamed if a child slips in the classroom or in a hall.  We are placing considerable pressure on teachers today and it is not surprising that they are becoming burned out.  It is unfair of the public. People must realise that teachers cannot be held responsible for every problem which arises.</P>
    <P>Qualified teachers should be provided in all schools.  We have spent a lot of money educating people and it is not good enough to have untrained people taking classes and looking after children. Parents who employ childminders place their children in a better environment and obtain a more reasonable service.  If they send their children to school they require first class service <Col N="93" /> from a qualified teacher.  Nothing else is good enough.  It has been stated on many occasions that the first years at school are the most important in a child's life.  From five to nine years of age their personalities and minds are developed, trained and regulated.</P>
    <P>At present many children in our cities and towns do not attend school and spend their time joyriding, etc.  I spoke to a man yesterday who is experiencing great difficulty in keeping such children off his land.  In one week three cars were burnt out on his land by children between the ages of eight and ten years old.  Initially they had great fun smashing the windows of the cars before setting them alight.  Such children should be better cared for because teachers must endure this kind of behaviour on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>It is important that teachers are properly trained and that each child be sent to school.  Future history will record that children growing up today did not do as well as those who grew up in the Goldenbridge orphanage, despite its many shortcomings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the motion.  I do not understand how any Member can oppose this simple motion which calls on the Minister for Education to continue to take the necessary steps to ensure that the required numbers of trained and qualified teachers remain available.  One would have to be completely out of touch with reality to be unaware of the situation which prevails in our schools at all levels.  It was never more difficult to be a teacher than it is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have served on a teachers' selection board for almost 20 years and one of the standard questions put to prospective teachers' inquires is whether they believe they are capable of disciplining and controlling a class.  Interview boards conscientiously consider the replies received to this question and engage in <Col N="94" /> an assessment of character and ability. A teacher's selection hinges upon their reply to this question because most prospective applicants for a post are suitably qualified.  The selection boards are seeking something more from applicants because they realise the tasks and problems ahead.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a woman recently who informed me that her 11 year old son spat in his teacher's face.  She asked me what action to take and I gave her very positive advice.  I told her I would take her son to see his teacher and make him apologise.  I will not inform the House with regard to the second part of the advice I gave, but it was very positive.</P>
    <P>This motion should have the unanimous support of Members because it is the simplest piece of business to come before the House.  It is seeking a strengthening of teacher's positions. Those who vote against that motion for political or other reasons will suffer the consequences because this matter involves the fundamental of teaching young people how to behave and be good citizens.  That is an onerous responsibility for a teacher.  Discipline has largely disappeared at home.  In these prosperous times it is not unusual to see children in primary schools being given £20 by their parents.  Such children do not need to be concerned about their teachers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to express my strong views on this subject and I hope that politics will not decide the vote on the motion.  I appeal to Members of all political persuasions to be sensible because it is important that the motion be carried.</P>

      <P>I will deal with the matter if the Senator sends me a written message.  I thank the Members who contributed to an exhilarating and wide-ranging debate.  Teachers and the partners in education, parents and management, will appreciate the support expressed by Members during this debate.  The issues I have put forward represent the points of view of parents and management as much as they do those of teachers.</P>
      <P>I recently attended a meeting of the Catholic Primary School Management Association &mdash; CPSMA &mdash; and the National Parents Council.  Those organisations inquired why untrained people are being employed in schools and why the INTO is not taking some action in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have much sympathy with Senator McGowan's point regarding discipline and Senator Farrell's point about maintaining order in small schools.  It is important to recognise Senator Hayes' point about the exploitation of young teachers and the inadequacy of the one year training course.  He is correct in stating that demographic changes will not deal with the problem regarding the shortage of qualified substitute teachers. Some years ago the Minister's adviser and I spent many months considering demographic trends.  The figure quoted in this regard during the debate became known as a result of that work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> I take Senator Honan's point with regard to the financing of education.  I will return to this matter when dealing with other issues.  I am familiar with the points raised by Senator McAughtry.  In his memoirs, the Senator's colleague, John Hewitt, stated that his father was one of the few Protestant Unionists who remained a member of the INTO at the time of partition, which was a source of great support to my organisation.</P>
    <P>I concede that there is substance in Senator Kelly's point, which is similar to that made by Senator Hayes.  I have contacted that Department of Education on numerous occasions to state that the category of &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; should be added to those of &ldquo;trained&rdquo; and &ldquo;untrained&rdquo;.  Parents would feel more confident as a result.  Proposals have been put forward that this could be reflected in the way such people would be paid.  They would not be trained primary school teachers.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's argument is somewhat specious &mdash; I am sorry that he is not present to hear my reply &mdash; because the issue of career breaks is a red herring; Senator Kelly might not have been clear about that.  Teachers on career breaks are replaced by temporary teachers, not substitute teachers. This is a completely different category and forms no part of the arbitration.  It will have no impact about the availability or otherwise of training; that is important.  Substitute teachers cover for people who are on maternity leave, sick leave and a small number of approved absences such as jury service.  They do not deal with absences due to career breaks.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Quinn, ranged quite widely over the topic.  He made a comment about replacing quantity with quality.  I firmly and honestly believe that the Minister for Education would welcome this motion being passed here tonight.  It would strengthen her hand in negotiations.  I have put forward what I consider to be a highly responsible <Col N="97" /> motion.  I have put forward a point of view that represents the partners in education; I have costed it and it is budget neutral.  I am simply asking that the money now being used to pay untrained personnel to supervise in schools be used to set up the panel of supply teachers.  That would allow 230 teachers to be established immediately.  I recognise that this does not meet the needs of the system but if the Minister is right and we will not need so many in the future, it allows us to build up to it.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with two of the figures given here.  If we retain the present number of 20,500 teachers in the system, and apply that to the 444,000 pupils referred to in the Minister's speech, we get a pupil-teacher ratio of 21.6.  That is a reduction from the present ratio of 22.9.  Even allowing for that, the pupil-teacher <Col N="98" /> ratio will go down by 1 point between now and the turn of the century. If there is to be an improvement, we are all agreed it will not take place before then.  If the £10 million used for substitution was provided for the employment of young teachers the whole issue could be dealt with, although I am not asking that that be done.  I am asking Members to support a motion which does not cost the tax-payer an extra penny, which improves the quality of education and provides job opportunities for teachers, security for parents and quality for pupils.  This is what is wanted in education at this time.  I can rarely stand up here and make a proposal which does not cost the taxpayer and which improves the quality of education.  I ask for the support of all Members.  I ask them to reject the amendment and support the motion.</P>

      <P>I want to ask about the policy of the Incorporated Law Society for admitting students to its vocational courses and I ask the Minister to make representations to the Law Society to allow students who are completing their studies this year and those who have entered its degree courses prior to the court decision to be allowed to start them.  I refer here to the High Court decision of Miss Justice Laffoy on 2 September regarding the admission of the Law Society.  The Law Society sought to rectify the effect of this High Court ruling by modifying its regulations to validate retrospectively law degrees obtained on or before 22 September 1990.  By a notice placed in the national newspapers on 3 November last, the Law Society invited applications from persons seeking to be exempted from the requirements to sit the final examination, first part.  This notice stipulated, however, that a person must be a law graduate before 1 March 1996, thus excluding present law students from applying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> The Law Society policy in this regard was reinforced before Christmas when a snippet appeared in the national newspapers stating that the Law Society would not grant present law students exemptions.  These decisions have caused much grief and distress to present students who have put great effort, time and money into their studies to find that all they will receive when they graduate is a piece of paper.  After spending approximately £2,000 per annum on fees alone, law students now find themselves in the same position as non-law graduates.  Many students do not have the money to spend on private crammer courses in law to prepare to sit the final examination, first part.</P>
    <P>The students' arguments are as follows. They should be treated in the same manner as persons who graduated before 1 March 1996 by being given exemption status.  When students embarked on their legal studies they had a legitimate expectation that they would be granted exemptions once they completed their degrees.  This exemption should be honoured by the Law Society.  The present students are being discriminated against in the sense that, even though the High Court judge ruled that in so far as a law degree is a yard-stick by which one can measure the state of knowledge of substantive law of a person to whom it is awarded, Queen's University LLB degree reflects an inferior state of knowledge in this jurisdiction.  She added that Queen's University law students are not taught constitutional law, treaty law, post-1932 statute law or, with some exemptions, post-1922 case law of this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The students argue that they have a superior state of knowledge of the substantive law of this jurisdiction and should be given their exemptions.  Many students have already passed the required eight subjects for their final examination, first part before the decision of 22 September 1990 was delivered.  To be exempted all they need <Col N="101" /> do is graduate.  The cannot do so until June 1996 and are caught by the Law Society's decision to exclude persons who have not graduated before 1 March 1996 &mdash; a matter of just three months.</P>
    <P>The students argue that the Law Society's policy to exclude them from exemptions is designed to restrict access to the profession of solicitor.  The Law Society argues that there are no jobs for solicitors.  This is a fallacy and operates on the assumption of a fixed pie.  It is a crippling anti-competitive assumption which ignores the following facts.  Many solicitors are self-employed.  Newly qualified solicitors may not wish to practice in the Republic but rather in Europe or elsewhere.  The profession provides service to the public.  Thus, competition is healthy, our economy is continually expanding and can cope with an increase in the number of solicitors. The students cannot expect the Law Society to look at their position in an objective and impartial manner because the Law Society is controlled by its members, who are solicitors.</P>

      <P>My part of the time share was agreed.  First, I thank Senator Neville for allowing me to speak on this matter this evening.  Senator Neville has made a case for a number of students who entered a course of studies in good faith and have found themselves through no fault of their own caught up in a catch 22 situation which is not of their making.  This matter has not been resolved.  The students have been left hanging.  They do not know what the resolution of the situation will be.  Any fair-minded person who examines the plight in which they find themselves will <Col N="102" /> see that their questions have not been answered and right is on their side.  It is not good enough for one body after the other simply to wash its hands of the situation and allow the students to wait in the apparent hope of the authorities that this problem will go away.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Michael Howard, who would have liked to have spoken on the matter had there been time, in expressing our strong support for the case made by Senator Dan Neville.  I hope a speedy resolution in the interest of the students based on equity can be arrived at as soon as possible because these people should not be left hanging around waiting for a decision.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for raising this issue.  It gives me an opportunity to respond on behalf of the Minister for Justice.  However, I will have to keep my comments brief as the matter is the subject of two separate sets of High Court proceedings.</P>
      <P>First, the Minister for Justice is very well aware of the concerns of university law undergraduates about the outcome of what has become known as the &ldquo;Bloomer&rdquo; case and the decisions taken by the Law Society arising from that litigation. I think it would be useful to set out the background to the present situation which was well illustrated by the Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1994 a number of law students from Queen's University, Belfast, took an action in the High Court against the Law Society, Ireland, and the Attorney General arising from certain regulations made by the Law Society under the provisions of the Solicitors Acts.  The plaintiffs were seeking a declaration that law graduates of Queen's University, Belfast, were entitled to similar exemptions from the society's entrance examination as those enjoyed by university law graduates in the State, that the society was guilty of wrongful discrimination as regards Queen's University, <Col N="103" /> Belfast, law graduates and damages against the Law Society.  The High Court, which delivered its judgment on 22 September 1995, did not grant any of these reliefs.  However, the High Court held that the relevant regulation made by the society was invalid having regard to European law and toppled the society's exemptions regime.</P>
    <P>The law students appealed to the Supreme Court against the decision of the High Court and the appeal was heard by the Supreme Court on the 6th February last.  The Supreme Court granted a declaration that the relevant regulation was invalid.  In effect, it upheld the decision of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Following the High Court decision of 22 September 1995, the Law Society decided to allow those university law graduates who had obtained their degrees in the five years before the date of the High Court decision to apply before 1 March 1996 for exemptions from the entrance examination to the law school.  The Law Society also decided to grant these exemption arrangements to law graduates from Queen's University, Belfast, who had obtained their degrees in the five years before 22 September 1995.</P>
    <P>Under the Solicitors Acts, it is a matter for the Law Society to make regulations in regard to the education and training of solicitors.  The role of the Minister for Justice is limited to concurring or not concurring with any regulations submitted to her.  In effect, she has a power of veto.  She does not have the power to initiate regulations herself.</P>
    <P>I understand that last February the Minister asked the chairperson of the Advisory Committee on Legal Education and Training to consider the implications of the Supreme Court decision and to make such recommendations on the matter as it sees fit.  That committee is chaired by Mr Justice Ronan Keane and includes representatives of the King's Inns, the Law <Col N="104" /> Society, the universities, the Higher Education Authority, the Union of Students in Ireland, ICTU, IBEC and my Department.  The functions of the committee include examining all matters concerning Irish legal education, including academic legal education and professional legal education.  It may make recommendations to the relevant bodies and may advise those bodies as to the manner in which such recommendations may most practically be put into effect.</P>
    <P>However, in view of the new legal proceedings to which I referred at the outset, it has not been possible for ACLET to consider the matter.  The position is that since the Minister asked the committee to consider the implications of the &ldquo;Bloomer&rdquo; decision, two further sets of High Court proceedings have issued arising from that case and the decisions of the Law Society.  One of the actions is being taken by the University of Wales, Portobello College, Dublin, and graduates of that college.  I understand that the other proceedings, which are by way of judicial review, have been issued by more than 800 persons who are pursuing undergraduate courses for law degrees in universities in the State.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I have outlined and having regard to the fact that proceedings are before the High Court, I hope Senators agree it would not be appropriate for the Minister for Justice to comment in any detail about the matter until the proceedings have concluded. I hope Senators will understand.</P>

      <P>Mulhuddart national school is a small four teacher school.  It is the oldest school in the area having been established by the Blanchardstown Patriotic Society in 1822 &mdash; an organisation which concerned itself with the education of children in the villages of west Dublin.  The school is housed in a <Col N="105" /> building erected in 1926.  For the past number of years parents and teachers have made every effort to have a remedial teacher appointed to their school.  There are 111 pupils on the roll and approximately 15 of them are in chronic need of remedial help.</P>
      <P>Originally the school made a joint application with Scoil Oilibhéir, the all-Irish school in Coolmine, to share a remedial teacher if one should be appointed.  The school was unsuccessful. For a number of years they also made joint applications with Ladyswell national school to share a remedial teacher.  However, while a remedial teacher and several above quota teachers were appointed for Ladyswell school, Mulhuddart school was left without the services of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>Last year another joint application was made, on this occasion with Kilbride national school.  A remedial teacher was appointed last September for Kilbride school but no provision was made for Mulhuddart school.  Mulhuddart is now the only national school in west Dublin without the services of a remedial teacher.  The parents and teachers feel strongly that the children, who are as in need of remedial teachers as any other children, are being discriminated against.  The parents have paid for the services of a remedial teacher after school hours for the past number of years and they are extremely concerned.  They have decided to launch a public campaign to inform the local politicians of the situation.  They have asked me on their behalf to bring this matter to the Minister's attention in the hope that a shared remedial teacher will be sanctioned for Mulhuddart national school.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> The Minister is not in a position to make remedial teacher posts available to the primary school sector.  As has been indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service.  However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of under-achievement in primary schools.</P>
    <P>Substantial additional resources have been allocated to this area in recent years.  In 1995, an additional 55 remedial teachers were appointed to primary schools and 223 schools benefited from this allocation.  This brought the total number of remedial teachers in place to 1,188.  Of the 3,209 ordinary national schools throughout the country, approximately 2,285 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or a shared basis.  Of the 408 ordinary national schools in County Dublin, 394 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis.  This includes 16 schools allocated a remedial service with effect from the commencement of the current school year as part of the distribution of 55 posts.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need following the collection and analysis of information from the schools by the Department's primary inspectorate and also having consideration for data submitted by schools.  This means that 98 per cent of pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Dublin currently enjoy a remedial service.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has indicated to the House her intention to review the needs in this area and consider how best these needs can be addressed within available resources. When the Minister is in a position to further extend the remediation service, <Col N="107" /> Mulhuddart national school will receive every consideration.</P>
    <P>At this stage, 87 per cent of the pupils in our primary schools have the possibility of access to a remedial teacher. This is a big improvement on the position when the Minister for Education took office in 1993 when 77 per cent of <Col N="108" /> pupils had the possibility of such access. It is a matter of regret to the Minister that it is not possible at present to meet the needs of all pupils for remedial teaching as, unfortunately, she does not have unlimited resources.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 1 May 1996.</P>
