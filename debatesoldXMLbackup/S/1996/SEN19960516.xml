      <P>I have notice from Senator Sherlock that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to outline his policy on the promotion and marketing of venison.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to introduce a special scheme of premium compensation for winter beef producers.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the near future on the value of afforestation to the nation. The Finnish Prime Minister is visiting this country at present.  Finland is economically self-sufficient and it uses its waste timber wisely.  This country should consider getting more value from its timber.  We export logs, which is not the wisest thing to do.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to provide time for a debate on the residential property tax.  House prices are rising and if this tax was abolished, prices might increase further.  The mechanism used to control prices in the construction industry is to increase interest rates.  I am concerned about mortgage holders who earn more than £12,000 per year and who would not qualify for a local authority loan, but who earn less than £30,000 for RPT.</P>

      <P>It is important to hear the other side of the argument.  A family earning £20,000 per year with a mortgage of £30,000 would pay an extra £400 a year for each 1 per cent increase.  That would impose an intolerable burden on such families.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on railway crossings.  Nobody seems to know if the local authority or Iarnród Éireann has responsibility for them.  The laws should be changed if necessary because great controversy has arisen in most local authorities as to who is responsible for them.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on agriculture.  This is a matter of urgency because agriculture is in crisis.  The farmers who suffered most during the beef crisis will not be adequately compensated.  The six weeks' subsidy for the rendering industry will expire next Tuesday.  Will that mean a further reduction in beef prices? The dispute which prevented farmers from getting results for tuberculosis tests is over.  However, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should not get any credit for that because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Ormonde asked about the legislation which will be taken this session and I can give the House a final list.  The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill is being taken in the House at the moment and will be completed this session.  The Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Bill and the Health (Amendment) Bill, which proposes to strengthen the statutory accountability of health boards and their chief executive officers, will be taken before the end of the session.  I also hope the Refugee Bill will complete its passage.  The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill will be introduced and, <Col N="792" /> I hope, completed.  We are dealing with the Dumping at Sea Bill at the moment. The Dublin Light Rail Transport Bill will begin its life in the Dáil shortly and it is expected that it will be passed before the end of the session.  The Control of Horses Bill will be published shortly but I do not think it will be completed before the end of the session; however, this depends on our timetable. The Irish Take-over Panel Bill, the Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Bill, which results from an EU directive, the Bill to provide the statutory basis for the governance of Tallaght hospital, a short An Bord Bia Bill, which will provide for consumer representation on that company's board, the Pensions Bill, which is at Committee Stage in the other House, and the Electoral Bill will be taken this session.  We will not necessarily complete all Stages of these Bills but we will commence all and complete most of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>That Bill is at an advanced stage of drafting but it will not be taken in either House this session.  If Members have any other queries later, I will be happy to answer them.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan raised the question of afforestation.  This is important but there is no room for it on our schedule for this session but perhaps we could take it in the autumn.</P>
      <P>I listened to Senator Townsend with interest, as I always do.  I do not think it is possible to have a debate on one specific tax.  However, a debate on the wider issue of local services and their funding would be worth having and I would be amenable to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Burke raised the matter of railway crossings.  This is important but it might be better for him to raise it initially on the Adjournment.  Senator Rory Kiely asked for a debate on agriculture. <Col N="793" /> I do not have any plans at the moment for another debate on this issue between now and the end of the session but things may change and, if need be, we can look at it again.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan raised the question of a general debate on health.  I thought it better to structure health debates in a focused way and I do not think anybody would disagree that drugs is the most crucial health issue at present.  The debate this morning will be a welcome contribution to that overall debate.  I hope to have more structured debates because we have found in the past that debates which are too widely framed can have little impact.  There will be further debates on specific aspects of health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): As well as distributing my speech, I have asked my officials to distribute a copy of the press release which contains the Government decisions of 21 February on reducing the demand for drugs and a copy of the Eastern Health Board's plan, which was a response to these decisions.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on the important issue of drug misuse.  I intend to outline the steps being taken by the Department of Health to tackle this serious problem which particularly affects young people and which is the concern of parents and politicians alike in every town and village in Ireland today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no hard data available on the exact number of drug misusers in Ireland.  Estimates of the number vary from 3,000 to 7,000.  The Health Research Board report of 1994 gave a figure of 2,702 people who were treated in the greater Dublin area.  It must be emphasised that this is the number of people receiving treatment and that the number of people misusing drugs is greatly in excess of this figure.  Future <Col N="794" /> Health Research Board reports will give statistics on treated drug misuse on a countrywide basis as opposed to the greater Dublin area.  The board has already taken steps to access other treatment sources countrywide in order to compile this data.</P>
    <P>It is recognised generally that there is a deficiency with regard to gathering of data on drug misusers.  The recent Government decisions recognised this deficiency and each health board will now be requested to undertake research on the extent of the problem in its area, the location of the problem areas and the types of drugs being misused.  This information will give a more precise indication as to the extent of the problem and will allow health boards to plan their drug strategies accordingly.</P>
    <P>In the absence of hard data, other evidence from Garda seizures and health service personnel and anecdotal sources indicate that Ecstasy and cannabis use are widespread.  In the greater Dublin area, these problems are compounded by a serious heroin problem.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that the problem of drug misuse is a complex and difficult one to which there are no easy or instant solutions.  The strategy to prevent drug misuse, which was published in 1991, employs a multi-disciplinary approach, requiring action in the areas of supply reduction, demand reduction and increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes, together with a comprehensive co-ordinated structure geared towards their effective implementation.  The Department of Health, in co-operation with other Departments and State agencies, has been implementing this strategy.</P>
    <P>Despite this strategy, it was clear to me that more dramatic and forceful action was needed to meet the growing menace of drug abuse and, in particular, the sinister heroin epidemic in the Dublin area.  Accordingly, I went to Government with a package of proposals and, on 20 February 1996, the Government approved a series of new demand reduction measures to prevent drug misuse. The objectives of the proposals are <Col N="795" /> based on two key elements: reducing the number of people turning to drug misuse in the first instance through information, education and prevention programmes and providing a range of treatment options for those addicted to drugs, the ultimate objective of which must be a return to a drug free lifestyle, although this may not be a realistic goal in every instance, in the short term at least.</P>
    <P>The features of the Government decisions are as follows.  No steps should be taken to legalise or decriminalise the use of so-called soft drugs such as cannabis and there should be further development of education and prevention programmes in conjunction with the Department of Education and other relevant agencies.  This will include the development of a multi-media awareness and prevention campaign, a programme aimed specifically at deprived areas and the other educational programmes outlined in the Department of Education's action plan.</P>
    <P>Specific measures include a total of £500,000 will be spent on awareness campaigns, including a major public media campaign which will be launched this year; each health board will launch information and awareness campaigns aimed at young people and their parents, which will focus on the dangers of drug misuse, with particular emphasis on the misuse of Ecstasy; health boards should in future play a more active role in local initiatives on education and prevention; my Department's Health Promotion Unit, in conjunction with the Department of Education and other relevant agencies and groups, will design a specific education and health promotion package for use in the inner city areas of Dublin and which could be adapted for use in other high risk areas.</P>
    <P>A task force under the aegis of the interdepartment policy committee on local development will examine the root social factors which give rise to drug misuse in the Dublin inner city area and recommend how best local community groups can be harnessed to prevent misuse <Col N="796" /> and how partnership arrangements with parents on prevention strategies should be structured.</P>
    <P>New management and evaluation procedures should be put in place for the services of the Eastern Health Board area.  These procedures should be ongoing and be directed to examine best international practice for application in Ireland.  Specific measures include a programme manager is to be appointed with specific responsibility for the drugs misuse programme &mdash; this post has already been advertised; a system of external evaluation is to be established for the services in the Eastern Health Board area and all services will be funded and co-ordinated by the Eastern Health Board once the new management arrangements are put in place.</P>
    <P>Treatment programmes should continue to be developed and have as their objective in the short term control of the drug misuser's addiction within the context of the long-term aim of a return of the drug misuser to a drug free lifestyle. Methadone maintenance programmes should continue as a valid and successful element in treatment services and the role of general practitioners in providing this service is to be strengthened. Specific measures include the ultimate aim of demand reduction measures must be that those misusing drugs and particularly hard drugs will, after appropriate counselling, treatment and rehabilitation, lead a drug free lifestyle. Methadone maintenance programmes are a valid and successful part of an integrated response to the problem of heroin abuse and such programmes should continue to be developed; drug treatment centres are to put in place appropriate measures to ensure that the leakage of methadone on to the illicit market is eliminated; the Eastern Health Board is to engage in widespread consultation with community groups in the establishment of community drug treatment facilities and negotiations with local communities should be handled with the utmost sensitivity; the emergency response service in Dublin is to be extended to a 24 hour <Col N="797" /> service and each health board is to establish a contact service which will provide information, advice and assistance on drugs to the public.  While heroin misuse is confined largely to Dublin, all boards are to have in place an emergency response if an addict or addicts should come to stay in the areas or be stranded there.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board regional co-ordinating committee is to make proposals on the provision of appropriate services for persons who smoke heroin. Adequate detoxification programmes are to be developed and health boards are to be responsible for the development of appropriate counselling, treatment and rehabilitation programmes, including those provided by voluntary bodies and therapeutic communities, to lead a drug free lifestyle.  Local co-ordination committees representing all local interests should be established at health board level to develop and monitor education and prevention measures and service provision and the demand reduction subcommittee of the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse should be comprised largely of representatives from these local committees.</P>
    <P>Specific measures include each health board is to establish local co-ordination committees to involve all bodies in the fight against drugs; each health board is to formally involve local voluntary and community groups on their co-ordinating committees which gives them a direct input on the decision making process and the national subcommittee on demand reduction is to be composed largely of representatives from the eight regional committees under the chairmanship of an assistant secretary from the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>A new unit is to be established to ensure that all businesses involved with controlled drugs comply fully with the terms of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, and the UN Convention on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.</P>
    <P>Liaison arrangements between the health services and the prison services <Col N="798" /> should be put in place to ensure that co-ordinated treatment regimes for prisoners are in place.  It is further agreed that the national co-ordinating committee be given specific responsibility to achieve maximum co-ordination.</P>
    <P>There should be a greater emphasis on providing basic information on the extent and type of drug misuse and more research should be undertaken as to best approaches to demand reduction services.</P>
    <P>Specific measures include that each health board is to put in place a system of monitoring on an ongoing basis so they will be fully informed of the level of abuse in their areas and of any new trends which may be emerging.  This country is to partake with a number of other European countries under the aegis of the Council of Europe as part of a working group to look at approaches to treatment in various member states.  Other measures include that all health boards are to be mindful of the security risk to personnel and property in the drugs misuse service. The Eastern Health Board is to discuss with the Garda the discreet local arrangements to be put in place to alleviate the nuisance caused by addicts congregating at treatment centres.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Eastern Health Board development plan for services in the Dublin area.  This arises from the Government decision which requested all health boards to produce such plans. However, because of the scourge of heroin in the Eastern Health Board area, it is appropriate that we spend more time on its plan rather than on the others.</P>
    <P>An evaluation of existing services in the Eastern Health Board, which was carried out by Dr. Michael Farrell of the National Addiction Centre and Institute of Psychiatry, University of London, and Mr. Ernst Buning of the Bureau of International Affairs in Amsterdam, noted that by international standards, there was a good level of drug treatment service provision in the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>Based on the recommendations of this evaluation and on the proposals in <Col N="799" /> the Government's decisions, the board has developed a comprehensive plan for the development of its services during 1996.  The plan includes ten specific proposals as follows: (1) increasing access to methadone maintenance treatment, increasing the number of patients on treatment from 1,400 to 2,500 through additional prescribing by GPs, the establishment of additional drug treatment centres and extension of services in existing centres and the introduction of a mobile service providing methadone; (2) the introduction of a seven day dispensing service in community drug treatment centres; (3) providing a rapid response to young problem drug users, including heroin smokers, through early intervention, particularly in the inner city areas; (4) increasing the number of rehabilitation places from 60 to 250 per annum; (5) increasing the number of detoxification beds in Cherry Orchard Hospital from ten to 15; (6) extending outpatient detoxification through both community drug centres and local GPs; (7) establishing a regional education and prevention unit to deliver awareness, education and prevention; (8) providing parenting programmes for drug using parents in the north and south inner city; (9) establishing an information database and (10) establishing a regional telephone helpline.</P>
    <P>It is expected that if this plan is implemented in full, significant progress can be made in reaching the vast majority of drug misusers who are at present in need of treatment services.  I have asked my officials to circulate the complete plan to Members.  The plan is moving in the right direction.  We are still discussing some details of it so if Senators wish to make comments on the plan, these can still be taken on board before we finalise it.</P>
    <P>In my view the most significant aspect of this plan is the involvement of general practitioners in the provision of methadone to misusers.  Up to now, GPs have been slow to get involved in this service and I can understand their fears <Col N="800" /> in this respect.  They may be afraid of the effect on their practices of having heroin addicts among their clients; they may even be afraid of violence.</P>
    <P>A pilot scheme initiated in March this year aims at implementing all the elements of the Protocol for the prescribing of methadone.  These include the provision of a treatment card to all drug misusers and the registering of all patients being treated on a central treatment list.  A facilitator will also liaise with GPs, pharmacists and community drug treatment centres.  It is hoped that with the success of this scheme, which is being independently evaluated, a number of other GPs will be happy to become involved in the prescribing of methadone.  In my address to GPs at the Irish College of General Practitioners' conference last Friday I asked for their assistance in addressing this serious problem and I was encouraged by their response. Indeed, a further meeting held this week between my officials and representatives of the college to pursue this issue further was very constructive and I am confident of a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>The expansion of health services alone, however, will not remove the problem of drug misuse from our society.  In common with our European counterparts, Ireland's hard drug &mdash; heroin &mdash; problem can be linked with several socio-economic factors.  For example, of those who received treatment in 1994, 84 per cent were unemployed while 60 per cent had left school with the minimum education.</P>
    <P>Drug misuse in these circumstances needs a far reaching, multi-agency approach, which tackles not just the results of misuse, crime and ill-health, but also the root causes of the problem, which are linked with a multiplicity of socio-economic factors.  In areas such as the north and south inner city, local communities have come together in a positive way to assist statutory and voluntary agencies working in the drug misuse area.  With this support, local GPs are becoming involved in treatment, and preventive initiatives are <Col N="801" /> being undertaken among parents who are drug misusers.  Rehabilitation programmes such as the Saol and Saoirse programmes provide drug misusers who have become stabilised with the skills necessary to integrate back into society.</P>
    <P>In the fight against drugs we should concentrate our efforts on prevention beforehand rather than rehabilitation afterwards.  Outside of the Dublin area, where the main drugs of misuse are ecstasy and cannabis, education continues to be the first line of defence.  The second level school based programme, which was jointly launched by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Education, is now in place in over 50 per cent of schools, with teachers being provided with training to deliver the programme effectively.  A similar programme for primary schools will be introduced next autumn.</P>
    <P>My Department's health promotion unit and the Department of Education continue to support the youth health programme being co-ordinated by the National Youth Council of Ireland which is at present drawing up guidelines for youth leaders on how to deal with drug misuse.  The HPU also supports parenting programmes and the efforts of a number of voluntary groups involved in education and prevention.  It also relaunched &ldquo;Drugs Questions &mdash; Local Answers&rdquo; last year.  This programme can provide local communities with a useful approach to addressing local drug problems.  A national media awareness campaign, supported by a wide range of printed materials, will provide adequate information on drugs to parents, youth leaders and young people themselves.</P>
    <P>So, as you can see, my Department is actively engaged in a multifaceted approach to tackling the drug problem. We cannot do it on our own, but need the support of community leaders, politicians, educators and parents.  The Government decisions have clearly marked the way towards progress.  My colleagues in other Departments, particularly <Col N="802" /> the Departments of Justice and Education, have also pivotal roles to play in this process.  I am confident, however, that we may see the fruits of our labour soon, with a reduction in the toll and misery caused by drug misuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He spoke of his announcement of a comprehensive range of measures to reduce the demand for drugs, and I accept there are some concrete proposals in it. Clearly, if the Minister's proposals were comprehensive and had any chance of working, this announcement would be welcomed by every Member of the House.  It would be welcomed if the Minister mentioned just once in his proposals how he will fund the increased services necessary to combat this crisis. However, the Minister's announcement contains none of these things and I think he may have mistaken &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; for &ldquo;long&rdquo;.  He announced a long list of measures with no real indication of how, when or by whom they can be implemented.  In fact, he indicated that the Eastern Health Board will implement these provisions.</P>
      <P>Two nights ago an alleged drug dealer was beaten to death not far from this House.  The worrying backdrop to this death is that many ordinary decent people in the communities in which we all live will not condemn the killing. Drugs are killing our children, communities and, ultimately, society.  They wreak havoc on all our lives.  I condemn unequivocally this killing.  However, it is a further sign of the reduced respect for life which the scourge of drugs has caused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem goes far beyond the direct damage inflicted on those addicted.  Drugs are directly responsible for the vast amount of violent crime in Ireland today.  This is particularly true in Dublin, where muggings, assaults, handbag snatches, theft from cars and aggravated burglary are almost an hourly occurrence, with virtually every person you meet having been affected in some way.  Yet the Minister and the <Col N="803" /> Government seem so unaware of the crisis unfolding around them that he comes here today with a series of bland platitudes and aspirations.  Worse than that, he has the nerve to propose yet another task force to carry out another special study.</P>
    <P>We know about the problem, its causes and most of us know what needs to be done.  I can tell the Minister here and now of the most important step he can take to combat drugs.  Anybody with a grain of sense can tell him.  The engine driving the drugs trade is vast amounts of money.  If the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues make drug dealing unprofitable, it will not occur. Attack the assets of major dealers unless their source is justifible, demand explanations to the Revenue of unaccounted wealth and investigate closely the assets of suspected dealers.  This problem requires a committed and aggressive approach but the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues seem unwilling to make such an approach.</P>
    <P>The drugs issue cannot be separated from the overall law and order record of the Government, which is truly appalling.  The stop-go on prisons, the failure to legislate, particularly on the key issue of bail, and the arrogant refusal to consider Opposition legislation on law and order issues is not the record of a Government which has the commitment required to tackle the drugs problem of Ireland today.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right to state that local, voluntary and community groups have a crucial role to play.  I believe that the alleviation of the horror of drugs for users and their families is an issue best dealt with at community level.  Despite the Minister's very public announcement, I see no sign that he has set about consulting people at a community level on how he will involve them in his plans. His record in this area is far from impressive, and I would refer specifically to previous Eastern Health Board decisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some interesting points, but I want to deal with the Eastern <Col N="804" /> Health Board's proposals on co-ordinated, directed, focused campaigns on addiction treatment.  In my constituency, as the Minister will be aware as he referred to it in his speech, the Eastern Health Board came to inform, not consult, the communities that it proposed to open a methadone distribution clinic, a needle exchange facility and counselling service, not for addicts in the greater Blanchardstown area but for addicts in community care area six, that is, Finglas, Cabra and Blanchardstown, in a small caretaker's house which had subsequently been used as a school for autistic children.  When the Eastern Health Board was asked about the level of abuse in Dublin 15, it had to admit it could not quantify it.  While I recognise there is a need to provide methadone treatment facilities, needle exchange facilities and counselling service, there is no need for the staff of the health boards to decide to proceed half-cocked to offer a service to the communities just because they have a building when they have no idea about the need for such a service.  I think the health board has put that proposal on a back burner for six months and I await its long-term outcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister should proceed to implement his proposals.  They will do some good and I would acknowledge that many of the Minister's proposals would coincide with the policies of most parties in this House, but he needs to make sufficient funds available to ensure they can be implemented properly. Certainly, from the kind of representations which I am getting at constituency level, the general health services are underfunded to an extent which they have not been for a number of years, so I want the Minister to indicate exactly what finance will be made available for the package of proposals he is recommending.</P>
    <P>More importantly, the Minister must return to Cabinet and convince his colleagues in the Departments of Justice, Education and Finance that much more needs to be done.  In his conclusion, the Minister stated that we need a comprehensive <Col N="805" /> multi-agency approach.  All strategies to combat drug abuse have made the same point, that unless we can involve the Departments of Education, Justice and Health there was no way of making an impact on the problem, which is growing daily.  However, once again, we see one arm of Government heading off at a pace alone.  It looks like the Minister is appealing to his Cabinet colleagues to at least join him in the fight against drugs, but there is no co-ordinated approach.</P>
    <P>I know for a fact, from knocking on constituents' doors two nights ago, that people know of unemployed people living in housing estates who are drawing the dole but seem to have huge wealth. There seems to be no attempt by any of the Government agencies to find out how people are able to live in expensive houses, own cars and still draw the dole. There was a famous case, and a number of other instances, where such people also had local authority dwellings. There is no co-ordinated approach, and unless there is such an approach, we are really doing nothing.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals appear to address those who have a problem.  I commend and welcome that, but that is only one aspect of the matter.  All the health board strategies and policies which have been agreed focus on reducing demand, and then supply, which would be the Department of Justice side of the matter if that was happening, but it is not.  The way to reduce demand is through education.  I do not see the Minister for Education's involvement in this area as being particularly enlightening or huge.  I know that the voluntary bodies, such as the Lions Club, are paying for an educational package for some of the post-primary schools in my constituency.  The Government and the Department of Education are failing miserably if charitable groups must fund educational packages.</P>
    <P>The Garda say they do not have sufficient powers in relation to the sale of drugs in that a person must be found in possession of drugs.  It does not matter <Col N="806" /> that neighbours and members of the community regularly telephone the Garda to inform them of unusual comings and goings in houses.  The power to get warrants is very restricted.  I know of instances where gardaí staked out communities to try to swoop on known drug dealers only to discover that their equipment, including walkie-talkies, was dead.  Yesterday the newspapers said that gardaí did not have the necessary forms in Garda stations and that they had to drive to another station to get forms and charge sheets.</P>
    <P>The situation in relation to drugs is appalling.  The Minister acknowledges that Dublin and the other cities are suffering dreadfully as a result of the drug scourge.  Yet the Government has not set up special drug units in every district. When we ask the Minister for Education to provide remedial teachers, she says that is the primary school teacher's job in the first instance.  We need a specialised force in every district to deal with drugs, but the Minister for Justice is not moving in that direction.  While I recognise gardaí are empowered and obliged to deal with the problem of drug sales and drug pushing, they are not fully equipped to do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the involvement of GPs. This proposal has the support of GPs in the community and it will make a significant difference to the lives of addicts seeking to come off drugs.  The sister of the person beaten to death two days ago said that he tried to come off drugs for one year but that the pushers pushed freebies into his letterbox.  The Minister's proposals are not as aggressive as drug pushers pushing freebies into letterboxes. We must match that type of cunning.</P>
    <P>This document tries to address those using drugs.  Because it does not have a multi-agency approach and is there no overall Government strategy to deal with this problem, only a specific area of this is being dealt with.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued when the Minister said that by international standards it was discovered that there was a good level of drug treatment service provision in <Col N="807" /> the Eastern Health Board area.  That flies in the face of reality and his speech. If that was the case he would not have put forward these measures and he would not have to deal with queues of drug addicts looking for methadone or physeptone.  If the Minister wants this strategy for the treatment of users to work, he must ensure that it is comprehensive. We should not open a treatment centre in one community area and six months later open another down the road.  That strategy was opposed by communities, including my own, which I supported.  The health board's proposal in my area was to attract drug users from the adjoining communities.  Unless treatment centres are opened at the same time, this support strategy for those trying to come off drugs will not work.</P>
    <P>I recognise the Minister faces difficulties in that there is not total Cabinet support for any concerted approach to combating drugs.  There has not been a reduction in drug use in the community. Drugs are cheaper and more widely available in schools and in the community. The Minister's proposals have some merit but have little chance of survival if they are not matched by a Government commitment to do something in the other areas, because nothing is being done in the education and justice areas.  He will be left handing out methadone, while the queue will get longer because there is no reduction in demand and supply is not being curbed. I wish the Minister and the health boards well in what they are attempting to do, but this scourge will continue unless his Cabinet colleagues join in the fight against the drugs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming here to deal with this problem again.  Drug misuse is a complex problem and requires various responses at different levels.  There is no single or simple solution and there is a need to regularly review and modify responses to problems to achieve an efficient and cost effective service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> The services of the Eastern Health Board, of which I am a member, for drug misuse have undergone rapid expansion in the past three years and they continue to expand under the high level of executive and board support for the development of these services. These services could not have expanded over the past three or four years unless they had got the necessary finances, which Senator McGennis mentioned, from the Department of Health.  Some £3.5 million has been made available this year and £4.5 million will be made available in a full year.  The Department of Health has provided finances to enable the health board to carry out its programme.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to review the service programme of the Eastern Health Board, which the Minister attached to his speech.  As Members will note, ten specific proposals have been detailed in the plan.  Each proposal has four subheadings &mdash; target date, outcome, output and estimated cost.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the methadone service.  There are currently 1,400 people on methadone treatment in the Eastern Health Board area, which is no mean achievement.  It is proposed to increase this number to 2,500 by the end of 1996.  Waiting lists are a problem in relation to methadone treatment and it is important that we reduce them.  They are a cause of concern for individuals, communities and organisations for various reasons.  Drugs users awaiting admission are at greater risk of contracting HIV by injecting drugs.  They may also cause disturbances because of their drug use and barter.  There is also the possibility of the consumption of non-supervised methadone.  People hanging around clinics often make demands on those using its services to sell their methadone.  It is important that we reduce waiting lists so that only a small number will need to attend clinics.</P>
    <P>As a result of these problems, people and organisations perceive the drug service as failing in its task and interpret it as a sign of an inadequate governmental <Col N="809" /> response to the drug problem, which is not the case.  The Eastern Health Board intends to tackle the waiting list by extending the hours of two clinics and recruiting additional counsellors and outreach workers to provide support to general practitioners and the introduction of special arrangements to deal with crisis cases.  As the Minister said, an important aspect is getting GPs involved in methadone treatment programmes. The Department of Health, in conjunction with drugs specialists and some leading practitioners, has drawn up a Protocol for the management of drug users in primary care.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has transferred 100 individuals as part of the strategy to move stabilised addicts from specialist services to primary care. However, this is contingent on the willingness of GPs to participate in such a programme.  A number of practioners are prepared to develop this programme and it is planned that a minimum of a further 200 drug users will enter general practice treatment this year.  However, this will only involve addicts who have been stabilised in the special care centre.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed as an interim measure to introduce a methadone programme using a mobile bus.  A bus has already been converted for this purpose and is available for immediate use.  It will serve various neighbourhoods and it is possible it will be able to deal with a maximum of 40 clients per location.  In view of the opposition of the public to treatment centres in their areas, it has been suggested that one of the sites for the bus should be Dr. Steeven's Hospital, the headquarters of the Eastern Health Board.  I proposed this at a health board meeting and it was agreed.</P>
    <P>Detoxification plays an important role in enabling drug users to achieve a drugs free lifestyle.  The health board has ten detoxification beds at Cherry Orchard and it is proposed to extend this to 15 beds.  It is also proposed to provide outpatient detoxification through community drug centres.  This will be done by enabling practitioners to <Col N="810" /> provide detoxification with community support.</P>
    <P>The rapid growth in the scale of the coverage and complexity of the drugs service in the Eastern Health Board in recent years and the proposed further growth has given rise to the urgent need to strengthen the management structures relating to the services.  At present the health board has three programme managers for special hospital care, general hospital care and community care. It is now proposed to appoint a fourth programme manager.  In addition, it is proposed that all the initial services, including those for alcohol addiction, should ultimately be amalgamated under the fourth manager, who will also be responsible for the services for adults who are homeless and disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a fourth programme manager has received Government approval.  Advertisements have been placed in newspapers and I am sure an appointment will be made in the near future.  I stress to the Minister the urgency of this appointment.  The entire programme outlined in the Eastern Health Board's ten proposals hinges on the appointment of a manager to carry it out.  The Government has also approved the appointment of two consultant psychiatrists in addition to the consultant psychiatrist already appointed by the drug treatment centre at Trinity Court.  This will allow the board to subdivide its region into three catchment areas and facilitate a move which will further improve the co-ordination of services.  Liaison with prison services will also be strengthened with the appointment of the two new consultant psychiatrists.</P>
    <P>Regarding treatment in prisons, the international consultants who reviewed the Eastern Health Board programme were of the opinion that the appointment of a consultant with specific prison sessions is a major resource investment in enhancing links between prison and community services.  However, they were also of the opinion that there is no infrastructure to support this level of input.  It was their considered view that <Col N="811" /> some community drug workers must be used in the prison services so as to construct a prison drug team with good links with the three sectors of the community services.</P>
    <P>They were also of the view that the most popular form of drug treatment is drug free therapeutic communities and the possibility of developing such facilities should be explored further.  The Minister for Justice has established a drug free unit in Mountjoy and the Coolmine therapeutic community appears to be the best service to develop such an approach.</P>
    <P>I make these points because I am somewhat shocked by a headline in today's <i>Irish Times</i>, &ldquo;Substitute for heroin is itself a killer, says Harbison&rdquo;.  The report states:</P>
    <P>The drug methadone, used by hundreds of addicts as a heroin substitute, is itself a potential killer and is certainly not a safe opiate, the State Pathologist warned yesterday at an inquest into the death of a Mountjoy prisoner.</P>
    <P>Dr. Harbison said methadone was regarded as safe for heroin abusers because it could be taken orally.  It was intended to banish the use of contaminated needles.</P>
    <P>However, he said it was not in itself a safe drug because it had been associated with death by overdose.  According to the <i>Irish Times</i> report, the jury heard the prisoner in question had taken a mixture of heroin, methadone, cannabis and tablets during his 39 hours of compassionate leave from prison, which ended the previous evening.</P>
    <P>Methadone taken in such situations would be a potential killer, but I understand methadone taken under proper medical supervision can assist people to get off heroin.  The consultants employed by the Eastern Health Board to review its programme said methadone maintenance is the most evaluated form of treatment in the management of heroin addiction.  There is clear and consistent international evidence that this <Col N="812" /> form of treatment achieves significant reductions in heroin use and crime and a lower risk of premature deaths, including those from overdoses.</P>
    <P>The consistent finding is that a daily dose of 50 milligrams of methadone is associated with lower rates of heroin use.  Methadone maintenance has been found to be effective in reducing the spread of HIV through intravenous drug misuse, while receipt of counselling and length of time in methadone treatment are both factors associated with favourable outcomes.  I regret that Dr. Harbison is reported in today's <i>Irish Times</i> as having made those comments, because methadone plays an important part in helping people to get off heroin.</P>
    <P>The two experts appointed by the Eastern Health Board to evaluate its programme stated:</P>
    <P>The need for locally based services is a key aspect of the Eastern Health Board strategy.  It is important that professionals, politicians, key policy makers and the broader community understand the public importance of such services and their overall value to the community.  Community consultation needs to take place with a clear understanding that the needs of particularly needy and vulnerable individuals will be addressed and are not subject to community veto on the development of such services.</P>
    <P>I hope politicians will listen to the views of the consultants and the Minister will not have to bestow on others the honour he gave to a Senator on the last occasion he addressed the House, president of the NIMBY syndrome.  This is the problem faced by society; everybody wants something done about drug treatment, but they do not want it done in their back yard.  Unless the community assists and co-operates with the health board, this problem will not be overcome.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis mentioned areas which do not come under the Minister's jurisdiction but rather relate to the Departments of Justice and Education. These areas are important in relation to <Col N="813" /> drug treatment.  During yesterday's Order of Business, when the despicable murder of a gentleman in the centre of Dublin was mentioned, Senator O'Toole called for the introduction of a preventative drugs programme in schools.  The stay safe programme has been successful in our schools and a preventative programme should be introduced at primary level to educate young people about drugs.  What children are taught at a young age remains with them for the rest of their lives.  If they are informed of the problems drugs could cause it is possible they could stay drug free later in life.  The Minister for Education should introduce such a service in schools.</P>
    <P>As a member of a health board I have been happy with the progress it has made.  The public have occasionally shown opposition to clinics being opened.  However, if we are to serve the community, it is vital that we have a substantial number of clinics.  We cannot provide the methadone treatment to stabilise people using heroin unless we have these clinics.  As the consultants have said, it is up to every politician and every person in public life to support the efforts of the health boards and the Minister for Health in overcoming this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement was very interesting.  The House has discussed the drugs problem before and it remains a topic of great concern.  There have been improvements in the availability of treatment of those addicted to illegal drugs.  However, there are still waiting lists for people to get treatment. When a person is on illegal drugs one of the most important decisions they can make is to come off drugs.  It is preferable that they undertake a detoxification programme and lead a drug free lifestyle.  Therefore, it is depressing to find that once a person has made this decision there is a waiting list for treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Cherry Orchard facility has been opened at last and will be expanded.  A serious effort will have <Col N="814" /> to be made to extend the number of beds available for detoxification if we want to deal with the city's heroin addicts.  Occasions when addicts want to come off drugs may be missed if there are not enough beds, and addicts may continue to use drugs for several years, contract associated diseases and the opportunity to rescue their lives may be lost.</P>
    <P>Methadone programmes are worthwhile and I welcome the increase in the number of treatment units.  In a sense methadone programmes are of more benefit to the community than the drug addicts.  Methadone itself is an addictive drug and there are dangers associated with it.  The advantage for society is that the heroin addicts who decide to go on a methadone programme do not become involved in crime because their habit is supported.  They are free from the risk of infection with HIV or Hepatitis B because they do not use syringes.  The addicts using heroin have to steal a large amount of money or goods and setting up methadone programmes prevents this crime.</P>
    <P>It is a good idea to involve GPs in methadone treatment programmes and I realise the Minister is disappointed at the level of take up of the idea.  Following the Minister's speech to the Irish College of General Practitioners in Waterford last week, GPs are looking at their involvement in the programmes and may make a greater response.  The Minister should ask the Medical Council to look again at its ethical guidelines on doctors becoming involved in the treatment of drug addicts.  We have been warned not to become involved in treating drug addicts unless we have the skills.  Drug addicts are very manipulative and it may be too easy for them to control the programme rather than the doctor controlling what is happening with the patient.</P>
    <P>The ethical guidelines say that one should not become involved in treating patients who are not within a doctor's practice.  The vast majority of heroin addicts are in the inner city area of Dublin and it is the GPs in those areas who <Col N="815" /> would have to take on enormous numbers of addicts if they were to deal with them from a GP base.  The Minister might talk to the Medical Council to reexamine the guideline to see if it could be altered.</P>
    <P>We have talked about the resistance of communities to the setting up of methadone treatment units.  However, there can also be considerable resistance if a GP sets up a programme to treat addicts.  The Minister referred to getting more community involvement and it is essential that greater community education is undertaken.  It is hard for a GP to have members of the community urge them not to become involved in programmes when they would like to do their share to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Security is another problem for GPs. Drug addicts can become violent if they have problems with their addiction and there may be a problem with other addicts congregating in an area where they know that treatment is being given in the hope they may be able to get methadone.  However, most methadone is now given in a liquid form.  Visiting the drug treatment units can be a very depressing experience.  People queue at a hatch where they are given their 40 or 50 milligrammes of methadone which they drink.  The places are joyless and depressing and the people who go there can be in a bad state.  It makes one realise that we must prevent people falling into such a pitiful condition.</P>
    <P>Doctors who take on drug addicts do not have to deal only with the drug addiction but with the complex medical and social problems.  The man who was beaten to death recently was dying of AIDS.  In dealing with patients on methadone programmes doctors will also have to deal with medical and social problems that can be very time consuming.  I get cross when people say that doctors do not want to treat drug addicts in their practices because it will ruin their private practice.  I assure the House that is not a concern.  Most doctors who work in communities <Col N="816" /> where there is a great deal of drug addiction have limited private practices. However, the rest of a GP's patients may object because a great deal of time and effort has to go into treating addicts.</P>
    <P>The Minister was disappointed with the small number of GPs who offered to take part in the pilot study and who insisted they would only treat people who were stabilised on methadone.  That is to say, people who had already gone to a drug treatment unit, had been put on a specific dosage and who might then be transferred to a GP.  Realising the seriousness of the problem, the College of General Practitioners is prepared to take on people who have just decided they will come off illegal drugs and go on methadone.  It has set up training programmes and has a Protocol of its own for GPs.  If this takes place it will be an important advance because we are making slow progress with the clinics as it is.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle stated that 1,400 people are involved in these programmes, but that is an optimistic estimate. The actual number may be somewhat less than that, but we must make a major effort in this regard.  It is important to remember that there is no guarantee that people on methadone programmes will be cured.  Methadone is not a cure, it is another drug of addiction.</P>
    <P>Doctors alone will not be able to deal with this programme.  Community support is essential and any statutory backup that is required should be put in place.  I welcome the fact that there will be a new programme manager.  This is at the top of the pyramid, however.  It is important that GPs working at ground level with drug addicts have access to key liaison workers who are essential for the success of such programmes. These people could be social workers, community psychiatric nurses or members of voluntary groups and would provide an important liaison between doctors, pharmacists, acute hospitals, the Garda Síochána &mdash; some of those in the programmes may have been <Col N="817" /> involved with the police &mdash; and the prisons.</P>
    <P>It is very important that there be proper liaison between the prisons and the community in general.  There has been a serious deficit in this regard in the past because prisoners who may have been off drugs while in prison become involved in drug abuse almost immediately after being released.  It is essential to encourage better liaison with the prisons.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the drug-free centre at Mountjoy Prison and the appointment of Dr. Fiona Bradley to work in that programme.  This centre will remove people from the pressure of their peers and efforts can then be made to have them detoxified and encouraged to embrace a drug-free lifestyle.  It may be the best opportunity they have to stop taking drugs.  Therefore, it is important that an additional advantage be taken while they are in prison.  Current programmes are very short.  Three weeks for a detoxification programme is quite short and much more must be done in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another very important area in which liaison workers are required is that of communicating with pharmacists who become involved in these programmes. Pharmacists in Dublin city have been extraordinarily co-operative about becoming involved in the programmes. They take on the risk of their pharmacy being disrupted during the day or burgled at night.  I praise the efforts they have made.  Liaison with pharmacists is essential because some drug addicts are very manipulative people and may be attending up to four GPs to obtain as much methadone as possible and they may also be attending different pharmacies. It is essential that support is provided to those who have agreed to work within the programmes.</P>
    <P>The security of premises has been an important obstacle for GPs becoming involved.  Some GPs have had to erect bars on surgery windows and doors.  It is not a very welcoming sight for patients to see steel shutters or steel bars preventing entry to a doctor's surgery. <Col N="818" /> Members are aware that some GPs involved in working with addicts have been attacked.  It might be possible that GPs who have agreed to work with addicts could work in health board clinics. Senator McGennis made the point that such clinics would have to be established at the same time because communities resist strongly when their areas are targeted for clinics.  The reasons for this are a mystery because the situation will improve if the numbers of addicts in an area can be controlled.</P>
    <P>I live near the Baggot St. clinic, which caused turmoil in the past.  There were almost 180 addicts attending the clinic at one point and the authorities estimate that the problem becomes serious when the number rises above 100.  With the establishment of clinics at Trinity Court, Amiens St., etc., people could attend in their own districts, which improved the situation.  The possibility of GPs working in health board clinics should also be considered.</P>
    <P>The seriousness of the problem of soft drugs &mdash; cannabis and Ecstasy &mdash; must not be underestimated.  On previous occasions I have spoken about the dangers of abusing Ecstasy from a medical point of view.  There have been many deaths in Dublin from such abuse.  This drug is widely available and is not considered to be harmful.  It is an extremely dangerous drug and is probably the only one which is being manufactured in this country.  We must take care not to consider the heroin programmes in isolation.</P>
    <P>The key to this entire problem is preventing people becoming involved with drugs, even prescribed drugs. Doctors have become increasingly careful about prescribing drugs which become addictive because such prescription also gave rise to serious problems within the city.  I am glad that the programmes will begin in primary schools because it is often too late by the time people reach secondary school.  I hope that there will not be any resistance as there was in the case of the &ldquo;Stay Safe&rdquo; programme.  Parents must face the fact that there is a great deal of drug addiction <Col N="819" /> in all walks of life.  Heroin abuse in confined to the inner city but a problem with drug abuse also exists in the suburbs. Prevention is much better than cure and I believe that doctors will become involved in the programmes.</P>
    <P>We have always believed that by diverting children into other activities such as sport, etc., we could prevent their becoming involved in drug addiction. However, I have visited many schools and I was informed by one young person who is involved in international canoeing that soft drugs were often available at parties following international events.  This is an extraordinarily depressing revelation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, Senator McGennis was very kind about the amount of money involved in this problem.  She also referred to unemployed people in certain housing estates who appear to have access to much money.  We must consider the amount of money involved in the heroin &ldquo;industry&rdquo; alone.  If there are 7,000 drug addicts in the country and each spends £500 per week on heroin alone &mdash; which remains expensive even though the cost has fallen &mdash; this would amount to £175 million per year.  I do not know what is the cost of heroin abroad but it must be expensive to transport and those making deliveries must rake-off a share of the profits. However, there must be many people in Ireland who are making millions of pounds from the sale of heroin.  A recent conference of accountants was addressed by a Mr. Mitchell from England who stated that until the situation relating to money laundering &mdash; I am not merely referring to people claiming unemployment who can afford to purchase a house worth £70,000 &mdash; was addressed in this country, the problem of drug addiction would not improve.</P>
    <P>This is an important, multifaceted problem.  The Minister for Health's efforts are very worthwhile but it is essential that the problem be addressed by the Minister for Education, through our schools, and the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <Col N="820" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is the most important to be debated in this House in recent times.  The drugs problem is the greatest issue which Irish society faces.  However, it is not treated as such despite the fact that it is an issue of life and death for many people.  The problem is that for many people drug abuse is containable, but it is containable only in a geographic sense.  It can be confined to major urban centres such as Dublin and even then to smaller sections of that city.</P>
      <P>I visited New York in 1993 when the drugs issue was being discussed at the UN by Parliamentarians for Global Action.  A man called Jerry Brown referred to the American problem and it came across that countries throughout the world do not seem to have a uniform way to deal with the massive problem of drug addiction and abuse.  He also said there were about 5.5 million registered drug users in the United States.  During his speech this morning, the Minister mentioned that a number of thousands of people are addicted in this country.  We should contact our American friends to ascertain whether they have a system whereby they register addicts and keep an eye on them. We do not seem to be able to do that. He maintained that over a period of about five years they brought the figure of registered drug users from 5.5 million down to 1.75 million.  He was not able to tell us how they did it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eamon Doherty, the chairman of Cospóir, spoke after him and delivered an excellent paper on how the Irish deal with the drugs problem.  The representatives from 15 countries present asked for a copy of Eamon Doherty's paper.  I asked him why they were interested in his paper and he said that we seem to have a common sense approach.  Drugs mask many issues in our society.  It is unquestionably linked to poverty and social disadvantage.  Any long-term solution to the problem that does not tackle social exclusion, particularly its concentration in regional blackspots, is a nonsense.  Successive Governments have failed to recognise this factor and <Col N="821" /> have not done enough to address social exclusion.</P>
    <P>For too many people the drug problem exists only because it leads to crime. Far too seldom is concern expressed for addicts themselves and the communities in the grip of ruthless drug barons.  If any indication of the lack of the community's concern for the problem is needed, it is found in the reaction of many to the news that a treatment centre is to be established in their area.</P>
    <P>There are two drug problems &mdash; soft drugs, such as cocaine and Ecstasy, and heroin addiction.  The second is responsible for the scenario we have already outlined and huge social problems, but fortunately for those living in rural areas, it is confined largely to the Dublin metropolitan area.  Even as a Member from Donegal I can recognise the size of the problem.  I see it particularly in the priority and urgency with which my Dublin colleagues talk about the problem and their frustration at what they perceive to be a lack of progress on it.</P>
    <P>During the Troubles in the North over the past 25 years one would have found that the importation of drugs into a county like Donegal was perceived to be very small.  One of the reasons was that the security on the Border meant very little got across.  Since the ceasefire, or even since the breakdown of the ceasefire, there has been a marked increase in the amount of drugs, especially Ecstasy, coming across the Border because security is not as tight. Sometimes one gains and sometimes one loses.</P>
    <P>Ecstasy is known to us all.  It has penetrated almost every rural town and village. Its definition as a soft drug is a complete misnomer.  As cases in this country, and perhaps more particularly in Britain, have indicated, it too can be a killer.  Last February at the launch of the Government's anti-drugs programme the Minister for Health announced that a media campaign on the danger of drugs would be launched. To be honest I have yet to see it.  I hope the Minister can confirm that it is at an <Col N="822" /> advanced stage of preparation.  He outlined part of it in his speech and I welcome some of the measures mentioned. Such a campaign is essential to inform young people that Ecstasy is not a leisure drug.</P>
    <P>There is another danger with Ecstasy. Throughout Dublin Ecstasy is used as a gateway drug to heroin.  It is sold in party packs comprising two Ecstasy tabs and a heroin joint.  While it has not been difficult to confine intravenous heroin use to a major city, it is not so easy to prevent the use of heroin through smoking from spreading throughout the country.  This is one thing of which we must be fearful in rural areas.  While I acknowledge that in its recent package the Government has recognised that heroin smoking is a problem, I have yet to hear any proposal as to how the problem is to be tackled.  The Minister mentioned it this morning but there do not seem to be any moves to see how the problem will be tackled.</P>
    <P>Despite large investment in treatment clinics in the Eastern Health Board area there are still considerable waiting lists for treatment for those injecting heroin. There is no service available for those who smoke heroin; this is an unacceptable state of affairs.  I agree with the Government's proposition that the treatment available for heroin users should aim at bringing users to a state where they can appreciate a drug free lifestyle.  I have no time for those who argue for the legalisation of drugs.  This can only serve to legitimate certain kinds of drug abuse but there is no guarantee that we can confine that abuse to so-called soft drugs.  I believe it would be a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>I support the Government's suggestion that every effort should be made to prevent the introduction of teenagers to the drug culture in any form.  Consequently, I welcome the measures announced by the Minister for Education in this regard.  One would have to guard against the fact that children are not always amenable to listening to their superiors or to people in authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> I worked with youth clubs in my home town.  We knew everything that was happening.  Very few of the young people we worked with or who played football and other sports got out of line because we were in touch and had our finger on the pulse at all times.  Whenever someone in authority goes to a school to speak about drugs, young people look up and see somebody from the establishment.  The message does not seem to get home.  Young people will respond more quickly to a message coming from people who are involved in sports, whether footballers, hurlers or whatever, than to a message coming from somebody in authority.  This should be complemented by other support services.</P>
    <P>Youth workers are often the only adults who deal with teenagers on a one to one basis.  They can play an important role in diverting teenagers' activities elsewhere and in so doing earn the respect necessary to operate effectively an anti-drugs education programme.  It is acknowledged that parents also play an important role in helping sons and daughters come off drug dependence. However, too often parents who find themselves in this situation do not know to whom they can turn when a problem arises.  Community drug teams operate in certain areas of Dublin and I would favour their expansion to rural areas.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the current allocation of facilities for heroin treatment is geared excessively towards methadone maintenance. Methadone maintenance is effective in stabilising many addicts but its effectiveness as a means of bringing people into a drug free environment is less clear.  It can only be successful if backed by other services.  I have heard reports that drugs are freely available inside these clinics.</P>
    <P>Although it is regrettable, it is hardly surprising that people in local communities are wary of these clinics.  The same problem may arise in relation to GPs who come on board with the Government's proposals.  The Government has <Col N="824" /> expressed support for locally sponsored drug centres or community developed responses.  This would be a profitable avenue to pursue as would more support, financial or otherwise, for the voluntary agencies involved.  Some of these agencies, like the Coolmine clinic, pursue approaches other than methadone maintenance and claim that these are no more costly and are as effective.  They too should be examined.</P>
    <P>I would like to say more on this issue. Thankfully, we have been confined to measures aimed at reducing demand.  If we were to consider supply reduction as well we could debate for a week.  This is a question of priorities.  We have a problem and we need to address it in a fundamental fashion.  A piecemeal approach would be futile.  I welcome the measures adopted by the Minister.  He has gone further than any of his predecessors but, in my view, the time for playing catch is over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few things I would like to say and I hope they are not recorded in the same way as remarks I made the last time we spoke on health with the Minister when I was accused of saying that he was economical with the truth after spending a speech praising him.  Today I will state clearly that I congratulate the Minister on the measures he has taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drug problem is horrendous.  For 25 years or more I have been working with adolescents and their families.  A number of years ago I would come across this problem occasionally but now, nearly every problem faced by a young person &mdash; whether they are not doing well in the leaving certificate, they are being promiscuous or they are stealing cars &mdash; has a drug basis.  It is unbelievable.  They use drugs as a natural or normal way of getting high. Senator Henry spoke about the dangers of Ecstasy.  A young man came to me the other day and told me that of course he used E but: &ldquo;I always know from whom I buy it&rdquo;.  That was it; as long as he knew the supplier he believed he was <Col N="825" /> safe.  I tried to explain the drug to him. I am continually surprised that so many teenagers do not have accurate information on drugs.  That is why I welcome some of the measures outlined today.</P>
    <P>Education has an important role and more resources could be put into that area.  It involves not just the Department of Health; the Departments of Education and Justice must also row in. A figure of £500,000 is to be spent on awareness campaigns.  It is good that a figure has been included but I believe it should be nearer £500 million.  If a bank went bust we would somehow find the money to bail it out.  We could find millions for Irish Steel and Aer Lingus but those problems are nothing compared to the drug problem.  Entire areas of our cities and towns are populated by people who are suffering daily, committing crime and dying slowly from drug abuse.  The £500,000 should be millions of pounds.  No Government or political party has tackled the problem with enough determination.  I realise that a Minister at the Cabinet table must fight for what he or she can get and I am not detracting from what the Minister has done in this instance.  However, the figure must be higher.</P>
    <P>I dealt with another young man who had a problem with drugs.  Both his parents smoked throughout the interview and the father was recovering from a hangover.  Yet they wondered why their child was on drugs.  As long as we continue to advertise alcohol on television and laud it as something nice, people will naturally take to drugs.  Most of the children I see mix alcohol with drugs, such as Ecstasy, heroin or acid.  They will take anything.</P>
    <P>A young lady I saw recently is spending £200 per day in the Dún Laoghaoire area.  She said she would do anything except kill somebody for that money. She had done practically anything, including prostitution and stealing.  The young people in that area have a system. They usually steal from ladies who carry their cheque book and cheque card together in their handbags.  They use the cheque books by forging the signatures <Col N="826" /> in the bank on the first day, in pubs and shops on the second day and they throw them away on the third day.  It costs them £100 to buy the package and a group specialises in it.  The child had reached that stage.  She did not know one person in her environment who was not using drugs.  I am often gobsmacked by what I hear.  I showed her that there was another world outside that environment. I do not know how she is doing now but perhaps she will make it.  The problem is the drugs are so addictive.</P>
    <P>Children mix drugs and use lethal combinations.  That is why the education process is so important.  I use the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; in the broad sense.  The awareness programme will be operated through each health board so that children might begin to understand.  Most people who use alcohol know that if they drink too much they will rot their brains or suffer liver damage.  People who smoke know that they will eventually die of cancer.  However, many of the young people who use drugs do not understand that it is not safe to use them.  Many people will say that hash and marijuana are relatively harmless and it is true they do not develop a physical dependency, but they develop a psychological dependency and tend to accumulate in the brain.  I cannot praise the awareness campaign enough but I would like to see more of it.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that drugs is one of the major worldwide industries, with arms and tourism; the fourth major industry is pornography which tells us something about how we are developing.  I do not know how we will eradicate the drugs problem.  The Department of Justice probably has a major role but so does anything that educates people about drugs.  If we prevent even a few people going on drugs it will help in the struggle against the problem.</P>
    <P>Increased involvement for general practitioners in drug treatment is proposed. I am not sure that is a good move.  The Minister said he is committed to it and that he has received a positive response.  I know one doctor on the northside who dispenses methadone.  He <Col N="827" /> is now frightened because the patients call when he is not there or when the surgery is locked up.  He has been threatened a couple of times and he is very frightened.  There should be designated clinics in particular areas to carry out such treatment.  It would be better not to involve general practitioners in this type of programme.  They have enough to do and other patients in some of the surgeries involved have been threatened.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk recently about decriminalising the use of soft drugs.  There is no such thing as soft drugs.  They do not inevitably lead to hard drugs and many young people are aware of that but prolonged use of such drugs encourage a <i>laissez faire</i> attitude to life and reduce motivation.  I am glad the Minister is not opting for that route. It has not been successful in other countries and has not reduced the drug problem; in fact, the problem has increased.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his work to date.  I do not disagree with the measures he has outlined, with the exception of his proposal regarding general practitioners.  I would like to see more money being spent.  The drugs problem is so strong that we must adjust our mindset and realise that we must do something about it.  The three Ministers who have responsibility should get together and insist that the Government put money into dealing with the problem. If Irish Steel or Aer Lingus need money it is made available immediately. We may have no money but the Government, regardless of which party is in power, is always able to produce it. I have never been a Minister so I do not know where the money comes from but I know that it is there.</P>
    <P>If we put £500 million or £600 million into tackling the drugs problem we could eradicate it.  It can be done. Senator Henry calculated that £170 million is spent on this; we cannot combat that with £500,000.  This is big business and the profits are huge.  People kill for it with impunity and they beat up people.  It is a violent business.  I know <Col N="828" /> another young man who was involved in it and he is now frightened because he was threatened.  He has to keep producing and dealing even though the police know about it.  The money, even for a small dealer, is so large and can produce such large profits almost instantly that people take chances.  The fines and penalties must therefore be large, as must the help.</P>

      <P>I welcome the measures put in place by the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  The urgency of the drugs crisis became even more apparent this week when a suspected drugs dealer was murdered.  Unless measures such as those proposed by the Minister are not only implemented but expanded, we might see more people taking the law into their own hands.</P>
      <P>Up to now we have tended to view drug addiction and the crimes associated with it as urban rather than rural problems.  In recent months we have heard of a drugs epidemic in our cities which, according to experts, is reaching levels last seen in the 1980s.  However, we have heard relatively little about the drug crisis facing Ireland's towns and villages.  The heart is being torn out of rural communities by unemployment, emigration and the slow winding down of essential services such as Garda stations and post offices.  A fairly large town in my area, Doneraile, is awaiting the deployment of gardaí for almost six months.  That is not good enough.  If it is an internal problem, the gardaí should sort it out.  Young people in these communities are vulnerable to the quick fix promise of drugs and are increasingly targeted by pushers and dealers, many of whom operate openly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Garda drug teams in Dublin, Cork and other areas have succeeded in stemming the drugs trade in our cities, but there is a danger that they will be <Col N="829" /> pushed into surrounding towns and villages. In latter years some progress has been made in terms of drugs seizures as a result of co-ordination between the Garda and the Navy, which is important.  We must ensure that gardaí in rural communities are given the expert backup they need to tackle the problem and that their numbers are increased or at least maintained.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that drug abusers in rural communities have full access to drug treatment services such as methadone maintenance programmes.  I urge the Government to build on recent progress in this area and to establish community drug teams in those rural areas where drug problems have been identified. We need to catch drug addicts at the beginning rather than at the end of the drug abuse cycle.  We need to ensure that the first contact drug addicts have with the State is through the social and medical services and not through the justice system.</P>
    <P>We must address the issues surrounding the supply of drugs and we must tackle the demand for drugs.  That is the crux of the issue being debated today. There are still long queues of addicts waiting for treatment which would not only save their lives but would reduce the suffering of thousands of victims of drug abusers.  If these were ordinary patients suffering from some form of organic disease, there would be a national outcry.  Instead, we turn a blind eye until we are confronted with the effects of drug abuse in the form of crime and anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>Drugs, like any other product, are subject to the laws of the market.  I am advised that Ecstasy tablets are currently available in Cork for a few pounds and that the prices continue to drop due to what can only be termed a glut on the market.  These tablets, like heroin, are ideal contraband &mdash; small, easily transported and, despite the drop in prices, sold at enormous profits. Many young people do not regard Ecstasy tablets as real drugs until they suffer the side effects.  This is the view of young people with whom these matters <Col N="830" /> are discussed.  There is a clear need for a frank, no holds barred education and information programme along the lines of the successful Manchester initiative.</P>
    <P>Unless we address the issue of supply and demand, we will not stem the drugs crisis and the crime wave will continue unabated.  The link between drugs and crime is incontrovertible.  It is estimated that approximately 80 per cent of all petty crime in urban areas is committed by drug abusers.  At our recent annual delegate conference, Democratic Left debated a wide range of topics associated with drugs, crime and justice administration.  The intensity of that debate reflected the widespread public concern at increasing levels of petty crime and violent offences against the person.  Contrary to popular belief, Democratic Left is not soft on crime. My party believes that every crime must carry an appropriate punishment which must be fully implemented while safeguarding the rights of the innocent.</P>
    <P>It is vital that persons convicted of a crime serve the sentence handed down by the court.  It is unacceptable that persons should be released on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis after serving just a few months of their sentences.  This is one of the issues which must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Temporary release was originally intended as a compassionate measure and to help rehabilitate prisoners into the community.  However, in the 36 years since temporary release was introduced, it has become little more than a convenient instrument used by the Department of Justice to relieve the pressure on prison places.  There is now an urgent need to review the operation of the temporary release system not simply for drug related offences but also in connection with other serious offences.</P>
    <P>We must stop viewing prisons as instruments of containment and start viewing them as instruments of rehabilitation. This requires a co-ordinated policy of sentence management for each prisoner to ensure that the pattern of offending and reoffending is broken. <Col N="831" /> We must also ensure that all prisoners have access to a comprehensive, individually tailored programme of drug treatment and rehabilitation, which they can continue after they are released.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Sherlock for agreeing to share his time with me. I congratulate the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, on his statement this morning.</P>
      <P>Some figures were bandied about during this debate.  Substantial additional resources will be given to this area over the next two years &mdash; in excess of £3.5 million will be provided this year and £4.5 million next year.  It sometimes galls me when the Opposition attacks increases in public expenditure and then calls for additional resources in these areas.  They are either for additional resources in this area &mdash; in which case they should support the Government and the work it is doing in preparing the Book of Estimates and stop playing politics with the issue &mdash; or they are not.</P>
      <P>Why are so many young people caught up in the drugs spiral?  The Minister issued a statement in February that he will set up a task force to address this issue.  There are many underlying reasons, including the fact that many of our young people live in ghettos and because of the lack of educational facilities and opportunities, they are sucked into a drugs culture.  That is the case in many parts of my constituency.  Senator Lydon is correct when he says that in certain parts of the city it is usual for young people to get caught up in the drugs scene.  We must recognise that fact and ascertain why it is happening. Certain areas of the city need more funding and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ecstasy tablets came to public attention approximately 18 months ago when people living on the hill of Howth suddenly realised their children were being caught up in the drugs scene.  Yet many areas of this city have been dealing with the drugs crisis for years.  That is the nub of the problem we face.  Poor conditions can lead to drug abuse.  This is a nationwide <Col N="832" /> issue and should be dealt with as such.  There has been a good response by the Government.  The interdepartmental committee formed by the Departments of Health, Education and Justice was dormant for a considerable period.  It is now working again and I congratulate the Ministers involved for taking the initiative to re-establish it.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity during our six months Presidency of the EU to highlight this issue as a European wide one.  I suspect that much of the information we have in terms of recent seizures comes from the good intelligence which has been built up by police forces throughout the EU.  This needs to be streamlined because we can only get at the surface of the problem when we take drugs out of circulation and we need the support of our EU colleagues in doing so.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record my support for the residents of west Tallaght in their efforts to get rid of drug pushers from their community.  They have engaged in a peaceful protest for the last month or so.  This is in great contrast to the summary execution which took place on the streets of Dublin a few days ago.  The residents, by peacefully protesting against the pushers, have shown the level of community action which can bring about results, once effort is channelled and directed in a certain way.  I congratulate them because they have shown what communities can do when they stand up to pushers.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis spoke about the Eastern Health Board and this should be an issue for the Minister.  Many residents of large sections of this city are frustrated by the fact that where pushers or large scale drug abusers are thrown out of local authority houses, they frequently receive rent subsidies from the health board and end up not too far from the communities they left.  This is an issue of co-ordination.  The Eastern Health Board, the Department of Health, the Garda Síochána and the local authorities need to concentrate their minds on this issue because it causes havoc in many parts of the city. <Col N="833" /> Pushers are bringing supplies of drugs into drug free areas and are causing havoc there.</P>
    <P>I support the work being done in local communities.  In my area a volunteer put together a community anti-drugs newsletter, in conjuction with the area's local newspapers.  There has been a focus in the area on bringing the attention of parents to the problems of drug abuse because many of them are not fully aware of them.  As Senator Henry said, drug abusers are manipulative and children want to experiment at a young age.  We need to inform parents that the community level is the best one at which to deal with the issue.  This initiative in Tallaght is having much more impact in the area than any nationwide campaign costing £500,000 could have.  I would like to see part of this money directed towards initiatives which are already in place and are working.</P>
    <P>Those who suggest that legalising soft drugs is part of the answer to the problem come from the vested interests of the pushers themselves.  We need to scotch the nation that we would should accept the legalisation of these supposedly soft drugs.  It is pushers themselves who are spinning this line, which is finding its way into many of our newspapers. This is not an issue.  People who read about this suggestion may not be aware of the problems of drug abuse and they need to familiarise themselves with the dangers drugs cause in my community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak with the impressive local authority with which the party spokespersons have addressed this issue.  They are able to draw on their knowledge of what is happening in their areas.  I echo Senator Henry's call that we should not regard this as predominantly a hard drugs, inner city Dublin issue.  It is a national issue.  In Cork the Ecstasy problem is a recurring threat to civilised young life and we should not become soft on so-called soft drugs.  I echo entirely what Senator Hayes has said in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> I am saddened at the way we have approached the issue.  The heading of the Minister's speech refers to the Department of Health's response to the problem.  The problem, as we have said time and again, transcends Departments. From the point of view of coping with problems, we chop them up so that they fit in with departmental structures. This is no reflection on people in Departments; but I find it staggering that we still approach debates from a specifically departmental perspective on issues which cannot be resolved by individual departmental measures, however worthy they are.  The measures proposed by the Minister seem eminently worthy, but to have the most fruitful debate possible we should have representatives from all the Departments involved, however that would be logistically organised.  Debates in this and the other Chamber would be far more fruitful if we could have representatives transcending a departmental basis on problems which are not departmental problems as such.  We can only get a partial perspective here, however insighted it may be.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, was here earlier I thought it was because he might have joint responsibility for programmes by the Departments of Education and Health on drug abuse.  I am informed that while he is responsible for child abuse programmes, he or anybody else does not have specific responsibility for drug abuse programmes across Departments.  I may be wrong but this is the information I have been given.  If this is the case, it is high time there was a Minister or Minister of State with specific responsibility for leading the Government's campaign against drugs misuse.  If there is somebody with specific responsibility, I would be glad to hear it; but I would like to see more reference to it in documents. If there is not, given the centrality of this problem in Irish life, which is one of the saddest issues with which we must cope, it is high time there is a Minister with specific responsibility who would be required to provide specific <Col N="835" /> accountability to the Oireachtas on the progress of these admirable measures and others which may be decided on.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which emerges and at which I am taken aback is how little we seem to know specifically about the scale of the problem.  Different figures have been quoted and we have been warned that they are probably underestimates.  I am grateful that the task force which has been appointed is not a high level but a poor ordinary one because there might be a chance that it will find something out.  A task force has been established now, even though we have been talking about drugs year after year.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry, who has a knowledge far exceeding mine or that of most of us on an issue like this, doubts the figure of 1,400 given by the Minister.  I do not know if her doubt is valid.  She used a figure of 7,000 heroin addicts to make calculations about the total cost. However, the figure of 7,000 in the Minister's speech refers to drug misusers, not just heroin misusers.  I do not know which is correct; maybe none of us knows.  It is staggering that at this stage we seem to have so little concrete data on the scale of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health finished by saying he is confident that the proposed measures will lead to a significant reduction in the scale of the problem.  If we do not know the scale of the problem, it will be extremely difficult to report back in a year's time on how successful the measures have been.  One would be hopeful, but I do not think we are in a position to use the word &ldquo;confident&rdquo; on the basis of the evidence contained in documents like this.  It is important to get basic data as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We have to some extent discussed the root causes.  I turn to socio-economic factors mentioned by the Minister.  He said that in 1994, 84 per cent of heroin addicts who had received treatment were unemployed and 60 per cent had left school with a minimum education.  I agree with Senator Hayes.  The Tallaght <Col N="836" /> experience and the intense concentration of heroin addicts in a limited number of areas show that a focused specific programme is more important than a blanket national media programme. In so far as a choice is to be made between them because of limited resources, I would try to focus an information programme on the areas and categories most at risk.  They are not confined to Dublin but there will be a disproportionate number in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am a little sceptical about the hopes being placed on education and the education system.  I am in favour of introducing as much information at primary level for pupils as possible but I am sceptical about the overall consequences. The culture of the school has only a very small chance of conquering the culture of the outside world from which these children come.  If that culture is so deeply rooted in deprived areas, we are treating symptoms rather than substance.  Until we can reduce the level of deprivation in these ghetto communities, we will have only limited success with a drug information programme in schools, much as I support it.</P>
    <P>I look at the Departments involved and I see no reference to any economic Department even though, in so far as policy can influence these matters, it will have to be the policy of economic Departments which influences levels of deprivation.  How much integrated thinking is there in Government about how one tackles these problems?  No economic Department should be allowed propose policies which have any potential impact on these areas without having them drug proofed.  We have gender proofing and a variety of other types of proofing, which are very valuable.  We must ask about the knockon implications for drug abuse in identified areas.  Economic programmes focused on these areas should also be required to take cognisance of their possible implications.</P>
    <P>Co-ordinating one Department can be a major problem but co-ordinating a number of Departments challenges our ability to conduct policy.  This afternoon <Col N="837" /> we will discuss a report from a committee of departmental Secretaries on reforming the Civil Service.  When one reads their report one finds that a central question is how to achieve co-ordination between Departments.  I can think of few programmes which require that co-ordination more than drug abuse.  Until we get it, however admirable the individual proposals, we will not be successful in reducing demand for drugs.</P>
    <P>Reducing demand is crucial.  There are drug pushers and we know about the horrible event last night.  Demand can to some extent be created, but until demand is significantly reduced supply will be found for it.  I support all the measures which try to get hold of drug pushers but as long as there is demand, a supply will find its way in.  If one reduces supply, the only thing that happens is the price rises.  If the price rises, it makes addicts even more desperate and more reckless in the criminal measures they often take to find the money with which to get drugs.  Reducing demand must be central.  I applaud the emphasis on demand reduction measures in the title to the Minister's speech, even if it is a departmental rather than total response.</P>
    <P>My final point echoes Senator Hayes's comments.  Why do young people take drugs to the extent to which they are taking them?  That comes back partly to the precise environment in which they find themselves.  It also comes back to the wider value system in society.  We are fostering what I will loosely call, without being clinical about it, a no fault value system.  It is a value system which says that anything goes and it is coming at us every day from most information sources and the media.  The schools can only counter the problem with a modest effort.  As long as those value systems are coming at us and appear to be embraced by the bulk of opinion forming establishment, all the specific programmes in the world which are attempting to cope with demand for drugs will have only limited success.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> It is like sticking a finger in a dyke.  If the waves are coming, one can do a bit here and there; but, irrespective of good intentions or the intelligence with which programmes are formulated, they are fighting an uphill battle.  Tá siad ag snámh in aghaidh an easa an t-am go léir.  We have to look at more than specific measures.  We must also examine the impression Government and indeed the rest of us are giving about the type of society we want and about its basic value system.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to discuss the drugs issue, which is most important.  Any of us who are parents or who have any contact with young people are aware of the increasing use of drugs in our communities and the dangers posed by the drug threat to the health, safety and future prospects of all our children.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health outlined the steps being taken by Government to tackle this serious problem.  It is a complex and difficult one to which there are no instant solutions.  However, we must address ourselves to these problems with a greater sense of urgency.  I was quite shocked to see the estimates of the number of drug misusers varying from 3,000 to 7,000.  Having discussed the issue with the gardaí in my own constituency, I believe there are anything between 700 and 800 people abusing drugs in the Laoighis-Offaly area.  It is no different from any other area of the country and a figure of 3,000 to 7,000 seems to underestimate the problem. This could be why the greater sense of urgency needed to address the problem is not apparent.</P>

    <P>Recently, 300 gardaí were moved to the Border counties because of the BSE crisis.  When are we going to see a similar announcement of a like number being allocated specifically to deal with the problems of drug abuse in our communities? We do not have any official drug squads in any of the divisions in the country.  I know that some official drug squads were set up in the cities recently.  However, unless we are to face <Col N="839" /> problems in country areas which we have already seen in the cities, it is vital that we appoint official drug squads to deal with the issues now.</P>
    <P>Those who present themselves for treatment for drug addiction should not be put on a waiting list.  Continuing to allow bail to drug addicts, without offering them treatment, when they have no visible means of supporting their habit is quite reckless.  I accept there is a need for a multi-disciplinary approach to tackle the drug problem and that it is not all within the responsibility of the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Deputy Currie is the Minister of State with responsibility for children.  Drugs affect our children and we need a Minister with special responsibility in this area because it is the greatest scourge and threat which faces society.  There is a belief in rural areas that drugs are seen by the authorities and the powers that be as a city problem.  We all would acknowledge that not a village or town remains unaffected by drugs.</P>
    <P>As long as we pay lip service to the drug problem it will escalate and reach a crisis point, when we will feel helpless. Individual gardaí are doing a tremendous job with the limited facilities available. Burying our heads in the sand and pretending the problem is not as great as it is will lead us in future years to look back and ask how we ignored the seriousness of the problem.</P>
    <P>In my area of Laoighis-Offaly the main drug being used is cannabis, followed by Ecstasy, LSD and speed. Thankfully, we do not have a heroin problem yet, but with the increasing use of Ecstasy over the past 18 months it will not be too long before it will be freely available.  In the past six months in Edenderry over £30,000 worth of Ecstasy tablets were seized by the Garda.  That gives us an indication of the seriousness of the situation.</P>
    <P>We should also be aware that very young people take drugs.  While the main problem is with teenagers and people in their early 20s, the Garda will say that people from 14 to 50 years of <Col N="840" /> age are misusing drugs.  The situation in my area is different to that in Dublin. Although people may believe drugs are not freely available in rural areas, on Tuesdays and Thursdays in Laoighis-Offaly when people collect their dole, large groups pool their money and send a person to Dublin on the train to purchase drugs to distribute among them. On Fridays third level students return from Dublin, Cork, Galway, Carlow and Athlone, some of whom bring back hash and Ecstasy.  Many people in rural areas working in the larger cities bring back supplies of hash, Ecstasy and LSD.  As a result, there is a regular supply of drugs in every town and village, particularly at weekends.  Much cannabis dealing is taking place.</P>
    <P>Our greatest concern is the increase in the use of Ecstasy.  Some people believe that Ecstasy is only available at raves.  Many young people in towns where discos are held at weekends take Ecstasy.  This is very frightening because many do not know what is contained in Ecstasy, which is extremely dangerous. Over the past 12 months a number of young people have died as a result of taking Ecstasy tablets, which are not only available in the cities but in discos, bars and any place in which young people congregate.</P>
    <P>We must stress the importance of contacting gardaí and of using their expertise in this area to talk to young people.  In many areas gardaí have gone into schools to talk to children and to parents groups about drugs.  As parents we must be conscious of the example we give to young people.  The greatest abuse of any drug in this country is alcohol. Statistics show that 72 per cent of all adults drink.  We cannot except our children to look at us drinking and smoking and then turn around and tell them that they cannot take cannabis or Ecstasy.</P>
    <P>We must also be aware of the high level of prescribed drugs taken in every home.  If young people see their parents taking prescribed drugs, it is easy for them to drift into the use of illegal substances. As others Senators said, there <Col N="841" /> is no such thing as a soft drug.  Alcohol, cigarettes and cannabis can cause considerable harm to young people and may involve them in a drug culture which will lead them to harder drugs.</P>
    <P>Underage drinking is a huge problem. The Garda will say that the use of false ID cards by young people is widespread. There has been a huge increase in underage drinking in recent years, which should be of concern to us all.  We must ask why young people become involved in drugs.  Many believe that if they do not take Ecstasy, they are not cool. They see their peers smoking hash in the same way as cigarettes.  Lack of self-confidence and self-esteem cause young people to turn to drugs.  It is important that parents are aware of the dangers and communicate and support young people when required.  Parents have a duty to educate themselves as to the availability of drugs, to know where drugs are available in their areas and to co-operate with the Garda and the schools in trying to rid their communities of drugs.</P>
    <P>The Government responded to the BSE crisis by increasing the number of gardaí at the Border.  If we are committed, we can react quickly.  The drug problem is the greatest scourge facing society and it is a huge threat to young people.  A difficulty many parents have is that if their children become involved in drugs they feel it is difficult to reach them and that they are beyond redemption, which is difficult for parents to accept.  We must acknowledge the extent of the problem; it is only then we will be able to tackle it.</P>
    <P>The Garda in Tullamore have told me that after discos at weekend the town is like Grafton Street on Christmas Eve. People move into the area from County Tipperary and County Westmeath and drugs are freely available.  We must face up to this issue.  I welcome the measures announced.  I accept there are specific problems in the Dublin area, particularly in relation to heroin, and that the Department faces difficulties in terms of involving larger numbers of GPs in methadone treatment and the setting up <Col N="842" /> of residential centres for the treatment of drug addicts.  If we manage to get across to people the extent of the problem and the fact that it not only affects children of a particular class in society, they might accept measures necessary to rid ourselves of this curse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I place on the record my condemnation and abhorrence of the recent summary execution of a person for alleged drug dealing offences.  It is a sad indictment on Government and society that such an appalling tragedy can occur.  I welcome any announcement by a Department, Minister or Government which tries to address the problems associated with the misuse of drugs.  However, Ministers and Governments have had a haphazard approach to the issue of drug abuse.</P>
      <P>The Garda will admit that it has lost the battle as regards drug dealing and the distribution of drugs.  It does not have enough resources and cannot convict drug dealers because of the inadequacies of the law.  Drug dealers out on bail can continue to profit while awaiting conviction.  These issues must be addressed.</P>
      <P>There is a huge Ecstasy problem.  It is sad that we did not respond to the misuse of drugs in society until it touched middle class people.  For many years, there was a huge heroin problem in the Dublin inner city area and we had a haphazard approach to dealing with that problem.  It is only now when teenagers from all sections of society go out on a Saturday night and pop two Ecstasy tablets that we realise we have a drug problem in society.  However, all is not lost because if a coherent and definite approach is taken by the Government and a liaison group involving the Departments of Justice, Health and Education is established, a strategy could be adopted at some stage to address this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fifteen years ago young people drove their cars home after a dance, having had up to 11 whiskeys and perhaps a couple pints.  This was acceptable, but young people today do not think drinking <Col N="843" /> and driving is acceptable.  Their views have been cultivated through education and advertising.  A coherent educational advertising campaign would get the message across to the vast majority of young people that taking drugs is dangerous and antisocial.</P>
    <P>An educational programme should be established which covers every school in the country.  This should also involve community gardaí, who are most effective but who do not have sufficient resources.  They attend meetings at night and discuss issues with parents and teenagers, but not enough resources have been directed towards education in terms of combating the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that there is a huge heroin problem in inner city Dublin. The statistics show that 2,700 people are receiving treatment.  From speaking to people who have been on heroin and went on to methadone treatment programmes, addicts only approach such programmes when they become ill, weak and unable to sustain their addiction through illegal activities, such as stealing and shoplifting.  The problem is that heroin addicts are not being reached in time.  They ask for treatment and are told there is a waiting list.  If one is addicted to heroin, which is one of the most addictive substances available, it is pointless being told one is on a waiting list.  One needs immediate treatment. The methadone treatment programmes must be vastly extended to ensure heroin addicts know they are available when they require them.  Addicts want to get off heroin.</P>
    <P>At this stage we have at least acknowledge there is a drugs epidemic throughout the country, particularly of the designer drug, Ecstasy.  There is a heroin crisis in Dublin's inner city areas. Sadly, this acknowledgement has come late and resources must be put into the education, health and justice areas to combat the importation and distribution of drugs and cultivate the thinking of young people so the next generation realise that taking drugs is dangerous and antisocial.  I mentioned the example <Col N="844" /> of a good advertising campaign about drink driving.</P>
    <P>My sister returned from Sydney a couple of weeks ago and she told me a girl died there as a result of taking Ecstasy.  It was the first time she had taken it and the Australian Government immediately latched onto this point and ran a huge advertising campaign involving the girl's parents, friends and school she attended.  This had a major impact on young people's views on what was considered a designer drug.  The Minister and his Department should take this example on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is immensely important and I concur with many of Senator Kelleher's points.  It is vital to get the dangers of drug abuse across to young people.  The Department of the Environment ran a successful campaign over several years in relation to drink driving.  This had a significant effect on preventing people driving after drinking; but, regrettably, young people still abuse alcohol to a large extent.  Similarly, a campaign against cigarettes is ongoing but many young people are still smoking.  Nevertheless, campaigns make a difference.</P>
      <P>The drugs problem is no longer confined to Dublin, Cork and other large cities.  It now affects every town and village. I discussed with the Garda Síochána the methods used by drug pushers to bring in drugs and it is amazing how devious they can be.  We need to reach the drug barons, but this is difficult because the Revenue Commissioners are reluctant to pursue many of these people due to the physical intimidation of staff members and their families. Social welfare officers, who had occasion to call on these people to investigate their means, and their families have also been physically threatened and intimidated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the scenario and it is serious. The Garda has extensive powers with regard to stopping, searching, arresting and holding people.  It also has powers to search houses, etc., but people are able to escape convictions.  If a person <Col N="845" /> was charged in a country town, such as Portlaoise or Tullamore, it would be difficult to secure a conviction against known drug pushers from a jury.  The situation is bordering on a crisis at present.  It involves paramilitaries and millionaires who have no regard for the life or limb.  We may have to declare an emergency and, although I am reluctant to say it, it may be necessary to consider establishing non jury courts to hear cases against drug barons.  I wish the Minister well in his difficult task and thank him for his efforts to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Kelleher and Enright for providing time for me to reply to the debate.  I thank Members for their valuable contributions to the debate and I endorse everything that has been said by my colleagues about the Government's intention to tackle the drug problem head on.  The fact that the Taoiseach's office is co-ordinating the establishment of the task force, under the aegis of the interdepartmental policy committee on local development, is also an indication of the Government's resolve to do all it can to address the issue.</P>
      <P>The task force will concern itself not with treating the fallout of drug misuse, which affects a number of areas &mdash; for example, health related problems and crime &mdash; but with tackling the root social factors which give rise to drug misuse in the Dublin inner city areas.  It will also examine how best local community groups can be harnessed to prevent misuse and how partnership arrangements with parents and other groups should be structured.  The only way forward in the fight against drugs is an integrated approach which involves statutory, voluntary and community groups working together for the benefit of local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators McGennis, Lee and Kelleher mentioned the need for co-ordination. Following a Government decision in july last year on measures to control the supply of drugs, the national <Col N="846" /> co-ordinating committee on drug misuse was reconstituted.  The committee's terms of reference are as follows: to advice the Minister for Health and Justice, and other Ministers as appropriate, on issues relating to drug misuse, including best practice in Europe; to monitor trends in drug misuse; to co-ordinate demand and supply reduction measures on drug misuse; to monitor the effectiveness of actions taken to combat drug misuse, and to make recommendations to the Ministers for Health and Justice, and other Ministers as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Membership of the committee is drawn from the Departments of Health, Education, Justice, the Marine, Defence, Foreign Affairs, the Environment and Enterprise and Employment and the Revenue Commissioners with representation also from health boards, the Garda national drugs unit and the health research board.  I have the honour of chairing the committee and as chairman I have a particular interest in ensuring the efforts of all agencies involved in the fight against drugs are co-ordinated to maximum effect.</P>
    <P>At its meetings to date the committee has reviewed current policy in relation to preventing drug misuse. It has established two subcommittees, one responsible for demand reduction and the other for supply reduction.  It was apparent at the first meeting that there was an urgent need for all of the agencies involved in tackling drug misuse to engage in ongoing communication and to collaborate on the formulation of all policy and in developing initiatives.</P>
    <P>The measures announced last February by the Minister for Health help to define the agenda for both the national committee and the subcommittees.  One of the Government's decisions was that each health board should establish a committee to co-ordinate activities at a regional level.  The regional structure will provide a forum for co-operation in which all major issues can be addressed. The Eastern Health Board has established such a committee already which <Col N="847" /> is fulfilling a valuable role in recommending how proposals to tackle drug misuse should be developed.  Representatives from each of the regional committees will sit on the demand reduction subcommittee ensuring there is a flow of information from national level to regional and local levels and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>Addressing drug misuse involves action at many levels.  While dealing with those who are misusing drugs must be a priority for the health services, in order to reduce the number of young people who are turning to drugs as a means of coping with life one of the most effective tools we have is education and prevention.  My colleague, the Minister for Education, is working on the development of a substance abuse prevention programme for primary schools which will commence in the autumn.</P>
    <P>As part of my brief at the Department of Health I have responsibility for health promotion and I am particularly pleased that in implementing these proposals major emphasis will be placed on education and prevention measures. The promotion of healthy lifestyles among our young people will be a core theme.  Self-respect is important in this regard and it is the best way to demonstrate to them that drugs need not impinge on their lives.</P>
    <P>Others will have a vital role to play in this approach.  I cannot emphasise enough the part which parents have to play.  Parents are, after all, the essential role models for their children and it is to them that children look for guidance and support.  They are also more likely to notice the tell tale signs, such as changes of behaviour, which can be an indication of experimenting with drugs. In the Eastern Health Board's service plan, parenting programmes will be initiated among drug using parents in order to equip them with basic parenting skills to help them play a more positive role in rearing their families in a difficult environment.  Other health boards and agencies have developed parenting programme models for use with parents <Col N="848" /> whose children may be experimenting with or misusing drugs.  These models aim to equip parents with skills to deal with communicating with their children and also to deal with conflict resolution.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health will move forward with implementing the Government's drug misuse strategy as a matter of urgency.  With improved co-ordination and a commitment to work together to find solutions to the dreadful problems which drug misuse causes in society, I am confident the services we provide at preventive, treatment and rehabilitative levels will be greatly improved.</P>
    <P>While health services alone are only one element in a much bigger strategy, my Department and all the agencies which come under its remit will work relentlessly to address this major issue. We have consulted with a number of our British and European counterparts in examining how these countries address drug misuse.  From these consultations I am encouraged and confident that the Government decisions have set us on the right track and that the actions implemented as a result of these decisions should result in an improvement in management of the drug misuse problem, particularly in the Eastern Health Board area, where the problem is most acute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to open today's debate on <i>Delivering Better Government &mdash; A Programme of Change for the Irish Civil Service.</i>  As Members are aware, this Government is fully committed to modernising the Civil Service, thus enabling it to meet better the many challenges it faces in today's more turbulent and demanding environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> The Irish Civil Service is one we can be proud of; it has served this House well and made a very significant contribution to the development of the country over the past 75 years of nationhood. We have long grown accustomed to, and taken for granted, its integrity, impartiality and equity of treatment for all. These core values have been major assets on which successive Governments have been able to confidently rely.</P>
    <P>However, society evolves and changes; economies grow and become more diverse and complex, and both become more demanding on Government and the services it offers.  Government must respond to these changes if it is to govern effectively and meet the reasonable expectations of those it represents. Ireland is no exception in this regard.  At present, Governments everywhere are faced with similar problems and unprecedented challenges.  The result is that Governments throughout the world are reconsidering the way in which they relate to citizens and businesses, how best to ensure provision of public services and how to maintain the capacity to govern in the face of great uncertainty and calls for change.</P>
    <P>Given the central, pivotal role of the Civil Service in advising and supporting Government and in delivering services, we must, in the first instance, consider the changes it must make if it is to maintain its proud tradition and record, and if it is to continue to serve the country and future governments to the best of its ability.</P>
    <P>There is also the very significant influence that the civil and public service exert on the economy.  This involves an array of organisations which interact in a variety of ways with one another, with businesses and with the public at large. The public service employs 189,000 people with a current pay and pensions bill of £4.8 billion per annum.  Within the public service, the Civil Service, at which <i>Delivering Better Government</i> is targeted, consists of some 29,500 people costing £713 million in pay and pensions per annum.  By any standards, these are large industries making up a very sizeable <Col N="850" /> chunk of the economy and accounting for just over 50 per cent of current public expenditure.  We owe it to the taxpayers to see to it that the civil and public services are well managed, operate to their full potential, deliver quality services that meet the needs of their customers and are value for the money spent on them.  The Government, as the employer of the civil and public services, has a major responsibility in this regard.  In turn, all Members of this House must share in that responsibility and ensure &mdash; on behalf of taxpayers, the customers of public services and civil and public servants themselves &mdash; that there is an efficient and effective system of public administration.</P>
    <P>In considering the changes that are necessary to meet more effectively the challenges ahead, the Government has taken this triangle of shareholders &mdash; the taxpayer, the customer and State employees &mdash; and comprehensively examined the way in which the Civil Service currently operates and how it might work better in the interests of all three.</P>
    <P>The odyssey on which we have embarked commenced with the launch of the Strategic Management Initiative in 1994 by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  That initiative, or SMI as it is commonly called, set each Department and Office the task of more clearly defining its role through identifying its objectives and devising strategies to achieve those objectives.  In short, the SMI requires management in each Department and Office to ask itself constantly a number of key questions: what business are we in?  Are we doing what we should be doing?  Who are our customers?  Are we meeting their needs?  What changes should we be making?</P>
    <P>The result is a better understanding and a more explicit articulation of what each Department and Office should be doing rather than what it is actually doing.  A great deal was learned through this process, resulting in a sharper focus on objectives and results.  The exercise also highlighted a number of constraints <Col N="851" /> commonly perceived as hindering the better use of resources.  Accordingly, in 1995, the Government asked the group of departmental secretaries &mdash; the co-ordinating group &mdash; established to oversee the development of the SMI across the Civil Service, to develop proposals to address these and other constraints. Drawing on the departmental SMI exercises, a number of specially prepared reports on a variety of aspects of Civil Service management, and on their own experiences, the group prepared a comprehensive set of proposals for Government to consider.  The Government, having given detailed consideration to these proposals, endorsed them.  The result is <i>Delivering Better Government, A Programme of Change for the Irish Civil Service.</i></P>
    <P>I would stress that this is a framework, not a fully articulated programme of change.  It will take time to develop. The framework sets out a clear basis on which consistent and ongoing change can be achieved.  It also establishes a clear overall direction for change, a set of principles and parameters which will inform and direct the overall process.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is excellence. <i>Delivering Better Government</i> thus constitutes a blueprint for change across the machinery of State, a means of steadily enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the civil and public service over time.  How much time?  Change of this magnitude could not be achieved within the lifetime of a single Government. All-party co-operation will be essential and I am glad to state that such commitment is assured.  A broad consensus exists in this House as to the need for change and the general areas where change is required.  Some improvements will become apparent almost immediately while others will take time to develop.  Many of the expected benefits will be cumulative and dependent on changes in other areas for their successful implementation.  It is for this reason that the Government is taking a holistic approach, placing the required changes within an integrated programme rather <Col N="852" /> than a series of loosely related initiatives.</P>
    <P>Widening the SMI to include the public service is also high on the agenda. The SMI reinforces and complements work already under way in relation to the better provision of public services and, in particular, the devolution of functions from central to local government. The Government has already stated its commitment to the renewal of local government on the basis of the principles of subsidiarity, accountability, integration, effectiveness and participation. It has established the Devolution Commission to make recommendations which include that significant additional functions are devolved to the local government system, on the basis of a phased programme, and local authorities are meaningfully involved in policy and administration regarding functions not directly devolved to them.</P>
    <P>The critical assessment of Departments' activities and the principles of interdisciplinary partnership and subsidiarity inherent in the commission's task are a key aspect of the approach under-pinning the SMI.  The Minister for the Environment has recently extended the SMI to local authorities.  Responsibility for the devolution programme has been placed under the aegis of the Taoiseach to highlight the priority being given to the task.  The commission has been asked to report in phases and, I understand, is finalising its first statement at present.  The extension of SMI to the wider public service will take place during the course of this year.</P>
    <P>I have already alluded to the external pressures for change.  To these may be added the pressures coming from within the Civil Service where there is recognition that some radical changes are needed if it is to perform to its full potential.  Such pressures, both external and internal, are not in themselves sufficient to produce the needed changes. We must be able to articulate a better and viable alternative and a meaningful series of steps that will lead logically to that chosen alternative.  It is essential <Col N="853" /> also that any such alternative meet the needs of customers, including Government. It must also be sufficiently inspiring to enthuse and energise those most affected by the envisaged changes.  In short, when people believe in what they are doing, they will put time and energy into making it work.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Delivering Better Government</i> sets out such an alternative or vision of the Civil Service of the future.  Based on the Government's vision for Ireland as contained in <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, the Civil Service of the future will be open and flexible, operating to the highest standards of integrity, equality, impartiality and accountability, with a mission and culture of quality service to the Government and the public at every level.  It will be a Civil Service that will make the maximum contribution to national, social and economic development while making the best use of the talents and skills of its staff.  In short, the aim is a Civil Service that retains its core values, while becoming a high performance, efficient, effective and value for money organisation, delivering quality services to all its customers.  The bottom line is excellence in everything it does.</P>
    <P>I will now address in some detail the main elements of <i>Delivering Better Government.</i>  Excellence in performance is the central tenet of the Government's programme.  However, for excellence in performance there must be clear lines of responsibility and accountability.  Thus, the issue of accountability must be addressed as a priority.  When the State was founded the core Civil Service was already in existence.  In order to give statutory validity to its activities, it became necessary to introduce special legislation, the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  This crucial statute was designed primarily to underpin already existing structures and to bring order to bear on what was then a somewhat chaotic system of public administration. To that extent, the 1924 Act was very successful and it has many strengths that have served the governance of this country extremely well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> However, a somewhat conservative interpretation of its provisions in the succeeding decades since the 1920s has tended to reinforce a rather static model of government.  As a result we have today a system of governance which, while strong and robust, needs to be updated to meet the demands of governing in the late 20th century.  This, of course, is not surprising.  Those who framed the 1924 Act were basing their model on an administration shaped in, and suited to, the 19th century, not one gearing up for the complexities facing us as we approach the 21st.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Delivering Better Government</i> will entail a number of changes to the 1924 Act and will make it possible also to consider incorporating in legislation a statement of vision to underpin the overall change process.  A more definitive allocation of authority, responsibility and accountability in the Civil Service of the future will enable roles and functions to be more clearly defined at all levels.  In particular, an amended Act will set out in more specific terms than at present the respective roles and responsibilities of Ministers and Departmental Secretaries and provide for the delegation of functions from higher to lower levels within each Department, depending on the circumstances.  This will enable services to be delivered with optimum efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>There is nothing very radical in what is being proposed.  The existing situation, where responsibility for all actions in theory falls to one person, namely, the Minister, is no longer a realistic foundation for a modern system of governance.  The proposed changes are really nothing more than the application of common sense in a complex and demanding environment, where responsibility for all that transpires cannot reasonably be expected to fall on the shoulders of one individual.  The changes I speak of will not, of course, alter the constitutional position of Ministers, who will remain accountable to the Dáil for their Departments.</P>
    <P>Allied to more clearly defined roles and responsibilities are openness and <Col N="855" /> transparency.  Openness and transparency are intended to connote an atmosphere or ethos in which the provision of information is the norm rather than the exception, leading to an organisation whose innermost workings are explicit and readily understood.  In our programme for Government we gave high priority to the introduction of legislation which would greatly increase both the quantity and the quality of the information available to the public on all aspects of public administration.  Freedom of information legislation, once introduced, can be expected to make a meaningful and lasting impression on the way the machinery of government operates.  Internal openness and transparency are needed to support an improved system of accountability.  In order to identify clearly points of responsibility and the lines of accountability running between them, we need to be able to distinguish between staff goals and activities and the underlying quality of their performance.  This requires a structured flow of information and feedback.  The more flexible or intricate the lines of accountability, the greater the importance of timely and accurate information on performance and the achievement of objectives.  Only in this way can excellence in performance be pursued and service quality guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The changes we will make to the Minister and Secretaries Act will underpin the framework of accountability. <i>Delivering Better Government</i> sets out such a framework which essentially ensures that Government, the Dáil and the people of this country will be better served, be more aware of who is responsible and accountable and get better value for money.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the delivery of services. I do not want to give the impression that public servants have not traditionally been concerned about the quality of service delivery.  This is far from being the case.  Many Government Departments and public bodies have made significant and laudable advances <Col N="856" /> in recent years in this area, developing an ethos which centres very much around the needs of the customer and his or her perception of service delivery. <i>Delivering Better Government</i> reinforces this trend and incorporates it into a general management framework applicable across all areas of the public service.  In so doing it is making explicit what has already been implicit in many parts of the civil and public service for several years now by identifying ways in which a more streamlined, systematic approach can be developed.  It is also the pursuit of excellence wherever possible, through exploring ways of making what already works well, work even better. This is what the delivery of quality services is all about.  It means looking afresh at the rules and procedures, questioning the fundamentals and asking our customers about the services.  It means having the courage to examine old assumptions and ask whether they continue to be valid in today's ever-changing environment.</P>
    <P>This means thinking deeply about the needs of our customers and how they are likely to evolve over time.  It means asking if the civil and public service can continue to evolve in tune with those needs?  That is often the critical question. The Government's proposed quality service initiative will focus very strongly on this issue, pursuing excellence on the basis of the following principles: a specification of the quality of service to be provided to customers; consultation with and participation by customers on a structured basis; the provision of quality information and advice to customers; reasonable choice for customers in relation to the method of delivery of services; the integration of public services at local, regional and national levels; and a comprehensive system of measuring and assessing customer satisfaction and complaints mechanisms which operate close to the point of delivery.</P>
    <P>A working group on quality customer service is being established to develop and implement the quality service initiative.  This group, which comprises <Col N="857" /> both public and private sector interests, will report to the Government in the summer and on the basis of its recommendations the initiative will be put into effect.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for the consumers of public services, I am personally very committed to this initiative.  I intend to have it implemented as soon as possible.  The quality service initiative underscores the Government's commitment to excellence in the Civil Service and sets out a rational and consistent basis for pursuing excellence in service delivery in an orderly and systematic manner.  It will also address an area which is too often overlooked in speaking of quality of services, namely, the Government itself as a customer of the Civil Service.  Without high quality policy advice, no Government, however committed, would be able to formulate and implement suitable strategies for national development. It is only by considering informed analysis and expert advice that Government can pursue excellence in its own sphere.</P>
    <P>I should also advert to the impact of freedom of information legislation on service delivery.  Not only will the customer of public services enjoy a closer relationship with those who provide those services, he or she will also be able to influence their design and delivery, particularly in any instance where their own case is directly affected.  In other words, the traditional distance between the customer and the service provider will be reduced and, where possible, eliminated.  Until now, the customer of a public service has normally been entitled only to information where the procedures and guidelines specifically make such provision.  But under the freedom of information legislation a new principle will operate, namely, that the customer will normally be entitled to information pertaining to his or her case unless some provision to the contrary has already been stipulated.  This will greatly extend the range of information available in many cases and enable civil servants to work more <Col N="858" /> closely with the customer without feeling constrained by an ethos of secrecy.</P>
    <P>The delivery of quality services to the individual customers should not distract attention from the need to consider the commercial or corporate sector in general. They too are customers of the Civil Service.  We cannot expect to further develop an enterprising economy equal to the demands of international competition if we are not alert to the many factors which influence the performance of the commercial sector.  Experience in OECD member countries shows that regulatory simplification can do much to assist the smooth operation of business and promote economic growth.  While there are several schools of thought on the way regulatory reform should be addressed and how far it should go, it is generally accepted that all Government bureaucracies tend over time to add to the regulatory burden on the private sector and that Governments must make a conscious effort to question and redress this tendency.</P>
    <P>For this reason the Government has included in <i>Delivering Better Government</i> a set of regulatory reform principles which are designed to increase the quality rather than the quantity of regulation; eliminate unnecessary and/or inefficient regulations; simplify necessary regulations and related procedures as much as possible; lower the cost of regulatory compliance; and make regulations more readily understood by the public.  The application of these principles will, of course, be guided by the need to protect the public interest in all cases.  The programme of regulatory reform will also include the introduction of national guidelines to improve the quality of new regulations; the development of self-regulatory mechanisms where feasible and effective; and the review every five years or so of existing regulations.</P>
    <P>A high level working group, again involving private sector expertise, will drive this initiative and ensure that it meets the objectives set by Government. Regulatory reform is intended also to make civil servants increasingly <Col N="859" /> mindful of the needs of business and to avail of every opportunity to reduce to the absolute minimum the administrative and other overheads imposed by the State.</P>
    <P>A great deal of attention is devoted to the area of human resources &mdash; the major asset of the Civil Service &mdash; in <i>Delivering Better Government.</i>  I alluded earlier to the importance of enthusing and energising those who will have a major role to play in bringing about the changes we are now embarking on. Indeed, it should be very clear that <i>Delivering Better Government</i> will be demanding on the creativity and initiative of civil servants by allowing them greater scope to debate and apply more innovative solutions and ideas.</P>
    <P>I believe this will lead to greater job satisfaction and a renewed sense of involvement in how their Departments operate.  But this cannot be expected to occur in a vacuum.  Staff will need assistance in developing and shaping their skills in a way which best suits the needs of their Departments while complementing their overall carrer development requirements.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Delivering Better Government</i>, there-fore, provides for a renewed focus on the human resource function.  That function will be redirected to take on a strategic role in managing and developing staff, operating on the principle that the most important resource in the Civil Service is its staff and their talents.  I am speaking here of a new era in people management, designed to bring the best out in our civil servants and to enable them to use their talents to best effect.</P>
    <P>Up to now the approach to managing staff and their development has been too <i>ad hoc</i> and short term in approach. Such shortcomings have become increasingly evident to staff at all levels. Indeed, if the approach now envisaged had been operating earlier, the need to resort to <i>ad hoc</i> measures such as restrictions on the filling of vacancies would not have arisen.  Such measures only highlight the need for a more strategic approach in the human resources <Col N="860" /> area, where changing needs and demands can be better anticipated, planned for and more rationally addressed, thereby greatly reducing the risk of having to resort to rough and ready solutions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Delivering Better Government</i> is designed to strengthen the strategic management process so that staff can be readily redeployed to areas of greatest need, where our major resource can be used to best effect, where staff have the opportunity to use their skills and potential in the most creative and satisfying way, and where the most productive individuals receive rewards commensurate with their performance. This will require an increased emphasis on skills acquisition, training and development.  For this reason <i>Delivering Better Government</i> proposes that each Department increase its training budget to 3 per cent of payroll costs compared to an average of 0.75 per cent at present.</P>
    <P>There are also many other aspects of human resources management that have to be adapted if we are to achieve a high performance, results oriented service. Accordingly, existing policies and practices in areas such as recruitment, training, redeployment and promotion will be subjected to critical examination.  We are seeking to put in place policies and practices that enable the Civil Service to respond quickly and flexibly to changing needs and work requirements.  This will essentially entail that state of the art human resources management practices become the norm.  Where existing practices are found wanting or inhibit the best use of personnel, they will be adapted and improved.</P>
    <P>A major goal of the new human resources management approach is the creation of a performance management system that ensures staff at all levels can work to their full potential.  Traditionally, managing performance has not been a strong feature of staff management in the Civil Service.  The strategic management initiative and the change in approach now being pursued are designed to address this weakness. There is little value in more clearly allocating <Col N="861" /> authority, responsibility and accountability and setting objectives at all levels unless there is a means of assessing progress and performance.  An effective, pragmatic performance management system is, therefore, an essential element in achieving a more accountable and results driven Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Effective performance management also means that good and excellent performance are openly recognised and rewarded.  Equally, it means that poor performance be better managed and that there are appropriate sanctions to help deal more effectively with this problem when it arises.</P>
    <P>I am aware some concerns have been aired in relation to the changes designed to enable better management of performance generally and underperformance in particular.  Let me say here and now that such concerns are misplaced and that civil servants and their unions have nothing to fear.  What is involved is quite simply the placing of responsibility for all aspects of performance and its management on those who should have that responsibility &mdash; senior management in each Department and Office.</P>
    <P>This is acknowledging reality and allowing management to exercise fully a basic management function, thus ensuring a more transparent and pragmatic approach to managing performance. The proposed change will also bring the Civil Service into line with practice in other administrations and organisations. The changes will be accompanied by appropriate safeguards and due process to protect both management in exercising its functions and the rights of staff. They will also be the subject of detailed consultation and discussion with staff interests.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of human resources, I want to direct the attention of the House to the matter of equality of opportunity for women and for people with a disability.  In the case of women, we have long had an imbalance whereby women are not adequately represented in middle and higher management grades in the Civil Service.  Below <Col N="862" /> these levels, women outnumber their male counterparts.  The charts on page 48 of <i>Delivering Better Government</i> illustrate this imbalance in a stark and graphic way.</P>
    <P>Putting aside the traditional constraints that prevailed up to 1973 on women staying in the Civil Service after marriage, the progress since then is disappointing to say the least.  Clearly, there are barriers at work which we must identify and address.  For example, women graduates are not being recruited in the numbers one would expect.  Neither are women in the Civil Service advancing as they should.  It is not clear why this should be the case. We are now committing ourselves to finding out why this is happening and what needs to be done to redress the serious imbalance that exists.</P>
    <P>In contrast to other countries, where admittedly there is a stronger tradition of women working outside the home, our recent record is dismal.  We owe it to that one half of the population who are women to determine the causes and take the necessary action to remedy the situation.  I am strongly committed to improving the current position and I look forward to examining the results of the researches we are now going to undertake and acting on them.</P>
    <P>Equally, we must cater for those who have a disability.  They, too, have a contribution to make commensurate with their talents.  I am pleased to say that the Civil Service has filled the 3 per cent employment quota laid down some years ago.  However, we must now also ensure equality of treatment by applying the code of practice drawn up in 1994.  There is also a need to pursue the 3 per cent quota in the wider public service to ensure its attainment as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In addressing accountability, transparency and openness, improved human resources management, as well as the delivery of quality services, there is also a clear need to assess financial performance and the extent to which financial targets are being achieved.  This calls for a high standard of financial management, <Col N="863" /> with accurate and timely information on the way funds and assets are being deployed.  Accordingly, delivering better Government provides for a number of significant developments in the area of financial management.  For example, the increased emphasis on devolving responsibility and accountability will necessitate an enhanced system for setting overall expenditure allocations and for delegating authority to Departments to manage the resources allocated to them.</P>
    <P>This system of multi-annual budgeting, which the Minister for Finance announced earlier this year in his Budget Statement, will operate to a fixed annual cycle to produce a rolling three year budgetary framework.  This process will facilitate changing circumstances, both budgetary and economic, while accommodating existing and emerging priorities in public expenditure. A key feature of the overall process will be a thorough review of each programme of expenditure at least once every three years.  This will ensure the continued relevance of programmes and that they are value for money.</P>
    <P>The administrative budget system, which deals with the ongoing operating costs of each Department, will also undergo a number of improvements to develop a more effective structure for devolving responsibility to a local level and promoting greater autonomy and discretion, as well as accountability, at the point where services are delivered.</P>
    <P>The system of administrative budgets, which are now in the third year of their second three year cycle, has proved to be a positive development and has helped to keep running costs lower than they would otherwise have been. Linked to the strategic management process, it is an invaluable tool for ensuring best use of resources and value for money are achieved.  It is essential, therefore, that, as now envisaged, it be subjected to continuous improvement to allow for the optimum exercise of local autonomy in managing departmental resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> The financial management improvements now being pursued would be difficult, if not impossible, to carry through without the necessary means of handling the additional data requirements. Existing financial management systems will, therefore, be extended to embrace wider information needs such as planned resource allocation, programme evaluation, ongoing management control, day-to-day financial reporting, performance assessment and demonstrating value for money.  Such a multi-dimensional approach will necessitate the introduction in some areas of an accruals based accounting system.</P>
    <P>Such improvements will yield a better picture of the unfolding budgetary position at any given time and enable a more accurate assessment to be made of the extent to which programme expenditure is achieving its intended purpose. All in all, they will ensure that the ideal of excellence extends also to the management of the public finances and that it is supported to the greatest extent possible by hard information and timely feedback and analysis.</P>
    <P>It should now be clear that the changes being pursued in a number of areas will require the enhancement of a range of systems from those under-pinning service delivery to human resources and financial management.  It is vital that such systems be properly supported by the innovative and effective use of information technology.  New technology has made a very significant contribution to the delivery of services and performance generally in the Civil Service.  However, studies have shown that even more can be achieved, for example, by harnessing technology to redesign long standing work processes, reporting arrangements and information management practices which have their origins in the pre-technology era.</P>
    <P>The use of information technology to effect significant improvements in the way the Civil Service carries out its business will be proactively pursued.  In particular, exploiting the potential of technology to enhance further the delivery <Col N="865" /> of services and to enable higher levels of performance to be achieved in all Departments will be a top priority.</P>
    <P>There is one other element of <i>Delivering Better Government</i> which I want to address, that is, the need for greater co-ordination between Departments. We are increasingly faced with issues and problems which do not fall within the sphere of activity and responsibility of any one Department. In such cases Departments need to work closely with one another in identifying appropriate solutions and to co-operate in their implementation.  This calls for a dynamic and corporate approach within the Civil Service as a whole and the development of mechanisms to facilitate closer cross-departmental co-operation. In response to this need, a number of dedicated cross-departmental teams will be set up on a pilot basis to develop new approaches to such issue as, for example, employment, competitiveness and local development.  The lessons to be learned from their experiences will be used to develop a systematic and innovative process for tackling key issues of national importance.  The work of such teams will be co-ordinated by a Minister or Minister of State to ensure the needed political direction and commitment to acting on the results.</P>
    <P>It is planned also that strategic results areas &mdash; or SRAs &mdash; that is, key priority areas of Government activity, and the means of implementing them, be developed for the Civil Service.  One important outcome of the SRA approach will be a shared agenda for Departments which will focus their attention on their individual and joint contributions to the achievement of objectives.  This will lead also to improved levels of co-operation between Departments.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to discuss in further detail the many elements that go to make up the comprehensive programme of change that is envisioned in <i>Delivering Better Government.</i>  However, I must address a further question, indeed the major question, of how it is <Col N="866" /> going to be implemented.  In the first instance, unlike previous programmes, <i>Delivering Better Government</i> enjoys a high level of commitment and support from across the political spectrum.  I welcome this as it ensures that it will continue to be supported over the long term.  It will need that long-term support because it will take many years, and a few governments, to see to its ongoing implementation.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that we had embarked on an odyssey &mdash; indeed one may say an odyssey of Homeric proportions &mdash; when the previous Government launched the Strategic Management Initiative.  <i>Delivering Better Government</i> was born of, and is part of, the SMI process.  Given the nature of that process, it is but another step along the road to putting in place a strategic management culture committed to continually renewing and refocusing organisational effectiveness in the interests of maintaining the relevance of the Civil Service and of meeting the changing needs and ambitions of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Second, embedded as it is within the SMI, <i>Delivering Better Government</i> can draw upon an already existing set of mechanisms for managing change.  It has also been developed at the Government's request by a group of Secretaries established to represent the Civil Service as a whole and has drawn heavily from ideas and suggestions emanating from a wide variety of sources, including the main Civil Service unions.</P>
    <P>Third, in order to provide the broadest possible foundation for promoting and supporting the programme, the SMI is being extended beyond the Civil Service, its domain to date, into the wider public service.  There is also a requirement on all Departments to develop further the SMI within their own organisations and to publish a strategy statement by the end of this year.  This will be the first time that any Irish Government has published a set of policy documents setting out the broad strategic process employed by the Departments of the State in the achievement of their objectives.  This will constitute a valuable <Col N="867" /> contribution to the debate on how best to advance the cause of excellence in the Civil Service and establish a sound basis for implementing <i>Delivering Better Government.</i></P>
    <P>Fourth, the co-ordinating group of Secretaries is being extended to include representatives of the most senior levels of management in the public and private sectors, as well as the trade union movement. It will continue also to occupy its pivotal position by reporting directly and regularly to the Taoiseach on the progress being made in implementation. The Government will shortly announce the membership of the extended co-ordinating group.</P>
    <P>Fifth, there will be, as I have already indicated, a number of high level working groups set up to develop action programmes for the various change initiatives now being pursued.  These groups will be given strict remits and timetables within which to deliver results.  Moreover, their work will be overseen by the co-ordinating group which, in turn, will report to Government on the progress being made.  I assure Senators that early results will be forthcoming and I look forward to keeping the House fully informed and up to date on developments and progress.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that change and the achievement of excellence cannot be imposed from above.  To be successful, change must evolve from a recognition by all concerned of the need for it.  All concerned must also be involved actively in helping to determine the best means of effecting such changes.  To this end, <i>Delivering Better Government</i> incorporates a process of consultation and dialogue which will involve staff at all levels having the opportunity to contribute to the change process, to influence its final shape and to have a real say in its implementation.  The Government is fully committed to such dialogue and to ensuring that it takes place at all levels within the Civil Service.  The objective is, as I have said already, to enthuse and energise all involved so that they will take the process forward and <Col N="868" /> take ownership of it.  With that kind of ownership and commitment, <i>Delivering Better Government</i> cannot but succeed. I am confident this will be the case.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Delivering Better Government</i> marks a major step towards a better Civil Service &mdash; a goal we are all interested in reaching.  It sets down a comprehensive framework in which change, both in the short and long term, can be managed in a rational and coherent manner.  The change we speak of is change for the better, change that will result in a Civil Service which is both more efficient and more effective.  I have every confidence that the Civil Service will respond positively, as it always has done to major challenges.  I know this House will support it in its efforts; the people we represent and serve will expect nothing less from us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to join the Minister in the pursuit of excellence. Who does not wish to achieve excellence? However, having listened to the Minister's speech this afternoon, excellence is at no risk of being grasped much less attacked by this Government.  The pages through which she has taken us are adorned with clichés of the kind which Senator Ross referred to last week as a load of codswallop.  Had he listened to the address today he would have been even more convinced of his analysis.</P>
      <P>Last week Senator Ross, a member of the Minister's party, said the strategic management initiative was a new phrase which has come into the language of Government and bureaucracy in the past five years.  Everybody is using it, but it means nothing.  He said it was a relaunch of an old hat and that the taxpayers' money and the time and apparatus of the State were being wasted to produce such propaganda.  I agree with him.  If he was here today to listen to the Minister's hunting call as she chased across the fields of excellence, he would be even more convinced that the industry of jargon and meaningless words is growing at a healthier rate in the public service under her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> I examined the various titles attributed to this Minister and I was amazed to discover she has responsibility for the consumer of public services.  I will explain why this elusive quarry, excellence, is safe and secure from the grasp of this Government.  It is extraordinary that a Minister, who is one of four Ministers in the Department of Finance &mdash; there were only two when I was there &mdash;can refer to the Civil Service, the pursuit and development of excellence and strategic management without making any reference to the most fundamental development in the Civil Service in recent times &mdash; the mushroom growth of Civil Service numbers, particularly under this Government.  How could a Minister with responsibility for achieving effective and excellent public service give us 12 pages of clichés and adornment without reference to the growing numbers in the public service?  I will illustrate how the numbers have mushroomed, which is what the taxpayers, business people and social welfare recipients want to know.</P>
    <P>The total number in the non-industrial Civil Service in 1987 &mdash; the year before a certain Government, of which I was a member, came into office &mdash; was 28,570.  By 1990 that number had been reduced by over 12 per cent to 26,015 &mdash; a reduction of 2,500.  It remained at that level until 1991.  What has this Government, which pursues excellence, openness, transparency and accountability, achieved since they came into office? Civil Service numbers, which were healthy and trim at 26,015, have now jumped to 29,491.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not recall interrupting the Minister and I will not be distracted by her now.  The figures for 1996 are 29,491 and they are still growing. We talk about pursuing excellence, but the cost of non-capital supply services is £9.5 billion.  It was just over £5.6 billion in 1987.  There is to be an <Col N="870" /> increase of more than 40 per cent in the non-industrial Civil Service current Estimates for non-capital services.  This can be seen from table 2 of the <i>Estimates for Public Services</i> for 1996.  This is an atomic mushroom growth which is in danger of contaminating our whole enterprise society.  The Minister, in the course of her long peroration on the pursuit of excellence, did not make a single reference to the need to control the growth of and numbers in the public service.  If the Minister wishes to refer me to where she mentioned this, I would be happy to yield to her.</P>

It will be a costly pack by the time this Government is finished and excellence will be secure from the hounds which will pursue it.  The hounds are growing in number and are yapping and yelping in every direction with no prospect of ever catching the quarry.</P>
      <P>There have been other interesting developments in recent times with regard to the public service but the Minister made no reference to them. The public is anxious to hear from the Minister with responsibility for the consumers of public services, as she describes herself.  I am speaking as one of the triangle of shareholders, as Brendan Behan might have said.  Within the public service, there has been a growth of phenomenal proportions in the ranks of special advisers and strategic programme managers.</P>

      <P>That remark is an example of the difficulties we may face in ensuring that the Government delivers the expert quality programme it has promised.  The strategic management initiative document on the pursuit of excellence has a special chapter on programme managers which outlines their function &mdash; to give expert advice to Ministers.  What about all the highly commended civil servants about whom the Minister spoke?  Are they not equipped to give expert advice without the need for programme managers and special advisers?  Are they not to be trusted to give such advice or must we recruit more experts from outside the public service, which now cost £12 million per annum?  A prominent civil servant, who understandably did not want to be named, had a view about these expert advisers.  He said that civil servants are uncomfortable with people who come into the Civil Service to tell them how to do their business.  The people the Minister proclaimed and lauded &mdash; I share her views about them because I worked with them in a number of Departments over the years &mdash; deserve better than to have a new phalanx of programme managers introduced to provide expert advice.</P>

      <P>There are special advisers with responsibility for constituency support programmes all over the place.  This and other Ministers have them.  They are paid for out of taxpayers' money and they were not already in the public service.  The public wants issues like this to be dealt with in the pursuit of excellence.  What right has a Minister to use public funds to keep his or her constituency seat secure?  This is the kind of nonsense which the public <Col N="873" /> rejects and repudiates.  All the clichés and platitudes which adorned the Minister's speech will do nothing to reduce the public's cynicism with regard to those in public office, including all of us in politics.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a passing reference to the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  We all agree with what she said and with what is contained in this elusive document. However, buried in the document is reference to this Act, which was the base statute for the whole governance of this country.  Although it has been amended a number of times since 1924, it needs to be amended more radically.  When the Ministers and Secretaries Act was passed in 1924, it did not even provide for 15 members of Government.  Over the years it provided for the maximum number under the Constitution &mdash; 15 Ministers.  In 1970 there were seven parliamentary secretaries &mdash; I was privileged to be one &mdash; and each knew their specific responsibilities.  Instead of seven parliamentary secretaries, which was an appropriate title for somebody who did not have a constitutional ministerial <Col N="874" /> function in Government, we have broken the record by appointing not ten or 15 but 16 Ministers of State, each of whom has a plethora of advisers and programme managers.</P>
      <P>We have the cheek to come in here to talk about better Government of this nation &mdash; the strategic management initiative &mdash; which allows us to recruit programme managers to give us expert advice but when we find it not to be so expert, we send them back to the Labour Party.  This is going on all the time and it has resulted in cynicism among the public, particularly when it hears about the intentions of the Government to bring about a more effective management of the public service.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not mention the Government's priorities or its vision for Ireland, like a bride richly adorned.  We will see a new vision for Ireland under this strategic management initiative for better Government.  I note the first programme of reform is in the area of openness, transparency and accountability &mdash; the ugly sisters of excellence. The Government pledges itself to the reform of our institutions at national and local level and to provide openness, transparency and accountability, which is wonderful.  The people will be reassured by openness, transparency and accountability in the public service.</P>
      <P>We will extend the opportunities for democratic participation by citizens in all aspects of public life.  Incidentally, the Minister did not say how citizens would participate more democratically. As far as citizens are concerned, they participate democratically by being elected or by supporting those who stand for election.  This type of irrelevance will ensure that their democratic participation will be strongly felt by this Government, which consistently pursues excellence, at the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking down through the priorities, one finds a range of commitments to the employment needs of our people and the development of an innovative and enterprising economy, of which we are all in favour.  Further down the list one <Col N="875" /> finds the reform of our tax system, to relieve the tax and PRSI burden on those with low incomes, especially those with families.  The Minister has hit the target because that is what the people are concerned about.  They will ask how the Minister can deliver on that principle, which is way down on the list of priorities, while providing for mushroom growth in the public service.  Figures show a 40 per cent increase in a limited number of years, particularly under this Government.  How can the Minister deliver that priority while at the same time allow such an increase?</P>
    <P>There was a time when the Department of Finance was the sole and exclusive custodian of the Government's finances.  It ensured the tightest possible control and that recruitment to the public service was at the lowest possible level.  Any businessman &mdash; there are some in this House &mdash; will say that if one wants to deliver an effective service, it must be a lean and healthy one.  When I was in the Department of Finance there was one Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The more we have the better.  We now find that the Minister is responsible for the consumer of public services.  The consumer will be reassured to know that a Minister, who <Col N="876" /> has not referred to the huge increase in public expenditure and in the numbers in the public service, represents them as a shareholder in the triangle.  It is clear that a good Government &mdash; we have all made mistakes in this area &mdash; is one which controls its growth and ensures that it is only involved where it is absolutely essential.</P>
      <P>If the private sector or private enterprise &mdash; the shareholder to which the Minister referred &mdash; can achieve something without the intrusion of Government, then it should not be involved.  Government's capacity to grow, expand and swallow is enormous. A Government which makes a virtue of growing, expanding and swallowing will in time kill the enterprise spirit of this economy.  We are ignoring reality if we do not see that now with a public sector pay bill of almost £5 billion.</P>
      <P>If shareholding and partnership is involved, the Government and the Minister might revert to what was effective shareholding and partnership during the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> from 1987 onwards. We saw the unions participate in a programme of controlled reduction of public service numbers and expenditure. The unions took a disciplined and positive part, along with Government, in achieving that controlled reduction. Those unions, who see no sense of direction or control, are now in conflict with a Government which is expanding the numbers in and the cost of the public service at a speed of knots.  Senator Cotter must appreciate the extraordinary irony that members of the left, whom one presumes are close to the trade union movement, are increasing the number employed in the public service at a rate of knots in contrast with the awful Fianna Fáilers who reduced the numbers in 1977 in agreement with the unions.</P>

      <P>The Minister scarcely made any reference to an important aspect of Government, local government. The document touches on the <Col N="878" /> point that it is an important part of Government service and an overhaul is long overdue.  The local government management system, which was introduced in the late 1920s and adopted by the Government in the early 1930s, was based on the assumption that only people who were qualified in management at the time could be effective local government managers.  There may have been something to be said for that in those days because the level of education of the population at large was limited.  However, 60 years later, the same management system is still in place.  Nobody in government at national or European levels has anything compared to the powers of a county manager.  He does not have to present his proposals to his colleagues and bring them before the Dáil and sell it in the Oireachtas.  He has reserve functions in management which in many cases have stifled local democracy in every respect.  This is a consequence of a system which is radically in need of overhaul.  I will support the Minister if she wants to direct her reforming zeal to that area.</P>

The EBR this year is pegged at between 2 and 2.5 per cent, but the level since 1989 has <Col N="880" /> been approximately 9 per cent a year. This type of misinformation cannot be unanswered.

In 1979 and 1980 his Government took on 13,000 extra civil servants in an attempt to keep the figures right.  This happened and the next time the Senator mentions being proud of something, he should skip 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was also part of the group which sold the country down the drain in 1977. We are still trying to come to grips with that problem.  The reason there is no local democracy is that the Senator and his colleagues threw it in the bin in 1977. They achieved that in one fell swoop. We talk about trying to create an enterprise economy, but it cannot be achieved in full until some means are found to undo the dreadful damage done to society at that time.  It was incredible.

      <P>It was an incredibly cynical performance and I was disappointed to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy referred to the early part of the century, the 1920s and 1930s, but things have changed since then.  Anybody who examines the management of companies in the private sector over the past 20 years will note that phenomenal change has taken place.  ISO 9001 and ISO 9002 are indications of the kind of change taking place to modernise management.  It is not simply for the sake of modernisation, but to produce better performance. For Senator O'Kennedy to decry efforts to try to do the same with the <Col N="882" /> Civil Service displays ignorance of what is going on in society.  Incredible changes are taking place.</P>
    <P>Managements in the private sector are trying to allow those who work in their organisations to express themselves to the full and to fully contribute to the day-to-day running of their organisations.  In doing this, they have released the full potential of their staff. Instead of the old hierarchical system, modern management practices are proving themselves to be worthwhile, indeed essential.</P>
    <P>I did some research on areas such as south east Asia, which I considered to be backwaters, only to discover that we had better be aware of what is happening there.  The approach of people to management is modern and up-to-date. I fear for our ability to compete in international markets in the future unless we make strenuous efforts to emulate them. In the development of modern management skills, styles and practices we are behind places which I considered to be backwaters.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Government and Civil Service lead the way on this, which is why I applaud this document. The process was begun by the previous Government, which is why I was so amazed that Senator O'Kennedy was so negative about it.  He had nothing good to say in the 30 minutes during which he spoke.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an incredible performance. One of the features of the document which I like is that civil servants had much to do with its compilation. They contributed many of the ideas used in it.  This type of consultation is essential.  Those involved in changes should have a big input.  This is widely recognised as good practice in the private sector and I am pleased to see that the Government also recognises it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Change from within is the best kind of change; gone are the days when it can be imposed.  We have an intelligent Civil <Col N="883" /> Service.  The cream of Irish society works in it.  The conditions under which civil servants have been working and continue to work are not conducive to proper job satisfaction and the delivery of a good service.  In recognising this we are taking steps to change it.</P>
    <P>I have been lucky in the course of my life to be involved with post primary students and community groups.  Whenever I get involved in a brainstorming session with an ordinary group of people &mdash; I did a few weeks ago and do so regularly whenever possible &mdash; I am awestruck.  When a group of 50 or 60 people meet and the situation is managed properly, they are amazed at the ideas they produce.  It is a great example of the empowerment of people and can be highly motivating for those involved.</P>
    <P>Occasionally in school I would set aside 40 minutes with leaving certificate students and discuss an important issue such as job creation.  Many would dismiss youngsters &mdash; 15, 16 and 17 year olds &mdash; as not having the experience, wit or wisdom to come up with ideas on issues such as job creation which are outside their experience.  However, they were always able to do so.  I have had incredible experiences where they have produced the kind of ideas made by people who were much older and wiser.</P>
    <P>The hierarchical nature of the Civil Service must be changed.  The public see people sitting at desks surrounded by filing cabinets, lifting files, dusting them down, getting information, never making a decision, passing the information up the ladder to the top, when it is then returned to the individual who must dictate a letter, do whatever is required and close the file.  It is a view &mdash; not far from reality &mdash; where those in the lower ranks have no status and get no fulfilment from their work.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service was an organisation where decisions were made at the top, orders came down from the top and the people down the line had very little means of improving the way they worked or of having a say in how their work should be organised.  It is now <Col N="884" /> recognised that this is a bad system.  It does not work in the modern world. Private industrialists moved away from it long ago.  For example, in modern factories everybody on the factory floor is involved in quality control, making redundant the work of those previously involved in this aspect.  Everybody is now involved and this has led to a huge enrichment in peoples' lives in many &mdash; regrettably not all &mdash; factories.</P>
    <P>We have a motivated group of people who can scale the greatest heights.  I wish that Senator O'Kennedy had spoken about change, how it can be managed and how the Civil Service can respond to the kind of world in which we are now living.  He did not even use one sentence to address this aspect.  Any organisation is only as good as its constituent parts.  There are 189,000 people &mdash; a huge number &mdash; in the Civil Service in different grades.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still a huge organisation. Civil servants do a huge range of work and deliver a huge range of services. Everybody would recognise that they have not been doing it in the most efficient and modern way.  The cobwebs had to be taken away to some degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of devolution of power, there is no need today for many of the middle management positions.  Some of them are disappearing in private organisations because they are not needed. The same will happen in the Civil Service, probably during the implementation of the SMI.  It is now appropriate to put in place a more lateral type of organisation where people working in a particular area can be given leeway to organise their lives, and management can recognise they are intelligent and have many gifts and skills for which they have never been given credit.  The real enrichment of the Civil Service will occur when these people are provided with the opportunity to make an input into organising their lives and the tasks <Col N="885" /> they must complete.  This is a <i>sine qua non</i> for the Civil Service.  It is only when such developments take place that civil servants will gain proper fulfilment from their work.</P>
    <P>People often speak about the satisfaction they derive from their jobs, particularly those involved in manufacturing or creating something who gain tremendous satisfaction from being able to start and finish a project and display a finished product.  Many of the staff of the Civil Service have never been in a position to do this.  Employees in the lower grades obtain information and pass it up the line where a final decision is made.  There is very little interaction, discussion or personal contact between the lower and higher grades in the Civil Service.  I am grateful that this initiative has been undertaken to change that situation which will hopefully evolve in the future.  I look forward to a time when things are much different.</P>
    <P>Last week I stated that in the future, as it assesses its tasks and objectives and the way in which it must fulfil those objectives, the Civil Service will probably reach different conclusions to those it has reached to date.  Do Members agree that people work best in a competitive environment?  This is an agreed principle and if the potential of the Civil Service is to be fully realised, that must be borne in mind when planning for the future.  I ask that civil servants consider this point and see if it is possible that some of the services they deliver could be put out to tender.  Perhaps they could then prove that they can carry out the required services better than anyone else.  The Civil Service contains many of our most intelligent and best people and I am sure they would stand up to any test of this nature.</P>
    <P>A Department should be given the task of considering such a test to see if it could be implemented without putting employment at risk and also attempting to realise the full potential of the Civil Service in a way which would give the people involved a sense of their own worth.  The Civil Service takes quite a hammering from the general public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> Civil servants who work with the public and have responsibility for handing down decisions often attract much criticism. They are not thanked for their efforts by many members of the public and must gain fulfilment from some other source, namely, doing their job to the best of their capabilities in the most efficient way possible.  Perhaps the only way this can be measured is by means of their defeating all competition to win contracts for delivery of service.  I would be glad to see this being attempted on a trial basis in some Department.  Many people will state that this cannot be achieved and that the public service should not be placed under such scrutiny. However, there is a positive side to my suggestion.</P>
    <P>Civil servants receive much criticism about the fact that they are employed in comfortable jobs, which are guaranteed for life, and that they do very little work.  Such statements are not factual. Civil servants would be in a position to prove their mettle if given the opportunity to compete for contracts for delivery of service.  I am certain that such a tendering process will be implemented within ten years.  I request that people begin to consider that kind of change.  We must live in a business environment and try to work in a business-like way.  If we are to build an enterprise economy, we must be enterprising from the top down.</P>
    <P>When I attacked Senator O'Kennedy for his approach to this issue I referred to 1977 and the way in which the then Government emasculated the local authorities in one fell swoop.  There cannot be an enterprise economy unless local authorities are entrusted with some kind of power.  At present they do not have any power and have been reduced to the status of supplicants.  On many occasions they are not very mannerly supplicants and constantly demand the provision of additional resources from above.  They have very little control over their actions, which greatly depend on funding from the Exchequer.  This terrible situation is one of total dependency from the bottom <Col N="887" /> up.  It is no wonder that the Irish people are of a similar mode in that they are totally over-dependent on the Government for everything.  Until the country discovers its backbone, we will wallow in an unacceptable fashion.</P>
    <P>Attempting to construct an enterprise economy involves many different aspects.  I believe that the public servants should be permitted to prove that they are good at the work they do and that they can deliver the goods as well as anyone else.  I hope they will be put to the test in the near future.  Perhaps a procurement company could be established by one of the Department's which will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I see it in a different way. The Department of Social Welfare, which delivers many services throughout the country, could be used as a base for such a procurement company.  Perhaps the delivery of some of the services provided by that Department could be put out to tender.  The private sector could be given an opportunity to tender against the Department for some of that work in a controlled and organised way which would not put people's jobs at risk.  I suggested earlier that civil servants should consider this issue.  Managed change will eventually occur and, therefore, we should discuss, consider and prepare for that change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this document.  It is ludicrous that since the foundation of the State, Ministers have had to take responsibility for everything that occurs in their Departments.  If someone in a Department loses a pencil and it comes to the attention of a Senator or Deputy, a debate on the matter ensues in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister involved is <Col N="888" /> held responsible for the loss of public funds because someone in their Department misplaced a pencil.  In the past Ministers have been obliged to take full and complete responsibility for events over which they have no control.  That was silly and wasted a great deal of the time of the Houses of Parliament.  I am glad the Ministers and Secretaries Act will be changed to allocate responsibility where it belongs, allocated down the line in the most appropriate way, rather than lying completely with the Secretary of a Department.  That is a very sensible change and will reduce the time civil servants spend in gathering information for replies to parliamentary questions on silly matters.</P>
    <P>Society is changing at an incredible rate.  I described the image of the civil servant as a person sitting surrounded by filing cabinets but we have the technology today to get rid of all those filing cabinets.  I do not have the technology but if I had a scanner and a fax modem &mdash; which would cost about £400 &mdash; I could get rid of most of my paper.  My secretary would not have to endlessly file documents but could scan them into the computer, put them on a floppy disk and file it.  That is how things are going and we have to learn to use the new technology in the most appropriate way. We can gather, keep and quickly access huge amounts of information with modern technology.  If we use modern machinery properly there will be more time for productive purposes.</P>
    <P>I commend the Government and the Minister for bringing forward the strategic management initiative.  I also note the involvement of the previous Government, although from listening to Senator O'Kennedy one would think they were not involved.  I hope this initiative will continue for as long as the Civil Service exists and that there will be a regular assessment of people's roles, how they interact, the most appropriate way to do things and the objectives of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for continual examination of co-ordination of the approach to attacking certain multidepartmental <Col N="889" /> problems, such as the drugs problem which the House discussed this morning.  To date, Departments have not been very good at working together. People need to be more flexible and available, and to work in teams to attack such problems.  I look forward to the strategic management initiative being put into place over a long period of time, and that it will evolve and respond to the varying needs which arise.</P>

      <P>I like the Minister's phrase, &ldquo;the odyssey we have embarked on&rdquo; because it is an odyssey of Homeric proportions which suggests odyssian cunning will be the first quality required in a Minister charged with implementing it.</P>
      <P>The strategic management initiative was launched in 1994 but, as the Minister knows, we could go back to the Devlin report in 1966 and what did, or did not, happen in the 20 years after that.  It took the best part of 20 years to produce a White Paper, which I think was called Managing the Country Better, by Mr. John Boland in the mid-1980s. That was partly because civil servants said they could not respond to Devlin's analysis &mdash; which was essentially that senior civil servants had no time to think about strategic matters because they were so involved in day to day matters &mdash; because they had no time to think about it.  That, one might have thought, was a vindication of the original analysis.  There is a rumour that the White Paper which eventually emerged did so unbeknownst to quite a number of civil servants who might have managed to delay it for another 20 years if they had known about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are embarking on something which, if it works, will be a pioneering achievement in many respects &mdash; not <Col N="890" /> that some good things have not happened in an <i>ad hoc</i> way in the last ten or 15 years, including the TLAC and other initiatives.  However, if this works it will be a major, new achievement in terms of the capacity of Governments to deliver.</P>
    <P>I will begin with what may seem a minor matter and is no reflection on the Minister.  I am astonished at the amount of verbiage which the two Houses of the Oireachtas wade through, and which civil servants have to put on paper, for the transaction of business.  On this item today we have had the document <i>Delivering Better Government</i>, a summary or achomhair, of the document and a speech by the Minister which lasted three-quarters of an hour, in which there was a great deal of overlap. There must be some way in which the time of civil servants and Ministers &mdash; and the time of Members of the Oireachtas who actually read the documents &mdash; can be saved by not having a triple shot at the target every time.  It may be harmless but it is an extraordinary waste of time.</P>
    <P>I also propose &mdash; and it may be the only ultimate result of the strategic management initiative &mdash; that the Irish and English versions of the achomair should be put on opposite pages, rather than upside down at opposite ends, so that Members of the Oireachtas who want to improve their grasp of Civil Service Irish lingo can do so.  If that was done I would think I had done some good in this House.</P>
    <P>The translation shows an enthusiasm in the translation section of the Houses of the Oireachtas, which is even greater than that of the Civil Service, for the superb performance of the Civil Service. For example, &ldquo;building on the good service that is provided at present&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;ag treisiú ar an tsársheirbhís atá á cur ar fáil faoi láthair, so that &ldquo;good&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; in translation. I do not for a moment doubt it &mdash; it simply would be easier to detect such matters and catch something of the morale in different areas of the Houses if the two versions were on facing pages. <Col N="891" /> That is a serious suggestion &mdash; I am not being facetious.</P>
    <P>There is no analysis in <i>Delivering Better Government</i> of what went wrong. Apart from the observation that political will was lacking, there is really no analytical critique.  It would have been interesting to have had a little more explanation about why we are waiting over 30 years for this document if only to warn us against obstacles that may lie in wait in the near future.  Although I am not a great believer in allocating blame, an analytical paragraph would be helpful for the future as well as providing a record.</P>
    <P>I take exception to the statement that delivering better Government constitutes a blueprint.  It is an agenda rather than a blueprint.  We are not yet at the blueprint stage because, although I welcome the general thrust, it is still aspirational. We will see that specifically when we examine the individual areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to local authorities, I agree with the observation that the powers of local authorities have been largely emasculated, in so far as they ever had great policy making powers.  We may romanticise to some extent the role of public authorities before 1977, but it is true that whatever authority they had until then has been significantly reduced since then.  Comments about local authorities being meaningfully involved etc. are meaningless unless provision is made for adequate resources.  As long as control of resources is left with central Government then, although the amount of resources may be increased from time to time, ultimate authority will lie with central Government.</P>
    <P>The test of the genuineness of this commitment will depend on how much of local authority funding can be raised independently of central Government by the local authorities.  Until that takes place everything else is either aspirational or arbitrary and we will not have effective local government decision making until as a prerequisite we have some greater control over the raising of local revenue as well as its expenditure. <Col N="892" /> Everything else is rhetoric in that particular sphere.</P>
    <P>With regard to openness and transparency as objectives, if one were disposed to be cynical, which God forbid, openness and transparency would make cynics of us all.  I do not say this with reference to any political party or Minister, but let me give a couple of examples.  The change in the ethos of some people in the Civil Service that a disposition towards openness requires would be revolutionary.  I recall when I first came to this House I tried to find out about the research resources available and I was told by the official responsible for servicing a particular committee that I was not entitled to know what research resources might be available without authorisation from that official's senior in the Department of Finance.  It was made clear to me that the senior official in the Department of Finance regarded this elementary request for basic information, which had no subversive implications for the future existence of the State, with the highest suspicion.  The first response was to find out why I wanted the information.</P>
    <P>If such a mentality is embedded in certain senior levels in the Department of Finance I shudder to think what the attitude may be in less educated or enlightened circles elsewhere in the Civil Service.  The group of Secretaries is very able but unless it can find a means of persuading those who are subject to it of embracing the same attitude, the blockers down the line will find ways of postponing, deferring and side stepping for years to come.</P>
    <P>The delay in bringing forward the Freedom of Information Bill is already raising doubts about the genuineness of the commitment of some areas of the Administration, whether on the political side, the Civil Service side or both. There is a danger that if expectations are raised and then frustrated, the final result will be even greater scepticism and cynicism about Government.  In terms of the standing of Government it is important that once expectations are raised they should be reasonably and <Col N="893" /> genuinely fulfilled.  Otherwise it would be better they were not raised at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the Government, the Dáil and the people of the country and said that the Civil Service can be proud that it has served this House well.  I am sure it has and I hope this House has served the Civil Service well.  I do not recall a solitary reference to this House in <i>Delivering Better Government</i> and that reflects the perception of senior civil servants of the relative influence and power balance of this House.  There is little reference to the Dáil apart from reference to Dáil committees.</P>
    <P>If one were to deduce from the rhetoric of the document and the Minister of State's statement the perception of where decision making really lies, one would say the Seanad was nowhere, the Dáil was on the margins, the Government towards the centre and the Civil Service at the centre.  I suspect that is a realistic perception.  However, it would be useful to analyse it more specifically if that is how things operate, which shows some deviation from constitutional rhetoric or facade.  Who can reject the principles underlying regulatory reform?  Although some regulation is necessary we are over-regulated. However, sometimes we are over-regulated simply for the sake of regulation. One welcomes the provisions in this regard.</P>
    <P>Human resources are at the kernel of the issue.  Historically, the Civil Service has recruited first class people, but it has then suffocated the potential of many of them through institutional rigidities.  I welcome the proposals for greater flexibility in recruitment and training.  More attention should be paid to how potential first class recruits can be prepared in the education system.  Reference is made to recruiting more honours graduates. I can see numerous ways in which universities could prepare graduates who would be more suitable for a number of occupations, including the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I do not mean apprenticing people at so early an age, but there are education <Col N="894" /> programmes which would allow recruits to the Civil Service and to a number of other areas to perform more effectively and better throughout life.  However they are often blocked in the universities precisely due to the same problem that afflicts the Civil Service &mdash; departmental turf wars and so on.  I would like to see those responsible for recruitment in the Civil Service asking universities how they think they could improve.  It means asking individual departments in universities how they think they could improve the supply of graduates to the Civil Service and more generally.</P>
    <P>Specific attention should be given to recruiting returned emigrants.  Young people who go abroad may acquire experience and perspectives in business. Generally, they do not work in civil services abroad but they may acquire perspectives that could be of use to the Civil Service when they return.</P>
    <P>I do not share the problems others have with programme managers and the like.  The relationship between them and the established Civil Service has to be formalised effectively.  However, they perform a necessary function and I would prefer to see attention devoted to how they could perform most effectively rather than to the question of whether they should be there at all.  I do not think the inherited structures of the Civil Service are fully appropriate to the type of challenge that confronts decision making today.</P>
    <P>We all go softly on incentives which are a significant part of <i>Delivering Better Government.</i>  It is difficult to find effective and adequate incentives to reward performance and penalise nonperformance. The statements about better Government are purely aspirational and a great deal of the success or failure of this document's contents will depend on finding effective incentives.  I am sure the Minister has a list of priorities. There are 101 things that could be done and three or four core questions to be tackled; the rest will fall into place if they are right.  If they are not it does not matter what one does in most of the <Col N="895" /> other areas.  The issue of incentives is central and no answer was given in either <i>Delivering Better Government</i> or the Minister's statement.  If we are serious, it should be a priority.</P>
    <P>Senior civil servants are badly paid for the quality of work they do, or at least for the quality of responsibility imposed upon them.  Managing directors of semi-State bodies are also grossly under rewarded for the responsibilities attaching to them.  One of the questions the State must face is how well it remunerates the managers in the commercial semi-States, particularly if they are to continue recruiting managers of the calibre they need.  I am not a begrudger when it comes to providing adequate reward for work or responsibility. We have a penny wise, pound foolish approach in that respect.</P>
    <P>Senator Cotter spoke about what he could do with a scanner.  We must improve information technology.  I ask that the Houses of the Oireachtas have the same quality of information technology as the Department of Finance, which would transform working possibilities and conditions.  I am delighted that the Department of Finance has technology but the Houses of the Oireachtas should also have it as a matter of course.  We work in primitive information technology conditions and even the minimum of self respect on the part of the Houses should demand improved services.</P>
    <P>Better co-ordination between Departments seems central to the report.  I wonder if relegating it to the end of the Minister's speech has anything other than organisational implications.  It is clear that co-ordination is central to the problem of Government because the main challenges confronting society do not fit into departmental groups.  It does not matter whether it is unemployment, poverty or drugs, individual Departments cannot confront these issues.  One of my two priorities would be the effective mobilisation of cross-departmental effectiveness in coping with challenges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> I am not a great believer in the word &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; which has been devalued.  I would be satisfied with results, even if they were not strategic results.  That does not just apply to civil servants, it also applies to universities and major multinationals.  It is a fundamental management problem, but if it is not tackled in the Civil Service many of the central problems will not be tackled as effectively as they could otherwise be.  That is crucial and political clout is required to ensure it happens.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister luck with implementation, which requires cultural changes at a number of levels.  It will be slow but if it is going in the right direction, that is the main thing.  As I said, it is important that one succeeds because failure will make people, even like myself, who are hopelessly naive inveterate idealists, cynical in the end.</P>
    <P>On page 29 of the report there is a little paragraph which states that appropriate measures to allow civil servants to protect and vindicate their character and reputation will be required, including the extension of privilege under the privilege and compellability of witnesses legislation.  That is quite an important matter in terms of the role civil servants can and must be allowed to play.  It arises partly from the kerfuffle that has arisen over what information one can give partly, I regret to say, because some Ministers have taken to passing the buck to civil servants for problems or mistakes made.</P>
    <P>Accountability should rest with those who are responsible and that is why I welcome the proposal to make those who have the authority responsible.  In our current constitutional situation it is cheap practice for a politician to blame a civil servant, even when the civil servant is responsible in objective terms but is not constitutionally responsible. That particular relationship is an important one.  It would be tragic if we were to lose the qualities which have made us value our Civil Service.  I have enormous sympathy for individual civil servants who find themselves carrying the can when constitutionally it is not <Col N="897" /> their responsibility.  I would welcome reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister to continue with the good work.  It is a Herculaen endeavour.  A television programme reminds me that Zeno accompanies Hercules.  There is no better person to combine the pair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>To continue Senator Lee's terminology, I want to bring the discussion down from the Olympian heights to the Augean Stables and talk, not about policy and strategy but about the people who do the hard work in the Civil Service.  I am an ex-civil servant. My concern is that no aspect of the proposed changes will bear heavily on the people who carry the heaviest burden in the Civil Service.  I am talking about the people who come face to face with the unemployed and people arriving at local offices of the Department with a chip on their shoulder because of the way life has treated them and so on.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this statement which at least shows friendship for the Civil Service and an appreciation of its past efforts.  It contrasts with the sort of directive that came down from Mrs. Thatcher in my Civil Service days, which were simply short notes cutting, slicing and slashing. Her contempt for the Civil Service was made quite clear and her successor is no better.  The ethos of the Government here is a refreshing change.</P>
      <P>I have been in touch with one of the trade unions and I notice it is a little concerned about input.  I know that the initial investigations were carried out by a team of permanent Secretaries and there is a reference to consultation with the unions.  They would like to ensure that when the working parties and the Minister get down to the nuts and bolts of this, the unions will be consulted properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also examine the working environment of those who have to do the tough and rough work and who have to bear the brunt of fighting with a new <Col N="898" /> man or woman every two or three minutes over the desk.  We must ensure that the working environments for those staff is appropriate to the conditions under which they work.</P>
    <P>In making assessments which may result in adverse reports, promotion or incentives, it is important to have an adaptable training system which will not apply uniformly across the board to the just and the unjust.  Training officers are a breed with which I am very familiar and they tend to have one approach for everybody.  If it affects working conditions, it will affect promotion in the Civil Service.  Different standards should be applied to people who have to do a rougher job.  An archivist who has a reflective job might also have a clerk to assist him or her.  That clerk has a different job from the clerk who is taking the brunt of public ire daily.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister of State intend to alter the existing rank structure and would it be necessary?  About 20 years ago we examined the rank structure in Northern Ireland and made some changes which enhanced career prospects. Recruitment policy is also extremely important.  It should provide for the next five years at a minimum so there will not be a sudden blip followed by an enormous amount of work to be done by a service that has been trimmed.</P>
    <P>With regard to numbers being cut, 29,000 does not appear to be an excessive number to run a State of this size. The Public Service Alliance in Northern Ireland has 30,000 members.  However, many duties were taken from local government by central government and Departments still have those duties. Nevertheless, 29,000 does not appear to be an excessively high number, despite what Senator O'Kennedy said.</P>
    <P>Departmental autonomy will be the order of the day.  Autonomy should be practised in different ways to suit the Departments concerned.  In my experience the work was hardest in Departments which issued benefits.  Every morning the post brought a fresh load of work and if one clerk was missing the <Col N="899" /> others had to deal with his in-tray because the money had to be paid. However, they were also the Departments in which supervision was the most harsh.  It is a curious thing but it is the truth.  The training of supervisors at lower and middle management level is essential and differences between Departments, such as those I mentioned, should be pointed out to them.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Kennedy's comments about the jargon.  There is not much jargon used in this document but one term always gets up my nose &mdash;&ldquo;human resources&rdquo;.  I believe the term was thought up by Mrs. Thatcher because it distanced her from the human race when she began to sack people in their thousands, not only from the Civil Service but from industry.  Suddenly, instead of being in charge of people, those who carried out the sackings were in charge of human resources. They enjoyed it so much that some of the bigger companies in England invited those who were going to be sacked to a bacon and egg breakfast.  After they got their breakfast they were told that they were human resources that were no longer needed.</P>

Senator O'Kennedy dons his rose tinted glasses when he looks back on the past but, as Senator Cotter said, his glasses are far too rose tinted when he looks back on his time in the Department of Finance.  The Minister of State will reply to the facts and figures quoted by Senator O'Kennedy.</P>
    <P>A tirade is no way to respond to the matter before us.  It is opportune that this initiative has been taken at this time.  We have been operating under a 1924 Act and the system we inherited goes back much further in our history. Apart from the Devlin report, there has not been a root and branch look at the Civil Service since the 1924 legislation. The strategy statements from Government Departments and examination of what should be done rather than what is being done, to which the Minister of State referred, is the correct approach. People can work hard but they might not necessarily be achieving the full potential of the number of people involved.  The only way to tackle that problem is to take a basic look at work practice, as is being done in this initiative, and to use strategic planning as a means of moving forward.</P>
    <P>A strategy statement from each Government Department enables civil servants to focus on the nature of their work and its value to society and themselves. The concept of strategic planning is being used more in many areas of life, whether it be in local and regional authorities or in local partnerships.  People are no longer simply doing things in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner, they are planning ahead.  That is a central aspect of what we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>The numbers in the Civil Service are large.  Over 30 different Government Departments and offices are covered. The figure is 29,500 people, who cost £713 million in pay and pensions per <Col N="901" /> annum.  If we can improve effectiveness of performance it will be money well spent.  The money involved takes a big chunk of funds from the public purse, and improvements in efficiency will save money in the long term.  Facilitating decision making is also important. Senator Cotter referred to the perception of decisions being passed up along the line with many people wasting their time passing matters from one person to another.  We could improve efficiency if we could avoid this as much as possible and give people the power and authority to make decisions at various levels within the Civil Service.  It would also increase job satisfaction for civil servants.</P>
    <P>A section in the document refers to red tape, a matter that concerns all of us.  There will obviously be a huge amount of red tape in a bureaucracy, and our membership of the EU has added a great deal to that red tape. However, it cannot be avoided.  The newspapers reported recently that the 1,200 clerical staff in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry were involved in the current industrial action. I remember wondering what 1,200 clerical officers were doing in that Department. However, one need only look at how the system works &mdash; we have already heard about the delays &mdash; to understand the day to day work they must do.  I wish the Minister of State luck in the task of reducing red tape but I doubt that it will be easy in the complicated world in which we live.</P>
    <P>The question of change is well described in the book produced by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions entitled <i>Ireland in the 21st Century.</i>  It attempts to approach the issue of change from the point of view of the trade unions.  It quotes from the Deputy Secretary of the OECD, who said:</P>
    <P>I think that we are beginning to see that the entire world, especially the industrial countries, are going through a period of immense and very disruptive wrenching technological change.  Not technological progress <Col N="902" /> which we all have learned to live with since the beginning of this century or at least since the end of the World War II but technological change probably in its disruptive effects of the order of the impact of electricity or, before that, steam propulsion.  If we look back in history these major technological changes produced major upheavals in the economies that experienced them, but at the end of the day things were better than at the beginning.  The problem was, getting over the change, altering institutions and ways of behaviour, ways of doing business and ways which adapted to the changes even as the winners turned out to be those economies, those societies that accepted the change more rapidly than others did.</P>
    <P>It continues:</P>
    <P>Organisations and societies which are successful in applying the new technologies will prosper.  Those who fail to do so will be marginalised and decline as they waste resources trying to maintain and reproduce the past.</P>
    <P>We have gone beyond the days of the big piles of paper.  This issue was discussed last week during the debate on the National Archives.  Records have always been kept on paper but from now on more material will be put on floppy disks.  We have a vast capacity to gather information which we should use to make people's working lives more efficient.  If I telephone the Department of Social Welfare, for example, and give the RSI number of the person to whom I am referring, the staff can get me information on that individual.  The same is true in other Departments.  The system has changed radically as a result of information technology.  I hope we will be able to use that to free up people's time and to make it less boring to work in the system.</P>
    <P>Many issues, such as drugs, affect a number of Departments.  The Department of Education and the Department of Health deal primarily with the demand for drugs, while the Department of Justice deals with their supply. There must be a greater Garda presence <Col N="903" /> in areas where drugs are bought and sold if we want to reduce the demand for drugs.  While this might not be effective in catching the big suppliers, it would show people living in those areas that something is being done about the problem.  This is an example of how co-operation between three Departments can produce better results than keeping them separate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the SMI to local authorities.  Many Members referred to the importance of devolving power to local authorities and of allowing them to have more say in what they do.  Many areas must come together in this regard and local authorities must be properly financed.  There should be co-operation between people who work in local authorities and those who work at central level.  It is important to extend the SMI to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to equality issues.  While there are many women in the Civil Service, there are few at the top of it.  I am glad the Minister said this issue will be addressed in the SMI.  She also referred to people with disabilities. I am glad we are fulfilling the 3 per cent requirement, but there is room for more improvement.  Some 80 per cent of people with disabilities are unemployed.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the Minister is looking at this issue from the consumer's point of view because services are provided for the good of the public. The public needs to be consulted in the same way that people working in the system need to be consulted about the best way to deliver the service.  The increase in the training budget to 3 per cent is significant.  It is fine to have such an aspiration but money is needed to make things happen.</P>
    <P>There must be a consultation process with those who work in the system, although Senator McAughtry expressed doubts about whether it would be an ongoing process.  This will not work unless the people are involved in bringing it to fruition.  Successful companies now operate in this way.  They no longer make decisions from the top down; it is a participative decision-making system. <Col N="904" /> I hope that approach will be taken in the Civil Service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Sullivan for sharing her time with me.  The Minister said we were embarking on an odyssey of Homeric proportions.  That seems a little overblown.  I hope we can achieve things a little more rapidly than Homer, although his odyssey was interesting.  Perhaps from that point of view it would be nice to embark on one.</P>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the report, <i>Delivering Better Government.</i>  It is the first major attempt in several years comprehensively to address the issue of Civil Service reform.  It is encouraging to see that it has been carried out by civil servants &mdash; the co-ordinating group of secretaries.  I am glad we did not employ a foreign firm of consultants to tell us the way forward.</P>
      <P>Given the important role which the Civil Service plays in Irish life and the tremendous economic, social and technological changes which have taken place in recent years, the publication of the report is timely.  It is remarkable that the Civil Service, which employs 29,500 people and whose remit reaches into every aspect of Irish life, is still governed by legislation which was enacted in the early 1920s for a smaller organisation with a narrower range of responsibilities. There seems to be a perception that the Civil Service is removed from mainstream economic activity.  That view must be quashed.  The Civil Service has a central role in the country's economy, in establishing our competitiveness and in the way our society is organised. It is not a separate entity in Irish society; it is part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The structures and systems put in place were no doubt appropriate when we achieved our independence, but they were based entirely on the British model and displayed little innovation or imagination on the part of the founders of the new State.  However appropriate they were for the Ireland of the 1920s, it is patently obvious they are not appropriate for the Ireland of the 1990s.  We have probably seen more change in Irish society in the past 70 years than in the previous 700.  Yet there has been no significant <Col N="905" /> change in the legislation governing the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The public sees the Civil Service as inefficient, ineffective, lacking speed of movement and flexibility of response and lacking the characteristics which are required in Ireland today.  However, the country owes a great debt to its public servants who have served us loyally under successive Governments since the State was founded.  They provide invaluable support for Governments of all political persuasions and they should be congratulated for their constancy in the face of fluctuating political complexions of Government.</P>
    <P>We must question the ability of the Civil Service as an institution to meet the needs of society.  It has failed to meet its obligations in a number of key areas and society has paid a heavy price. The extent of the maladministration in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry with regard to the beef industry has been well documented.  It has damaged Ireland's reputation as a food exporting country and has left the taxpayer with a bill for £70 million in the current year for the fines levied by the EU for the irregularities which took place.  It must be remembered that the Department was the agency with responsibility for administering intervention. Recently we heard of the scandal of negligence and mismanagement in the Blood Transfusion Service Board, which will cost the taxpayer in the order of £200 million in the form of compensation. What cannot be calculated is the cost in the human suffering and misery of those infected with hepatitis C.  In the Department of Education there are many cases of examination papers being mishandled, mislaid or dumped in bogs, with consequent damage to the integrity of our whole examination system and considerable anxiety for those preparing for important examinations.</P>
    <P>We could also point to the cost overruns on major Government construction projects, the continuing chaos in the prison service and the collapse of a major criminal prosecution yesterday due to industrial action in the Chief State Solicitor's office.  Civil servants might argue that the responsibility in all these cases <Col N="906" /> cannot be laid exclusively at their door and this may be the case.  Nevertheless, all these incidents point to the need for a thoroughgoing reform of our existing system of public administration.</P>
    <P>The basic thrust of the Government's document is welcome.  It calls for modernisation, better management and more accountability, all of which are worthy aspirations in themselves.  The Minister said that the Civil Service of the future will be open and flexible, operating to the highest standards of integrity, equality, impartiality and accountability, with a mission and culture of quality service to the Government and public at every level.  We all agree with this.  One could not but agree but where are the specific details?  What will happen?  There is no detailed timetable in the document for action.  There is no detailed list of clearly identifiable objectives and there is a commitment to quality but no means of measuring it &mdash; I think it can be measured.  I find it strange that the Government should abdicate its responsibility in this crucial area of Civil Service reform.</P>
    <P>Although there is a Minister of State with responsibility for this area, it appears that the design, management and implementation of the reform programme is to be left to the Civil Service, specifically Department Secretaries. The Minister spoke about expanding the co-ordinating group into several other areas, and trade unions were mentioned as part of that expanded group. However, consumers have not been mentioned, even though they have the greatest interest of all in what the Civil Service offers.  It is notable in the week an Bord Bia is to be reformed to include consumer representation that such representation is not being provided for here.</P>
    <P>Does the Government have any view on what course Civil Service reform should take?  Can it not take the lead in this issue and set out its blueprint for reform?  There seems to be a lack of direct involvement in this issue.  Napoleon said that war is far too important to be left to generals.  Is it equally not the case that the Government, as manager and paymaster of the Civil Service <Col N="907" /> on behalf of the taxpayer, should play the lead role in any reform of that institution?</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I recently put forward proposals on the reform of the public service, including the Civil Service, and I would commend them to the House.  My starting point was a basic set of principles on which any comprehensive reform programme should be grounded.  The concepts of efficiency and effectiveness must be central to any programme of public service reform and I am glad the Minister referred to them.  We may define efficiency as doing the thing right and effectiveness as doing the right thing.  In the Irish context neither of these objectives will be achieved without major changes in the way we currently go about our business of Government. Efficiency is perhaps the most easily measured and addressed.  How do we deliver a particular service with fewer people and at lower cost?  Could it be delivered better by organisations outside the public service?  In certain circumstances the answer to this question is yes.  Effectiveness may be a more difficult question.  Are there State programmes for which there is no longer any social or economic justification?  If so, can they be dispensed with entirely?</P>
    <P>Efficiency and effectiveness are concepts but how do we translate them into reality?  I suggest five key practical principles. First, the State should not be involved in any activity which community effort or private enterprise could carry out more efficiently and effectively. Second, State trading enterprises would operate most efficiently and effectively if structured similarly to private businesses.  Third, State Departments would operate most efficiently and effectively if their functions are clearly set out.  Fourth, departmental managers would perform most efficiently and effectively if made fully accountable for the running of their organisations without central direction but subject to fixed spending limits. Fifth, the cost of Government activities should be decided as far as possible by real market factors, that is the quality, <Col N="908" /> quantity and cost of products supplied must be determined by the purchasers' own needs.  There is nothing revolutionary about those principles.  They are easy to understand and straightforward to implement.</P>
    <P>Similar principles underlie the comprehensive programme of reform which transformed the New Zealand civil and public service, which is one of the most efficient in the world and a model for other countries wishing to go down the route to reform.  When we published our document there was considerable criticism of the New Zealand model aspect of it.  At the outset of the document we are considering today, there is reference to a MSC group which reviewed the civil services in New Zealand and Australia. Reforms in these countries succeeded because there was a strong political commitment to them and a clearly defined programme for their implementation. Effectively, the entire structure of their public service was altered dramatically within five years.</P>
    <P>A cursory reading of <i>Delivering Better Government &mdash; A Programme of Change for the Irish Civil Service</i> does not incline one to be equally optimistic about the pace at which change might be implemented here.  The whole process appears to be open ended.  There are plenty of aspirations but few specifics. There is no indication as to what precise reform are involved or as to when they would be fully implemented in an individual Department.</P>
    <P>We need a culture of excellence in our public service and this means we should not accept a prison service which is patently incapable of coping with the problem of criminality in our society or the worst roads in Europe, with potholes turning many rural journeys into obstacle courses.  Neither should we accept a bovine TB eradication scheme which has swallowed up hundreds of millions of pounds without achieving its objective, is still costing millions of pounds every week and has in the recent past allowed reactor cattle to stay on farms as a result of a dispute.  This does not seem to be a good way of going about eradicating bovine TB.  We must recognise that money is not the answer <Col N="909" /> to everything.  Higher spending does not translate automatically into better services.</P>
    <P>We must focus on quality rather than quantity but if we are going to talk about quality we must be specific about what we mean, what our objectives are and how quality is to be measured.  The quality management concept is now widely embraced in the private sector of the economy.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland publishes a catalogue listing the organisations which have attained ISO 9,000, 9,001 and 9,002, the internationally recognised quality management standards.  Holders of these standards include not just manufacturers but insurance companies, hoteliers, hauliers, architects and estate agencies.  The catalogue lists over 1,100 Irish based holders of the standards but of these, only over 20 &mdash; less than 2 per cent &mdash; are State organisations, even though the State accounts for almost 25 per cent of total employment.</P>
    <P>Clearly, there is a quality management deficit in the Irish public sector.  It is worth noting that if the Blood Transfusion Service Board had operated a quality management system, the horrendous problems which have arisen with regard to hepatitis C might never have occured.  The quality management concept is virtually unknown throughout most of the Irish civil and public service. The ISO certificates held by the public sector are largely concentrated in the semi-State companies, particularly commercial ones such as Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, Bord na Móna, the ESB and Telecom Éireann.  It should be noted that these certificates do not necessarily cover the entire organisations but certain aspects of their operations.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that more than 90 per cent of the public service still work in organisations which have not attained a recognised international quality standard. A more demanding standard of quality management must be required of the public sector.  All bodies should be required to meet the ISO 9,000 standard within a specified period.  Alternatively, the Government could develop and enforce its own quality regime, such as the citizen's charter in the UK.  At <Col N="910" /> least, consumers should be given some idea of what they are entitled to expect from the State in terms of quality.</P>
    <P>There is a passenger's charter which sets out standards on which Northern Ireland Railways must operate with regard to punctuality, reliability, cleanliness and other matters.  Performance against these criteria is measured every month and publicly displayed at all stations.  Surely the introduction of this kind of management philosophy would do wonders to improve customer services in organisations like Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus and Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>I also find the Government's proposals defective in as much as they fail to differentiate between the multifarious roles currently being carried out by the Civil Service.  Its core Departments should concentrate their efforts on three main aspects of Government &mdash; policy formation and review, preparation of legislation and evaluation and monitoring of public spending.  There are also key areas to which Ministers could devote their attention and there is increasing evidence of failure in these areas.  In terms of policy, Ministers rely less and less on civil servants for advice and turn instead to a variety of external sources.  Even vital issues like attacks on the elderly now require task forces and unnecessary deferral of decision-making. Given the number of task forces in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, what role have civil servants? Senator O'Sullivan mentioned the number employed there.</P>
    <P>In practice, the Civil Service does not concentrate on the key areas of policy. The majority of civil servants are engaged in routine administration &mdash; staffing tax offices, processing social welfare applications or paying out agricultural subsidies.  This type of work is vitally important but it is far removed from policy formulation, expenditure evaluation and the drafting of legislation. The skills and experience required are entirely different.  The report underlines the argument for that policy input because of the way it has been prepared and by whom.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> No programme of Civil Service reform will succeed if it does not address the need for a clear division of responsibilities.  The administrative aspects of the Civil Service should be devolved to autonomous executive agencies, each of which would be democratically and fully accountable, not subject to day to day control by the relevant Minister but answerable to Oireachtas committees.  An Bord Tráchtála, for example, functions well as an executive agency of Government.  Why can a similar structure not be put in place for the Companies Office, social welfare services offices, the Central Statistics Office, the Meteorological Office or other areas of public life?  We would be left with a serious of slimline Departments at the core of the Civil Service which would be free to concentrate on the key areas currently receiving inadequate attention &mdash; policy formation, the drafting of legislation and the evaluation of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>We also need to change the nature of the relationship between departmental secretaries and their Ministers.  I suggest the following initiatives.  Each unit of Government should be given operational autonomy with secretaries being restyled as departmental chief executives to show that they hold responsibilities for the administration of their areas.  Each chief executive should be assigned an annual budget to deliver a specified level of services and make them accountable to a new State services board annually for their stewardship. We should give wide responsibility to the State services board which would have power to recommend departmental chief executives for appointment, review their performance, develop managerial talent and report to the Government on the general management of the public service.  The introduction of new structures and new ways of thinking is not something for public servants to fear.  They stand to gain much from a transformation and revitalisation of public service structures and the creation of a more rewarding and stimulating working environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> It is important that any programme of reform secures the widest possible degree of support from all levels of the Civil Service.  There is considerable disenchantment in the service at present, particularly in the more junior grades, which has given rise to several industrial disputes in the Civil Service, a number of which are currently causing considerable disruption.  I do not condone the industrial action but I understand the resentment felt by many members of the CPSU which represents the clerical workers.  Over the past five years a clerical officer in the Civil Service has enjoyed a salary increase of 18 per cent and now earns £210 per week at mid point of the scale.  By contrast, a departmental secretary has enjoyed a salary increase of some 42 per cent over the same period bringing the salary level for that position to £75,000 per annum.  I have no objection to top civil servants being paid the going rate for the job, but we are now paying the price in terms of industrial unrest in the Civil Service for what appears to have been a policy of discrimination against the lower paid workers in the service.  That is a mistake we cannot afford to make again.  I support remarks made about the employment of women and other aspects of the service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to suggest a list of things which the Minister should do.  Although there is one real gem in this set of proposals, there is a great deal of disappointment.  As other speakers said, this gem has been clouded in obfuscatory language &mdash; an aspiration rather than specific proposals.  My criticism of the document, <i>Delivering Better Government</i>, is that it is aspirational and does not contain enough detail or specific timetables for performance.  It contains hopes which we want to achieve but there is no indication of when we will achieve them or when they will be brought before us, even in the form of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public service reform is not a new issue.  This is the thirtieth anniversary of the formation of the Devlin group.  The Devlin report was published in 1969. We must be honest in saying that little <Col N="913" /> has been achieved.  The distressing aspect of <i>Delivering Better Government</i> is that it contains very little more than what was in the Devlin report in 1969. That is an indictment of us all, including a series of Governments and the permanent government of the State.</P>
    <P>The core proposal, the abolition or the limitation of ministerial responsibility, was contained in the Devlin report.  It was reiterated in John Boland's White Paper.  He was very trenchant in his analysis, with which I would agree, as to where the will for reform did and did not exist.  The Devlin report was a very comprehensive document which proposed root and branch reform, a more responsive public service, a better organisation of our public service, better co-ordination and inhouse expertise.  There were supposed to be four staff units in every Government Department &mdash; a staff unit for planning, organisation, personnel and finance.  If they had been put in place and staffed as the Devlin proposals suggested, we would not be reinventing the same wheel.</P>
    <P>Effecting change in public administration is extremely difficult.  An American commentator, a Professor Caiden, once said that implementation was the real Achilles heel of public service reform, which has been the case here.  According to the Devlin report, we were supposed to tear up the concept of ministerial responsibility, a notion which was introduced when Victoria was a young child.  It was sneaked into the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 &mdash; a piece of self-delusion which remains on our Statue Book.</P>
    <P>I was amused when Senator O'Sullivan referred to the need to get rid of ministerial responsibility.  Would her colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, accept that ministerial responsibility is nonsense?  It is nonsense that a Minister can be answerable for every pencil or, as in a famous case a few months ago, every letter which resides in every drawer of each civil servant. It is amazing how people who change sides in the House can praise ministerial responsibility when looking for a ministerial head, while eviscerate <Col N="914" /> the concept when wanting to appear reformist.  The concept of ministerial responsibility is arrant nonsense.  It is ridiculous to suggest that the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, should be aware of every file, social welfare claim and pensioner.  What goes on in the other House during Question Time is nonsense when Members ask Ministers ridiculous questions about detail.  We are deluding ourselves in this regard and I welcome the aspect of this document dealing with it.</P>
    <P>The Devlin report failed for a variety of complex reasons.  Senator Lee's comment that it is a pity some analysis is not contained in this document is valid.  The blame for the destruction of Devlin lies in a number of sources.  Events caught up with the Devlin report.  We must accept that there was extraordinary pressure at that time.  The Government was faced with the Devlin report and the outbreak of civil strife in the North, which was obviously going to be a political priority.  Four years later when the Government changed, the new Government, many of whose members were inexperienced, had to learn the ropes. That Government was very much in the control of the permanent Civil Service which, as John Boland said ten years later, was openly hostile to the concept of change proposed in the Devlin report, not the lower but the upper Civil Service.  The Government was faced with the Northern crisis as well as a series of economic crises.  Government is about looking after the screaming baby. The oil crisis in the 1970s provided Government with ample issues to attend to.</P>
    <P>It has often been said that there was a lack of political will, an analysis which I reject.  There is an abundance of evidence that there was more than sufficient political will in both the Coalition of 1973 and in the Fianna Fáil administration of 1977 to achieve public service reform.  One of the first decisions of Minister Ryan when he took office was to establish, through a change in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, the Department of the Public Service.  I argued then that the Department was wrongly crafted, wrongly shaped and it <Col N="915" /> was a control rather than a reform agency.  I did not blame the Minister for that because, as I worked in the Department then, I was aware that he had been given certain advice.  There was a cynical and calculated effort from day one by officials in these Departments to carve out little niches for themselves and, at the same time, to bury deep the concept espoused by Devlin.</P>
    <P>It is also worth recalling that in the early 1970s task forces were established in a number of Departments.  Some of those task forces never reported.  For example, the task force established in the Department of Defence has not been heard of since.  In the Department of the Environment the task force ran into incredible problems.  Those problems did not arise because Ministers were being in any way obstructive.  The issue that is always referred to is the argument by former Minister Justin Keating against the task force in the Department of Industry and Commerce but if one reads the published correspondence one will see that the Minister wanted real change, not jobs being created at senior level in his Department from confined competitions within his Department.  He has been badly treated by history and used by many people who put forward the analysis of a lack of political will to support that bankrupt thesis.</P>
    <P>One of the most remarkable things about the change of Government in 1977 was the speech by Jack Lynch when he became Taoiseach.  A significant proportion of it indicated his personal commitment to, and his Government's commitment to and espousal of, the concepts contained in the Devlin report.  Subsequently, in September and October that year and in his budget speech the following year, the late George Colley made lengthy contributions arguing the case for public service reform.</P>
    <P>No purpose will be served by dragging up history, but the history of what happened to the Devlin report is a clear and obvious indication that implementation of this set of proposals has been put in the wrong hands.  It should not be <Col N="916" /> left to group of Department Secretaries and senior civil servants to implement them.  The implementation of any public service reform programme should be the sole responsibility of a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would have a specific timetable and oversee that certain targets are achieved by certain dates.  Then there would be reform.</P>
    <P>There were other issues at that time, including the problems of the model of reform itself.  There was an attempt to achieve too much at one time.  Grand reform strategies failed, not just in this country, but elsewhere.  The Fulton and Glasgow reports came and went and a variety of presidential commissions in the United States attempted to achieve grand reform.  However, they failed because they tried to do too much at the same time.</P>
    <P>This document has much to commend it, but it is clear on the issue that, after all these years, the concept of ministerial responsibility will be attacked. However, there are alternative ways to go about achieving public service reform which could be more successful in the longer term.  The type of approach I have in mind is what was referred to in an OECD document some years ago as selective radicalism.  In that document it was accepted that grand reform strategies do not work and had everything stacked against them.  The document argued that relatively small areas of public administration should be picked, that we should focus clearly on them, give ourselves specific targets and go about changing them.</P>
    <P>If that approach is taken, they will be changed because a number of things will happen.  The people who are motivated to reform will receive awards early on; they will see reform and a response to their efforts.  Selective radicalism, by focusing on relatively small areas, is easier and cheaper to achieve.  If something will not be achieved in a particular area, one can abort the programme and move on.  Before we discuss selective reform, we should start examining precisely what we want to reform and for whom we want to achieve it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> The problems in Irish public administration can be shortlisted under three headings.  First, it is far too centralised; second, it is far too secretive, and third, it is far too bureaucratic.  It is strange to refer in 1996 to the concept of centralisation. People could say that, for over 30 years since the mid-1960s, we have been involved in decentralisation.  However, my response is that the Irish administrative psyche is fundamentally centralist. It is informed by a strong antidemocratic streak.  If there is a real failing within the public service &mdash; I have spent more years in the public service than I have in political life &mdash; it is that there is a rejection of the value of the democratic input.</P>
    <P>Senator Cotter mentioned local government.  The death knell of local government did not sound in 1978 but in the 1940s when the managerial Acts were put in place.  The dead hand of bureaucracy entered local government then and destroyed any possibility of local elected representatives having a say.  There has been a shift in offices over the years.  In the past 30 years politicians who were dedicated to the concept of reform and decentralisation have come and gone.  However, nothing has been achieved by decentralisation. Parcels of civil servants have been moved to Wexford, Longford or Castlebar but that is not decentralisation, rather deconcentration.  The person at the counter in the social welfare office in Bray has not been given the right to make any decisions.  They are inexorably sent to the centre.  Centralisation needs to be taken to task.</P>
    <P>Secretiveness is a central part of the bureaucratic psyche and needs to be addressed.  I am sorry there has not been a commitment to expedite putting the Freedom of Information legislation into effect.  Perhaps this is due to diverse responsibilities at ministerial level.  The Minister's colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, is dedicated to the concept of the Bill and there is undoubtedly political will on all sides in this House to achieve it.  However, we are stuck because of the rules of the House and the Minister of State and her progressive colleagues are being impeded <Col N="918" /> by one or two Ministers who may take a different view.  Their views are informed by their civil servants and an example in that regard is the resistance from the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>There is far too much power within the administrative structure to stymie administrative reform.  This is why I have argued that, since implementation is the Achilles' heel of public service reform, we must try a different way. One of the problems with achieving public service reform, with which we all have failed to come to grips, is the behaviour aspects of reform strategies. Personnel must be won over to reform. It is not possible to hand down a list of reform strategies and tell people to implement them because they will think of 10,000 ways of stymieing them and keeping the ball going until the Government changes and they get another unfortunate Minister.  The experience of public service reform involving overambitious experimentation in Ireland, Britain and elsewhere suggests we must be radical.  We must select small areas, make achievements and build up on that basis.</P>
    <P>A third factor is the continuing need for political commitment.  An interesting aspect, which is a secret I have shared with the House previously, is that the programme for Government the Minister is attempting to implement is precisely the same programme put together by the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil in the heady days of December 1994.  I happen to have the original draft.</P>

      <P>In 1990 a company called Galtee Deer Care Limited, which has its registered office at Ballinwillin, in Mitchelstown, County Cork, promoted <Col N="919" /> deer farming on a massive scale on the understanding that the potential for venison in the home market and for export was extensive.  The directors of the company are Ms Miriam Mulcahy, Mr. Patrick Mulcahy and Mr. Ray MacSharry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant that Charles Haughey lent his name to the promotion by attending and speaking at public functions in Mitchelstown.  An auction is purported to have taken place at which large sums of money changed hands.  The venture also has the public support of Teagasc which promoted deer farming as an alternative enterprise.  It is reported that as much as £5 million in EU funding was made available for the promotion and development of deer farming.</P>
      <P>The agreements reached by the company with farmers who undertook deer rearing never came to maturity.  There was an assurance that the price to be paid would be breeding stock prices for five years.  In fact, the price paid was far below that agreed and the company charged a 20 per cent commission on the transaction.  It made a contract with people to raise deer guaranteeing purchase at breeding stock prices, but this never happened.  I am aware of a herd owner who reared deer for sale independently of this operation.  When he wanted to dispose of stock he could not find anyone to purchase it.  A County Limerick factory kept putting him off.</P>
      <P>The operation is a matter of public interest because of the extent of the issues involved.  Expectations which were raised were never realised and farmers have been left at a great loss which could affect their future livelihoods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the close link between the business and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, I appeal to the Minister to investigate the matter fully.  The investigation should be undertaken by whichever Department is <Col N="920" /> appropriate with regard to company law or by the Director of Consumer Affairs. The contracted profits were not realised and the complexities of the issue were never really addressed.  I urge the Minister to have the matter investigated, even if that means calling in the Garda fraud squad, which would be a justified and appropriate step to take in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>It falls to me to outline the role of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and An Bord Bia in the promotion and marketing of venison.  The reply to the matter notified to the Department does not specifically address Galtee Deer Care Limited, because the Adjournment Matter notified did not indicate that the Senator intended to deal with the company.  However, in view of what the Senator said, I will urge the Minister to fully investigate the Galtee Deer Care Limited, operation and he may respond directly to the Senator.</P>
      <P>Deer farming is a comparatively recent development in Ireland, having expanded from a base of three farms in 1983 to 530 in 1995, with a present breeding population of approximately 23,000.  It is a viable alternative farming activity which is free of any restrictions imposed by CAP reform on the more traditional forms of livestock production. It is not labour intensive and so offers land owners with off-farm employment or low labour resources an opportunity of supplementing their income without incurring high wage bills.</P>
      <P>Various grant-aid schemes have contributed to the growth of deer farming by providing funds at the crucial startup stage when establishment costs are high.  Chief among these is the alternative enterprise scheme which is operated by the Department's farm development service offices.  Grant aid is payable on investments of up to £20,000 for deer handling and fencing at a rate of 40 per cent or 50 per cent in less favoured areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the alternative enterprise scheme the Department has supported <Col N="921" /> 441 deer farmers involving the payment of £1.329 million in the period 1988-93. Under the current programme, 541 approvals have issued in respect of planned investment of £5.7 million, for which grant assistance of £2.2 million has been approved.  These figures demonstrate the positive level of response the scheme has attracted so far.  Aid is also payable to farmers in respect of increases in breeding numbers.  The aid is £160 for red deer and £80 for sika and fallow deer subject to a maximum of £4,000 in grant aid.</P>
    <P>The profile of the industry is one which comprises approximately 530 producers representing 23,000 breeding female animals.  There are four producer groups, three export abattoirs and four export processors and about 8,000 animals were slaughtered last year.  The industry is in its infancy and characterised by small farms and small herds.  It has advantages however, principally in its healthy grass finished feeding system and the fact that there are no production quotas so that the industry has significant growth potential.</P>
    <P>In addition, producer groups are grant-aided under the live farmed deer producer group scheme.  Under this scheme individual deer farmers come together and form a producer group as a co-operative or as a company under the Companies Acts prior to applying for official recognition as a producer group from the Department.  The overall objective of the scheme is to encourage individual producers to adapt their production to meet market requirements through the implementation of a unified production, quality and marketing strategy.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia has statutory responsibility for the promotion and marketing of Irish food and livestock.  While acknowledging that venison is a fledgling industry, it has recognised the market opportunities for the product and is actively seeking ways in which to exploit them.  One of the board's senior executives has been assigned as product manager of the venison sector.  In addition, the board has completed a study of the sector in consultation with the industry and the results of this are currently <Col N="922" /> being evaluated.  A closed seminar with the industry next week will devise a strategy to exploit market opportunities. This strategy will build on the success of the industry in 1995 which recorded output of £2.3 million involving the production of some 400 tonnes of venison, of which 65 per cent was exported.  The principal markets are Germany and France where An Bord Bia, through its local office network, is building on the current level of market penetration.</P>
    <P>Venison is included in An Bord Bia's promotion campaign for the home and export market.  On the home market it will include partnership retail promotions, recipe leaflets, cook book inclusion, regional food fairs and demonstrations. In the export market, An Bord Bia will assist marketing plans for export companies and marketing information and venison products will be included at trade fairs.  Companies producing deer products are also eligible for grant assistance from the board through its marketing improvement assistance programme and its strategic market development programme.</P>
    <P>The board will act as a catalyst for such companies but ultimately it is for the companies themselves to secure and consolidate new markets and to assist in the growth of a vibrant venison industry in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1989, while Minister for Agriculture and Food, I introduced a slaughter policy for any isolated incidents of BSE and banned the use of meat and bone meal, whether indigenous or imported.  Despite my firm <Col N="923" /> actions, which demonstrate that Ireland does not have a problem with BSE-infected cattle, the crisis with BSE in the United Kingdom has affected Ireland's beef and livestock sector, which is worth £1.7 billion, and created an unprecedented crisis at farm level, particularly for winter beef finishers.</P>
      <P>The pre-Christmas BSE scares in the United Kingdom, in addition to the severe reduction in the level of European Union export refunds last October, resulted in a dramatic decrease in the price of cattle in December 1995.  The UK announced the existence of a problem with BSE on 2 March 1996.  We all regret and deplore the manner in which that announcement was made.  With the subsequent virtual collapse of beef markets in the UK and European Union and the imposition of export bans in many of our international markets, cattle prices collapsed to 92p per pound. This gave rise to an income crisis for winter beef producers who play an essential role at the end of the beef production chain.</P>
      <P>At a steer price of £1 per pound, Teagasc calculates that producers were losing £71 per head of cattle even with the £60 per head winter beef slaughter premium. This price operated from 1 January to the announcement of the BSE crisis on 20 March.  Following that announcement cattle prices fell to 92p per pound.  Teagasc, taking account of the £60 per head slaughter premium, calculates that producers are losing £138 per head at that price.  Premium compensation is required.  The UK BSE crisis and European Union reductions in export refunds inflicted heavy income losses on producers during the current year.  Both problems were outside the control of farmers and were in no way related to the stringent and effective actions I took in 1989 as Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Luxembourg BSE farm council acknowledges the need for producer compensation if required by the market situation.  Point 10 of the council's report states that, if justified by market conditions, additional specific measures will be proposed by the Commission for <Col N="924" /> suckler cows and male bovines.  The beef sector is three times more important to the Irish economy than any other agricultural sector is to other European economies.  When I was a member of the Council of Ministers I argued for specific support for the Irish beef sector.  I constantly reminded my European colleagues that no matter how important was cheese to the French economy or wine to the Italian, Ireland's beef sector was three times more important to its economy.  Full premium compensation is required to offset the severe losses endured by winter beef producers in 1996.</P>
    <P>Premium compensation should be very specific and should be paid to producers who incurred losses during the current year.  It should be paid in the form of a beef finisher premium based on beef animals sold between 1 January and 9 June 1996.  The level of premium compensation must reflect the cattle market price and differentiate between the periods 1 January to 24 March and 25 March to 9 June.  The compensation must cover steers, heifers and young bulls slaughtered at meat plants and exported live during the period 1 January to 9 June.  As calculated by Teagasc, the beef finishers premium rate should be £71 per head for January to mid-March and £138 per head mid-March to June.</P>
    <P>I will now explain what I propose by way of deseasonalisation premium.  As a result of the BSE crisis there was a significant reduction in steer slaughtering at beef export plants from 25 March.  The European Union deseasonalisation premium was reduced from £60 per head to £45.07 per head on 15 April.  It was further reduced to £35.05 per head on 29 April.  In view of the fact that animals could not be sold because of the BSE crisis, it is now essential that the full level of the deseasonalisation &mdash; £60.09 per head &mdash; be paid on all eligible steers slaughtered up to 9 June. This proposal is neutral in terms of the European Union Commission budget.</P>
    <P>To give an indication of the calculation of losses, 305,763 disposals took place between 1 January and 24 March. The total losses calculated by Teagasc, <Col N="925" /> at £71 per head, were £21.7 million. From 25 March to 9 June there will be 260,455 disposals and the losses calculated by Teagasc, at £138 per head, total £35.9 million.  The overall number of disposals will be 566,208 at a total loss of £57.5 million.  Teagasc calculates that winter beef producers have incurred the following income losses as a result of collapsing beef prices in 1996: January to mid-March £71 per head and mid-March to June £138 per head.</P>
    <P>Compensation for these losses is required in the form of a beef finisher premium.  Premium compensation must be paid to producers of steers, heifers and young bulls who sold cattle between the dates of 1 January and 9 June.  The full rate of £60.09 per head of the deseasonalisation premium must be paid on all eligible steers slaughtered up to 9 June.  The IFA has calculated that total premium compensation will amount to £57.6 million.  This money must be paid in the form of beef finisher premia at the following rates: £71 per head for the period January to mid-March and £138 per heard for the period mid-March to June.  That is the only basis that this essential link in the chain of cattle and beef production in Ireland will be protected against complete decimation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, I fully acknowledge that beef producers in Ireland have experienced a very difficult period since the beginning of this year.  This happened as a result of the various reductions in export refunds last autumn and the recent BSE crisis following the announcement by the British Minister for Health on 20 March in the House of Commons of the possible link between BSE and CJD.  The difficulties being experienced by Irish producers are evidenced by the substantial fall in cattle prices since the beginning of the year, which has resulted in serious income losses for many producers.  The Minister's objectives throughout this crisis have been, first, to ensure the market was adequately supported through the introduction of emergency intervention <Col N="926" /> measures and, second, to secure compensation for the income losses arising from the BSE crisis.  Any reasonable commentator would acknowledge he has been successful in achieving those objectives.</P>
      <P>As regards intervention, the emergency arrangements for April abolished the carcase weight limit and extended intervention purchasing to grade 04, a quality of animal not normally eligible for intervention.  The arrangements for May introduced a weight limit at a relatively high weight and covered 70 per cent of our steer production.  These arrangements have worked very well to date, and have succeeded in disposing of most of the backlog of cattle which had built up on farms in the immediate aftermath of the House of Commons announcement.  In any event, the Minister is satisfied the emergency intervention measures prevented a complete collapse in the market, not just in Ireland but across Europe.</P>
      <P>The Commission has also increased export refunds by 12 per cent in order to improve the competitiveness of our exporters to third country markets and to boost cattle prices within the European Union.  This increase took effect from 9 May and, along with the intervention measures, should ensure a degree of stability in the market over the coming months.</P>
      <P>The Minister was always conscious that the emergency intervention measures would be insufficient to support cattle prices at reasonable levels. For this reason, he insisted, both at the emergency BSE Council on 1-3 April and again at the usual meeting of the Agriculture Council on 29-30 April, that provision should be made for compensation to be paid to beef producers who suffered income losses because of the crisis.  I am very pleased, therefore, to be given the opportunity today to outline on behalf of the Minister the compensation package which the European Commission adopted yesterday.  This package represents a substantial response to the conclusions of the two Councils held in April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, the compensation package consists of an increase of £24.88 in <Col N="927" /> the suckler cow premium and £20.71 in both instalments of the special beef premium. I understand the intention is that the increased premium payments would be based on applications submitted in 1995, with provision for adjustments to be made where producers had fewer animals in 1996 than in 1995, and for the savings on this to be used to compensate those producers who had more animals in 1996.  This package is worth about £60 million to Irish beef producers and, in global terms, it will go a long way towards alleviating the income difficulties of Irish producers.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledges, however, and I agree with him, that the package as currently constructed is not sufficiently targeted at those producers &mdash; the winter fatteners &mdash; who have borne the brunt of this crisis.  He intends to seek to have the package amended so as to provide for compensation to be paid also to those producers through the deseasonalisation slaughter premium.  I do not want to underestimate the difficulties the Minister faces in persuading the Commission and other member states to agree to this approach.  Nevertheless, this will be an extremely important objective for him in the negotiations ahead on the Commission's proposals.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am very pleased the Commission has adopted the compensation package and I intend to ensure that, first, it is targeted at those producers most affected by the crisis and, second, that the compensation is paid as early as possible.</P>

However, the Senator can rest assured that both he and his advisers in the Department will do everything possible to ensure those most seriously affected, the winter fatteners, will get some compensation for the serious loss in income they experienced for the two reasons I outlined &mdash; the reduction in export refunds last autumn and the BSE crisis which has befallen them since early April.</P>
