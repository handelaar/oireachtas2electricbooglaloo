      <P>I have notice from Senator Daly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make a decision regarding the provision of a formal personal assistant service to enable people with disabilities to live independently; and if he will establish an independent living fund.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to report on what proposals she has to cater for the educational needs of a child (details supplied) and her response to the report from the Castleknock child and family centre outlining his urgent need for speech therapy and their concern at the absence of adequate facilities for his education.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give an update on the resolution passed at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which called on the Government to call upon the European Union and the United Nations to obtain guarantees for the safe return of Belen Toras and Raul Ramos to Columbia.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide the necessary funding to the Irish Wheelchair Association for its proposed national respite and holiday centre at Donamon, County Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> I have also received notice from Senator McGowan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to make a statement on the religious discrimination claims against the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Daly, McGennis, Hayes, Finneran and McGowan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Daly's and Senator McGennis's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Hayes, Finneran and McGowan may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Item 1, by agreement, will be without debate.  I do not expect item 2, the reporting of amendments from the Dáil to a Seanad Bill, will take very long.  There will be a time limit of 30 minutes per speaker on Item 3, the Freedom of Information Bill, 1996, Second Stage of which will probably not conclude today. That item will follow the completion of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill, 1996, until 4 p.m. There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.  Item 4 will commence at 4 p.m. and, subject to what I said yesterday, if there is agreement, we will take all Stages of item 4; item 5 will be taken from 4 p.m.  If there is a difficulty about that, we will simply take Second Stage of item 4 and the remaining Stages and item 5 on today's Order Paper after the Appropriation Bill, which will be debated tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>On item 3, if Senator Roche, who introduced a Freedom of Information Bill last year, required 45 minutes would that cause a problem?</P>
      <P>On item 4, I agree with the Leader that, subject to the way the debate develops, we will meet tomorrow so it may be dealt with in that fashion.</P>
      <P>I noted in the financial pages of this morning's newspaper that the Credit Union Bill has been flagged.  I asked the Leader yesterday if he had any information on the matter.  If he has, I would appreciate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Roche is to have 45 minutes on the Freedom of Information Bill, the House deserves an early warning notice to prepare itself.  We will have a meeting of the Independents to see if we can agree to that and we will communicate with the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Senators raised the fact that, since the number of sittings days has increased, we need to take a serious look at the resources available to Members.  Every Member should now be entitled to exclusive secretarial support.  It is becoming <Col N="1239" /> more difficult for our staff to keep up with the business of two or three Senators.  I know it is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the first instance but it is also a matter of which Members should be aware.  We should start waving flags about and getting some reaction on the matter.</P>
    <P>The other matter of which I would like to make the House aware in case I would be embarrassed at some other time, is that I have been involved recently with the parents council of the local post primary school in Swords, County Dublin.  My wife and I have, at various times, gone around to local people, including, I must shamefully say, some supermarket owners, including that of my colleague, Senator Quinn, and, on a number of occasions, some of these supermarkets, including that of my colleague, have invested money in local school outings.  I am sure this might find its way to the front page of some newspaper some time in the future so I would like to put it on the record.  We are absolutely ashamed of what we did and I am sure Senator Quinn will share my shame in this, but that is the way life is at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection whatever to Senator Roche having an hour if he so wishes. Perhaps the Leader will consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Magner should not tempt us.  There might be an outbreak of seasonal humbug and ill will.</P>
      <P>To follow on what Senator Wright said about the Credit Union Bill, which we have asked about for some time and for which the Leader gave a detailed timescale within the past couple of weeks, will the Leader outline the most up to date position?</P>
      <P>To re-emphasise a point made yesterday we need an early debate on Northern Ireland, particularly in view of the statement made yesterday by the British Prime Minister that he felt the talks were now at a standstill.  We should also note the remarks of the deputy leader of the Alliance Party, Mr. Séamus Close, when he said that politicians need guts and leadership to negotiate an agreement.  The worry is that unless progress is made through talks and peaceful means, the vacuum which is inevitably created by a standstill will be filled by violence.  We hope there will be no more violence, particularly over Christmas, and we ask IRA/Sinn Féin to restore the ceasefire at least temporarily.  We all wish it to be restored permanently so that we can progress to meaningful talks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to giving Senator Roche 45 minutes on the Freedom of Information Bill as long as we do not have to give Senator Ross 45 minutes.  It looks as if we will not <Col N="1240" /> finish Second Stage of that Bill today.  I am anxious that it be dealt with as early as possible in the new session because it will take some time before it is passed.  Public bodies and Departments will have to adjust to a big change in political culture from an assumption of secrecy to one of openness.  We welcome this change but it will take time.  It will also take time for the public to adapt to the fact that they are entitled to information that was denied to them for so long.  I ask the Leader to deal with the rest of the Bill as soon as possible in the next session.  I would also like to see the Credit Union Bill.  I expected a copy of it this morning.  I hope it will be made available to us as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Dardis in relation to Northern Ireland.  We call for a ceasefire and also for progress in the talks.  Christmas is a time of reflection and we can only hope that this will lead to taking steps forward rather than backward.  I agree that we should have a debate in this House as soon as possible in the new session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The efficiency audit group which has been looking into the operations of the Army, the Navy and the Air Corps has been working for some time and we have not yet heard any of its results.  Senator Dardis has an interest in this topic as he wants an airport opened on the south side of Dublin as do I.  However, there are major concerns about the progress of the efficiency audit group and I would like the Minister for Defence to be present as early as possible in the next session for a major debate on the defence forces, the progress of the efficiency audit group report and the future of the Army.</P>
      <P>I asked for a debate on the National Roads Authority some time ago.  I also said that the reports of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs are still not being published. What has the Leader been able to do about both those issues?  The Credit Union Bill was mentioned. I note that, according to the terms of the Bill, credit unions will be able to offer credit card services.  Perhaps the banks might cancel all our cards between now and Christmas incase the credit unions get a commercial advantage over them.</P>
      <P>I am not sure exactly what Senator O'Toole was getting at when he spoke about looking for Christmas goodies from various bodies.  I pay tribute to Dunnes Stores and everybody in that group for their contributions to charity over the years. There is no charity in Ireland which has not received a contribution from Dunnes Stores.  As Mayor of Kilkenny, I can state that Dunnes Stores was first to send a subscription when requested.</P>

      <P>Dunnes Stores has been one of the largest contributors to charities throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes asked about the safe return of the two farm leaders to Colombia.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has tried to ensure that this will happen but who can ask the Government of Colombia to guarantee anyone's safety? That Government is run by a drug cartel and receives billions of dollars from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask Senator Hayes to contact the Government of the United States to request the Colombian Government and President to stop discussing the sale of drugs? Perhaps we can then ensure the safety of all people living in Colombia.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with calls for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I wish to draw attention to two aspects of this issue which the Leader might communicate to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I do not recall any reference being made in the House to the 2,500 lb. bomb discovered at Drumadd on 28 November, the mortars found in west Belfast or the ongoing punishment beatings.  However, for some reason, Members have mentioned other matters which caused concern, including the behaviour of a number of Protestants in Harryville.  It is good that the actions of these individuals were condemned by many other Protestants living in that area.</P>
      <P>Another matter, which should not be treated as of lesser importance I suggest the Leader raise with the Taoiseach, involves people such as myself who cannot vote for the British Labour Party.  An organisation of which I am a member picketed Tony Blair outside Queen's University but when I spoke to him I merely received a wintry glance in return.  There is no way I can vote for the party which, it appears, will govern Northern Ireland following the next British general election.  I do not know how the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs might raise this worthy issue.  We fought to halt the excesses of the Stormont Government and formed the first real opposition at that forum to highlight those excesses.  We are surely entitled to a say and to vote for the British Labour Party when the time comes, regardless of whether it is in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the Order of Business and I suggest that items No. 4 &mdash; the Oireachtas (Miscellaneous Provisions) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) <Col N="1242" /> Bill &mdash; and No. 5 not be taken today.  I do not oppose the Bill in principle, but I oppose taking it today.  To do so will send the wrong message to the public.  The Bill will triple the revenue of the major political parties, which is not a trivial matter, and it is to be pushed through all Stages in 36 hours.  I spoke in the House at 2.30 p.m. yesterday but I was unable to obtain a copy of the Bill at that time because it was not available.  I only received a copy after 3 p.m. when it was finally published.  The Bill was passed by the Dáil last night and it is intended to rush it through the Seanad today.  Item No. 5 then requests that the President sign the Bill immediately.</P>
      <P>What message does this send to the people about us?  It states that politicians suit themselves and they push through legislation when they want something done.  The Bill should not be taken today because of the aspect of retrospection.  It should not be rushed through the House in such a short period.  When Bills dealing with taxes or social welfare payments are debated, the public is made aware, months in advance, of the changes being introduced.  This Bill has been made retrospective, but we can deal with that issue during this afternoon's debate.</P>
      <P>I am not opposed to the Bill in principle, but to the message which rushing it through today sends out.  I ask the Leader to amend the Order of Business and that we do not take this Bill today.  The message the public will receive is that we are not cleaning the stables but feathering the nest.  That is the opposite to what we want to convey. I suggest we do not take these two Bills until we have time to consider them and to let the public know we consider such matters seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment to come to the House to discuss planning?  Planning permission takes too long, particularly when we are trying to locate industries in rural areas.  By the time environmental impact statements and objections have been dealt with, such industries will have set up elsewhere, for example, in Scotland, Devon or Cornwall.  We should discuss this matter soon so that we can speed up the planning process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday on the Order of Business I tried to raise an urgent matter.  I am in a dilemma in that I must arrange a debate on the serious situation in Foyle Fisheries Commission before we adjourn.  Our Government is party to religious discrimination and has been fined £40,000 as it is a joint manager.  In the absence of a debate, will the Leader contact the Minister for the Marine?  We want the resignation of two commissioners and we want the manager of Foyle Fisheries Commission to be sacked as he has been found guilty of religious discrimination which contributes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter does not arise on the Order of Business.  The Senator has an alternative way to raise this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I do not have an alternative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter may be resubmitted for tomorrow's Adjournment debate and it might be sympathetically considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it for me to disagree with the procedure of the House as I have been a Member for a long time, but I must listen to fairly lengthy contributions from Members with less important business.  I must take a stand.  Will the Leader recognise that the Government of which his party is a member has been found guilty of discrimination in the courts?  This is the essence of what Senator McAughtry spoke about and from where religious bigotry comes.  I seek a debate on this issue and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Calnan in calling for a debate on planning.  I would like the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter in detail and to explain why planners must wait until the last minute to give a decision. Senator Calnan referred to job creation.  It can take nine or ten months to get planning permission while in other countries an indication can be given in one month.  The problem is greatest in large cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Newspaper reports indicate the Cabinet has made a decision on the abolition of services charges.  Will the Leader clarify whether proposals to abolish service charges at local level include library charges?  I have received several approaches from county librarians and members of the Library Association of Ireland over the past 24 hours.  The Library Association of Ireland is my nominating body so I have more than a passing interest in this subject.  Proposals and discussions regarding service charges focus on water and sewerage charges but no reference is made to library charges.  Senators who are members of local authorities will be aware that the imposition of library charges is decided at the annual Estimates meetings.  It is a charge on local taxpayers and ratepayers and it is included in the annual budget of each local authority.  It has been a controversial matter for many years and has led to a decline in the usage of public libraries by those who need them most.  It has been bitterly and <Col N="1244" /> continuously opposed by librarians and the Library Association of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House seek clarification of the newspaper report before tomorrow?  I appreciate this is a budgetary matter but the fact that the Cabinet has made a decision on the abolition of service charges is now in the public domain.  Can the Leader clarify if that decision applies to library charges?  Would he go further and convey to the Minister for the Environment the serious opposition to these charges and the concerns that have been raised by librarians that if this matter is not dealt with now it could be left on the back burner?  I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator Wright sought an extension of time for Senator Roche's contribution, I thought the request might also apply to some of his colleagues during the Order of Business. There is no difficulty in Senator Roche speaking for 45 minutes.  Other spokespersons can also take 45 minutes, with 30 minutes for speakers thereafter.</P>
      <P>The Credit Union Bill has been cleared by the Cabinet.  It is a large Bill but it will be published before the end of the year.  Sadly, it will not be a Seanad Bill.  Senator O'Toole raised the issue of resources for Members.  That is a matter for the Committee on Procedures and Privileges and the Oireachtas Joint Services Committee.  Senator Dardis sought a debate on Northern Ireland.  He, Senator McAughtry and Senator McGowan have made a good case for a major debate on Northern Ireland early in the next session.  I will try to set a date early in January.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan asked about the Freedom of Information Bill.  It is a priority Bill and Committee Stage will be taken early in the next session and as much time as is necessary will be devoted to it.  She also appears to have joined the ranks of the people who attack Senator Ross.  We will probably have to form a society for the protection of Senator Ross, although every attack must help his vote getting ability in a certain constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan's omnibus contribution would bring the House back two weeks early after the break if we were to cover every issue he mentioned. I agree with his suggestion of a debate on the National Roads Authority.  A series of statements or a debate on the Defence Forces would also be worthwhile and there is a degree of expertise in the House on that issue.  The foreign affairs issue is a matter for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  I have raised the matter with the Minister for Finance but I have other priorities for the Seanad.  If, after those matters have been dealt with, I can give the Senator support in that regard I will do so. <Col N="1245" /> Senator McAughtry made some points which could be included in a debate on foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn spoke about legislation being rushed through the Oireachtas.  It is not uncommon for Bills to pass all Stages in one day.  This time last year we passed licensing legislation in one day to accommodate the sale of drink on Christmas Eve, which fell on a Sunday.  With regard to today's legislation, I am prepared to take Second Stage today with no time limit.  As long as Members wish to speak on Second Stage they can do so.  Committee Stage can be taken tomorrow with, again, no time limit.  Item 5, the request for early signature, is simply that.  The President may do as she wishes and if she has doubts about the constitutionality of the Bill she can refer it to the Supreme Court.  If she does not like the Bill she can wait for the prescribed constitutional time limit before signing it.  It is simply a request to the President and she may act on her own discretion.  I would not like the House to divide on this issue.  I will make as much time as needed available and the same will apply tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Senator Calnan and Senator Cassidy mentioned planning.  If they put down a motion perhaps we can have a debate on the matter.  Senator Mooney raised service charges which is a matter for the Minister of the Environment.  I am not privy to what happened at Cabinet and I do not have any detailed statement.  I cannot add anything today but I will try to obtain some information for him. Senator McGowan raised the Foyles Fisheries Commission which is more suitable as a matter on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>The Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill, 1996, is a Seanad Bill which <Col N="1246" /> has been amended by the Dáil.

On the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as a report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.  Members may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>

The House will recall that I promised to ask the parliamentary draftsman to consider an amendment along these lines following a request from Senator Manning in the course of debate in the House.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 6 increase the amount of damages that may be claimed for mental distress in fatal injury cases from £7,500 to £20,000. The amount now proposed is on the basis of further debate and review of what should reasonably be paid in these cases.  Senators will recall that the former level of compensation for mental distress stood at £7,500 for many years and updating that by using the consumer price index would have given a figure of just under £15,000. However, following further consideration and debate, it was felt that there should be a further modest increase in the maximum amount.  The figure decided was £20,000 and this is why the amendments are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the changes made to the Bill.  The Minister dealt with most of the amendments in an open and reasonable manner and the Bill has been significantly improved.  I particularly welcome the increase in the limit of the amount of compensation which can be awarded to £20,000, but I would be happier if it had been possible to agree an even higher figure as proposed by Deputy Woods in the other House.  However, I accept the Minister agreed to a substantial increase from the original proposal <Col N="1247" /> and has included a mechanism for future reviews by ministerial order.</P>
      <P>An aspect of the Bill which was not resolved on Committee Stage was the dilemma posed by the division of the amount where there is a significant number of dependants.  Throughout the debate, the Minister has been at pains to stress that compensation is for mental distress.  He favoured the term <i>solatium</i>, with which I am not familiar, and having been criticised previously for my colourful language, I will take care to use the Minister's terminology.</P>
      <P>Compensation of this nature is, by its essence, a personal matter and it is sensible that it should take into account the number of people involved. I accept that a simple per person figure may not be the ideal solution and I understand the difficulties involved in assessing the closeness of dependants.  The setting of a maximum which takes no regard of the number of dependants is probably not an adequate response.  I appreciate this matter cannot be considered now but perhaps the Minister will consider it in the future.</P>
      <P>Another aspect which was not resolved was the issue of exemplary damages where the death in question results from a deliberate or reckless act. This is a reasonable proposition which is in keeping with the spirit of the Bill.  On the principle that the compensation is for <i>solatium</i> the level of mental distress must be much greater where a dependant is aware that their loved one's death took place as a result of a deliberate act rather than an accident.  There is a case for exemplary damages in these circumstances.  The Minister gave a commitment on Committee Stage that he would ask the Taoiseach to refer this aspect to the Law Reform Commission and on Report Stage he indicated that he was in consultation with the Attorney General about this matter.  Will the Minister outline the up to date position and give a firm commitment that the matter will be referred to the Law Reform Commission in the near future?</P>
      <P>The possibility of consolidating the Acts also arose on Committee Stage.  The consolidation of legislation is important and while proposals designed to make legislation more accessible and understandable to the public may cause significant disquiet in the Law Library, they are a critical aspect of law reform.  I hope the Minister will reconsider the possibility of consolidating the Acts in the short time left before the election.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the manner in which he dealt with the legislation and I hope he will take on board the points I and other Members made.  At this late stage, I wish him and his staff a happy Christmas.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendments and I compliment the Minister on the manner in which he dealt with the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 4 recognise the changes which have taken place since the Bill was introduced in the Seanad, including the passage of all Stages of the Family <Col N="1248" /> Law (Divorce) Bill.  It is important to recognise that and to deal with the new position created by the amendments.</P>
      <P>All parties wished the limit of compensation to be substantially increased above the £7,500 that operated heretofore.  The Minister's initial proposal of £15,000 reflected the rate of inflation since the original Bill was introduced.  The extra £5,000 is a reasonable response to the views of Members of the Oireachtas.  I compliment him for initiating the Bill in the Seanad.  It is a necessary instrument ensuring we update our civil liability responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 5 are drafting amendments. I congratulate Senator Manning for bringing them to the attention of the House.  I thank the Minister and his staff on the work they have done on this Bill; they are to be complimented. We have debated many Bills throughout 1996 and Senators McGennis and Gallagher have been present for them.  I congratulate the Minister and his staff for the work they are doing in the area of law reform.  From the amount of legislation that has come before the House, they must have been under pressure.  I wish the Minister and his staff a happy Christmas and a successful New Year.</P>

      <P>It must be the end of the year when people compliment each other.  I congratulate the Minister for his hard work on this and other Bills.  The appointment of a Minister for Equality and Law Reform was critical for social legislation.  The Minister has achieved so much within that portfolio that he deserves recognition, and so do his staff.</P>
      <P>We appreciate that this Bill was initiated in the Seanad.  The amendments put forward are sensible. The Bill was sensible, not revolutionary, and the amendments recognise the changes in the law in relation to divorce.  By allowing the definition of &ldquo;family relative&rdquo; to include divorcees and cohabitants was a realistic change in our laws because it recognises that some families do not come under the old definition: a husband, wife and children.  When someone has suffered the loss of a loved one he or she deserves compensation if that loss was caused by a wrongful act.  This is a very sensible provision.  The amendment to increase the maximum amount from £15,000 to £20,000 takes account of today's values.</P>
      <P>This Bill is one of many that takes a practical approach to updating our laws and I welcome it.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his elevation. I am sure he will do a good job.</P>
      <P>This House has a fine record in pioneering change and has consistently been to the fore in promoting Bills for reform of our public bodies. Freedom of information is a case in point.  As far back as 1985, a small group of Senators presented the first Freedom of Information Bill to this House.  Subsequently, Bills were presented in 1988, and more recently, we had an excellent debate on a Bill presented by Senator Roche. Given the foresight of Senators and their persistence for over a decade in pursuing this key change, I have great pleasure in coming here today to speak about the Government's Freedom of Information Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that Members of the House on all sides support the objectives of freedom of information.  Our purpose is ensure that we adopt <Col N="1250" /> the most effective mechanism for ensuring the culture and practices of secrecy in public bodies are set aside for good.  There has been a consistently high standard of debate in this House on the issue, and I look forward to hearing what Senators have to say.  I will be open to constructive suggestions which may be made and which could further improve the public's right to know.</P>
    <P>Freedom of information gives every person a legal right to ask for and get access to records held by public bodies.  It creates a new legal right for citizens to see public files.  It recognises in law that public bodies should be directly accountable to the public they are there to serve.  Freedom of information overturns the presumption of official secrecy set out in the Official Secrets Act, 1963, and replaces it with the legal presumption that the public has a right to know.  The Bill contains a mandate for the public service to provide the public with access to information to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest and the right to privacy.</P>
    <P>This Bill will mark a permanent change in the way public business is done.  Giving people a legal right to know what public bodies do and what information they have is extremely important because public services touch every aspect of our lives &mdash; as parents, patients, residents, when we pay tax or draw a pension.</P>
    <P>The public bodies to be covered under the Bill include Departments and their subsidiary agencies, including the Blood Transfusion Service Board, county councils and health boards, other public boards, semi-State bodies, organisations which are substantially publicly funded, such as secondary schools, voluntary hospitals or organisations contracted to provide services for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any confusion &mdash; and there has been some public comment which appears to be so confused &mdash; the list of bodies in the First Schedule to the Bill are those which are to be included, not those to be excluded.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is in force, every person will have a legal right to see what is on his or her files held by public bodies and to correct that information if it is wrong.  The Bill carefully protects personal privacy and personal information will not be available in the normal course to third parties.</P>
    <P>Pensioners and unemployed people will be able to look at their welfare files; taxpayers will be able to see their tax records; people who have applied for grants will be able to see how their application was handled; homeless people will be able to find out where they are on the housing list; parents will be able to see their children's school assessments.</P>
    <P>Community groups will be able to look at policies and plans which affect their community and at information on road repairs, waste disposal and recycling and issues which are important for the quality of daily life.  People will be able to see how public bodies spend their money, how priorities are set and reasons for delays.  Freedom of <Col N="1251" /> information will give the public the right to know how and why decisions are taken.  Public bodies will have to give answers to the public they serve.</P>
    <P>Governments and Government bodies will become more accountable when all the information is out in the open.  Everywhere freedom of information legislation has been introduced, it has brought about more open government and better administration of public services.  Doing business in the open is the best guarantee of efficiency.</P>
    <P>At the very heart of freedom of information is the creation of a new legal right for every person to access any information held by a public body. This right will place an obligation on public bodies to provide the public with information when they look for it.  Complementing this, a powerful mandate for openness and access to official information is set out in the Long Title.  This establishes that the Bill is &ldquo;to enable members of the public to obtain access to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest and the right to privacy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State, public bodies have worked in a culture where secrecy was the norm.  Overturning the practice and philosophy of three quarters of a century involves radical change.  For this reason, the Bill sets out a range of key measures to enable, support and enforce this fundamental change.</P>
    <P>Recognising that the public need information to get information, the Bill requires that each public body must publish information on its structures, functions and the categories of information it holds.  This is so that members of the public can find out which public body has the information they are looking for and can learn what kinds of information are available.</P>
    <P>The Bill places a legal duty on public bodies to help members of the public in making requests so the public can pinpoint the information it wants to see.  It imposes a specific duty to help those with disabilities find what they are looking for.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is in force, every person will have a legal right to correct any personal information on them in public files where it is incorrect, incomplete or misleading.</P>
    <P>Internal rules, guidelines and criteria must be published.  In addition, the Bill provides that each public body publish all its internal rules and guidelines which it uses in decision making.  In this way the public can be informed in advance of the ground rules and basis on which its application for any grant or benefit will be judged.  So, for example, the guidelines used by community welfare officers in deciding on whether the amount of help with an ESB bill and the detailed criteria for assessing income in means tests will be publicly available.  The Bill provides that, where a public body fails to publish such guidelines in full, nobody can be placed at a disadvantage where they might have been able to qualify for something if they had known the full rules.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> The Bill requires public bodies to give reasons for the decisions they make to the individuals concerned.  When a public body refuses a grant, a medical card or welfare payment or says a child is not a priority for orthodontic care, those affected will have a legal right to the reason for that decision.  The Bill also requires that people are told the appeals mechanism for challenging any such decision.</P>
    <P>Taken together, these changes confer important and powerful new rights on individuals in their day to day dealings with public bodies. The Bill sets out important guarantees that public bodies are fair and seen to be fair in their dealings with the public.  This openness is the best guarantee of efficiency and fairness.</P>
    <P>The public's right to know will be backed up by a powerful and independent appeals system which is the cornerstone of the Bill.  Experience abroad has shown that an effective appeals system is the best guarantee that the public actually get the information it is looking for and that public officials carry out to the full their legal duty to provide information.</P>
    <P>The Bill establishes the office of Information Commissioner which will act as an independent watchdog to ensure the public's right to know is upheld and not blocked.  The commissioner will have power to issue binding rulings and to overturn decisions to withhold information.  He or she will have power to examine all the documents in any case and to send for and examine witnesses. These are powers akin to those of a High Court judge.</P>
    <P>In the normal course of events an unfavourable decision on a request for information will be reviewed in the first instance by a higher official in that organisation.  If the decision is still not satisfactory, there is a right of appeal to the Information Commissioner.  The onus of proof is on the public body to show why the information should not be released.  Therefore, the onus of proof is in favour of the person looking for information. Given the fine track record of the Ombudsman as the people's champion, the Government has asked Mr. Kevin Murphy to be the first Information Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The commissioner will develop, protect and enforce the legal right of the public to get information. He will enforce the legal duty of public bodies to supply information.  The office of Information Commissioner will be a separate and independent one with its own staff.  The commissioner will have power to report to the Oireachtas on how the legislation is working and on its operation in any case to which he wants to draw attention.  He will have a role in promoting a more open attitude to the release of information generally by public bodies, irrespective of whether it has been requested.  He will be able to investigate how any individual public body is meeting its legal obligation to provide information to the public.</P>
    <P>There are certain exceptions to the automatic right to see information.  These are similar to <Col N="1253" /> those in comparable legislation elsewhere, for example, Sweden, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.  These are areas which common sense requires should remain confidential, for example, information which could jeopardise security or law enforcement, breach legitimate personal privacy of individuals or where, for operational reasons, release of the information at a particular time would be premature.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not be a charter for crime bosses or drug barons and will protect the criminal investigation process.  It will not disclose the code to the combination locks at the Central Bank for tell speculators how currency strategy will be managed. Next year's leaving certificate papers will not be available at Easter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Companies doing business with the IDA can be assured that commercially sensitive information they provide will be protected.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the exemptions are discretionary, not mandatory.  They permit information to be withheld but do not require it to be withheld.  They are subject to two vital tests, the purpose of which is to ensure that exemptions are not abused.  First, release of the material must be assessed as harmful to the interest concerned &mdash; it is not material about security but material which could damage security which remains protected. Second, most exemptions can be set aside where the balance of the public interest favours disclosure. The purpose of the exemptions is not to inhibit disclosure but to protect information in circumstances where its disclosure could be contrary to the public interest.  Subject to that public interest concern, any discretions under the Bill are intended to be used to the greatest extent possible to provide access to information.  That is the mandate as set out in the Title.</P>
      <P>The provisions on exempted information are set out in detail.  The practical experience of freedom of information elsewhere suggests that openness is better served where exemptions are clear and specific.  A broad brush exemption allows more information to remain hidden whereas tightly drawn exemptions ensure the release of information is at a maximum.  In the event of a public body using an exemption to refuse to grant access to a record the matter does not end there. It will ultimately be for the Information Commissioner to decide, on appeal, whether access should be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three main categories of exemption are as follows.  First, where there could be a breach of privacy by a third party.  Personal information about an individual, commercially sensitive information and information given in confidence will normally remain confidential.  In exceptional circumstances, this information may be released where the balance of public interest in disclosure outweighs the merits of keeping the information confidential.  In such cases, the individual or company <Col N="1254" /> concerned must be consulted if disclosure is contemplated.  However, they do not have a veto on the release on information.</P>
    <P>For operational reasons, certain kinds of information may be withheld to protect normal day to day functions.  Often this material may be exempt at a particular time but could be released later. This material included operations such as audits, exams, test procedures and negotiation strategies. Information prejudicial to audit or testing functions or negotiation strategies may be exempt, unless the balance of the public interest favours disclosure.  That very important public interest test it there.</P>
    <P>Factual material relating to Cabinet decisions is released as soon as a decision is taken and published, and Cabinet papers are published automatically in full after five years.</P>
    <P>Policy consideration can be exempt until the policy decision is made if early disclosure would be contrary to the public interest.  Where disclosure of information would damage the financial interests of the State and economic management, information may be withheld, unless the balance of the public interest favours disclosure.</P>
    <P>Information may be protected where disclosure could harm the areas of law enforcement, defence, security and international relations.  In exceptional cases, where a Minister considers release of information would prejudice one of these areas and the matter is sufficiently sensitive and serious to warrant it which is a very important qualification &mdash; a certificate may be issued.  This effectively removes the avenue of appeal to the Information Commissioner. Instead, a certificate is reviewed by Cabinet colleagues and must be withdrawn where a review finds insufficient grounds for its use.  An appeal can also be made to the High Court.</P>
    <P>A number of requirements must be met before a certificate can be issued.  First, the matter must be likely to prejudice a key matter under either of the exemptions mentioned.  Second, the matter must be of sufficient seriousness or sensitivity to justify the issue of a certificate.</P>
    <P>Experience in common law jurisdictions abroad has been that certificates have been rarely used and even then only in the early days of freedom of information.  For example, in New Zealand a certificate has only been issued once.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Our rules are as tightly drawn as they are there.  I wish to emphasise to the House that the clear and absolute intention of the Bill is that a certificate should issue only on a most exceptional occasion where the nature of exempt information is such as to justify excluding the Information Commissioner from access to the records concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill effectively turns the Official Secrets Act on its head.  It replaces the presumption under section 4 of that Act that all information is secret unless expressly authorised for release, <Col N="1255" /> with the presumption that all information can be made public unless its release would give rise to specific harm.  The Bill amends the Official Secrets Act accordingly.  A further review of the Official Secrets Act by the Oireachtas Committee on Legislation and Security is nearing completion. I personally look forward to the day when the Official Secrets Act is gone in its entirety.</P>
    <P>Where other Acts provide a catch-all confidentiality clause, these, as listed in the Third Schedule of the Bill, are repealed in this Bill.  Where confidentiality clauses have been designed in particular circumstances in other legislation, they are not lifted on a blanket basis.  What the Bill provides for is a review process where an Oireachtas committee must review these enactments, where the sponsoring Department must report on whether these provisions should be repealed, amended or retained, and where the Oireachtas committee will have an independent view from the Information Commissioner whether these should be repealed, amended or retained.</P>
    <P>We are concerned to ensure that when people go looking for information, it will be readily available, that teething troubles will not derail the principle and purpose of the legislation and that foreseeable steps are taken to have a user friendly system that works.</P>
    <P>Within the public service, a special group is overseeing the practical steps Departments must take to make access to information a reality when the Bill comes into force.  These include reorganising the filing and file retrieval systems and the training of staff.  The Bill creates a statutory duty on the Department of Finance to ensure these practical steps are taken to make access to information work.  There will be a special unit in that Department to drive the working of the Bill when passed.</P>
    <P>There is a lead-in time of one year from the passing of the Bill to ensure everything is prepared and can run smoothly from day one.  Most importantly, because all internal rules and guidelines will be published from day one &mdash; some of which go back over 75 years in terms of precedents &mdash; will have virtually the equivalent force of law, Departments need to ensure that these are compiled, scrutinised and rationalised in time for the Bill's starting date which is a major task. Other important public bodies come in automatically in this first phase &mdash; they are listed in the First Schedule &mdash; and county councils and health boards come in automatically at the outside two years later.</P>
    <P>The long Title sets out the purpose of the Bill as, among other things, enabling the public to obtain access to official information to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest and the right to privacy.  It is the purpose clause which guides interpretation of the discretions offered under the Bill for the release of information.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> Part I contains standard provisions in relation to the short Title, commencement and interpretation of various terms used.</P>
    <P>Part II establishes a legal right for the public to access records held by public bodies.  It sets out arrangements for making requests and determines times within which public bodies must respond and the ways in which access may be granted.  In general, people must be given the information as soon as possible, and at the outside within 20 working days, except in exceptional circumstances.  Public bodies must publish information about themselves, the information they hold and the internal rules and guidelines used in decision making.  This Part also deals with deferral and refusal of access to records.  It sets out procedures for internal review.  It establishes rights for each member of the public to access reasons for decisions directly affecting them and to have personal information held by a public body amended where such information is incorrect, incomplete or misleading.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill sets out a series of related measures to protect information relating to key areas of Government activity.  Information may be protected as confidential where its disclosure could damage the security or defence of the State, international relations or law enforcement.  Matters before Government or information likely to prejudice the operations of Government may also be protected.  In addition, information relating to third parties may be protected where disclosure may constitute a breach of confidence, invasion of privacy or damage to commercial interests. Many of the protections outlined can be set aside where the public interest would, on balance, be better served by disclosure than by withholding the records in question.</P>
    <P>Part IV establishes the office of the Information Commissioner.  The functions and powers of the commissioner and the procedures for review of decisions under the Bill are also set out. In addition the commissioner is required to keep the operation of the Bill under review and may carry out investigations into procedures adopted by public bodies for the purpose of compliance with its provisions.</P>
    <P>Part V presumes a decision to have been made in the event of failure by a public body to reply to a request, and provides for appeals to the High Court, legal protections for the release of information under freedom of information, exclusions from the Bill, charges and the amendment of the Official Secrets Act.  It provides qualified privilege to authors of documents and those who release them under freedom of information.  That removes an important inhibition on the release of information at present.</P>
    <P>This Bill will mark a profound and lasting change in the way public business is done.  It ushers in a new relationship between citizens and the State, between the ordinary public and the public services they use.  Because information is power, it will transfer power to ordinary people from those behind closed doors. <Col N="1257" /> Every country which has brought in freedom of information has seen significant improvement in the quality of public administration and in the accountability of public services.  This Bill will herald a quiet revolution in the way public organisations conduct their business.  It will create a new climate of openness, and I have every confidence it will end forever the culture of secrecy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of business today there was some discussion whether I would take 45 or 50 minutes to contribute.  In reality, I could sum up in two words: &ldquo;I consent&rdquo;.  The Minister of State knows I am a passionate believer that information is not just power but truth.  If we can have information we can have truth and the light of public scrutiny flowing into parts of public administration which are obscured by secrecy and anonimity.  We can illuminate the excellence which exists in the public service.  The public service will gain more than any other sector from freedom of information.  It has always been my view that we have one of the best public administrations in the world.  It is not besmirched by the scandals which have taken place in public administrations elsewhere.  We also have, however, a public administration in which secrecy is an epidemic, anonymity has been elevated to a high order and all that is good is obscured.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Back in those heady days of 1994 when governments were collapsing and new governments were being pulled Adam-style like a rib out of the Dáil, I sought the opportunity with my party leader and other colleagues to put forward a series of propositions which would have been instrumental in producing a revolution in public administration.  In the discussions at that time I was pleased that Labour Party colleagues were very willing to accept everything we suggested and I am even more pleased that they were able, in breach of the Copyright Act, of course, to ensure that their new colleagues in Government were willing to sign up for the same agenda. That was interesting from the point of view of academic research.  I had 12 pages of propositions which went forward and their number was expanded to 14 in the programme.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister because she has doggedly pursued this Bill over the past two years.  I also compliment Mr. Carney and the officials in the Department &mdash; it is unusual to name them &mdash; and I thank the Minister for arranging the briefing. I was most impressed by the fact that they share what I regard as a passion for openness. This is positive and it is a sign of good things to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill but I must say some critical things about it which are not in any way personal. First, the Freedom of Information Bill before us comes through a process which I well understand. At the end of the legislative process we do not necessarily see the passion which the Minister or her officials feel about a topic but we see the classic compromise.  It is often said that a camel is a thoroughbred which was designed by a committee <Col N="1258" /> and there are some of those hallmarks in this Bill.  I am not putting the blame at the door of this Minister or her officials, but there are a series of mandarins and political figures who must be dealt with in the legislative process.</P>
    <P>This is a classic example of the way we approach administrative reform in Ireland.  We are passionately committed to the concept of adminstrative reform but we are a little like the saint who said &ldquo;Look for reform but not quite now&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Bill promises a great deal but it is in danger of delivering less than it promises; it is, in fact, somewhat confused.  Perhaps it is too little too late.  It is most decidedly not the radical Bill I expected and which had been promised in countless press briefings over the past two years. Many aspects are conservative and constrained and in many other areas it is dangerously confused. I hope I am not being uncharitable to the Bill and I will seek to defend each of these points.</P>
    <P>However, on the positive side, the Bill gives us a good foundation to put much needed administrative reform on the Statute Book.  I know the Minister is interested but if she is, as I suspect, willing to listen to what is said in this House and carry the views of Members, together we can build a real administrative reform which would benefit the Irish people and politics.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is committed to administrative reform.  In the 1994 negotiations between the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil following the collapse of the last Government, administrative reform was a major item on the agenda.  Indeed, it is ironic that Fianna Fáil proposals which had been agreed between the two parties form a substantial part of the current Government's programme. I am not in any way unhappy about that; I celebrate that fact because it means that, for once, we all got it right.</P>
    <P>In 1995, Fianna Fáil introduced in this House a Freedom of Information Bill in Private Members' time and the Minister's respones was very generous. That Bill, in stark contrast to the one before us, however, offered a very simple radical response to the universally recognised need for openness and transparency &mdash; now a cliché &mdash; in the Irish administrative system.  That Bill was not simply a Fianna Fáil Bill; it was supported by Members from all sides of the House.  Its aim was to create a simple right of information, which is also at the core of the Minister's Bill, which would apply automatically and benefit each and every citizen.  Moreover, the Bill I introduced had universal application across the whole administrative system.  If I were really critical of this Bill, I would be critical of the exclusions and temerity about its introduction; I will return to that.</P>
    <P>In stark contrast to the Bill the Minister is introducing today, Fianna Fáil's proposals were not encumbered by bureaucratic procedures. Fianna Fáil's measures simply set out the rights which citizens should have in the area of public administration.  Its proposals broke new ground in that they sought to codify in clear detail the <Col N="1259" /> only areas where the administrative system could withhold information.  In this regard, the Fianna Fáil proposals can be seen as the precursor to legislation removing the now ridiculously outdated Official Secrets Act, 1963.  Again, I recognise the fact that the Minister, like me, regards that Act as an anachronism which should really be consigned to the shredder or the archives because it is a judicrous piece of legislation which presumes everything &mdash; from the salary of the chief gardener in St. Stephen's Green to the minutes of Cabinet &mdash; is secret.  It is so ludicrous that it is unworkable.  It is breached each and every day so it is a nonsense to keep it on the Statute Book.  I am pleased there is a commitment to its reform.  I am not sure it will be easy to simply right it off but we must look at that.</P>
    <P>As Fianna Fáil and its leadership are committed to real openness in the Irish administrative system and because I, as the party spokeperson on public service reform, passionately believe that reform of the administrative system is vital and long overdue, Fianna Fáil will not be playing party politics with this Bill.  Fianna Fáil will assist the passage of the Bill and will look to its speedy enactment into law.  Moreover, when the Bill is enacted we will be seeking to ensure that its provisions are brought into immediate effect in all areas of public administration.  However, the party's co-operation will not be given freely.  We will demand changes in the Bill, some of which will be major; we will demand an undertaking on the introduction of the administrative procedures Bill, another proposition we put forward in those frenetic days in 1994; we will demand more radicalism with regard to freedom of information than the Minister, constrained as she is by conservative colleagues and powerful mandarins, has been capable of delivering in this Bill and we will demand that inexcusable exclusions of certain areas of public administration in the Bill will not be given a legislative basis.  In short, we will be operating as a constructive Opposition should, assisting to promote that which is positive &mdash; there is much in this Bill which is positive &mdash; and opposing that which we believe to be negative.</P>
    <P>I will be asking the Minister today and on Committee Stage, first, to consider the extension of the provisions of this Bill to all areas of public administration with immediate effect.  Second, I will ask her to extend the provisions of the Bill to cover not only bodies which are funded directly by the State but also those, such as the Law Society, which have been given responsibility in Statue for regulating the activities of certain professions.  I am not singling out the Law Society but certain liberal professions are self-regulating only because the Oireachtas has given them such a statutory right.  From my experience as a constituency worker, they do not fulfil that responsibility to citizens.</P>
    <P>Third, I will ask the Minister to ensure that areas which have traditionally be shrouded by virtual taboos of secrecy, such as the administration <Col N="1260" /> of the courts, the senior courts in particular, and of the operation of the medical services, up to and including clinic judgments, are encompassed in the public's right to know.  I will come to the exclusions which specifically deal with the courts and I will deal, on Committee Stage, with my concerns about medical privilege and the issue of clinical judgment, both of which, incidentally, are exclusions from the Ombudsman Acts.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will also ask to ensure that some of the Bill's more complex provisions should not become a perverse bulwark which will frustrate the search for truth by individual citizens, academic researchers or investigative journalists. I will be referring specifically to the complexities in section 2.  There is a view, and it is my view, that the more complex the legislation, no matter how well meaning the complexity, the more it assists people to frustrate the very intention of that legislation.  I understand from the briefing the Minister arranged, why there are complexities in this Bill.  However, I fear that some of them may be used to frustrate the very openness which the Minister and the Oireachtas would wish to enforce.</P>
    <P>Despite its conservatism, timidity and initial narrow span, Fianna Fáil wishes this Bill well.  We think it is important legislation.  We will demand that some changes be made to it.  I remind the House that when it adopted the Fianna Fáil Bill on Second Stage, it adopted measures more radical than those proposed in this Bill.  Our Bill provided more comprehensive cover than this Bill does and I suggest that the House, in keeping with its radical tradition and its interest in information, should broaden and deepen the Bill and assist the Minister in ensuring that it is as we would all wish it to be.  We also wish to ensure that when the Freedom of Information Bill is finally passed it will strike a mortal blow at the culture of secrecy which is endemic and pervades all parts of the Irish public administrative system.</P>
    <P>We should show more courage than the Bill does in a number of areas because we are not encumbered by the considerations which the Minister and her Department have to bring to the legislative process.  We should recognise that, when the light of public scrutiny is allowed to fall into areas of public administration, only good can be done.  If it illuminates good practices and decisions people can be assured that they are in receipt of the type of public administration we all want.  Where bad administration, practices, poor decision making or individual injustice are illuminated, corrective measures can be taken and in both cases the people will be the real beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>I accept that Second Stage is not the occasion to discuss the Bill in detail.  I wish to put a number of specific points to the Minister of State and I have outlined one or two of them in briefings with her officials.  There should be a degree of openness between us.  I agree, broadly speaking, with Part I and I will make one or two specific comments on it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> Under section 4 of the Bill the head may delegate in writing to a member of the staff of the public body concerned any functions of the head under this Act.  Under the Ministers and Secretaries Act this cannot be done without specific statutory authority and it strikes me that this provision contradicts the concept of ministerial responsibility, although ministerial responsibility is another Victorian practice that should be consigned to the archives.  Is section 4 viable given the restraints in the Ministers and Secretaries Act?</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate why Part II is so complex.  It would be very easy to shoot bolts at individual aspects of Part II of the Bill but I do not wish to do so.  I have a nagging doubt about this at the back of my mind.  I have thought about the very cogent arguments put forward by the officials responsible for drafting this Bill for the complexities of Part II.  To summarise those arguments, the Minister in the Bill seeks to create a situation where the regulations will be so tightly drawn that it will be impossible for public servants to refuse to co-operate with the intention and spirit of the Bill.  This is very good, but having thought about the arguments on both sides I feel that simplicity is better than complexity.  Simplicity is better for a variety of reasons.  It will aid the public's understanding of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right; there will have to be a period of public education to inform people that they can come into public service bodies, look at their files and see that Irish public life is not operated on the basis of nudges and winks, who you know rather than what you know or on the basis of family connections but rather on the merits of a case.  I agree that those provisions are necessary but simplicity would be better than complexity which leads to a lack of understanding and I fear these complexities will be seen by the public as exclusive rather than inclusive.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Part II of the Bill is to protect the citizens' rights but its complexity could well frustrate that aim.  I will illustrate my points with specific examples.  I will be opposing section 7(1)(a).  This section requires that members of the public cite the Bill in requesting access to the information.  That is an unnecessary complexity. The Minister said the purpose of the Bill is to create a right.  If the citizen has a right, he or she should not have to cite the Act conferring that right.  There should be an automatic assumption that once this legislation is enacted, the right to freedom of information applies to everybody, that every public servant will vindicate that right and will be appraised of their legal responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Our administrative code does not impose legal responsibilities on individual civil servants, but we must educate public servants that as soon as a person asks a question he or she has a right to the information.  I understand the difficulty in achieving the balance but section 7(1)(a) could provide a loophole by which an unscrupulous administrator could avoid his or her responsibilities <Col N="1262" /> under this Act.  A civil servant could behave in a scandalous way, deny the right to freedom of information and be able to defend the indefensible by reference to the fact that 7(1)(a) was not complied with.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the formulation of 7(1)(b).  The point about freedom of information is that information should flow freely and without any impediment.  Sometimes we know something is wrong but we do not know what questions to ask.  Anything that constrains the flow of information could frustrate the purpose of the legislation. Under 7(1)(b) the request for information must contain sufficient particulars.  I will give the Minister an example from my days as a very junior civil servant.  I remember being appalled at being chastised for telling somebody that they were entitled to something other than that for which they were asking.  I was specifically told it was not my job to ensure that the person knew they were entitled to one payment when they were asking for another.</P>
    <P>There could be a situation where a public servant could say that he or she would like to help the person but cannot provide the information.  This might be the case but the answer to that person's question might be contained in surrounding information. Unless the person knows what question to ask, he or she cannot be sure of getting the answer they require.  The Minister is pointing to the fact that there is also a requirement that the public servant be helpful.  We all wish for that but we know that people are not always helpful.</P>

      <P>I will come back so that.  The other provisions in section 7 are very interesting.  These deal with the idea of reciprocal case handling and I welcome them.  Such procedures should be in place in a good administrative system.  The Minister is now requiring that they operate with regard to information.  These are the kind of reciprocal case procedures which would be central to administrative procedures legislation.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that I welcome the balance of the provisions in section 7.  They are, however, the type of procedures I would like to see included in an administrative procedures Bill.  I do not doubt that such a Bill will be introduced, either by way of Private Members' motion or by the Government, early in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made reference to a number of specific points of concern in Part II.  For example, section 10(1)(c) makes reference to &ldquo;the opinion of the head, granting the request would, by reason of the number or nature of the information....&rdquo; which represents an exclusion on the basis of the extent of the records.  This is a broad provision and it is difficult to tie down.  We do not want to create a situation where people will request that 40 foot long containers full of documents be provided. At the same time, however, we must be <Col N="1264" /> careful.  I am aware the commissioner will oversee these provisions but I am concerned about bolt holes which might be used by public servants who are not necessarily as passionately interested as Members in freedom of information.  Section 10 could be used or abused in limiting access.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals extensively with access to records.  I am worried that there would be a temptation to subject this section to perverse interpretation. However, I acknowledge that section 12 is not merely concerned with providing copies of records or the information public servants believe people are seeking; it provides for reasonable opportunities for members of the public to inspect the records in person.  The fundamental issue obtaining in a Freedom of Information Bill should be access to hard records.  I believe the Minister of State is also of this opinion because interpretations of the records will involve a certain amount of editing and sanitising.  Essentially, this would mean there would be two records.  I am concerned that perhaps section 12 could be subjected to a narrower interpretation.</P>
    <P>I will now to deal with a more important aspect of the exclusions involving the manner in which the Bill is being introduced.  There is no need for a 12 month delay in respect of all Departments complying with the provisions of the legislation. The Bill requires that books of precedent should be written down and made accessible to the public. This is an interesting step in terms of public administration because it comes close to creating a body of administrative law, which did not exist heretofore.  It will move us away from the old British tradition and closer to the Napoleonic code which operates throughout continental Europe.  That is an interesting measure.  I am not sure whether it should be introduced in the context of this Bill, but I welcome it.  The Minister of State has managed to piggyback one positive measure onto another and I celebrate her success in that regard.</P>
    <P>One of the problems that has arisen, however, is the fear the legislation will be so complex there will be a need for a 12 month delay, after it becomes law, before it comes into operation.  I accept that in Departments and Offices with major administrative decision making processes, such as Social Welfare, the Revenue Commissioners and Agriculture, Food and Forestry, time will be required to put the necessary systems in place.  However, the public service has had in excess of two years to work on the concept of freedom of information.  It is aware of the commitment of the present Government, its predecessor and the Houses of the Oireachtas to this issue.  It strikes me that public administrators have had ample time to make preparations but I accept there is a special need to draw up books of precedent which will be accessible to the public.</P>
    <P>Many Departments do not fall into the category of being required to give decisions on a daily basis.  For example, there is no major volume of executive decision making in the Departments of Health, Finance and the Taoiseach which <Col N="1265" /> requires the construction of overly elaborate books of precedent.  The staff Departments and several of the line Departments do not have a large volume of executive day to day decision making.  By their nature, they are the policy drivers and should make information pertinent to their operations accessible from the outset.  It could be argued that the Department of Social Welfare, for example, requires time to adjust to the new procedures.  However, a period of 12 months for all Departments is not necessary.  The Minister of State should accept an amendment to introduce immediate application of the legislation in those Departments where there is no overwhelming argument against the taking of such action.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not be implemented immediately in respect of local authorities and health boards which is a fundamental error.  Part of the tremendous contribution made by those who drafted legislation in the 18th century, particularly for local government which is the basis of our law, was that they introduced requirements of openness. These have been eroded by the intervening legislation.  The Minister of State is aware of the bizarre situation that occurred recently in County Wicklow where her party colleague, Councillor Cullen, had to take the manager of the council to the High Court in order to gain access to information. Councillors and citizens have a right of access to information from local government. There is no compelling argument for not applying the full rigour of this legislation to local authorities, county councils, urban councils, corporations, town commissions and vocational education committees from the outset.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has as much experience as I have of local government.  I put it to her that in recent years there has been an unacceptable propensity within the managerial and executive ranks of the councils to deny access to information to the public and councillors.  The latter cannot fulfil their democratic responsibilities if they do not have access to information they require.  A number of years ago I was obliged to use the powers provided under sections 2 and 3 of the Local Government Act, 1955, which covered managerial matters, to try to discover the actions of my council regarding the purchase of land for a super dump.  That is wrong and cannot be defended.  When I discovered the truth as opposed to the spin being put on it, the argument was that it would not have been a good idea if councillors knew the management was negotiating for particular land.  It took a year or two before it admitted negotiations were taking place. That is not the type of openness we want in public administration.  We must ensure access to information at least where public representatives are concerned.</P>
    <P>I will table an amendment on Committee Stage proposing that the Bill be extended immediately to all local authorities.  Given that the original legislation, the Local Government (Ireland) Act, <Col N="1266" /> and other 19th century legislation provide a right of access to information in local government, there is no compelling reason we should deny access in this legislation from day one.  The moment this Act comes into effect each local authority should be subject to its full rigours.  Our councillor colleagues would welcome that.</P>
    <P>A few years ago a bizarre situation arose when the Comptroller and Auditor General had to take a health board to the High Court to get access to information on interviews.  It was even more bizarre when it was appealed to the Supreme Court.  That is not the culture on which local government was based.  It was based on the concept of government by the people.  Since the 1940s we have allowed the openness of local government to be eroded and our councillors to be put in the ha'penny place and to be continuously kept in the dark and treated, as some have said in their elegant way, like mushrooms when trying to get information from public management. A great deal of good could be done for the democratic process and the public if the Minister included local authorities from day one.</P>
    <P>The full rigours of the Bill should apply to health boards immediately.  I commend the Minister of State, who indicated she had problems with State-sponsored bodies to which I will return, for accepting that the BTSB should automatically come under this Bill.  There is far too much secrecy about the way we administer health.  We have done irreparable damage to the good health services by allowing everything to be shrouded in secrecy.  Like myself, I am sure the Minister receives representations from people who are unhappy about the way they or a relative was treated within the medical system.  There is supposed to be a charter of patients rights in the health board system but the Minister of State knows, as I do, that it does not work because there is no culture of openness in medical administration. From the day a person goes to medical college, he or she is imbued with a degree of arrogance. There is no tradition of openness in the medical profession or the medical administration system.</P>
    <P>When we introduced the Ombudsman legislation we excluded the health authorities.  When we finally included them within the Ombudsman's remit, we excluded clinical judgment.  If I or the Minister go into hospital with an injury to our right leg but our left leg is cut off, we can only look at whether a clerk filled in the form correctly and not at the area of clinical judgment.  I am not suggesting professionals in the medical field should be second-guessed.  Clinical judgment is frequently based on guess work &mdash;in fact, it is a fancy word for guess work because often medical professionals do not know what is wrong with a person.  If we exclude the entirety of medical administration from this Bill, the Ombudsman Act and other reforming legislation, we are doing an injustice.  I would like health boards to be included from day one.  I do <Col N="1267" /> not believe the sky will fall if we do so.  In fact, I am certain it will not.</P>
    <P>I again refer to the concerns which existed in political life when we first discussed the Ombudsman legislation.  The Minister will know I was very interested in it and fell foul of a number of senior people in my party because I regarded the approach taken as ridiculously conservative.  I pointed out in an article in IBAR that if we included the prison service, health boards and local authorities, nothing would happen.  We began to include them incrementally and things have not ground to a halt.  However, the damage was done because people went to the Ombudsman's office and were told it did not have jurisdiction, so they did not have much faith in it. The Ombudsman and his predecessor have had to fight to establish themselves in the public consciousness.</P>
    <P>There is no reason State-sponsored bodies should be excluded from day one.  State-sponsored bodies, particularly non-commercial ones, are in a privileged position.  They are budget driven and, to a large extent, set their own targets. They are not subject to the scrutiny of ministerial responsibility, to questioning on daily executive activities by the Houses of the Oireachtas or to Adjournment debates.  We have created &mdash; I accept the analysis of the 1969 Devlin report &mdash; a huge number of non-commercial State-sponsored bodies because we want to break areas of public administration away from the constraints of ministerial responsibility, which I accept.  However, we have not put in place a public overseeing on the activities of these bodies. For example, we excluded such bodies from the overseeing activities of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, a crazy thing for both Houses to do, and from the operations of the Ombudsman.  We are effectively excluding them from the operations of this Bill for three years.  We cannot argue in favour of that.</P>
    <P>I do not know what briefing the Minister received or what conservatives on the political side of the Administration insisted on this.  I cannot believe any member of the Cabinet or the second rank of Ministers would argue strongly for the exclusion of State-sponsored bodies.  The argument has been that it would interfere with the commercial freedoms we sought to give them. That argument does not hold.  State-sponsored bodies would gain greatly by being included and there should be no delay in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about other areas.  I refer specifically to the exclusion of the courts.  Our courts are in an almighty mess.  I do not believe the conventional view that Ministers for Justice are responsible for the mess is entirely true or an accurate explanation.  I am familiar with a case, which was tied up in the High Court and now the Supreme Court, concerning a young couple, Mr. and Mrs. Doran, who live in Greystones.  They have been seeking justice for seven years and <Col N="1268" /> have been frustrated at each turn by what I call the legal Mafia &mdash; solicitors and, most recently, the Bar Council.  They have been driven to distraction by delays and inexcusable behaviour by the highest legal officers in the land.  I sought to highlight their plight on the Adjournment.  As the gentlemen in the Law Library and the senior wigs on the benches do not pay too much attention to us, there is no way we can inquire as to how the administration of justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not refer to a specific case. However, we should imagine a case in which this situation could conceivably arise where the Chief Justice &mdash; I am not saying this happens &mdash; must listen to a case at one level and do so again at another level and where it takes him seven years to reach a conclusion.  We would not be able to inquire into the administrative procedures.  The people would not have access to the material surrounding the case.  Perhaps it would be more appropriate to return to this on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Section 46(1)(a) provides that the Bill does not apply to the courts.  I might be interpreting it incorrectly and if I am I would welcome such news.  However, my interpretation of section 46(1)(a), which states: &ldquo;the courts (other than a record concerning the general administration of the courts or the offices of the courts)&rdquo;, is that we do not have power over how the courts administer themselves.  The Minister of State knows we are impotent in this area.  It is one of the last areas of secrecy.</P>
      <P>Section 47 refers to fees.  The Minister of State does not intend that the fees should become a problem and I am sure she and her staff wish to ensure that the public interest is also protected. We do not want people endlessly copying documents for administrative research.  Section 47(2)(a) refers to &ldquo;the estimated cost of the search&rdquo;.  This issue should be confined to direct costs; people should not be expected to bear the cost of administrative overheads.  I will propose an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage. I am trying to be helpful in outlining the amendments I will propose because I do not want to spring them on the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> My party's aim is to have a Freedom of Information Bill passed as soon as possible.  We are not interested in who sponsors the Bill.  If some minor points that recommend themselves in my Bill can be incorporated into this Bill we will be pleased to do so.  We are not interested in securing political kudos on this issue because freedom of information is long overdue in this country and will do a huge amount of good.</P>
    <P>I regret if I sounded critical of some aspects of the Bill but the criticism arises from a sincere interest in having an administration which will operate in the interests of the people and not in the interests of bureaucrats and vested interests. It is self evident that a public administration that is open and accessible is an administration that serves the people.  A public administration that is not open or accessible does not serve the people. Nobody in political life, from the local authorities to the Oireachtas, is interested in that type of administration.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and welcome its introduction. It is a pity it took so long to bring it before the House but that was not the fault of the Minister of State.  I wish her and the Bill well and I hope she will listen to our arguments in favour of amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is appropriate that it is initiated in the Seanad in view of the debates that have been held here on this subject in the past.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman, Kevin Murphy, said in his 1995 annual report: &ldquo;Information is at the centre of the citizen's dealings with public bodies and, in its absence, he or she cannot even begin to ask how and why decisions are made.  The fundamental cause of many complaints which I receive is a failure to provide appropriate information or reasons&rdquo;.  Many of the complaints documented in the report result from a lack of openness by public bodies.  If citizens had greater knowledge of the basis on which decisions were made, many of the complaints would not have arisen.</P>
      <P>Access to how official decisions are made is a civil right in an open democracy.  To date we have had a culture of secrecy and of avoiding giving full information.  It was as if the system felt exposed if information was available.  On reading the Official Report of proceedings in the Dáil and Seanad, one is struck by the culture of secrecy surrounding our approach to public life.  In the past 50 years Ministers from all parties went out of their way to give as little information as possible, especially in response to questions.  Negative answers were frequently given and no supplementary questions were allowed.  Phrases such as &ldquo;the matter is being dealt with in due course&rdquo; or &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; litter the replies to parliamentary questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The culture of secrecy permeated all aspects of Irish society, including education, the churches, health, hospitals, the Garda Síochána, the Army and so forth.  Even the Government Information Services prevented information being given.  It <Col N="1270" /> was not until 1973, when Muiris MacConghail became head of the service, that a real attempt was made to put the dessemination of information to the media and the public on a professional basis.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to introduce legislation before society is ready for it.  If this Bill had been introduced ten or 20 years ago it probably would have been too soon because society was not ready for it.  This Bill provides citizens with access to official information which is of direct personal relevance to them.  The presumption of secrecy is removed and replaced with a presumption of openness.  People who have received blood transfusions or blood products, for example, will be entitled to know where the blood came from and what tests were carried out on it.  It will give the public the right to have personal files amended if the information in them is incorrect, incomplete or misleading.  It will establish a principle that all official information should be available unless the body withholding it can establish that it is in the public interest not to release it.</P>
    <P>The main feature of successful freedom of information legislation in other countries is a purpose clause which establishes a legal presumption of openness.  This Bill establishes that presumption. It legislates in favour of releasing information and enunciates a policy of access to information. This is a powerful reference point for the private citizen in a dispute with the Government or with a local authority or body as to whether information should be released.  It puts the onus on the bureaucracy to justify, through an open appeals system or even the courts, why official information should not be released.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not unique in the European context. Freedom of information legislation is well established in Denmark, Holland, France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Sweden and Finland.  It also operates in Canada, the USA, Australia, Norway and New Zealand.  The right to information can be exercised by directly requesting particular information from a Department or agency.  To enable citizens to exercise this right in a focused way, freedom of information legislation requires that each year public bodies publish guidelines their structure, functions and the categories of information they hold.  Freedom of information legislation is based on a number of key principles: to progressively increase the availability of official information to the public and enhance the accountability of Ministers and officials, to provide the right of access by each person to official information relating to himself or herself and a right to seek to have it amended where he or she misleading, and to provide and independent appeals system to review matters in dispute.</P>
    <P>The key to the successful operation of freedom of information legislation lies with the appropriation operation of effective review mechanisms. Experience abroad shows that inteernal review by Departments proves effective in resolving many appeals by individuals whose requests for access <Col N="1271" /> to information have not been met or who dispute charges.  About 30 percent of appeals are resolved through this process.  The most effective independent appeals system from the point of view of cost, efficiency and informality is that of an independent Information Commissioner.  The functions of this commissioner would include investigating complaints where information has been refused, or where the amount of charges imposed is diputed.</P>
    <P>Freedom of information bring considerable benefits to the Irish public.  It will make administration more responsive and accountable to individual citizens, offer new opportunities for democratic participation and will help protect against arbitrary decision making.  It is important to get this right.  Freedom of information legislation has not been fully successful in a number of jurisdication because it gave Government agencies extensive opportunities to avoid releasing information.  We must avoid this.  I compliment the Minister on getting it right in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill of an independent review procedure to examine cases where people are refused information by the Government or a semi-State body.  Citizens can appeal to the Ombudsman, acting as an information commissioner.  If the Ombudsman, acting as commissioner, supports the application but access is still refused, it can be appealsed to the courts.  I commend the Ombudsman and his staff on their excellent work.</P>
    <P>Public bodies must publish a list of their main functions and the classes of information they hold.  A new statutory duty is being created to give reasonable assistance to those requesting information to pinpoint what they are looking for. When a request is made for information, it must be answered as quickly as possible, but within 20 working days at the outset.  Only in exceptional cases is a longer timescale allowed.</P>
    <P>The records which will become publicly available not only include documents but also maps, film, recordings, computer data and computer files.  People will normally be given access to information in the form they request, for example, a photocopy of a document, but information may also be sent electronically or given on computer disk where it is appropriate.  In the case of personal information, people will have a legal right to see their files, which will not generally be open to third parties.  Regulations will provide for parents to see records relating to their children and for certain information to be available to the next of kin when someone has died.</P>
    <P>Concerns were widely expressed in other countries when freedom of information was introduced in the early 1980s at to its adverse effects on public administration.  It was feared it would fundamentally change the way in which Government business was conducted, with the danger that it might grind to a halt.  It was also feared it would seriously discourage officials putting their views on paper and that the frankness and candour <Col N="1272" /> of advice from officials would suffer.  These deeply help views were publicly aired by civil servants and politicians.  Despite the fears expressed, Governments in other countries implemented freedom of information legislation with the purpose of improving the quality of public decision making and of increasing public awareness of the decision making process.  Their approach was vindicated by subsequent reviews of the impact of the legislation in Canada and Australia, undertaken by parliamentary committees.  Each found that the openness of freedom of information had delivered significant benefits in their respective jurisdications.  Following from the success of freedom of information at federal level, it was rapidly extended to states within each of these Commonwealths.</P>
    <P>The benefits included the improvement of the quality of decision making throughout Government &mdash; this stems from the possibility of access under freedom of information &mdash; to the associated requirement to provide facts and reasons to support decisions.  There was a deepening awareness of the need of objectivity and accountability in dealing with the public.  Improved information systems and record management and administration practices were revised and updated, <i>ad hoc</i> policies and procedures were formalised and there is now greater public confidence in Government agencies, arising from better communication. There has also been an improvement in the quality of written advice, with greater accuracy and less subjectivity.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 15 December Fintan O'Toole wrote:</P>
    <P>If it does nothing else except pass a Freedom of Information Act on the lines approved by the Cabinet last week, the Government will have effected perhaps the most profound change in Irish democracy since the foundation of the State...for all the air of secrecy about Government business, and for all that the Official Secrets Act remains in place, it looks as if something genuinely radical is about to happen.</P>
    <P>With luck, by this time next year, citizens will have access, as a matter of right, to huge amounts of information about the way the country is run.  The pane of glass behind which John Bruton promised to run the country may remain somewhat misty, but at least the steel shutters in front of it seem to be coming up.</P>
    <P>He also refers to the second principle in the Act:</P>
    <P>But the second critical principle in the Act is that even within these areas of exemption, it will be possible to appeal a refusal to an independent body &mdash; the office of the Ombudsman &mdash; on the grounds that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in maintaining confidentality.  This, too, is welcome. Even the most passionate libertarian will accept that there are times when secrecy is a good thing.  Purely personal information that could be used maliciously against a private <Col N="1273" /> individual should not be available.  Details of negotiating positions or sensitive discussions in the Northern Ireland peace process should be protected.  Somebody acting for, say, Ryanair, should not have access to Aer Lingus's commercial strategy.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Bill will mark profound and lasting change in the way public business is done. It ushers in a new relationship between citizens and the State and the public and the services they use.  Information is power and the Bill will transfer power from those behind closed doors to ordinary people.  It will herald a quiet revolution in the way in which public organisations conduct their business and will create a new climate of openness.  I, like the Minister am confident the Bill will end the culture of secrecy forever.  I commend the Minister on introducing the Bill and I look forward to its speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.  I also pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Roche, who published his Bill in March 1995, which the Minister has taken on board in this Bill.  It has been redrafted but the thrust, intent and spirit of Senator Roche's Bill is incorporated in it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the Bill recognises in law that public bodies should be directly accountable to the public they are there to serve.  When I was first elected to Dublin County Council in 1985, of which the Minister had long been a member, public servants were not amenable to the public they served.  They also decided they would not be amenable to members elected, due to a trade union dispute, which I understand and accept.  I did not understand the attitude of a particular member of staff who has left Dublin County Council.  I was frustrated by the type of answers I received and the blank wall I came up against as a newly elected public representative.  I came to the council with great enthusiasm expecting to change the world only to discover I was making little or no difference to what went before. Eventually this public servant took me aside and said their job was not to help but to tell us exactly why something cannot be done.</P>
      <P>This Bill will have achieved something if it forces public servants to change this view.  It is not the view of the majority of public servants today but it was in 1985.  It was perceived by some public servants that they were there to interpret the law in the most negative way and to frustrate the public and public representatives.  It is intended that it will now do much more than that.  As the Minister and Senator Roche said, information is power.  It is also truth and everybody is entitled to know the truth about decisions or information relating to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the Bill gives the legal right to people to see files on them held by public bodies. As Senator Roche said, this provision should be brought into operation as soon as possible in relation to local authorities and health boards.  I am not sure what the Minister's definition of public <Col N="1274" /> bodies includes but I will deal with this aspect later.</P>
    <P>The Bill will ensure that taxpayers can see their tax records.  A couple of years ago an insistent constituent came to see me with a huge bundle of papers, a copy of the Data Protection Act and other relevant explanatory memoranda.  He told me he had done the rounds to gain access to his tax and social welfare documentation.  He cited the Data Protection Act and said he was entitled to this information.  I read the correspondence he received from the Data Protection Commissioner and the Revenue Commissioners; I am not sure whether he received any correspondence from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The correspondence stated that the information he sought &mdash; the PRSI and tax contributions paid by his employer on his behalf from 1983-87 &mdash; would not be made available to him. He stayed with me for at least 30 minutes and explained why he should have that information.  I told him I would write to the relevant authorities, but I could still be writing to them because he does not have that information.  He still has not been told whether his employer paid tax and PRSI on his behalf, although he is sure he paid his tax.  I presume the Bill will allow this man to receive the information.  I can then call to his house and tell him he can get the details.  As a public representative I had a misguided belief that this type of information was available but it appears that is not the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister said parents will be able to see their children's school assessments.  This is important but another area of secrecy surrounding the way schools operate involves pupils who are suspended or ultimately expelled.  Children have a legal right to education up to a certain age but the placing of such pupils in another school depends on a telephone call from one principal to another.  In my experience the principal who is considering taking the child asks the other principal about the behaviour of the pupil in school rather than their academic ability.  A principal can decide not to accept the child into the school on the basis of the telephone call but the parents do not know why he or she was not accepted by that school or others.  The child's behaviour may have been extremely bad, but there could be other reasons.  I welcome the Bill if it opens up this area about which I am very concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that community groups will be able to look at policies and plans which affect their community.  This is welcome.  There have been many changes specifically in relation to local authorities where they must publish plans and reports and are statutorily obliged to perform certain functions.  Local authorities, health boards and various other institutions will do this but the Minister and I know from the experience of adopting local authority estimates that this can be done in such a way that it means nothing.  It is unintelligible and of little or no use.</P>
    <P>The process is expensive and the glossy documents are usually well prepared and researched. <Col N="1275" /> However, they are unintelligible to ordinary people such as me.  I do not know if they mean a dump will be built in Wicklow or land will be acquired for a regional park.  The way such information is made available to communities must be simplified.  I am not sure if it is necessary to incorporate this suggestion in the legislation but local authorities must be made to do their work in a way which is consumer user friendly.  This is happening to a certain extent but further progress is necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche referred to the section which requires members of the public to specify that they want information in accordance with the legislation.  It was pointed out that, in tandem with simplifying reports, there is also a need for members of public bodies to help those seeking information.  The Minister said this aspect is covered and, if that is the case, I welcome it. However, there could be a huge chasm in terms of knowing what one wants and being able to express it and receive the assistance one needs.  It could be the difference between having information, truth and knowledge or being unable to secure it.  We must ensure the process is simple.</P>
    <P>The role of community welfare officers was discussed in the past when my party was in Government and I was the spokesperson on social welfare. I defended them then and I continue to do so because they have a very difficult job.  The type of criticism levelled against them is often unfounded; I do not know if I could do their job as well.  However, community welfare officers will welcome the Bill because constituents tell me that if one knows how to play the system, one can get everything but if one tells the truth, one gets nothing.  If there is a way it can be shown that the decisions of community welfare officers are based on the information people gave them and are sound &mdash; although they can be appealed &mdash; it will stand to the community and to the officers who do an extremely difficult job well.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the right to access to the reasons for decisions.  I did not go through the Bill and having heard Senator Roche's contribution, I thought perhaps that I should not speak. I do not have his, or the Minister's, depth of knowledge of the legislation but as I learned from the comments earlier, the courts and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions are excluded.  I do not know if it is possible but the public needs to know how the Director of Public Prosecutions reaches decisions.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a local case in which a child was hurt.  The person who allegedly hit the child was summonsed and the child's parents attended the court.  However, the man who allegedly committed the assault did not turn up because of a strike involving the summons server.  When the matter arose again, the parents were told there was no case.  No matter what one tells them, they are convinced that somebody inside the system was on the side of the man alleged to have assaulted the child.  They believe that because he did not turn <Col N="1276" /> up the first time the case was called, the Garda must be on his side.</P>
    <P>It appears the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions said it was a civil case because the person who allegedly committed the assault did not conceal it.  However, it does not matter how many times this is said to the parents because they are convinced the man had more clout with the Director of Public Prosecutions.  If the Bill is to achieve its aims, the decisions of the courts and the DPP should not be excluded.  The problem of a deficit of information from and accountability by the Department of Social Welfare, health boards and community welfare officers has existed for years and we are approaching crisis point in relation to decisions of the courts and accountability in that regard.  If this area is excluded, worse problems will be stored up and there will be an even bigger crisis in the future.</P>
    <P>The move to establish an Information Commissioner is excellent.  The Minister pointed out that the powers of the Information Commissioner will be stronger than those of the Ombudsman, who would be the first to admit that he would prefer stronger powers.  His original job became more detailed and he was given slightly greater powers, but the Information Commissioner will need the powers it is proposed to give him and which are in line with the legislation.  As the Minister said, unfavourable decisions can be reviewed by the commissioner.</P>
    <P>Because of my background I cannot speak in the House without mentioning a group who lobby me daily.  Those who are adopted and seeking information about their birth records feel they are excluded from getting the information on their birth circumstances.  That is why I ask about public bodies.  The Adoption Board is a public body but I am unsure as to whether adoption societies are included in this definition.  There are good adoption societies but some abuse their power disgracefully regarding information on birth files and will continue to do so.  Some adoption societies will still refuse access to records even in cases where adoptees have made contact with their birth parents.  If contact is established with a birth parent, presumably one has their consent and it is hard to understand the excessive control the adoption societies have of their records.  As they were undertaking a function of the State I would regard them as public bodies.</P>
    <P>When the Tánaiste discovered the batch of files in the archives of the National Library, he announced the information would be made available on a central database.  That suggested an opening of the door which people with files in other agencies copy.  Obviously there are some details that cannot be given out without consent but some, such as health records, can.</P>
    <P>During my first pregnancy, I was asked for my health records.  My history of blood pressure, etc., was sought and I had to say I had no health record.  The obsession with information which later develops in adoptees comes about because they are refused information on ordinary matters <Col N="1277" /> such as health records, details of where one's parents came from, etc.  Not all information can be given and those who gave children up for adoption were guaranteed confidentiality but I am told that is not enshrined in the Adoption Act, 1953. It was arranged between the adoption society and the person giving up the child and while it may have some legal status it does not have the status these societies apply to it.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on every matter in the House which had some relevance to adoption.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health has not been helpful in this respect.  Yesterday I received a most unhelpful reply on the matter of a contact register which would probably get around the problems mentioned.  I will use my friendship with the Minister for State to see if we can do something with this Bill to get information for this group of people who seem to regard me as their personal Senator.  With the Minister of State's help, something might be done to recognise that these people are entitled to the information just like everyone else.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the fact that it is being initiated in the Seanad.  It will change our society tremendously.  It is a cultural change as much as a change in the operation of Government and public bodies.  The experience of other countries is that there was a change in the way the citizen approaches the State.  It has benefited the operations of the State, public bodies, public representatives and particularly the relationship between the citizen and the State.  It allows citizens to actively participate in a way they had not been able to do because of the presumption of secrecy.  Now there will be a presumption of openness.</P>
      <P>People will not feel alienated from the process of decision making.  At present they feel they do not have access to the information they need from local authorities, health boards, public bodies or Departments.  The legislation covers all these bodies.  The exclusions have been carefully thought out.  There was an interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday stating that the specific nature of the exemptions and the way they had been considered strengthens the legislation.  It ensures other bodies cannot hide behind the possibility of exemption.  The fact that the balance of public interest is the overriding consideration in relation to exemptions is very important.</P>
      <P>The front cover of <i>Democracy Blindfolded: The Case for a Freedom of Information Act in Ireland</i> by Patrick Smyth and Ronan Brady states: &ldquo;We need a new sense from our political establishment that the citizens of this State can be trusted, that they are mature enough to take the right decisions for themselves and that they no longer need the protective mollycoddling of one of the most protective States in Europe.&rdquo;  That sums up the importance to our democracy of bringing in such legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly commend the Minister of State on her dedication to this legislation.  She has been <Col N="1278" /> committed to this for many years and it has been difficult to get it right.  A great deal of work has been put into learning from other countries. Senators have cited countries which have implemented such legislation, particularly Canada, New Zealand and Australia.  The balance is right in this legislation.  Senator Roche was correct to say it is a move from the old British system we inherited to the more European, Napoleonic code, with its commitment to informing citizens more than protecting official secrets.  I welcome the examination of the Official Secrets Act because it goes hand in hand with this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the sos, I concentrated on the importance of enacting this legislation because of its potential to transform public participation. I will now speak about how the legislation will be implemented and how it will contribute to change.</P>
      <P>While the legislation itself is most important, it is nearly as important to ensure that, when it is enacted, the rules and regulations introduced are clearly spelled out and are effective.  As other Senators have said and I concur with them, there are many areas where we are poorly informed. This means we cannot fully or adequately respond to decisions which affect us as individuals, as members of the community or pressure groups or as people who want an issue resolved with a local authority, health board, Department or other public body.</P>
      <P>There are many examples one could cite.  Local authority housing is one area where people often feel they are not adequately equipped with the information they need.  They do not know where they are on the housing priority list nor where to get that information.  There are many other areas one could cite where people feel inadequately informed and do not know how to get the information.</P>
      <P>Information is power but it is necessary to know how to get it.  I welcome the obligation on public bodies to publicise how information may be obtained.  Public bodies, including local authorities, must publish what information they have and specify what is available to the public. Senator Roche raised the issue of sections 6 and 7 in that regard.  He was right about section 7 but I hope section 6, which places a duty on public bodies to give reasonable assistance to the public, would ensure the availability of information.  It is sometimes difficult for the public to relate to the information available; it does not know how to access it and some of it is available under current legislation.  This Bill will assist greatly with public access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be resistance in local authorities to providing information.  I hope local authorities, health boards and other public bodies will be as prepared as Departments.  Perhaps the Minister could give information on that.  I understand that <Col N="1279" /> Departments will prepare for this legislation so that they can adequately respond when it is enacted.  Is there a similar intention for local authorities?  Will officials in local authorities be trained to be fully <i>au fait</i> with their obligations under this legislation?  For it to work, all the people who use and hold information must be ready and willing to impart it.</P>
    <P>How is the information to be transmitted?  Will it be published in newspapers, in a document or available on disk?  How will the public find the information?  Will it approach relevant officials and, if so, will they have that information to hand?  These are important practical issues in implementing the legislation.</P>
    <P>I note that in other countries which have brought in similar legislation the transformation in public attitudes took place slowly.  That is probably inevitable because it takes people a while to realise the power they have under this type of legislation.  It is essential that every effort is made to ensure public officers have a positive attitude towards assisting the public to obtain information.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  One article I read suggested that we would probably not have needed the hepatitis C tribunal or the beef tribunal if we had had freedom of information legislation earlier. The right to information under this legislation should greatly improve the access to information in these areas where legitimate questions are asked about how public bodies do their business.</P>
    <P>I also support Senator McGennis's comments on adoption although I understand this legislation does not exclude information on adoption and, in that sense, it is not denying any right to information. The case she makes is one which must be addressed, if not in this Bill, then in later legislation.</P>
    <P>I also support her point about the Director of Public Prosecutions.  While there is a need for safeguards in this area, a strong case has been made by the Rape Crisis Centre about cases which go to the DPP where it is difficult for people to understand why some are proceeded with and others are not.  I do not know to what extent the legislation applies to this area.</P>
    <P>The application of the legislation to An Bord Pleanála and similar bodies should be as wide as possible.  There are many issues under the heading of local authorities: planning, environment, housing and information on the funding and expenditure of local authorities at the time of estimates, to which Senator McGennis referred. In my local authority we removed service charges the city manager had proposed but in order to do so we had to cut expenditure.  There was great difficulty getting details of expenditure from the local authority.  This poses problems both for public representatives and the public.  I hope that this will change as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important that information is available to the general public and its representatives.  If the <Col N="1280" /> public is to participate in our democracy it must have equal access to information.  Public representatives should not always be seen as intermediaries and I hope this Bill will promote a feeling among the public that it can access information without the assistance of public representatives.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the commission and the powers this Bill confers on it.  It is appropriate that the Ombudsman has been appointed to this position but I believe there is considerable overlap between his two roles as many cases referred to him arise from a lack of information. Will the Minister clarify this point?  The commission has strong powers and it will be possible for it to ensure that the spirit of the legislation is adhered to.  It will have power to report to the Oireachtas on how the legislation is working and that is welcome.</P>
    <P>The way in which this legislation is being enacted means that there will be no loopholes or hiding places for public bodies and officials.  The intention is to make available whatever information is required.  Concerns that some information will not be released are not justified because information can only be refused to protect the public good.</P>
    <P>My party has had a strong commitment to this legislation for many years.  The programme for Government agreed with Fianna Fáil contained a commitment to consider this legislation.  The present programme for Government also includes a commitment to its enactment.  That Bill is being initiated today.  I have no doubt that it will transform the way in which the public relate to information. I hope the Bill will be implemented as soon as possible.  It cannot be introduced overnight because preparations must made in the various bodies.  The manner in which the legislation is implemented is as important as the legislation itself because there is no point in having it if it does not permeate through all levels of administration. The legislation will provide for this and I welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and this legislation.  I believe that rumour is always worse than reality, as I am sure we will find out in the other House today.  The culture of openness in this Bill is a step forward.  I commend Senator Roche on his efforts in bringing this legislation before the House.  I also remember Senator Ryan's Bill which was introduced in 1985 and 1988.  It is interesting when reading through the debates which took place then to see how much attitudes have changed.  There is now a warm welcome for this legislation from all quarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have come a long way and some of the changes sought have been introduced.  I commend the Department of Social Welfare which has improved enormously and the citizens' advice bureaux which constantly produce leaflets so that people are aware of the benefits available to them.  It was interesting to discover that the Department advertises these benefits on the <Col N="1281" /> radio.  This is a total change in attitude.  Ten years ago people could not find out how to get a fuel allowance because the circular was not available.</P>
    <P>However, a culture of secrecy remains in some areas.  A number of years ago I telephoned a Department to ask for information and was asked why I wanted it.  I replied that if that was its answer, then I would not ask the question because the reply would vary depending on the reason for my asking it.</P>
    <P>There is less of a culture of secrecy in some Departments than in others but I have particular trouble with the Department of Justice.  I was not in favour of the bail referendum but I could not find out how many individuals had committed crimes when on bail rather than the number of crimes committed.  Did one person commit 5,000 crimes or did 5,000 people commit one crime? Not being able to get this kind of relevant information can be very irritating.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not just affect Departments.  I am very interested in the progress being made in the food industry, particularly regarding genetic engineering.  People will want more than simple labelling giving the contents of food.  They will also want to know the source of the products, whether they were genetically engineered and so on.  This information is not top secret and it is important that it be made available.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the medical profession which is one of the most secretive of professions. However, since doctors began giving more information to patients our lives have become much easier.  In one hospital to which I am attached the patients hold their charts and the charts have never been better kept.  It is convenient to be able to ask patients how their haemoglobin levels have changed, for example.</P>
    <P>This legislation ties in with the data protection laws because there is a great deal of information which is relevant only to the person it concerns. We in the medical profession must be careful about insurance companies' and employers' interest in personal data about patients.  I am glad to see provisions in the Bill dealing with such circumstances.</P>
    <P>There may be problems with privacy on the Internet; perhaps all we can do is look for best practice.  I am often amazed at what some people put on fax messages which are sent to public offices.  We should always remember that modern means of communication are not always as private as we think and information which we wish to keep private should be sent in a private way.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Bill was not ready for debate during the EU Presidency; I am aware the delay was not the fault of the Minister of State.  The Bill brings us up to best international practice.  Our nearest neighbour, the UK, has traditionally had a culture of secrecy and perhaps that hindered us bringing forward this legislation earlier.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> Many dignitaries from applicant states to the EU visited Dublin recently.  It is important to impress upon them that we expect the same freedom of information practices in their countries as in the EU.  We have a tendency to consider the economic aspects of the EU but the social aspects are also very important.  I had the privilege of being asked to speak in Bratislava at the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the birth of Alexander Dubcek.  To my dismay I discovered that a considerable body of legislation in Slovakia diminishes the freedoms so recently gained.  For example, legislation has recently been passed whereby any group which objects to what it considers the infringement of the state upon the person can be considered to be acting against the state and might be imprisoned.</P>
    <P>Slovakia has a unicameral parliamentary system, which I think unfortunate.  For all their splendid universities they do not have university senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Such countries need us to object to such measures.  I compliment a former Senator, Gemma Hussey, who has done great work in eastern Europe stressing the importance of freedom of information and of the press.  One often gets the impression that more changes have been made in the eastern European countries than have been made.</P>
      <P>The President of Romania, Mr. Constansescu, and the Romanian Foreign and Culture Ministers visited Dublin last week.  They came within two days of being elected because they wanted to be here in the lead up to the EU Summit to stress how important it is for them that we should know what is happening in Romania.  It would be a mistake to think there has been freedom there since the fall of the Ceaucescu regime.  It is only since the last election that Romanians have achieved a freedom on which I hope they can build.  We should give them what support we can.  They have sent a very good ambassador to Ireland.  Romania puts great emphasis on the way small European countries should act towards others.  It is important for us to keep an eye on what is happening in the countries on the far side of the continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found to my astonishment that in Slovakia the directors of the opera and the national theatre were being replaced.  In many of the former Eastern bloc countries the members of the artistic professions were often the most outspoken and courageous.  Had we been in the same position <Col N="1283" /> many of us would probably have stayed quiet and kept a low profile.  At the celebration for Alexander Dubcek I met some of those people who for decades put themselves in great danger trying to encourage freedom in their country.  That illustrated to me how fortunate we have been since the foundation of the State to have the freedoms we had and this Bill extends them even further.  I remember once asking about the menu for a dinner I was attending in Northern Ireland and I was told it was secret.  Thankfully, we have never gone that far.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope its provisions will extend to all citizens.  People in prison often have difficulty getting access to information and can have problems preparing for trials.  There may soon be an increase in the numbers on remand in the prisons and those people may have more difficulty preparing for their trials than if they were outside prison.  While we can give freedom with one hand it can be easy to take it away with the other.  I hope the Minister of State will keep a close on watch on the implementation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>One might say that with the enactment of this freedom of information legislation the old order changeth.  It has been awaited for a long time. Appalling cases have arisen over the past few years concerning the failure of local communities and individuals to obtain information to which they were rightly entitled.  I recall fighting a battle some years ago with others in the county council for the right of people to have access to planning files.  At the time were told we could not have access to such files but changes were made when sufficient pressure was applied and now one has the right to consult planning files.  If an individual or group has an interest in something, that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's reference to &ldquo;county councils, health boards and other public boards, and semi-State organisations and organisations which are substantially publicly funded such as secondary schools&rdquo;.  However, urban district councils should also be included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State specifically mentioned county councils but I accept that the urban district council is a statutory body under the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The right to see one's own files and to refer to the housing list was referred to earlier.  Many local authority managers have failed in recent years to provide housing lists.  I have been a member of a local authority for nearly 30 years and for 27 of those years we had a housing list.  However, because of the reduction in funding for local authorities such lists are no longer provided.  The reason was the most urgent cases would be provided for when houses were being built and consequently the county managers' association decided there would be no lists.  That should be <Col N="1284" /> specifically provided for.  People who apply for rehousing should be entitled to have their circumstances assessed and be placed in order of priority.  They should not have to wait six or seven years which often happens.  Such a system would eliminate that.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that community groups will be able to get information on policies and plans that affect their community.  We have plenty of evidence of cases where local authorities planned and developed landfill sites which have become a major problem.  People are concerned and they are at least entitled to the right to know about such matters so that they can assess their situation.  That will relieve many of the problems that currently exist where people have blocked roads to stop hauliers bringing effluent into their areas.  It would be helpful if people knew which hauliers were licensed by the local authority to access such sites.</P>
    <P>Health boards behave appallingly as far as making decisions without giving any explanation for them is concerned.  The Bill will improve that and many people will now have the right to see their own files.  I do not know whether representatives of such people will have the same right but that should be considered.  Some people may be well able to present their case while others may be too timid to do so.  The office of the Information Commissioner will act as an independent watchdog and that is built solidly into the Bill.</P>
    <P>According to the explanatory memorandum, section 47 &ldquo;provides that fees may be charged in respect of the location and copying of records, based on a standard hourly rate...&rdquo;.  In what circumstances can records be copied?  I understand that if one looks at a planning file in a local authority one cannot copy it.  There is provision to charge a fee for copying records but will the right to copy records be built into the legislation?</P>
    <P>Information is vital to the proper functioning of a democracy.  Our democracy will be strengthened by the provisions of the Bill.  Over the years we have become accustomed to under the counter Government.  In our Constitution there is no vindication of the right to know and successive Governments have used provisions ranging from Cabinet confidentiality via the Official Secrets Act to specific legislative changes as pretexts for denying the public access to the most innocuous information.</P>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Bill will tear apart some of the veil of secrecy which has shrouded Government and public administration in the past.  I hope that in future, progress will be made on related matters.</P>
    <P>While I am concerned about the exemptions in Part III, I will not deal with them now.  I am also concerned, however, about the Department of Justice, which was mentioned earlier by Senator Henry.  That Department's attitude is absolutely appalling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has no bearing in the world except that, as the Minister of State is introducing a Freedom of Information Bill, I agree that there has to be a change from what has happened in the past where members of the public, Members of the Oireachtas and members of county councils could not even find out who they were talking to when they raised queries.  Freedom of information is not about the major things in life, it is about somebody walking into a county council to inquire where they are on the housing list.  People could not get that information up to now but the Freedom of Information Bill will allow someone who has no house to find out when they will get one.  People want to be able to find out if they can get a house within the next couple of weeks. As a public representative I want to know who will give me the information.  I want to know the name of the person to whom I am speaking and where a person about whom I am inquiring is on the priority list.  I have been a member of a local authority and a Member of the Oireachtas since 1969 and I must say freedom of information is a two-way process.  I want to be able to talk to civil servants or county council officials on the basis that they know I will not shaft them if I ask where a person is on the list.  I do not want to be quoted afterwards saying that the person is not fit to do this or that.  Does this mean that, every time I make a telephone call on behalf of a client to a county council official, that official must tell me the exact situation?  Must I then be responsible <Col N="1286" /> for that information or is the official responsible for it?</P>
      <P>I know people who are towards the top or bottom of a housing list and they have been in contact with every Deputy and Senator.  Under this Bill, does the responsibility lie with the first person who telephones a county council official and is that official responsible immediately for the statement he or she makes?  That is very important.  If Senator Sherlock and I are in the same constituency, for example, and a person goes to him first and he telephones the county council official tells him &ldquo;There is no hope&rdquo; and the same official tells me &ldquo;We will look into it&rdquo;, where lies the official's responsibility?</P>
      <P>Under the Data Protection Act, 1988, I can ask about the data an organisation holds which affects me.  Can the Minister give me protection? If she, as a Minister, telephones a county council or Government body, will she be told that under the Data Protection Act, 1988, she cannot be given any of my details but that she can be given them under the Freedom of Information Bill when it is enacted?  How can she equate the Data Protection Act, 1988, with the Freedom of Information Bill?  That is my major difficulty with the Bill.  I would agree with many of its provisions but the two pieces of legislation are absolutely different.  If one examines sections of the Bill, one will find that it negates the Data Protection Act. The Minister keeps shaking her head.  Where, in law, can I have protection under the Data Protection Act, 1988, and where can I have it under the Freedom of Information Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will welcome the opportunity to explain to Senator Lanigan, but it will wait until her reply.</P>
      <P>In general, I welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue and I welcome the intention behind it. However, the Bill is not as liberal as has been suggested.  Indeed, the number exemptions is significant. There are a large number of exemptions throughout the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 62.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that is my difficulty with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have talked about the culture of secrecy which has permeated all public institutions for many years.  I have mentioned before that I find disquieting the attitude that county council officials know best and that State officials should decree to what the public should or should not be allowed access.  That is a characteristic of colonialism at its worst.  The colonial attitude was always that the natives could not be trusted, that they could not be let run their affairs because they would make an absolute shambles of it, and that rule by the great benevolent power overseas was best.  The attitude was that there was something <Col N="1287" /> faintly distasteful about the natives, they were not as well educated as the colonists and they did not know as much about life as the colonists. That is an appalling attitude.  Incidentally, I am not suggesting that the Minister would adopt that attitude and everything in her history would suggest she would not, but that is a very widespread attitude within not only the State but also institutional life.  There is a belief that people who are outside the establishment are not to be trusted and that must be stamped out, and I hope this Bill has that effect.</P>
    <P>I accept there must be exemptions&mdash;I am not suggesting otherwise&mdash;as specified in the Bill in respect of the security of the State, military matters, Northern Ireland and sensitive information which might be available only to the Government and which, if widely known, could lead to instability. However, as always in these cases, the question is one of balance, and the balance has not been weighted far enough in favour of the liberal side of the argument.</P>
    <P>There have been two beneficial effects of Nordic countries' membership of the EU and the first has to do with freedom of information. Things which would have been, and are, tolerated in Ireland as matters of secrecy would not be tolerated in Nordic countries where there is a more open attitude.  The second beneficial effect relates to the environment, and it is unrelated to this Bill. Nordic countries have brought these perspectives to bear on the EU and they have made a welcome positive impact.</P>
    <P>One serious flaw in the Bill is time it will take to introduce provisions in respect of a range of bodies.  It will be three years before the Bill comes into effect with regard to local authorities and health boards, and that is before one considers the year after the commencement.  That is an appalling length of time.  I can not understand why it will take so long.  The question which then arises is when is the commencement date?</P>
    <P>When people are seeking information which, of its nature, is needed immediately, speedy access is essential.  There can be a four week lead in period, followed by another four week extension if that is deemed necessary by the head of the organisation providing the information.  There is an extended period before the person seeking the information can acquire the information and it then has to be kept on the books for another four week period to allow that person time if he or she so desires before acquiring the information.  That period will have to be looked at on Committee Stage.  The other question that will have to be looked at on Committee Stage is whether this three year lead in period for local authorities and health boards is too long.</P>
    <P>There may be difficulties in certain areas when it comes to the exemption aspect of the Bill. Those of us who are members of local authorities know that, for instance, very sensitive individual and personal information is available to people in <Col N="1288" /> the health board and in the local authority which is very beneficial when making decisions as to who should qualify for local authority houses. Kildare County Council has had quite a debate about opening some of these meetings to the press.  I can understand the difficulties caused by discussing information of that nature in a public place.  However, each individual should have access to whatever information is on file about them and should be able to correct it if necessary. That would be the case under the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are so many caveats in the Bill that if the head, as specified in the Bill, wants to be obstructionist he or she can make life extremely difficult for the requester to the point where the requester might be inclined to give up looking for the information. This could be the case to the extent of specifying the type of written form that would have to be presented when applying for the information. It is inevitable that there are specific rules and regulations under the legislation but everything is biased in the direction of the person who witholds the information.  If the culture of secrecy continues and if the individual who is responsible for the dissemination of the information contained in the files subscribes to that culture of secrecy, it will be very difficult for the Bill to operate.</P>
    <P>I am concentrating on some of the negative aspects of the Bill but in its general thrust and tone it is a significant advance on what we have had to date.  A related issue is defamation and freedom of the press.  The bias has been against freedom and publication of information and weighted heavily in favour of the protection of individual rights.  At the moment it is extremely difficult for the press to publish information which is freely discussed in the public domain. The defamation laws are such that newspapers expose themselves on a daily basis to people who trawl the newspapers for statements which may be defamatory so that they can sue those newspapers. That is wrong because at the foundation of our democratic system is freedom of the press. There has to be a healthy tension between Government, political establishments and the press and that tension is good for democracy.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the one year period and the three year period which is granted to local authorities. There is a reference to the Chairman of Dáil Éireann in section 2 (1) (j) of the Bill&mdash;&ldquo;in relation to the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Chairman of Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.  I am sure, Sir, you wish to have your name added to the distinguished list of people mentioned in the Bill.  I know you would exercise your functions in an exemplary manner.  We will have to look at that on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I realise that.  Section 2(b) (v) puzzles me, although I am sure the Minister has a sound legal explanation for it.  This section covers information relating to the criminal history of an individual.  Why is there is a restriction on the criminal history of an individual?</P>
      <P>Information relating to the property of an individual is included under that section.  I know some people find the publication of the estates under wills in newspapers very distasteful.  I do not think the Bill can deal with it because it deals with a deceased person, but people draw all sorts of conclusions and there is a vicarious fascination with finding out how much money people left in their wills.  It is not desirable to have that type of information in the public newspapers but I imagine others might take a different attitude.</P>
      <P>One of the main features of the Bill is in section 6(1), which states:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act, every person has a right and shall, on request therefor, be offered access to any record held by a public body and the right so conferred is referred to in this Act as the right to access.</P>
      <P>That is very positive; it is the foundation of the Bill.  However, that right of access is very restricted and on Committee Stage we will look at the degree to which we want it restricted or liberalised by way of amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is very difficult to follow in that in many sections there are references to other sections and it is necessary to move back and forth and it becomes extremely complicated to understand what exemptions are and are not in force.  I do not know what can be done about that. Although this Bill is trying to liberalise information, one would almost need to be a professional <Col N="1290" /> lawyer to be able to find one's way through it.</P>
    <P>Section 6(2) deals with &ldquo;reasonable assistance&rdquo; and broad latitude is given to the public body to decide the nature of such assistance. The Minister of State might comment on what she regards as &ldquo;reasonable assistance&rdquo; and what the law regards as &ldquo;reasonable assistance&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Section 6(4) states:</P>
    <P>The records referred to in subsection (1) are records created after the commencement of this Act and records created during such period (if any), or after such time (if any), before such commencement as may be prescribed, after consultation with the other members of the Government, and references in this Act to a record shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>I am led to believe that a person wishing to inspect a record which was in place before the commencement of the Act could be denied access on these grounds.  That would be a serious limitation. I accept it can be prescribed otherwise, but I wonder if that will be the case.  I have reservations about this matter and the Minister of State might provide clarification.  There is also the issue of making requests in writing, the two week period in respect of records not held by a body and the necessity of completing forms.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides power to grant or refuse to grant a request.  This section is very complicated and makes provision for extending the period for a further four weeks.  Section 15 is one of the desirable and positive features of the Bill which stipulates that public bodies must prepare documents and books containing information about the way they conduct their business.  I welcome this development.</P>
    <P>The most legitimate area for exclusion of public access involves defence, security and Northern Ireland.  However, distinctions must be made in this regard.  One area of concern to members of the Defence Forces who live in my constituency involves records kept in respect of their service. The promotion prospects of those serving in the Defence Forces can be determined by information contained in their personnel files.  There is a view among members of certain sections of the Defence Forces that they have not always been informed about what held them back when it came to promotion.  That is a different situation to the one which obtains in respect of the overall aspect of security.  The question arises regarding the extent to which it would be open to an individual to gain access to their personnel files, particularly where this has a bearing on future promotion.  I welcome the appointment of an Independent Commissioner.</P>
    <P>There is an important aspect I wish to raise in connection with section 19(1) which states:</P>
    <P>A head may refuse to grant a request under section 7 if the record concerned&mdash;</P>
    <P>. . . . . </P>
    <P>(c) contains information (including advice), for a member of the Government, <Col N="1291" /> the Attorney General, a Minister of State, the Secretary to the Government or the Assistant Secretary to the Government for use by him or her solely for the purpose of the transaction of any business of the Government at a meeting of the Government.</P>
    <P>I suspect that, had this been law when the beef tribunal was in place, someone would have taken a case in the High Court to prove that some of the transactions which took place in respect of export credit guarantees should have been excluded from the ambit of the tribunal.  The Minister of State is shaking her head and she will have an opportunity to clarify the position in a moment because I am about to conclude.  I do not believe anyone else wishes to contribute on Second Stage now that Senator Lanigan has departed.</P>
    <P>I return to my main point concerning the culture of secrecy.  The Bill is a reasonable attempt to erode that culture but, if they are determined, public officials, Departments or local authorities will be able to ensure that people seeking information are thwarted.  I hope the legislation will ensure that those who do not want to release information will be compelled to do so.  I know that is the Minister of State's intention and on Committee Stage we will be able to deal with these matters in greater detail so that her intention can be put into law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for a good and constructive debate which, at times, strayed into matters more relevant to Committee Stage by virtue of the detail and depth of contributions.  I hope that, as a result of this debate and on Committee Stage, we can improve what is a good Bill, which has at its core the principle of maximising openness.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan repeated an allegation made by a Member of the Lower House that there are 62 exemptions under the Bill.  This comes from a misreading of the First Schedule which involves bodies that are included not those that are excluded.  I hope I can nail that misconception for the benefit of Members of the other House and readers of <i>The Irish Times,</i> which repeated the mistake in its editorial.  The aim of the Bill is to include as much as possible, subject to basic, common sense exemptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis queried some of the exemptions and I do not believe he was present to hear my opening contribution.  The exemptions are basically common sense.  The Bill is not a charter for drug barons or crime bosses and it will not interfere with the process of law enforcement or criminal detection.  We are not going to distribute examination papers at Easter which are pertinent to examinations to be held the following June. We are not going to reveal the negotiating processes used by the State or interfere with the privacy of individuals.  Senator Dardis expressed concerns <Col N="1292" /> about the list of provisions in this regard.  If a person gains a criminal record in connection for parking their car on a double yellow line which is private and personal, others will not be able to access that record if they have no business doing so or if it is not of concern to the public interest.</P>
    <P>Commercial secrecy and privacy are also protected under the Bill.  The fact that someone applied for a grant to the IDA should not provide a way for their competitors to obtain their trade secrets <i>via</i> the backdoor.  These are common sense exemptions and they take up so much of the printed text because they were carefully and tightly drawn up.  If the Bill merely referred to commercial secrecy, many things could be hidden behind it.  However, because we specify what is involved and due to the inclusion of balancing public interest, we minimise what is protected, which is only that required to be protected in the public interest.  This concerns something which would harm or prejudice security, defence, international relations or law enforcement.  It also involves situations where the public interest would be more damaged by breaching personal privacy than by releasing the information.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the Bill is not liberal enough.  If it is scrutinised alongside similar legislation in other countries, the Bill is probably one of the most liberal pieces of freedom of information legislation in the world.  The reason for this is that, by coming to it late in the day, we were able to consider legislation adopted in other countries, discuss their experience, discover whether it had worked and what different approaches they would take if they had to reintroduce the legislation.  The advice we received from foreign jurisdictions has informed and shaped this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators Roche and Dardis were concerned about naming the detail of the procedures.  Those procedures are in place precisely to avoid the situation about which Senator Dardis is concerned, namely, that the thrust and spirit of the Bill will not be obeyed in practice.  It is for this reason that an independent Information Commissioner will be appointed; people will be given the right appeal to him or her and he or she will have mandatory powers.  We considered the issue of appeals to the courts but these do not work in countries where they were introduced.  We met with representatives of the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal and discovered that the process is slow and does not work effectively.  We chose the route of appointing an independent Information Commissioner with mandatory powers because we want to ensure that the legislation works.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to the possible delay of four weeks after an initial application for information has been made and another four weeks if there is a deferral.  These provisions have been tightly drawn up.  There is legal obligation on public bodies to give the information as soon as they can with an outside limit of four weeks.  The deferral only comes in to play in specified circumstances <Col N="1293" /> referred to in the legislation, for example, where somebody is looking for truck loads of information which cannot be physically got within four weeks or information which is difficult to find because of its nature.  When a decision is refused under section 22(2) (c) one must say why access to information is being refused.  The information commissioner must justify why he cannot give that information.  Checks and balance exist which are based on solid experience and advice to ensure this legislation works from day one.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis was concerned about the form in which information will be given and if it will be a reason for delay.  That matter has been informed by problems experienced in trying to gain access to environmental information, for example.  Environmental groups have looked for information which would require somebody to stand at a photocopier for weeks.  Such information can be electronically transmitted so that they can do the photocopying.  It easier to analyse material in computer form.  This is about making the transmission of information more user friendly and not about inhibiting how a person gets it.  Normally, one will get the information in the form in which it is requested, that is, if one looks for a photocopy or a disc, that is what one will get it.  If it is more convenient to give the information on disc, it will be sent in that way.  If there is a problem with that, one has the right to appeal to the information commissioner.  We have built in caveats which may look cumbersome but which are based on solid experience.  They will ensure this works in practice because that is our prime concern.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis and Senator Roche raised the issue of access to local authority information and expressed the wish that it should be available as quickly as possible&mdash;a wish I share.  Like other Senators, I have put in more than 13 years as a member of a local authority.  One of the most damaging allegations made today was how difficult it is for elected members to get information, let alone the public.  That is disgraceful.  What is contained in the Bill represents the outer limit, that is, that health boards and local authorities will come under its remit by a certain date so there can be no delay beyond that.  If it is possible to bring the date forward, we will do so.  When drawing up the legislation we did not go to the 78 local authorities, eight health boards and the 96 urban district councils to see if it would cause them problems.  We would never have come up with a Bill by the time that consultation process was complete.  If it is possible, I will explore bringing forward the date because I agree with the Senators that the sooner we get the information the better.  We have an outer limit in mind in terms of time.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock raised the right of a public representative to see a personal file.  Individuals have the right to see their files.  There is a provision to make regulations so that parents, for example, will be able to see their young children's health or school records.  However, these regulations <Col N="1294" /> will have to be carefully drawn up to protect the privacy of someone with AIDS, for example, so that their parents will not see their records.  When making those regulations we will look at the right of a public representative, duly authorised, to get information somebody's behalf.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry and Senator Lanigan asked about the relationship with the Data Protection Act.  That Act allows individuals access to their files held on computer by public or private bodies. It forbids the use of that information for purposes other than those for which it was collected. This Bill has related, but different, provisions, It concerns access by individuals to their own files held by public bodies.  It does not deal with private bodies except in cases where they are publicly funded.  Individuals will have access to their own files, whether on computer or manual record.</P>
    <P>We have safeguarded the privacy of those records.  Third parties, in the normal course, cannot see a person's tax, social welfare or personal files except in circumstances where the overriding public interest is concerned &mdash; for example, in matter of major public importance in which it is necessary to give private information.  An individual must be consulted about that and their comments must be taken into account when a decision is being taken, but that does not give them a veto.  This has been carefully drawn up to protect personal privacy.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators asked what would happen if they wrote on behalf of a constituent. Under Article 15.10 of the Constitution, the personal papers of Members are constitutionally protected and are private.  That provision is repeated in the Bill.  We are extending that protection to the private papers of county councillors and members of health boards in carrying out an analogous function representing their constituents.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis asked about adoption information. I appreciate her concern in this area.  As everyone will know, this is a highly sensitive and personal area.  Mothers who gave birth 40 or 50 years ago were guaranteed confidentiality.  They may now be married and their families may not know the situation.  However, people may want to know their origins and to have their records. To some extent, the Freedom of Information Bill would be a blunderbuss to deal with such personal issues.  The Department of Health is preparing legislation on access to files but it cannot finalise it at present because of a Supreme Court action which deals with balancing the right of the natural mother to confidentially versus the right of the child to know.  It will set up a voluntary based contact register.  As soon as the Supreme Court makes a decision, it will proceed with legislation which will address the concerns raised by Senator McGennis.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche in a most thoughtful contribution raised the issue of the scope of the bodies to be included.  He made some practical suggestions which we will consider as well as a point about bodies with quasi-statutory functions. <Col N="1295" /> Senator O'Sullivan asked about the overlap between the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner.  We asked the Ombudsman to be the first Information Commissioner but the two roles will be distinctly separate in law.  The second Information Commissioner may be somebody else.  If an appeal is made under this Bill, it will be dealt with as such.  People may challenge administrative malpractice under the Ombudsman Act.  The Ombudsman will have two separate offices dealing with both functions.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche spoke about the administrative procedures Bill.  He thought we had borrowed from that.  I am pleased there is an overlap between administrative procedures and the right to information.  Once a person has the right to information, he has the right to see secret rules, regulations, criteria circulars which is also part of good administrative procedures.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Doyle, is working on the administrative procedures Bill and I hope she introduces it as speedily as possible because it dovetails into this process of reforming our administrative system.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche also raised the issue of medical privilege which is excludes from the Ombudsman Act but not this one.  People will be able to read medical comments on their files.  He asked if the complexities would frustrate access.  This has been carefully designed to do the opposite. Section 7(1) (b) and the need to specify what one is looking for will help a person to find the information. The converse of that is that civil servants and public servants will have an obligation to help a person not only by publishing the guides to and lists of what information is available, which will be available in every public office, library and so forth, but they also have a statutory duty to help a person find their way through the maze.  That duty is provided for in section 6(2)(a).  I looked at the point the Senator raised with regard to section 7(1)(a) but I am legally advised that the rights under this Bill, in terms of access to information and so on, come into effect with its release under the Act.  That is why the provision is phrased in that way.  However, we will look again at the wording.</P>
    <P>Will the form of the record be sanitised?  Legally it cannot be sanitised except by the exclusion of personal identifying information.  If a person asks for something he or she must get it.  The Information Commissioner can examine the records.  Non-co-operation with the Information Commissioner is a criminal offence for which an offender can be sentenced to six months in prison.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche referred to the administration of the courts and delays in sheduling cases.  Our intention was that the legislation would cover general administration and, if it does not achieve that, we will look at it again.  We are precluded under the Constitution from involvement in certain aspects of the administration of the courts, <Col N="1296" /> such as the process whereby judges reach decisions.  We are also constitutionally precluded, and there is case law precedent, from getting involved in aspects of the work of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The administration of that office is covered but there is Supreme Court case law with regard to getting involved in the choices made by the Director of Public Prosecutions and in other areas in which some Members would like Government to be involved.</P>
    <P>With regard to charges, it is reasonable that if somebody is seeking information they should pay the usual photocopying costs.  That is normal practice and I doubt that it will cause a problem. There is provision for not charging fees, for example, from a pensioner who has no money and is seeking his or her records.  The retrieval costs will come into effect if somebody is looking for a great deal of information and if it would involve a staff member devoting, for example, half a day to finding the information.  Rather cunningly, however, we have provided that if retrieval takes a lot of time because the public body does not have its affairs in order, the applicant cannot be charged for its inefficiencies.</P>
    <P>The Bill explicitly provides that if the cost of collecting this money would outweigh the cost of administration, it will not be charged.  This and the voluminous requests and deferral provisions are included to deal with certain situations.  We were told in Australia about a man who looked for 18,000 documents.  There was no way in which the individual concerned could process them and retrieving the documents meant the public body would have to stop its work.  If a body is obliged to stop issuing housing grants, headage payments and so forth in order to gather 18,000 documents there will be a problem, as Departments and agencies must carry on their usual work.  This provision is included to cover that.</P>
    <P>The legislation also provides that people must try to focus on what they are seeking.  In one case in Australia a man sought information on every road maintenance project in the relevant territory.  He wanted to know why the potholes outside his house were not filled and once people realised what he was seeking they were able to give him the file.  It saved everyone going to much trouble to dig out information the man could not handle, while giving him the information he sought on the reason for delays in repairing the road.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a person need not say why they are looking for information.  It is a citizen's right to look for information.  Non-nationals who, for example, might have to deal with the Department of Justice under the aliens legislation will also have a right to information.  Some Senators commented on the traditional secrecy of the Department of Justice.  Only issues that will involve harming the administration of justice, law enforcement and criminal prosecutions are not covered by the legislation.  Issues regarding administration are explicitly covered.  If the authorities break the law in criminal investigations, information in that regard is made available. <Col N="1297" /> There are safeguards to ensure there will not be abuse of this legislation in the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis asked about Cabinet papers and what would have happened in the beef tribunal. Under the Tribunals of Evidence Act, Cabinet papers are available to the public.  They are also available under the Ambiorix judgment by way of discovery in the courts if one is a litigant with an interest in a particular set of papers. The papers are, in theory, available to a small number of people.  This Bill confers a right on the ordinary person to seek information.  Cabinet papers are subject to time dated protection.  After a decision of the Cabinet has been made and published a person can get all factual information relating to it immediately.  That would include the information used to make the case and expert reports.  Within five years the full Cabinet papers automatically become available.  This is not a mandatory but a promissory exemption and some of the papers might become available sooner. There is also provision for consulting with the leaders of the parties who were in Government at the time the decision was made.  This is to inform them rather than give them a veto.  This provision opens the Cabinet papers to ordinary members of the public.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis asked about the personnel records of serving officers in the Defence Forces. They are entitled to see their records and information that might interfere with their promotion prospects.  The only case in which these would be private would be where there was a security problem in letting an officer have such information, for example, if the officer was suspected of being in the IRA.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche and Senator Dardis asked why it will take a year to implement the legislation. My concern is to make it work.  Senator Roche acknowledged the work involved in gathering the circulars and the internal rules and guidelines which will have the force of administrative law as soon as they are published.  That process will take time.  We are also concerned that when people go looking for information they will get it.  Public bodies must get their filing systems in order and they need time to do that.</P>
    <P>We consulted widely on this matter and with Robert Hazel of the Nuffield Foundation about the introduction phase of freedom of information legislation in Commonwealth countries.  We asked about the teething difficulties and we were advised that it would take more than a year to get it right.  We have reduced that timeframe as much as possible.  The worst possible outcome would be that if somebody sought information under this legislation and could not get it, the legislation would be discredited and there might be moves in the public service to abandon it.  I do not want that to happen.  I want the system to be well prepared and user friendly for both sides.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to keep delays in implementing this legislation to a minimum.  If I am satisfied <Col N="1298" /> we can reduce the delays further we will do so. However, our advice is that a year is required. Like the Senators, I am committed to maximising the amount of information available to the public. This Bill is framed with that in mind.  Its mandate in the Title, which has legal effect in interpreting the discretions, is to maximise the amount of information to become publicly available consistent with public security, public interest and respect for personal privacy.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Roche that information is truth as well as power.  The conduct of public business and the delivery of public services is enhanced when they are delivered in truth and openness.  This Bill sets out to do this.  I welcome the constructive debate in this House and hope it will help us to further improve the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I addressed the other House on this Bill at some length yesterday.  The resources for political parties and the democratic process have been less than adequate for many years.  Recently, controversy has surrounded the way political parties finance themselves.  A conventional way over many years now appears, on the basis of a statement ongoing in the other House, to have become the subject of enormous controversy.  That is one reason the Bill is before the House.  However, it is not the only reason and I will outline its purpose before I return to the main theme of financial support for political parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> The Bill contains a number of measures.  Prior to last year, I agreed, following consultations with the Whips of all parties in both Houses, that the provision for overnight allowances was inadequate and that the rules and regulations which applied to Thursday nights were not fair because of the increased workload of Members of both Houses regarding committees.  I made provision in the budget and the Estimates for an additional sum of approximately £0.5 million for extra costs associated with Thursday overnights and a new administrative system in relation to telephones.</P>
    <P>Members are familiar with the original system which required Deputies and Senators to submit their telephone accounts.  These had to be verified and checked and 75 per cent of the costs were recouped up to a maximum of £2,000.  This engaged an enormous amount of administrative time which was wasteful because it involved second gussing and checking material which had been already verified by Telecom Éireann.  The money involved was considered less than adequate, particularly for some Members who represent constituencies in provincial Ireland who had costs in excess of the 75 per cent limit.</P>
    <P>It was decided to change the system and to give Members approximately £2,000 to be allocated in four quarterly instalments.  The purpose of this was to eliminate the unnecessary bureaucratic second guessing of the verification.  However, it was not possible to do that by regulations and a statutory basis for the new arrangements for the overnight allowance and telephones is necessary. I wanted to do this for some time.  The provision in the 1996 Estimate was £0.5 million and I wanted to spend it this year.</P>
    <P>Section 4 relates to payments indemnification in respect of certain persons in employment. Since 1980 a system of secretarial assistance for Oireachtas Members has existed, but not on a proper statutory basis.  Problems in relation to its administration led to industrial relations disputes and confrontations on a number of occasions, involving issues such as whether the Deputy&mdash; Deputies have had individual secretaries since 1982&mdash;or the State was the employer.  Either way the status and basis on which the system was administered was loosely linked to Article 15.15 of the Constitution which describes the delivery of services to Deputies and Senators as a facility.</P>
    <P>The Government was advised that it was necessary to put the system on a statutory basis in order to improve the arrangements and to reach a satisfactory conclusion with the secretarial assistants representing all parties and Independents. This is why the matter is covered by the legislation.  It is an enabling provision which will not deal with terms and conditions of employment. It will just provide the legal basis on which people will be able to negotiate their terms and conditions of employment from time to time. Members are aware that discussions have been ongoing for some time in this area.  I hope we are <Col N="1300" /> close to a resolution of this matter which has been the source of conflict on a number of occasions.  I assure Members on all sides that the enactment of this enabling provision does not in any way pre-empt the negotiating position of the management of the staff in this area.</P>
    <P>The issue of the indemnification of employees and the extraordinary liability exposure that currently exists was alluded to at some length in the debate in the other House.  This matter came to a head following an industrial accident which could have happened to anybody working in the Oireachtas for any particular group or political party.  However, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was willing to offer the information herself.  A person working for her suffered an industrial accident during her work and she will never be able to work again because one of her arms is partially paralysed.  When she sought compensation in the normal way, it emerged the employer's liability was not the State's, which paid her salary, or Leinster House, which provided the place of employment.  It was Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and the Fianna Fáil Party.  That was never the intent of the legislation or the administrative processes put in place in respect of it.  Therefore, section 4 deals with the indemnification of all people who have secretarial assistants, supervisors, etc., working for them.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the speed and alacrity with which the Seanad has addressed this legislation.  I know there is disquiet in this House at the apparent haste with which we introduced this measure.  It was not because we wanted to get something through by way of subterfuge nor because we had not made provision for something.  Neither did we want to obscure public knowledge of the legislation. I have taken a public stance in the Dáil and chosen to take this measure through the Seanad.  I will take as much time as the House orders for the matter.</P>
    <P>The part of this Bill that has attracted all the publicity relates to the extra allowance for parliamentary parties in Leinster House.  Going back 15 years, the Labour Party argued that there should be State funding similar to that in all 15 countries in the EU with the exception of Britain. The newly emerging democracies of Eastern Europe such as Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland also have provisions for State funding of political parties, including provisions for election time.  There are various checks and balances in all of the systems but there is a common principle.  It is that the democratic process should be encouraged, transparent, open to all citizens' participation and it should not be open to distortion or manipulation by any group, class or individual by virtue of excessive monetary or economic power.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent we had that up to 1965.  If one goes into the history of the limited franchise of the last century, one finds, for example, it was an offence to buy a prospective voter a drink. That would probably disqualify every Member of the House but there were then 300 to 500 electors <Col N="1301" /> in particular constituencies.  In T.P. O'Connor's book, <i>Parnell and the Irish Movement</i>, T.P. O'Connor was the only Irish Nationalist MP elected to the Houses of Westminister from a Liverpool constituency.  The other members of Parnell's parliamentary party came from Ireland.  He goes into great detail on the allegations and charges of corruption against an MP called Keogh from the constituency of Westmeath who was based in Athlone.</P>
    <P>Buying votes and the associated corruption is not new and goes back to the time of limited franchises. As the Acting Chairman may be aware, these were male franchises.  Up to 1965, the first general election I participated in as a foot soldier, there was a restraint on how much could be spent in elections.  It was subsequently removed by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Haughey.  Arthur Mitchell was director of elections for Michael O'Leary, the successful candidate, and I recall him struggling with the accounts which had to be returned to the returning officer of Dublin city, the City Sheriff.  Since 1965 concern has been expressed by different groups at different times which culminated in the controversies about the 1992 election and which suggested that the process of politics had to be put on a different footing. To be partisan, the Labour Party, of which I am Deputy Leader, campaigned on a slogan of &ldquo;Ethics in Government and justice in economics&rdquo;. A number of measures were part of our programme for the consolidation of ethics in Government.  There was ethics in office legislation, the freedom of information proposal which is to be published on Monday and the electoral Bill that was to deal with funding of political parties.  It would deal with funding during election time, caps on expenditure and funding for parties between Oireachtas elections.</P>
    <P>I go into this extensive history to nail the suggestion that, burning the midnight oil during the declining days of December in the penultimate year of a general election, we got a sudden rush of blood to the head and decided to write ourselves big cheques.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Electoral Bill was initiated in the Dáil but stalled in committee because, between agreeing it in Cabinet and the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, publishing it, we had a change in administration.  We also had the Supreme Court judgment known as the McKenna judgment.  That fundamentally altered the basis on which that Bill was constructed.  The judgment said in effect we could not distinguish between parties and Dáil Deputies in general elections but each candidate had to be treated on an equal basis and we could not give money for political parties out of the Oireachtas allowance. It meant that if we wanted to increase the Oireachtas allowance for parliamentary purposes, we would have to ensure the proceedings of the allowance to parliamentary parties would be limited and restricted for <i>bona fide</i> party activity.  In essence, we were obliged to return to the drawing board following the McKenna judgment because <Col N="1302" /> of that judgment's implications.  Members will be familiar with the controversy that surrounded the divorce referendum and affected, in part, the way the bail referendum was subsequently conducted by the Government.</P>
    <P>We said we wanted to give political parties the kind of money we had always intended to give them and to do so on a basis that would be seen as equitable, fair and as addressing the concerns of ethics in office, access to the parliamentary process and, in particular, equality of access. Deputy Howlin announced a three part package some 10 days ago of which this legislation forms the middle part.  I will describe the other two parts first to give Members a comprehensive picture.</P>
    <P>The proposal by way of new amendments to the existing electoral Bill which is before a Dáil committee is that there would be a limit of £18,000 on what a candidate can spend in a general election as a prospective Deputy whether the candidate is independent representing no group other than himself, or a member of a political party.  If the candidate saves the deposit, this is the threshold of qualification and the candidate can then reclaim up to a maximum of £5,000 from the taxpayer provided he produces vouched receipts.  The £18,000 will have to be administered in the following way, as per a very strict legal interpretation given to us by the Attorney General. Political candidates running on a party ticket in a constituency can decide that they will only spend £10,000 each.  That will release a sum of £16,000 which can be spent nationally by their party.  Parties will draw up a budget based on the number of candidates they field in the 41 constituencies and will then decide what portion of the £18,000 will be retained for the national campaign and what portion will be spent locally.  The accounts of the party, nationally and locally, must be lodged with the Electoral Commission at the end of an election.  There will be a series of penalties and fines associated with breaches of expenditure.</P>
    <P>The philosophy behind this is clear and this House will have an opportunity to debate it in detail.  It is exclusively for election purposes and designed to ensure that participation in the electoral process is not confined, as it currently is in the United States and increasingly in other jurisdictions without proper funding of political parties, to people who are either independent, independent and wealthy or wealthy.  Being wealthy means one is also independent.  There is also a limit on what can be spent, something which did not exist before.  That is the first part of a three component package upon which the Government has decided.  Funding will be based on the Lower House and this is not intended to show disrespect to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We then asked how parties handle their affairs and how one deals with the issue of funding political parties.  I will return to the issue of donations at the end of this exposition.  Political parties are currently funded between Dáil elections <Col N="1303" /> by the provision of a leaders' allowance decided upon by Mr. de Valera who had either the foresight, wisdom or a combination of both never to express it in any Estimates which go before the House.  It is taken out of the Central Fund.  A leader is not obliged to account for it.  It is paid in instalments during the year and is designed for a two and a half party system.  It is based in favour of the Opposition on the correct assumption that parties in Government have the support of the infrastructure of office, now reinforced by the provision of programme managers and special advisers.</P>
    <P>We were advised on foot of the McKenna judgment that the party leader's allowance was probably unconstitutional in that it gave taxpayers' money to political parties which were not accountable for how it was spent and it could be used to assist the financing of political parties' head offices.  It could, therefore, be open to legal challenge by a disaffected citizen or defeated election candidate on the grounds that, on foot of the McKenna judgment, a candidate had the benefit, directly or indirectly, of taxpayers' money to the disadvantage of the plaintiff.  The same legal frailty was associated with secretarial assistants because there was no statutory basis for them.</P>
    <P>As an election year was approaching with a crowded legislative programme, problems which had already been identified had to be addressed because they could have left the election process open to challenge.  The current allocation of moneys in the party leader's allowance which is unaccountable and comes out of the Central Fund is approximately £580,000.  I will make the figures available to Deputies and Senators during the debate and they can be examined in detail tomorrow on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>To address the second component of the package, the financing of political parties during the life of the Oireachtas, we have decided to put the parliamentary Oireachtas allowance on a statutory basis payable to the parliamentary leaders of parties because it must be made payable to a designated person.  There are also provisions for paying Independent Deputies.  It will be payable quarterly and can be used only for parliamentary activities and not for electoral purposes, especially the funding of political parties.  This does not preclude a political party from providing services for a parliamentary party which can be paid for out of the parliamentary leader's allowance. However, the allowance will be transparent, accountable and clear which it is not at present. If the Bill is passed into law, it will also be legal which is not the current situation.  Sums of money were negotiated on the basis of what political parties reckoned they needed to operate.  Contributions will be limited.  In summary, the second component of the financing package is to provide guaranteed and regular funding for the operation of political parties during the life of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> The advice of the Attorney General on foot of the McKenna judgment was that a distinction could not be made in law without being open to challenge between a citizen who stood for election and received a mandate in terms of votes but was not elected and one who was elected.  The Attorney General, the only legal adviser to whom the Government can listen, said there was another category of citizen that must be addressed if the first two components were addressed.  Political organisations or groups of people who stand for election and get support must have equality of treatment with other groups which benefit from the first and second components of the package.</P>
    <P>To address this, a third component is contained in the Electoral Bill, 1996, which will be introduced by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin.  That component is State funding for political parties as political parties, irrespective of whether they are in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>How will this function?  As it is currently designed and written in the Bill, subject to whatever changes both Houses make, a fund of £1 million per annum will be available to support political parties, payable in quarterly instalments on the basis of the percentage support they received from the electorate at the previous general election.  This provision will not, therefore come into play until after the next general election which must take place in 1997.  There will be a qualifying threshold of 2 per cent of the vote. The concept and precedent of qualifying thresholds is clear in this jurisdiction in that we have the requirement of a deposit and the forfeiture of that deposit if 25 per cent of the quota is not reached.  That knocks on the head the idea that people would instantly form political groupings to stand at elections to get the money.</P>
    <P>The qualifying threshold has two components. The first is the one to which I have just referred, obtaining an aggregate minimum support of 2 per cent in a general election.  The second requirement is that the group be a registered political party.  There is much jurisprudence associated with this.  Many actions have been taken by groups and organisations who wanted to register as a political party.  Some were successful, others were not.  Some of us are old enough to recall Seán Dublin Bay Loftus's herculean attempts to get the Christian Democratic Party of Ireland registered on his behalf and on behalf of two other people, one of whom lived in Donegal. There is therefore a test as to what constitutes an organised political party against which there is now a body of jurisprudence.</P>
    <P>What would happen with this £1 million based on the last general election?  Our calculations suggest that Kevin Street or Parnell Square Sinn Féin would get some money as it received over 2 per cent of the vote in the last general election.  The Green Party, which has a representative in the Dáil, would also get money.  Christian Solidarity, which I understand is now a registered political party, could also qualify if it received the vote <Col N="1305" /> Nora Bennis did in the European elections.  We would then have at least one and possibly two registered political parties which demonstrated that they could get over 2 per cent of the vote in a national election, which would receive £20,000 for the four or five years during the period of that election.  At the next general election they would retain that amount, lose it if they were below the threshold or increase it.</P>
    <P>This in essence is the overall approach to the funding of political parties by the State.  The total cost in a non-election year will be £2.7 million. Leaving aside the capital account of £1,500 million, the annual current account budget of this country is £13,038 million and out of that sum, we are looking for £2.6 million to fund political parties.</P>
    <P>How are political parties funded at the moment?  At present their money comes from mandatory membership fees, voluntary subscriptions by friends and supporters, donations from corporate Ireland or particular organisations such as trade unions in the case of the Labour Party and by levies on public representatives.  For example, in the Labour Party I, as a Minister, pay a monthly standing order of £125 towards party funds; Ministers of State pay £110, Deputies £90 and Senators £75.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure my colleague in the Lower House that this will not change.  On top of this, funding for political parties, at election time in particular, has come from large corporate donations.  In the presidential election campaign Fianna Fáil spent about £1 million.  In general elections the two large parties spend between £800,000 and £1.5 million.  That money does not fall from the trees; it comes from corporate donations.  In the past it was given by individual business people who had a particular commitment to a party but, increasingly, it has come from the corporate sector.  Many of these are public companies and a decision is taken by a board to allocate, for example, £50,000 on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to the political parties.</P>
      <P>Individuals also give substantial amounts to political parties.  We never hear of this and it is often done in anticipation of political favours.  It is obvious from the public anger displayed during the beef tribunal and the Dunne saga that this system of funding is totally unacceptable.  The Government always argued that it was so but the perception, or the reality, of people buying favours through private donations was unacceptable and it was against this background that we argued for State funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In return for this funding we believe that there should be a transparent declaration of contributions made by individuals both to candidates and to parties.  The Bill requires every donation over £500 to a candidate to be declared by the donor and the candidate and every donation over £4,000 to a party to be declared likewise.  The <Col N="1306" /> details as to how this would function have yet to be decided.  For example, in the case of individual donations, to whom does the donor declare the money?  The candidate, in accounts submitted to the Electoral Commission, would outline spending and expenses of, say, £10,000 and, having saved their deposit, would receive £5,000.  These accounts would also outline the sources of income.</P>
    <P>When a company makes a donation that money would have to be declared in accounts submitted to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is argued that the taxpayer is implicitly and inadvertently subsidising many of the corporate donations to political parties.  These parties seek and receive donations which the donor corporations can offset against taxation.  I say this without reference to the Dunne controversy.  I am not suggesting that this happened in that case even though I am speaking under privilege.</P>
    <P>I would be happy to go into this area in detail on Committee Stage.  However, the Government has been guided by the intensity of the debate of the last three or four weeks, by a policy decision going back years and a published Bill which is over two years old.  This is not a midnight raid as we approach Christmas.</P>
    <P>Soon after I became Minister for Finance I received representations from Members of both Houses and from all parties, particularly those representing provincial constituencies, that they were prohibited from claiming overnight expenses on a Thursday when they were forced by business to stay in Dublin longer than the regulations allowed for.  As a consequence they were financially losing out.  I looked at the detail with the assistance of Department of Finance personnel and the Houses of the Oireachtas and the representations made were proven to be accurate. I decided to change the system to make provision for overnight allowances because, in many cases, extra committee work resulted in Members staying until Friday.  The cost of this alteration will be £300,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>I also received representations about the delay and unnecessary bureaucracy involved in the administration of the telephone allowance.  Up to a maximum of £2,000 of verified costs in telephones would be allowed.  This required people submitting accounts which was taking up too much administrative time which could be put to better use.  To move from a vouched expense to an allowance system and to avoid the hazard of its being deemed income, I had to have a proper statutory basis to pay the telephone allowance. Following extensive discussion with the parliamentary draftsman it was necessary to put the overnight allowance for a Thursday on a statutory basis also.  That is why the sections are in the Bill. I have already addressed the question of the secretarial staff which will also have a statutory basis and the legal indemnification of people who might work in the Oireachtas for a Member and who under the present system do not have the protection of proper insurance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> I would have liked to have had the legislation published and enacted sooner.  Senators will recall that on two occasions I had meetings on a Saturday afternoon with the three party leaders, not because we have nothing else to do on Saturday afternoons but it was the only time we could meet.  Given the itineraries of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, in particular, whose involvement was essential, it did not prove possible to have the meetings earlier.</P>
    <P>I would have liked to have circulated the Bill in November in the normal way because we have nothing to hide.  However, that was not possible. The Bill was agreed politically last week and subject to changes in the draft it was available late on Tuesday.  I know some Senators, my esteemed cousin included, have expressed understandable concern at why the Bill has appeared to fall from the sky, so to speak.  There is a view that any measures associated with politicians' expenses are somehow suspect and are only discussed because there is some cause for complaint or scandal. That, in part, explains the publicity the Bill has attracted.  It received publicity on Pat Kenny's radio show this morning, for example, yet he refuses to tell the public what he earns.  There is an extraordinary juxtaposition in interest particularly from journalists and commentators who refuse to reveal their earnings yet have a voyeuristic obsession with what we are paid.</P>
    <P>I am a passionate republican and a defender of democratic politics.  I agree with Bernard Crick that it is a noble profession and people should be encouraged to participate it.  The rates of remuneration in salary terms is one issue but this Bill does not deal with salaries.  It is about having the resources to do the job.  Two Deputies from Galway spoke of having telephone bills of £6,000 to set against an allowance of £2,000.  We are in the midst of negotiations with many categories of workers about what they are paid.  Nobody is arguing about what we are paid.  We are honoured to volunteer and to be elected to serve in the Oireachtas.  However, to do the job we need basic resources.  As a minimum we need to be paid what it costs us to go from A to B and to have paid the cost of the telephone calls we have to make.</P>
    <P>Our political parties, particularly those in Opposition, need proper resources to match those which Ministers have at their disposal &mdash; an entire Civil Service of dedicated and non-partisan professionals.  They are my resource to prepare legislative measures which the House may wish to challenge.  How can Members do so without resources?  They may get the resources in one of two ways.  They may seek money from the corporate sector to challenge legislation but that sector will want to know what legislation is involved. Alternatively, they can go to the taxpayer and seek funds to try to make democracy work on the taxpayers' behalf.  If taxpayers do not like the way democracy works they can fire the Members. Members of the Oireachtas are the original contract <Col N="1308" /> workers and they are not on zero hour contracts or 48 hour a week contracts.  I make no apology for making adequate provision for the funding of political parties.</P>
    <P>The Constitution does not recognise political parties, although one cannot run a democracy in a complex industrialised society without political parties.  The founding fathers of the United States thought they could do without political parties&mdash; the variants of the Whigs and Tories from the mother of parliaments.  They thought they could have an assembly of individuals addressing the values, issues and concerns of the representatives best enunciated in the Edmund Burke's famous address to the electors of Bristol.  However, such a system would prove inoperable.  It would mean, for example, there would be mayhem if the Ceann Comhairle had to regulate 165 Deputies on the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Political parties are the skeleton of parliamentary democracy yet they are not provided for in the Constitution.  The concept was not all that fashionable in the 1930s.  There were then two strains of thought&mdash;corporate fascist Germany and Italy, soon followed by Spain and Portugal, and the party state Marxist-Leninism of the Soviet Union, soon to be followed by the central European countries.  Democracy was not necessarily the only intellectual option in the 1930s, on the left and on the right.  That is one of the reasons political parties are absent from the Constitution. This absence has made it more difficult to provide legislation to support political parties. That is why we have chosen to use the device of having the allowance paid to the leaders of the parliamentary party.</P>
    <P>This legislation must be seen in the context of the provisions for elections on the one hand and the provisions for support for registered political parties who get 2 per cent or more of the vote in general elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  The Minister has dealt with it openly and explained it in detail and I congratulate him on his presentation. I could probably talk for an hour on the reasons the Bill is needed.</P>
      <P>I complained to the Minister, through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, before the summer recess and he replied by letter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges indicating his intention to introduce the legislation in this session.  I do not consider the legislation was rushed and Senator Quinn is entitled to make known his views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do a good job for the party and for the House. I usually travel home on Friday mornings having worked until Thursday night.  The reason I complained about the overnight was that on a Thursday our secretaries normally leave at 4.30 p.m. which gives them time to cash their cheques and go home a half hour earlier.  I have no complaint with the way Senator Manning runs the House as Leader.  It is perfectly run.  I know the problems <Col N="1309" /> in trying to get legislation ready for the following week.</P>
    <P>Even though I have finished work at 2 p.m. in the Seanad I must then work until almost 5 o'clock to produce the Order of Business in consultation with Senator Manning.  There are times when I have to check if there will be a vote and who I will pair for next week.  That is the normal running of Seanad business.  The letter I produce advises Senators of the business for next week. It tells them whether a three-line Whip will be imposed or whether it will be an easy week if someone needs a pair.</P>
    <P>When I claimed my allowances I had worked on Seanad business on my own in the office up to 7 o'clock on a Thursday night.  So, I was hurt by the reply&mdash;although it was not the officials' fault&mdash;saying that as the Seanad finished at 3.30 p.m. they were not in a position to grant me an overnight allowance.  I complained about that matter before the summer recess because, as Chief Whip, I felt we were not being treated properly.</P>
    <P>As for the expenses and other items in this package, like other political party members I travel to cumann meetings.  The furthest cumann meeting I have to attend is at Staigue Fort which is 93 miles from my home in Dingle.  It is almost the same distance as travelling from Dingle to Nenagh.  The Minister knows that part of the country.  I must travel from Dingle to Milltown, Killorglin and Killarney, across Moll's Gap and down into Kenmare before reaching Staigue Fort. That is the furthest I have to travel, and I go there once or twice a year.  However, I must also travel to other cumainn in Caherdaniel and Waterville which are nearly two hours from Dingle.  While they may be only 80 or 90 miles away it takes two hours to get there because there are no motorways. It hurts me to see the remarks made in the newspapers.  I am not a crook, nor am I corrupt. I do not travel the county for my own benefit but &mdash;as I originally set out to do when I entered politics&mdash;to try to improve the lot of local people.  That was the only thing that brought me into politics.  I succeeded in being elected to the Seanad in 1981 and 1982.  Nobody saw me at home at that time.  I ran for election to the Dáil in 1982 and when I lost I ran in another Seanad election which rolled over into 1983.  When I went home I did not recognise my teenage son. Because of the amount of time I had spent in getting elected and progressing my political career I was not at home much in those years.  When I arrived home late my children were in bed.  They went to school in the morning and when they came back I was gone.  That is the way life was.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not go far enough.  I am not a begrudger but I cannot think why I should have a car phone simply for the use of the State.  I do not need a car phone but it is the only way people can contact me during the 20 hours a week I spend travelling by car.  It takes me five or six hours to go home.  I have never been able to drive to Dingle in four hours.  One would have to break <Col N="1310" /> many rules and regulations to do so.  On average and without too much traffic it takes me five and a half hours, including a quick stop for tea, to get home.</P>
    <P>I seldom make a call on my car phone because calls are charged at trunk rates, yet I pay a £20 monthly rental plus 21 per cent VAT simply to do the business of the State.  However, it makes me available to Senators who ring me on the way home to arranging pairing for the following week. When travelling to the Seanad recently I received a call from Athens.  As Senator Manning knows, three weeks ago when we were voting in the new Cathaoirleach, people on a foreign delegation wanted to know if the pairing position could continue, which it could not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">

      <P>The funny thing was that the call did not come from a party colleague but from a Member of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go into the big money business and party funding.  To be truthful, we are treated disgracefully.  The Leaders and party Whips run this House without any help from civil servants.  I am not complaining about the Clerk of the Seanad or the Assistant Clerk who are top of the list.  The girls in the Seanad Office could not be more helpful but outside that we are trying to run important business on our own.  Is the Minister aware that in most cases three Senators must share the services of one secretary?  That situation is ludicrous.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to shout to every newspaper in the country that there is no allowance for Chief Whips or the Leader of the Opposition.  They should be entitled to an allowance.  There is a small allowance&mdash;I would call it a pittance&mdash; for the Leader of the House.  Like the Minister, nobody pushed me into politics.  I walked in and wanted it.  I am proud to have achieved something as a Member of the Seanad, no matter how small it may be.</P>
      <P>I have a car but my wife also needs a family car.  If I was not a Senator I would not need a second car.  Indeed, the last time I bought a new car was before I became involved in politics.  I could afford it then; I could not afford it now.  All I am saying is that I need a second car to do my business because if my wife and family want a proper life, they need a car too.  If I was not in Dublin on Seanad business, there would be no need for that.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to look into a couple of matters and I do not care if the newspapers say I am looking for something for myself or for somebody else as we do not know where we will be this time next year.  There is a need for allowances for the general staff of the Leader and the Chief Whip of the Government parties and for the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation in telling the Minister that I must send letters to 23 people weekly.  Members <Col N="1311" /> of the other House are treated in a different manner. The convenor of a committee of the other House will get an allowance for notifying Members on a number of occasions but we must do that on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>What is being said in the newspapers about the Minister and politicians is scurrilous.  I know he called on members of the press in the Dáil yesterday to come down, take over his job and set themselves up for election.  He mentioned the criticism on radio of people who will not reveal what they earn.  One can see from my file in this House that I have a half acre site and a small fishing boat in Dingle, County Kerry.  I do not know what these other people have and they are more often in the public eye.</P>
    <P>I am not biased when I speak about politicians. Every politician who stood for election or sat in either House of the Oireachtas came with the same ambition as I, the Minister, Senator Manning and all the rest of us had and to be treated in this manner is scurrilous.  If they want to know what I earn, I have a small private income from a boat.  The can examine it, they can follow me home to Dingle and they can come with me to meetings.</P>
    <P>The Minister and everybody involved in politics knows that we go out at Christmas to cumann meetings and meet people who have been generous with their support; I do not mean generosity in monetary terms.</P>

The next time I saw him he was in Brussels and the following morning he was meeting President Clinton.  Let us look at it this way: if the Irish soccer team travelled to a foreign country, they would go out about a week or ten days before the match because they might suffer from jet lag but politicians are supposed to go from A to B and sleep on the aeroplane.  That is the way their lives are run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not begrudge what some Members of this House have and their salaries are greater than the Taoiseach's.  A proper restructuring should be undertaken and it should start at the top by treating <Col N="1312" /> the Taoiseach in a proper manner by giving him a realistic salary for the work he does.  The Tánaiste, Ministers, Ministers of State, etc., should be tackled from the top down and not from the bottom up.  We received small increases &mdash;5 and 10 per cent&mdash;over the years and they amount to a small sum.</P>
    <P>I am glad I did not lose my temper because I came into the House to say things which I would probably regret and I was advised by some of my colleagues in the other House to refrain.  I have said enough.  I have made my case.  I welcome the allowances which the Minister is proposing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I did not go into the matter of money for parties. I know that if all parties gather around the table and agree to something in principle, it is all right.  As the Minister explained it, it seems very fair.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and this Bill to the House.  We heard from the Minister for Finance one of the best speeches I have had the privilege to hear in my time in politics because it combined passion with a great grasp of the subject, great clarity and a willingness to defend what is utterly defensible, that is, the contents of this Bill.  I suspect there will be little coverage tomorrow of what he had to say.  It was not so much the speech but his extempore contribution over 45 minutes without a note which was fine because of its content and honesty.</P>
      <P>These are areas from which we tend to shy away.  The greater the amount of open discussion, the better because people can see the reality of how most people conduct their business, as Senator Fitzgerald outlined in a fine contribution, the pressures under which they work and the very meagre financial reward.  I would advise any Member with young children interested in making money not to enter politics.  One might advise them to try and get into politics at a later stage in life when they are secure.  If a person is looking for security he should work for the bank or do an MBA; he should not think of going into politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a short Bill and I intend to be brief. There is only one question of principle in the Bill and that is the State funding of political parties. Section 2, which deals with overnight allowances, and the sections dealing with telephone allowances are straightforward.  They try to redress, in a small way, an inequity and a wrong which has existed for some time especially in the case of overnight allowances.  I can see it.  I am in a privileged position in one sense in that I probably live marginally closer to the House than Senator Henry&mdash;we both probably live within ten minutes' walking distance of Leinster House&mdash; so I do not have overnight allowances.  Certainly, if I did, they would be news to my wife since I am certainly not entitled to overnight allowances. I can look at the picture in a disinterested way. Everything Senator Fitzgerald says is correct. <Col N="1313" /> Frequently, while I have waited as Leader of the House on a Thursday or, on occasion, Friday, for Departments to come through with details of legislation which the House is to take, Senator Fitzgerald has had to wait around and has then been forced to drive to Dingle, County Kerry, or stay overnight at his own expense.  He has been involved in legitimate business at the centre of the life of this Parliament and his anger is justified because he, and many other Senators who live some distance away, have not been treated well.</P>
    <P>One colleague, who had a heart by-pass recently and needed to take it easy, was obliged to leave here on a wet murky evening.  He was not entitled to an overnight allowance even though he had been in his office for a couple of hours after the close of business doing political work so he was obliged to drive 120 miles home, thereby putting his health in danger.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be personal about this but many Members of the Oireachtas live on a financial tightrope. We go into great debt at times of election and after 1981-1982 period when three elections were held in a row, people had to remortgage their houses and went into enormous debt.  I do not have huge financial problems but it took me about four years to recover from three general elections and one Seanad election over a period of 18 months. We do not talk about these things.  It is difficult to listen to some of the new moral arbiters of our time as they lay down the law about everybody else in public life while refusing to disclose their own earnings, arrangements, the appearance money they earn and so forth.  Sections of the media are generating a very sour anti-politician ethos and that should worry us.</P>
    <P>I am a politician.  I can say what I think with a degree of objectivity because I have come from academic life.  I am impressed by the quality of the people I have served with in both Houses, their grasp of a wide range of issues, their breath of knowledge which would put most professors to shame, their common sense, their feeling for the people, and their ability to devote themselves to bettering the lot of their people and their locality. It impresses anyone who looks at this work in a serious way.  However, this is not widely recognised. There is a danger when we create an anti-politician ethos that all sorts of destructive groups will come to prominence.  Public life would not be improved by this.  Our political parties and those who come from independent traditions in this country have had a great deal of learning and experience invested in them by their predecessors which is at the service of the people through those political parties and politicians.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald is absolutely right in regard to the overnight allowances and the telephone system.  What is being provided was long promised. This matter was discussed at the Committee for Procedure and Privilges very early this year and on more than one occasion.  We were aware that the Minister intended to bring in these <Col N="1314" /> measures.  Each party and group has its representative on the Committee for Procedure and Priviliges. I conveyed this information to all of my members and I am sure it was widely available. The Minister explained about the indemnification aspect of the Bill and there can be no argument about it.</P>
    <P>The only point of principle in this Bill is whether the State should fund political parties. The Minister is correct when he says the Constitution is silent on the question of political parties. It is almost as if it was a subject which was not spoken of in polite company in the 1930s.  The Constitution is specific on the number of members of the Cabinet, the re-election of the Ceann Comhairle and a range of other issues.  It may even be too intrusive in some cases. However, on the question of the political parties it is silent, as if they did not exist.  In a sense that means that our public life is based on a myth.</P>
    <P>Curiously, the west German constitution came into being just 12 years after our Constitution and in their constitution the Germans recognised that political parties are at the very centre of parliamentary democracy and political life.  The Germans did what we are now beginning to do and must complete.  They built a framework of laws around the way in which political parties operate. These cover the democratic content and aspirations of political parties and the way in which they are funded and must disclose how their money is spent.  West Germany also took the view that parties are central to democracy so the State funds political parties, pays for research, and does what is needed to make them fully professional. As the Minister said, this is now a fact of life in every country in Europe apart from the UK and Ireland.</P>
    <P>Many of us have had an opportunity to help some of the emerging parliaments in eastern and central Europe.  We have been at seminars and have been there to advise them.  We see the importance which these people attach to strong political parties and their grasp of the principle that these parties must be properly funded so members are not distracted by the constant burden of fundraising.  We all do a fair amount of fundraising.  It goes on all the time and is an enormous distraction to elected politicians and ordinary members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also a deterrent to new members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed.  As the Minister said, State funding for political parties ensures that we are not dependent on major donors and there is an openness and clarity about what happens.  I make no apology for saying that political parties should be funded by the State.  Walter Bagheot said in the 19th century &ldquo;Without political parties there is no parliament, there are no politics&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this State was founded in the 1920s, Kevin O'Higgins and others hoped that our parliamentary system would develop without what <Col N="1315" /> was called &ldquo;the tyranny of the Whip&rdquo; and the dominance of political parties.  They hoped that the Free State Parliament would have been an assembly of largely independent people, that there would be a great debate on every subject, that every issue would be discussed on its merits and finally a conclusion would be reached.  They discovered in a matter of weeks that for a Government and the State to get their business done there was a need for political parties.  This is not a negative thing.</P>
    <P>Political parties provide the agenda at election times.  They develop policies between elections. Political parties recruit people, train and groom them.  There is a sifting process through which people of ability can rise in political parties.  Political parties have traditions which are also important in the life of a State which lives off its inherited history.  I could talk for hours on the justification for political parties and on the vital role they play.  Political parties are democratic. There is no small group sitting in a board room in Middle Abbey Street deciding that it will make or break a politician.  Political parties are answerable to their members.  There are no small groups which decide what public policy should be and in whose interests it should be carried out.</P>
    <P>I make no excuse whatsoever for a defence of political parties or for saying with passion that political parties should be funded.  There should be an electoral law which does all of the things we want, which ensures that funding is open and transparent, that the uses to which it is put are seen by the public.  If, as the Minister said, the public does not like a party, it has the ultimate right to throw us out, and it does.  Some parties become redundant over the course of time.  Some parties grow, others wax and wane; that is life. However, as long as parties are at the centre of our political life they should be funded adequately to do their job.</P>
    <P>I have heard much nonsense about State funding. The State funds golf courses.  It funded part of the Cork Park redevelopment.  There is hardly a group in the country that is not in receipt of some sort of State funding.  For example, the National Women's Council, an excellent organisation, is funded because there is a need for that group to pursue particular policies which are in the public interest.  Surely political parties are at the very centre of the political life of the State? The need for funding of political parties is unanswerable.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions the Minister spoke about politics being a noble profession.  James Dillon always referred to politics as being the greatest of all vocations after the priesthood.  In his memoir he recalls standing with his father in 1918 outside Monica Duff's in Ballaghdreen. John Dillon was being opposed in the seat he had held for 40 years by Éamon de Valera.  One political world was collapsing and a new political world was coming into being.  John Dillon said to James, who was then just 16 years of age, that the previous <Col N="1316" /> day he had returned the last evicted tenants to their land and said that on the next day those people would vote to throw him out of Parliament and that was political life.  He said that politics is the greatest, after the priesthood, of all the vocations, but never to expect gratitude in politics. On that note, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. F. Quinn Mr. F. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, and not only because of the very interesting speech he made.  It is a shame that the nation's attention is focused on another issue because it has missed one of the finest political speeches I have heard. I say this because the Minister's contribution was unscripted.  I am aware that a script was available, I have not had an opportunity to peruse it to see if all aspects were covered, but I understand the Minister dealt with a great number of the issues without reference to his script.  Senator Manning referred to the passion with which the Minister spoke.  It must be stated that he also made a very cogent argument.  I congratulate the Minister and I am proud of the blood relationship we share.</P>
      <P>The Minister's contribution influenced me because I was unsure where I stood on many of the areas covered by the Bill.  Many of my attitudes in respect of political funding have changed and I recognise the challenges the nation must face in this regard.  The Minister provided an explanation of what he referred to as the three components which I had not understood and to which I must now give serious consideration.  I do not disagree with the principles, aims and objectives of the Bill.  The case made by the Minister should be widely circulated and I hope it will be understood by those who have not given it the attention it deserves.  For this reason I must express my concerns which are emphasised by the fact that the attention of the nation is focused on a matter being dealt with in the Lower House. There is a need to present to the electorate the correct message about the political process.  That is my concern and it is underpinned by the comments of Senator Fitzgerald.</P>
      <P>My colleagues and I are honoured, as Members of this House, to represent our fellow citizens.  It is clear that Senator Fitzgerald's words were spoken from the heart and I will not attempt to comment in that regard.  Senator Manning stated that he feels privileged.  I am certainly privileged because I live near Dublin and do not experience the same problems as Senators who live in other parts of the country.  I have an income which makes me independent of the need to worry about the financial tightrope to which Senator Manning referred.  I would be ashamed to comment on that aspect of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, care must be taken when we deal with the question of Members' incomes in both Houses.  I disagree with the Minister regarding the situation to which he referred in respect of Pat Kenny.  It seems that members of the media who refuse to provide details of their income are in a different situation because they negotiate their salaries with another party.  We negotiate <Col N="1317" /> our incomes among ourselves and we must be very careful when debating the income we receive &mdash;be that an income in respect of salary, expenses, allowances, etc.</P>
    <P>Unlike Senator Manning, who stated it was common knowledge that the Bill was coming before the House, I was unaware of its introduction. People may criticise my inability to know everything that is taking place but I was unaware that the Bill was to be debated.  My criticism involves the question of speed.  I do not believe the Minister provided an adequate explanation in this regard.  He stated that he would like to have published the Bill sooner and went on to explain that the Government has been extremely busy.  I agree with him but this sends the wrong message to the nation.</P>
    <P>When the Order of Business commenced at 2.30 p.m. yesterday in this House, I was still seeking a copy of the Bill but I could not obtain one. I was informed that Cabinet had only discussed it at 11 a.m. and it would not be available.  I understand that copies had been available but were withdrawn until Cabinet made its decision.  The Cabinet made its decision during early yesterday afternoon and I finally obtained a copy of the Bill at approximately 3.15 p.m.  Last evening the Bill was rushed into the Lower House and passed within two hours.  I understand why people outside the Houses expressed vehement concern about the way those arranging their own income rushed the legislation through so quickly.  This morning we were informed that this House would debate the Bill today and I am delighted the Leader responded to my concerns and stated it would not be rushed through.  Item No. 5 on the Order of Business involves a request to the President to sign the Bill when passed by the House but the Leader responded to my request to take Committee Stage tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the message we are sending to the nation.  It sometimes takes years to have Bills passed which deal with other areas but legislation concerning our own income is passed quickly.  A number of weeks ago I expressed concern about the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and I was intent on arguing long and hard in respect of one aspect of it. It was made clear to me that, if I managed to delay the debate and ensure the Bill was not passed before Christmas, a £500 million deal in connection with the Telecom Éireann's new strategic alliance could be threatened.  I stated that there were three weeks for the Bill to be returned to the Dáil if it were amended by the Seanad.  I was informed that it would be almost impossible to return the Bill to the Dáil before Christmas. What happened?  Time was suddenly found to introduce the Bill now before us.</P>
    <P>I accept that some of the details we discussed may have been published two years ago but the Bill itself was not published at that time.  I appreciate the Minister's explanation with regard to funding parties and the way such funding is to <Col N="1318" /> be provided.  We will have an interesting Committee Stage debate in that regard.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the major reason for my objection to this legislation.  I do not object to the Bill in principle, I object to the aspect of retrospection. Each time we debate a Bill relating to increases or reductions in taxation or social welfare benefits we are informed that the provisions cannot be put in place immediately.  This cannot happen in respect of increases in taxation but in the case of duty the Minister for Finance will inform us that the changes will take effect from midnight on the evening in question.  When it comes to a reduction in taxation or an increase in social welfare allowances, we are informed that these cannot be implemented for a number of months.  However, we are now informed provisions relating to the incomes of political parties and Members will be backdated to 1 January last. We are setting an unacceptable standard and sending the wrong message to the people.  I believe we should reconsider our actions.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for the explanation but I must express deep concern about the speed with which the Bill is being dealt.  I recognise that we are being given an opportunity to debate it but I harbour a deeper concern that we are making an error if its provisions are made retrospective. We should consider instead the way we deal with matters which affect us.  I suggest that we will demean this House and the entire political process if we rush the Bill through and make it retrospective to 1 January last.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I congratulate him on his excellent speech.  I am proud to be a member of the same party.  He has taken on board what is a thorny issue, particularly when dealing with the media and those outside the Houses, and handled it well.  I stress that we are not talking about income for Members.  They will not receive one penny extra.  The matters being dealt with relate to expenses.  Mileage and overnight allowances must be paid.  Such expenses are paid to other people, including celebrities who open festivals and who charge accommodation costs to the committee which invites them, but we hear nothing about that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision relating to the payment of the overnight allowances on the night after Members attend the Houses.  I received a letter outlining the route I should take when going home.  It was like something one would get if one was involved in rally driving.  Stage one was to Portlaoise, stage two was to Cashel and stage three was to Cork and the final journey home was the last lap of the rally.  I was to drive at 35 to 55 miles per hour depending on weather conditions. When I get into my car to head for west Cork I often say I am off on a rally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I am to be in the House by 10.30 a.m., I must leave at about 8 a.m.  Provision was made for me to get home at 12 p.m. at night but how many people work until that hour?  Driving home is part of my work, I do not drive for the fun of it. <Col N="1319" /> Approximately three or fours years ago I asked someone who was an authority on the motor industry how much it would cost to have a car on the road and I was informed it would cost 55p per mile to keep a car on the road.  There is a big difference between expenses and income.</P>
    <P>Members will not gain from the telephone allowance.  We will get the same amount of money but the system will be less cumbersome. Journalists want to say we will get extra money but we will get £1,000 per year which amounts to less than £20 per week.  I must make telephone calls to the Department of Social Welfare office in Sligo, to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry offices in Castlebar and Portlaoise, to the Department of Education in Athlone and frequent calls to Dublin.  I do not have much change from £20 after one day not to mention one week.  The telephone allowance is inadequate.</P>
    <P>I must travel to Labour Party and community meetings in my constituency which stretches for 125 miles from Kinsale to the Dursey Sound for which I receive no travelling expenses despite what was mentioned in one of today's newspapers. There is no provision for constituency travel as far as I am aware.  An inspector of taxes told me I could not get income tax relief on my salary if I received secretarial assistance.  That is a matter which should be addressed.  If I want to employ somebody to work in my home, I should be entitled to income tax relief.</P>
    <P>The Minister handled very well the situation pertaining to political party funding.  I will not go into it since he made an excellent speech on the issue earlier.  State funding for political parties is necessary because he who pays the piper calls the tune.  Parties should not receive money from people who want to benefit from their contribution. If people are interested in a party and wish to give money, they should do so without strings attached.</P>
    <P>I refer to criticism being levelled at people in public office by the press.  We are great talking-points for radio and television programmes which is not right.  Often the amount we are paid does not compensate us for the work we do.  I enjoy working for the people in my constituency and being a Member of the Seanad and I should be properly recompensed for doing so.  The press never mentions constituency work.  I have yet to find somebody who will accompany me to clinics and party meetings to see what is done and the long distances which I must travel.  Elected members of county councils, corporations, town commissions and urban councils, etc., spend much of their spare time doing work for which they are not paid.  They only receive travelling expenses.</P>
    <P>I remember an occasion when a press correspondent attended a county council only until the question of conferences was raised.  He wanted to know where councillors were going and the cost of sending them to meetings.  The meeting dealt with the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds on housing and other matters but there was no mention of that in the newspaper the next day.  I congratulate the Minister on the fine job <Col N="1320" /> he is doing and on his excellent speech.  He has a great grasp of what is required to keep the country running properly.  If we want the right people in politics, they must be paid accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation and hope it will pass speedily through the Houses.  I thought it would have been convenient for us to pass it this evening and bring it with us on our visit to Uachtarán na Éireann so that the President could sign it in our presence.  I congratulate the Minister on his speech which I did not hear because I was listening to one in the other House but I gather it was a fine one which is what I would expect. This is a matter on which we are on a hiding to nothing.  We are an easy target.  We will lose in that we will be lambasted whether or not we defend ourselves.  I have no difficulty with that if this is a good spectator sport for the press and that is what it wants to do.</P>
      <P>The press subject us to reasonable and not unfair scrutiny but there are exceptions.  Some people who make snide indirect remarks and who are on good salaries would never in one hundred years present themselves for the humiliation of an electoral defeat or even the satisfaction of an electoral victory.  It is important to say we have a democracy for which people died.  It is worth preserving and paying for and it is good value. Thank God we have it because the alternatives are ones which do not bear contemplation.  There must be a sensible and equitable way to fund that democracy.</P>
      <P>We accept we work long hours and travel long distances.  The life is difficult in many respects but it is also rewarding.  It exposes us to people and influences which I would never have encountered if I had not become a practising politician.  It is a fulfilling life.  It must also be said that we enter politics voluntarily.  We know what is at stake when we enter politics.  Perhaps we do so from an old-fashioned, even defunct, ideal of service, a belief that we owe the State a service and that people should work for the State.  It is good to work for the State and we need not be defensive about it.  However, we volunteer for this life and enter it with our eyes open.</P>
      <P>I did not have a background in politics.  When the Minister and I were in college we were in different political parties.  His career blossomed while mine went into abeyance.  However, I came to politics with no political pedigree but because I thought it was something worth doing.  That probably gives one a more detached view than if one comes from a traditional political background.</P>
      <P>I discovered one extraordinary fact on my first day as a Senator in 1989.  I had not been in the Oireachtas buildings for 20 years when I was nominated to the Seanad so I knew little about how it worked.  When I was introduced to my secretary I asked her where was the PC.  She explained that she did not have a computer but a typewriter.  Then I asked about the fax machine. She said I had to go to the party offices if I wished to send a fax.  At that time all a Senator received was a hand held dictaphone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> I had come from a journalistic background, the same background as those who now criticise us. In that environment new technology was taken for granted.  One had a PC and fax machine on one's desk and a modem to transfer information. One had only to lift the telephone to have every source of information available.  However, in 1989 I wondered how the country was run when Members of the Oireachtas had to work in almost primitive circumstances.</P>
    <P>Look at the problem of research.  I have become the renaissance man.  Only Senator Honan and I represent our party in the Seanad. We must deal with every Bill that comes before the House.  I am now an expert on matters such as removing sand from the foreshore and the buoys in the channel below Waterford and New Ross.  I have acquired knowledge as a result of membership of this House which I would never have acquired and that is desirable.</P>
    <P>We must defend our democracy and ensure it is on stable foundations.  There is nothing wrong with private people making donations to political parties, even if the parties are also funded by the State.  If people wish to act improperly they will do so even if there is full State funding of political parties.  State funding will not exclude abuses and the abuses are no more evident here than they are anywhere else.</P>
    <P>I remember when the House debated the serious events in the sugar company.  At that time I said there must be a relationship between business and Government because it is in the interests of both the country and business.  It is the nature of the relationship which is at issue, not the fact of its existence.  It should be possible for business people to see a Minister if there are matters of serious national interest for the business community. It is appropriate that they should have access to Ministers and their officials.  The only question is where do the improprieties arise? They arise from abuses.  It is wrong for an individual to use money that is given for political purposes for his or her own use.  It is a different matter if money is given to individuals who give them to the parties.  In my experience, the money has always been handed over to either the local party organisation or the national organisation, depending on the specification under which it was donated.</P>
    <P>Senator Calnan made a number of valid points. The issue of secretarial support in one's constituency deserves consideration.  I accept our constituency is national but it should be possible for Senators, if they so wish, to have some of their secretarial support located in their home constituency. Senator Calnan also spoke about tax deductible expenses, a matter which I have frequently pondered.  If I were running a business and drove to west Cork in my car, that would be a tax deductible expense.  However, when I drive around my constituency as a practising politician I do not have that facility.  If I decided to pay for a secretary in my constituency it would not be a tax deductible expense, but if I had the good fortune to have a business and I employed the person in that business I could probably claim it as <Col N="1322" /> such, although that might be queried by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Expenses arise which are directly related to our work as politicians.  I have expenses which I never had before.  All Members are familiar with having to contribute locally to associations and worthy causes.  It is a considerable annual expense but it is not tax deductible.  I do not know what the Minister can do about it but it should be examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It could give rise to a constituency cartel among public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not advocate such a noncompetitive practice.  With regard to the parliamentary leader's allowance, in which the public have probably most interest, it is appropriate that smaller parties should get a disproportionate amount compared to larger parties.  As Deputy McDowell said in the Dáil, one cannot have half a secretary and half a fax machine.  Each party must have a certain basic infrastructure irrespective of the party's size.  The larger parties obviously have additional expenses above that. However, there are good reasons why Opposition parties should receive proportionally more funding. They do not have the resources of parties in Government.</P>
      <P>While I have become the renaissance man, it is an amateur approach to research.  I could do with access to expertise in various areas.  In practice, when one is dealing with an issue before the House, one telephones a person whose expertise in that area one respects and seeks their balanced view.  We regard that as the legitimate view and we put it forward as our own.  Of course we plagiarise it dreadfully.  That is not wrong but it means there are deficiencies in our ability to argue a case on legislation.  In my experience, when a case for an amendment is well argued the amendment will be made, whether it is proposed by the Government or the Opposition, and legislation has been improved as a result.</P>
      <P>With regard to people donating to parties, nobody claims it is wrong to make a donation to Amnesty International or to Greenpeace or to the friends of East Timor.  Why is it wrong to make a donation to a political party?  I have sold tickets for national draws in aid of the Progressive Democrats to members of other parties and they have willingly contributed.  Nobody ever approached me later to ask for a favour.  People in business who make donations to political parties do so with no strings attached and it is important to remember that.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I realise that Members who live near Leinster House have an easier task dealing with work in the House than those who come from rural areas.  I am in the fortunate position of having an independent income which makes an enormous difference.  I am sympathetic to those who live some distance from the House and do an enormous amount of work here. They have the onerous task of coming back and forwards to the House to make their splendid contributions.</P>

      <Col N="1323" /> Some of the criticisms made about overnight expenses have been outrageous.  If this was looked on as a health and safety measure, how many people would be encouraged by their firms to leave Dublin to drive to Dingle late in the evening?  I think there would be very few and this should be considered.  There has also been criticism of claiming overnight expenses if a Member lives more than 20 miles from the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This House rarely sits late although the Dáil does sometimes.  With modern methods of travel 40 or 50 miles may seem like an easily commutable distance.  However, it is unwise to ask Members to travel that distance at night after a long day.  As a woman, I think it is particularly unwise to ask people to travel around the country late at night.  I am glad that any temptation to change the 20 mile limit has been resisted and that the Minister has also changed the matter of overnight stays on Thursday.  As Senator Fitzgerald said, some Members of the Dáil who have young children and who live far more than 20 miles from home have told me they go home at night as they do not want to miss them growing up.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to what Senator Dardis said about money for research and the fact that he has become an expert on so many subjects.  Fortunately I can consult my colleague Senator Quinn on all economic matters and I can also consult people in the university.  I feel chintzy constantly telephoning people and asking them to give professional advice for which they could charge if a large body asked them.  More funding for research would do no harm.</P>
    <P>Much of the criticism outside the House has been concerned with the fact that expenses are not receipted.  As the European Parliament is looking at this matter again, perhaps the receipting of expenses could be considered in the future.  As Senator Dardis said, Members have a large number of expenses which are not allowable but are necessary to run a constituency.  As one who has an international constituency I know this can be expensive.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not have to revise his figures as regards the party payments in the morning.  Earlier today, Senator Lanigan, referring to the Official Secrets Act, was enthusiastic in telling people I was a member of the Labour Party.  I assured him it was not a secret and was on my manifesto when I ran for the university. He said I could not be independent and I said he should ask how the Labour Whip felt about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply to some of the points raised.  Tomorrow we will have extensive time to go into the thinking <Col N="1324" /> behind the funding for the political party leader's allowance.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for welcoming this measure and indicating that it will be passed.  Senator Quinn criticised the retrospection of expenses and the bad taste in terms of public perception which is associated with that.  This is a valid point and is perhaps a reflection on a failure in communication. I wanted to address this problem as I became aware of it at the end of 1995, as Senator Fitzgerald knows.  I provided a sum of £500,000 for retrospective payments in this year's Estimates in the expectation that it would be spent during the year.  For self-evident reasons I am not in the business of raising more money than I need in the course of a year.  The Department of Finance has a system of surrendering.  That money would have been lost if it was not spent by the Houses of the Oireachtas and we would have had to look for it again.  This is not a good way to do business and it was an administrative concern.</P>
      <P>Members in both Houses expected they would be paid expenses, particularly overnight expenses which they had been denied.  There was much anger and many queries were raised by all the political parties at parliamentary meetings. Senator Calnan will verify that was the case in my own party and the Chairman of our parliamentary party, Deputy Bell, raised the issue on numerous occasions, as did the Committees on Procedure and Privileges.  There was an expectation that money which they were owed would be paid.  In some cases this is arrears because the costs have been incurred.</P>
      <P>As regards telephone expenses, there is little or no real increase.  Not everybody is using the full £2,000 allowance.  I may look at the suggestion made by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn last night that all Deputies and Senators be linked to the GTN system which would considerably reduce telephone costs.  I do not know what the cost implications are but already this morning staff in the Department of Finance were looking at the matter.</P>
      <P>As regards retrospection and political funding for parties, the existing leader's allowance will be increased by approximately 150 per cent, with some variations.  When the present Administration was formed, the question of funding for political parties was discussed by the three parties involved.  They were given a report by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, who had negotiated with the previous Minister, Deputy Michael Smith.  The details were published and there was an expectation when it would be enacted.  Some parties in this House, including Senator Dardis' party, which is not well funded, entered into contracts and employed people on the basis that this money would be paid in 1996, which they had every reason to believe would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Howlin, was hesitant about proceeding with this because of the anti-party political atmosphere generated around the McKenna judgment and the difficulty in designing a system that took account of the three aspects of the interpretation of the judgment. These factors slowed down progress in the Bill <Col N="1325" /> but there was an expectation.  We were asked by party leaders, who had entered into commitments, when the extra money would come.  Some of them had written to corporations and said they would no longer be able to raise money in the conventional way and they were seeking a last donation.  In a free society it would be wrong to ban contributions to political parties, but they can be made transparent.  There is a question as to whether they should be capped, which is a matter for detailed debate.  People cannot be prohibited from donating money as it would be a manifest intrusion of basic civil liberties.  Many corporate companies give money to all political parties because they feel it is their civic duty.  I have spoken to people who feel they are no longer obliged to do this.</P>
    <P>An appeal for funds was made by the major political parties, including the Labour Party because it has arrears, to corporate bodies.  Money was received but liabilities in terms of ongoing budgets for running political parties and parliamentary parties and research were maturing.  There was an expectation that this money would be paid in 1996.  This is essentially why the legislation was introduced and is being dealt with as quickly as possible.  There were a number of compelling reasons this should be done.  Of course I would prefer to be elsewhere this evening and if the legislation had been published and circulated in the usual fashion, but I have explained why that was not the case.  It is not a great excuse but it is factually accurate.</P>
    <P>There was legal frailty in relation to the leaders' allowance and the problem regarding employers' indemnification because that case is ongoing.  I believed the sooner the issue was addressed, the sooner indemnification would exist.  The law moves slowly but solicitors were engaged and counsel had been hired by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and the Fianna Fáil Party. Until the Bill was introduced, that exposure existed.  In addition, Senators, Deputies and political parties had expectations.  I did not make provision for the extra money for the leaders' allowance but the resources for it are available because of the particular buoyancy in revenue this year.  All these reasons made it desirable to introduce the Bill as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am aware this is not a politically popular measure.  I have been severely criticised for it and I took a particularly strong position in the other House yesterday.  However, perhaps because of the elegance of the Wedgwood decoration of this Chamber or because it was previously a ballroom and the strains of music continue to haunt the plaster and ambience, this is a much less aggressive and adversarial House and I do not need to defend the Bill as aggressively and stoutly as I did in the other House.  Somebody of my stature and seniority in the political system should stand up, outline what is being done and explain the reasons for it.  It is unpopular but it must be done and this is why I seek the enactment of the Bill before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment which is so urgent that I cannot engage in prolonged correspondence with the Minister for Education.  A decision must be taken now about this boy's future.</P>
      <P>The child in question is six year old Stephen Creighton and, to date, he has not had a single formal day in school or received the advantages of a formal education.  For exactly one year the local Barnardo's brought him through its pre-school programme but, unfortunately, this year Stephen was too old to join the pre-school group. The boy's mother and grandmother told me they have tried everything possible to have Stephen placed in an appropriate school which caters for his needs, including speech therapy.  There is a suggestion that Stephen may be mildly mentally handicapped but his family reject that view.  They told me he is on the low end of the intelligence scale but there is no confirmation or indication as yet that he is mildly mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>Regarding the intention of placing him in a school which could provide speech therapy, the family approached two local schools only to be told by Scoil Chiaráin and a school in Chapelizod that they did not have speech therapy facilities and could not accept Stephen.  He was sent to St. Vincent's on the Navan Road and his parent was content to bring him to that school if it could cater for him.  As the Minister is aware, St. Vincent's is a school for the mentally handicapped and, unfortunately, Stephen's reaction to his placement there was extremely disruptive.  He was badly affected by being placed in that environment. His mother and the school principal would say that he was inappropriately placed for his needs because he was very distressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will agree that every child, irrespective of their ability, is entitled to an education. I spoke to the counsellors in the child and family centre in Castleknock and, although they did not give me a report of their assessment of Stephen, I understand they submitted a comprehensive report to the Minister.  I have the impression they suggested to the Minister that this is an urgent case.  In view of the facts I have outlined and my meetings with Stephen, who is a fine young boy, and his mother and grandmother, I ask the Minister <Col N="1327" /> to urgenly find an appropriate place for this young man so that Santa Claus can bring him what he wants and he can start in his new school after Christmas.</P>

      <P>I congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh, on your elevation to that office.  I wish you every success and fulfilment.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform Senator McGennis that a special school placement has been arranged for Stephen at Scoil Chiaráin, Glasnevin, Dublin 11, from early in the new year.  Scoil Chiaráin caters for the special educational needs of children who suffer from mild mental handicap.  The authorities at Scoil Chiaráin will shortly be in touch with Stephen's mother inviting her to a meeting with a view to arranging for Stephen to commence attendance at the school from 13 January next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education responds to the special educational needs of children with disabilities by providing an extensive network of special schools and special classes in ordinary schools.  All such facilities are specially resourced to cater for particular needs and receive special <Col N="1328" /> levels of teacher and funding allocations.  Where the nature of the disability requires it, additional supports can be delivered by medical, therapeutic and care personnel through the health services. The nature and level of special support services provided is determined by the assessed needs of the individual child.  In Stephen's case, assessment reports indicate a need for speech therapy services in addition to normal educational provision.</P>
    <P>The provision of speech therapy services is a matter for the relevant health board.  However, the Department of Education has written to the health board in question to arrange that the necessary speech therapy service will be made available to Stephen.</P>
    <P>It is intended Stephen's placement in Scoil Chiaráin will initially be for a three month trial period.  During this period, his progress and needs will be monitored on an ongoing basis.  Experience gained during this period will allow for a fully informed assessment of Stephen's longer-term needs.</P>
