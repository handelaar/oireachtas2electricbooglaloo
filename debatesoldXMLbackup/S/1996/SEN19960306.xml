      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to outline the Government's actions in response to the nuclear incident that occurred in the vitrification plant at Sellafield on 2 February 1996.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cotter on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to encourage members of the dental profession to carry out certain orthodontic treatment in an effort to reduce the high cost of orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Farrelly on the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education when approval will be given for the commencement of work on a new community school for Trim, County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> I have also received notice from Senator Enright on the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Justice when the proposed extensions, renovations and improvements required in Tullamore Garda station will be carried out, and if she is aware of the current accommodation and safety problems at that station.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Neville's and Senator Cotter's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Farrelly and Senator Enright may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1, Second Stage of the Trade Marks Bill, 1995, until 6 p.m. and item 18, Motion 30, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>We agree with the Order of Business.  I ask the Leader to make time available between now and the summer recess for a debate on coastal erosion.  I understand this issue is being debated at European level.  This House is an ideal forum for such a debate which would be of great interest to many Senators.  For the first time funding is now available for coastal protection.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader could tell us when time will be made available to discuss education.  He has asked us on several occasions to come up with ideas on the type of debate we should have.  Following the recent agreement between the Minister for Education and the unions, it is appropriate for this House to discuss education and to allow Senator O'Toole to elaborate on his negotiating prowess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to hide my hurt at those terrible articles.  On a more serious note, it would be in everyone's interest if we had an early debate on item 17 on the Order Paper, concerning the report <i>Putting Children First</i> and mandatory reporting of child abuse cases.  There is much confusion on this subject.  Teachers, including myself, are often asked why we are opposed to mandatory reporting, for some reason people think we are.  This should not be used to delay the process, since the present debate is similar to that which took place after the Kilkenny incest report.  Mandatory reporting should be brought in as quickly as possible because it is the only protection for everyone involved in this area.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for his wise decision to ensure <i>Anois</i> begins to resemble an ordinary newspaper by moving to put it in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader is aware that, arising from the Price Waterhouse and EAG reports, we have been looking for a debate on defence for a considerable period.  Since proposals for a voluntary redundancy package have now come from Cabinet, this is an opportune time to discuss the future of the Defence Forces, given that their strength is to be reduced.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised item 17, concerning the report <i>Putting Children First.</i> Last week we sought a debate on childcare. Senator Magner had a narrow focus and while we have no problem with that, my request was to discuss aspects of residential care on the basis of disturbing reports in the newspapers. When we consider the matter, I ask the Leader not to confine the debate to the report but to make it broader in its scope.</P>
      <P>I assume Senator O'Toole will use his newly found gold card to bring Senator Ross to dinner, as appropriate thanks for the publicity he gave him last weekend. Finally, does the Leader propose time limits for contributions on item 1?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the last speaker about the debate on children, I specifically stated &mdash; and intimated subsequently to the Leader &mdash; that I wanted a tight, focused debate on street children and not an omnibus discussion. I understood that a wider debate should go ahead but the street children issue should not be included in it.  I intend to pursue it either with the assistance of the Leader in Government time or by putting forward a Labour Party Private Members' motion.  I am collecting data on the subject at present.</P>
      <P>Last week on the Order of Business I attacked RTE's coverage of this House, with much justification, particularly in relation to Senator Mooney's Private Members' motion on Sky Television's encroachment into exclusive coverage of events which are part of our national heritage.  I subsequently received a telephone call from RTE and met the editor of &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.  I raised three points with him and am happy to tell the House that we made substantial progress. First, I said the opening credits to the programme were misleading: the programme covers the Oireachtas, which consists of two Houses, yet the opening sequence shows one House exclusively.  RTE has undertaken to replace the opening.</P>
      <P>Second, I said the Seanad did not have a Question Time and that normally the Order of Business is used, with your indulgence, Sir, to raise questions Members have for the Leader of the House.  RTE did not cover that in the past but has undertaken to do so in future.  Their other bad practice was to cover frontbench spokespersons in the morning.  If one spoke in the morning one had some chance of coverage, whereas if one spoke in the afternoon or at midnight one had no chance.  They have also undertaken to rectify this.</P>
      <P>I suggest that we invite RTE to attend the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to copperfasten the agreements made with me and to broaden the debate because there is still much work to be done with regard to coverage of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, to attend the House to make a statement on the EU ruling yesterday which gave Spanish fishermen the right to register their boats in the UK?  The ruling means that they can register in any country within the EU, which will enable them to fish the quotas of the country in which they register.</P>
      <P>This is an outrageous ruling against which we should protest immediately. While we cannot include an extra boat in our fleet without taking out equal tonnage, the ruling yesterday allows Spanish fishermen &mdash; their case was the only one under consideration but it applies to other fishermen &mdash; to register their boats in Ireland and take fish from our quota.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister for the Marine to contact his counterpart in the UK immediately and lodge a protest because this ruling means the end of the fishing fleet as we know it.  It is useless to suggest that there is a reciprocal arrangement whereby Irish boats can register in Spain because there is no fish to be caught in Spanish waters; we have the fish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the remarks of my friend and colleague, Senator Magner, and commend him for his initiative with regard to his discussions with RTE as they affect the House. When representatives from RTE meet the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, they should look at radio coverage. The radio coverage of &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; is a direct link to the television coverage &mdash; the radio represents the sound track from television; they are not two separate entities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that it is of concern to the House and given also that the Senator has made a specific proposal to the Leader, which I support, I <Col N="1163" /> ask that, in the context of the proposed meeting, the issue of radio coverage should also be raised, especially the coverage which has now been shifted unilaterally by RTE radio from its traditional night time position to a later, variable time.  The House does not deserve this kind of treatment from the national broadcasting station.</P>
      <P>On a matter of perhaps greater importance, especially to those of us who are supporters and lovers of Leitrim Boxty, this wonderful potato delicacy &mdash; Senator Bohan tells me he consumed some of it this morning &mdash; has not been included on the list of delicacies of a national character submitted for registration to the EU by An Bord Bia in the absence of a list submitted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry..</P>
      <P>With Sweden, this country has failed to register such a list.  For example, Dublin coddle, Cork drisheen, Clonakility mussels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the list is being compiled &mdash; it should have been submitted to the EU long ago &mdash; will the Leader convey to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, who is responsible for An Bord Bia, that I saw no mention in any reports of the inclusion of Leitrim Boxty?  I am concerned about the survival of this potato based dish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to bring the Minister responsible for funding of county enterprise boards into the House.  I have raised this matter on a number of occasions and <Col N="1164" /> the situation is getting more serious by the day.  Our county enterprise board has a greater budget for administration than it has for supporting small industry. I am sure that the Leader of the House would want to open up this debate.  The county enterprise boards were set up in a blaze of glory and people in rural Ireland were given the impression that they would contribute to setting up small industries.  This issue is serious.  It would cost £930,000 to fund approved projects in my area but we have only £90,000.  That could be equated with like having one sweet for ten children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to provide time for this debate as soon as possible here because it is no longer a joke.  I have to live with an announcement that was made this week in Donegal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to put a case to the House.  An announcement was made in Donegal this week that a new theatre would be funded at a cost of nearly £2 million.  There will be no shortage of actors for the theatre because that is all we are doing now as far as funding for county enterprise boards is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought Senator McGowan was going to thank me for delivering the theatre.  I have no doubt it will be the second Chamber he and I will appear in, the way things are going.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the nurses' dispute. The public is concerned about people who work in psychiatry and with the mentally handicapped.  Talks are not progressing quickly enough in this dispute. These people have a special place in society and the worst thing that could happen would be if they went on strike. Very few people who have not worked in that area understand the situation.  I have done so and I know these people are overworked and overstressed, yet they give their time freely.  The message should go out from this Chamber to the Minister that we are concerned.  The process should be speeded up as much as possible and a strike should be avoided.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Wright in asking for a debate on coastal erosion. This is a serious problem.  We have been asked on several occasions to prepare a policy and documentation to show what needs to be done.  This has been done on numerous occasions in Sligo but no funding has been forthcoming.</P>
      <P>I also call for a debate on the local improvements schemes; in my county we have a ten year waiting list.  Our funding amounts to £110,000 and it would cost £1 million to fund all the applications.  It is time we had a debate on this subject to see how we could get money to update the scheme.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross wrote two very fine articles in the newspaper on the last two Sundays about how banks overcharge their customers.  It is time we had a debate on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know what the banks are charging; we have been overcharged. I am a golden years customer now but people in business do not know what they are charged or for what the charges are.  We should have a full debate on how the banks operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Farrell will have ample opportunity to put forward his views during this evening's Private Members' debate on banking which will also enable the House to discuss the points he made.</P>
      <P>My question to the Leader relates to currency which has been discussed on previous occasions.  I am aware that the Leader is anxious to have a good debate on the matter.  I am afraid that monetary union will sneak up on us like a brass band.  We have been hearing about it, we know it is coming but we have not debated its implications.  I urge the Leader to provide time for a debate on monetary union, which will be critical to exports, employment and the economy, as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste has been very generous in appearing before this House to keep Members abreast of developments in relation to Northern Ireland.  However, it now appears that there are in-built preconditions in the joint communiqué which were not previously obvious and which might provide some parties with a right of veto against the participation of other parties in the talks process.  With regard to the talks that will take place between now and 13 March, could the Tánaiste inform this House about the prospect of bringing about the all-party negotiations to which the Taoiseach referred?  I acknowledge the importance of such negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Tánaiste make a statement to the House regarding the intervention of the Taoiseach, from the point of view of his fraternal associates in the British Labour Party, because it seems that confidence in Ireland is higher than in Britain that the Conservative Party will remain in Government?  It is important <Col N="1167" /> that a statement be made in this House as to the propriety of such action.</P>
    <P>Would it be possible to invite the Minister for Finance to appear before the House at whatever fee he believes appropriate &mdash; it need not necessarily be £100 per head &mdash; to hear the views of Members as to what might or might not be included in the Finance Bill?  We will charge him a little less than £100.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Fitzgerald's statement about the undermining of the Common Fisheries Policy by a recent court decision.  Irish fish stocks will be placed at great risk as a result. Not only does that decision create difficulties for fishermen but it places hundreds of jobs in the fishing and processing industries at risk.  It is urgent that the Minister for the Marine gives some indication of how he proposes to deal with this issue at European Union level.  The decision is serious and will place severe pressure on Irish fish stocks.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, recently met the British authorities with regard to the dumping of waste ammunition, radioactive waste and other substances in the vicinity of the Irish coastline. Such action is causing widespread concern in coastal communities because quite an amount of material has washed up on our beaches.  Perhaps the Minister of State could give this House some indication of the outcome of his discussions with the British authorities and the nature of both Governments' proposals for dealing with this serious problem which has given great cause for concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis' request for a debate on defence issues because avenues for discussion have recently opened.  I have requested such a debate on a weekly basis for many months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this House should express its horror at the events which took place in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv during the past <Col N="1168" /> two weeks.  I request that the Leader invite the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to join with his European counterparts in ensuring that the EU plays its part to ensure that the peace process in the Middle East does not go off the rails due to the activities of a minority of people with no mandate. The parallels between events there and what could potentially happen here are too obvious to state.</P>
    <P>Given the television coverage in recent days of the prisoners in Rwanda who will face trial when the international war crimes tribunal is established, will the Leader continue to ask the Tánaiste to press the EU to ensure that that tribunal is set up?  Thousands of people, from ten years of age upwards, are in jail and although some have committed horrific war crimes and must be punished, many people are dying in these jails every day.  Until they are brought to trial&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Health to intervene in the dispute involving junior hospital doctors in Galway and the Western Health Board before it becomes a serious issue?  Will he consider arranging a debate this session on part-time workers because there are many anomalies in the social welfare legislation which discriminate against such workers.  It would be a most useful debate.  For example, I recently encountered a case where dock workers in Galway are seriously discriminated against because social welfare regulations have not kept pace with change in that industry. Now dock workers, who traditionally had good employment, may have only three months work in a year.</P>

      <P>Senator Wright asked for a debate on coastal erosion.  The Senator is aware a debate on coastal erosion in County Wicklow was shared last week by Senator Ross and Senator Roche.  However, I am happy to arrange a debate on the issue which will cover the entire country.</P>
      <P>The Senator referred to some articles in a Sunday newspaper.  I am a great believer in pleasant Sundays and I do not read that particular newspaper. However, I am sure I can find it in the Library and I will pass on the Senator's comments.  I did not receive an invitation to that lunch so I cannot comment on it.  However, I am sure the Minister, in her inimitable way, will defend it and that everything she has done is defensible.</P>
      <P>I am sure the House will be glad to receive the briefing Senator O'Toole offered on educational matters.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators raised the question of a debate on childcare and child abuse.  I intend to order that debate for Thursday, 14 March, and to focus it on the Minister's recent report. However, this is just a focal point and it does not mean the debate must only be about that matter.  All matters relating to childcare and current issues may be considered at that time.  I hope the debate will not conclude next week, but will remain on the Order Paper so that it can be pursued at a future date.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole made a point about <i>Anois</i> about which I have no comment. Having listened to the discussions last evening, only a fool would rush in on that particular issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> Senator Lanigan and Senator Dardis requested a debate on defence issues. The Minister is taking Question Time in the other House today but he is anxious to come to the House to talk about the issues, given that most of them have been reasonably resolved.  I will try to arrange this debate; I am aware it has been asked for over a long time.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis asked about time limits on item 1.  There are no time limits as I do not think they will be necessary. Senator Magner raised the issue of childcare with which I dealt already. The Senator spoke to RTE personnel last week, as I did also.  I assure the House, and the Senator will agree, that there is goodwill on the part of RTE.  It is no harm to remind them, as they were forcibly reminded last week, that this House expects better treatment than it has received in the past.  I also received the assurances the Senator received that coverage of the House from now on will increase significantly.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Daly raised the question of yesterday's EU ruling and I will make immediate contact with the Minister in that regard.  As I said, he is taking Question Time at the moment in the other House but I am sure he will want to address that issue as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney drew our attention to the variable timing of the radio coverage of this House.  I have not recently listened very much to RTE radio in the evenings.  However, I am glad the Senator has drawn attention to the fact that the coverage is not broadcast at a fixed time and we will put that on our agenda.  On the question of the delicacy he raised, perhaps he might arrange a tasting for Members so that we can convey his concern to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock asked about the Waste Bill, the Committee Stage of which will be taken on Thursday week. I am sorry Senator McGowan was embarrassed but, in answer to his question, we will have a debate on that matter soon.  I will convey Senator <Col N="1171" /> Maloney's concern on the nurses dispute to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell apparently believes that Senator Ross should receive an increased fee from Independent Newspapers for the quality of his articles, although that might not be unanimous.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Kennedy asked about a briefing from the Tánaiste, for which I will ask him.  In regard to the other matter which the Senator raised, it is my understanding that confidential conversations remain confidential.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad Senator Lanigan raised the question of the atrocities in Jerusalem. All Members will wish to express their absolute abhorrence, horror and detestation of what has happened and our concern at the parlous state in which this has put the peace process in that country.  I will convey to the Tánaiste the urgency of what the Senator said about how the EU must do everything &mdash; as it is doing &mdash; it can to preserve the <Col N="1172" /> peace process there.  I have also noted the Senator's comments on Rwanda.</P>
    <P>I will convey Senator Fahey's comments on the Galway dispute to the Minister.  The Social Welfare Bill will be in this House before the end of the month and will cover many of the issues raised by the Senator about part-time workers.  If those concerns are not adequately dealt with in the Social Welfare Bill, I could then talk to the Senator about a debate on the matter.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that this Bill is very narrow and boring in comparison to the exciting menu I have just heard the House debate.  However, I am assured that it is very necessary.</P>
      <P>Our present law in this area in contained in the Trade Marks Act, 1963, and the rules made thereunder.  Registration of trade marks is administered by the Patents Office, under the direction of the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, which maintains the register.  Changes in our legislation are necessary due to an EC directive on harmonisation of trade mark law throughout the Community and other international developments which I shall mention later.</P>
      <P>In essence a trade mark is a badge of goodwill and the primary purpose of registration is to legally protect the exclusive rights of the proprietor and, thereby, the goodwill subsisting in the trade mark.  The register is a record of what are claimed as exclusive rights. There are over 65,000 entries on the register at present and every year approximately 6,000 new applications are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to give effect to EU Council Directive No. 89/104 to approximate the laws of member <Col N="1173" /> states relating to trade marks. Implementation of the directive will reduce or eliminate differences in approach between EU member states in the area of trade marks, thereby reducing barriers to competition and assisting the completion of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the law governing registered trade marks are the key questions of how marks should qualify for registration and what rights are conferred by registration.  In order to be registered, a mark must be able to fulfil the essential function of a trade mark &mdash; that of distinguishing its proprietor's goods or services from those of his competitors. It may not, for example, be descriptive of the goods or be a word that another trader might legitimately wish to use to describe his goods, nor may a mark be validly registered if it conflicts with an earlier right, for example, a similar trade mark already on the register.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the registration of a word or device as a trade mark does not give an absolute monopoly to all uses of that word or device; it is necessary in law to make clear what is the scope of the protection conferred and what acts constitute infringements of the trade mark right.</P>
    <P>The directive seeks to ensure that, as far as possible, these questions are answered in the same way throughout the Community.  Article 3 is concerned with grounds for refusal or invalidity that relate to the registrability of the mark &mdash; sometimes referred to as absolute grounds.  Article 4 refers to grounds concerning conflicts with earlier rights &mdash; often referred to as relative grounds &mdash; while article 5 deals with the rights conferred by a registered trade mark.</P>
    <P>The directive is concerned with substantial law, not procedures.  While it sets out the ground for refusal or invalidation of registered trade marks, it states specifically that member states remain free to fix the procedures whereby these grounds are applied.  This is why articles 3 and 4, which deal with the grounds for refusal or invalidation, include the words &ldquo;shall not be registered <Col N="1174" /> or if registered shall be liable to be declared invalid&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Countries like the UK and Ireland, who register trade marks only after search and examination, can continue to do so while countries that do not search or examine but leave the validity of a registration to be settled by litigation are free to retain their systems if they so wish.  The essential requirement is that there must be some legal mechanism whereby the grounds of objection contained in articles 3 and 4 can be considered. The changes to our legislation needed to give effect to these articles are twofold.</P>
    <P>First, the test for registering a trade mark will be whether the mark is capable of distinguishing its owner's goods or services from those of another.  The new and wider definition contained in article 2 of the directive is reflected in section 6 of this Bill which permits registration of geographic names and the shape of goods or of their packaging.</P>
    <P>Second, the rights enjoyed by a registered mark will be broadened so that in future another person's use of a mark on similar goods or services will constitute infringement.  Article 5 of the directive gives a much wider protection than was available under the Trade Marks Act, 1963.  Under that Act, infringement proceedings could only be taken if another person used the mark on the precise goods for which it was registered. If that other person used the mark on similar goods or used it to sell services related to the goods for which the mark was registered, then the owner did not have recourse to trade mark legislation and had to rely instead on a common law action for passing off.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill will not only extend these broader infringement rights to similar goods but, in the case of a mark that has a reputation in the State, extend infringement rights to non-similar goods where the infringing use takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or repute of the well known mark.</P>
    <P>The second main purpose of the Bill is to make provision for the new Community <Col N="1175" /> trade mark.  Council Regulation 40/94 of 20 December 1993 established the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market for trade marks and designs.  This office will register Community trade marks that will have effect in all member states.</P>
    <P>The Community trade marks system will operate in parallel with national systems, and offer trade mark owners the opportunity to register their mark throughout the Community by means of a single registration.  This Bill makes provision in connection with the operation of Council Regulation 40/94. Applications for a Community trade mark can be made through the Patents Office in Dublin.</P>
    <P>A third aim of the Bill is to enable ratification of the Protocol to the Madrid Agreement concerning the international registration of marks and also to implement certain provisions of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.  Explicit provision is now being made in Part III of the Bill to allow us to meet our various obligations under both the Madrid Protocol and the Paris Convention.</P>
    <P>At present, an Irish trade mark owner who wishes to protect his mark in overseas markets must apply separately for registration in each of the countries in which protection is desired.  This entails going through whatever procedures are required in each country, paying fees to each national office and undertaking substantial costs to pursue the various applications.</P>
    <P>Trade mark owners in some European countries are able to register their mark by means of a single application under an international arrangement known as the Madrid Agreement. Although this agreement had functioned for more than 100 years, it had a membership of only 44 countries.  This is partly because participating countries conduct little or no examination of applications and objections to a trade mark have to be pursued through litigation after the mark has been registered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> In contrast, our trade marks system is based on registration being granted only after the mark has been examined by the controller, including a search of the register for possible conflicting marks. Given the lack of compatibility between the Madrid system and many national systems it was not surprising that many countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan, the UK and Ireland, remained outside the Madrid Agreement. A Protocol to the agreement was concluded on 27 June 1989 which overcame the difficulties we had with the original agreement.</P>
    <P>The fourth aim of the Bill is to facilitate the registration of trade marks in respect of services.  Up to now, service industries were unable to do so as section 11 of the Trade Marks Act, 1963, confined the definition of a trade mark to only goods.  This Bill will facilitate the registration of trade marks in respect of services by broadening the definitions of a trade mark as contained in section 6 to cover services.  This will benefit service industries who will now be able to protect the goodwill associated with their marks and should assist in attracting service industries to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to the detail of the Bill.  I should highlight two new provisions which were introduced on Report Stage in the Dáil as sections 12 and 25.</P>
    <P>Section 10 sets out the relative grounds for refusal of a trade mark application.  Relative grounds have to do with conflict with an earlier trade mark or application as distinct from the absolute grounds for refusal in section 8, which relate to the nature of the mark itself.  Section 12 provides, by way of exception to section 10, that the controller shall not refuse an application for registration despite the existence of relative grounds where an applicant demonstrates that there has been honest concurrent use of the applicant's mark with the earlier mark.</P>
    <P>The controller will take account of honest concurrent use in considering any opposition to the application.  This <Col N="1177" /> provision which was introduced at the request of the Association of Patent and Trade Mark Agents, replaces section 20(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1963, which also dealt with honest concurrent use.</P>
    <P>The second new provision is section 25 which deals with powers of seizure and search for infringing goods, material or articles as defined in section 21.</P>
    <P>Following the Committee Stage debate in the Dáil on section 92, dealing with the fraudulent use of a trade mark, I was persuaded that more effective deterrents to counterfeiting were needed.  Section 20 offers trade mark proprietors the option of applying to the High Court for an order for delivery up of infringing goods.  This remedy may not be effective against professional counterfeiters who will likely fail to obey the order and simply move their counterfeit goods to another place.  The powers of search and seizure will enable the Garda Síochána to take immediate action following application to the District Court.  Seizures will involve a financial sanction in direct proportion to the scale of counterfeiting involved and should be a serious deterrent to those who might seek to infringe the rights of trade mark owners.</P>
    <P>Part I of this Bill clarifies general matters and provides for repeal of the present law.  Part II deals with the registration of trade marks generally.  It reenacts much of what was contained in the Trade Marks Act, 1963, while taking account of various changes that have taken place since enactment, particularly those necessitated by Council Directive 89/104.</P>
    <P>Section 47 now provides for a trade mark to be registered for ten years and renewed for further periods of ten years.  Under existing legislation the first registration period is for seven years with renewals for successive periods of 14 years.  This will bring our registration periods into line with international norms.  Section 54 introduces a new category of trade mark whereby an association of members can register a collective <Col N="1178" /> mark in respect of goods or services.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill covers the various provisions necessary to take account of the new Community Trade Mark Regulation 40/94, the Protocol to the Madrid Agreement and our obligations under the Paris Convention.</P>
    <P>Part IV contains administrative provisions many of which re-enact existing legislation.  Matters covered here include the maintenance of the Register of Trade Marks, the powers and duties of the controller of patents, designs and trade marks and legal proceedings and appeals.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with the trade mark agents and replaces section 69 of the 1963 Act.  Section 84 provides for the controller to maintain a register of trade mark agents while section 86 outlines the eligibility requirements to be placed on the register of trade mark agents.</P>
    <P>Section 90 provides for rules governing the register as well as the professional qualifications and conditions for registration of an agent.  Section 91 is a new provision that confers privilege on communications between registered trade mark agents and their clients in the same way as between solicitors and their clients.  The provisions outlined in this Part follow largely on the existing provisions in section 105 to 109 of the Patents Act, 1992, as they relate to patent agents.</P>
    <P>Part VI is devoted to offences and introduces important new measures to deal with the growing problems of the fraudulent use of trade marks and counterfeiting.  Section 92 gives much stronger protection to registered trade marks by broadening the scope of offences to include use of a mark which is identical to, or nearly resembles, a registered trade mark.</P>
    <P>The unauthorised use of a registered trade mark devalues the reputation of that mark as the counterfeit goods are generally of inferior quality.  Such use also harms traders in the genuine goods who lose business.  This Bill will provide trade mark proprietors with wider rights <Col N="1179" /> against acts of infringement as defined in section 14.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill deals with miscellaneous and general matters.  Section 96 breaks new ground by placing the onus of proving use of a trade mark on the owner where use of the mark is contested. In the case of a person seeking to have a mark cancelled on the grounds of non-use under the 1963 Act, the burden of proving non-use rests with that person.  This is a difficult matter and it is reasonable and straightforward to call upon the owner of the mark to prove use and this is the approach taken here.</P>
    <P>The First and Second Schedules of this Bill set out requirements and procedures for registration of collective and certification marks, respectively.  The Third Schedule deals with transitional provisions.  Existing registered marks kept under Parts A and B of the former register shall be deemed to be transferred on commencement of the new Act to the new register as set out in paragraph 2.  The remaining transitional provisions relate to the status of applications for registration pending at the date of the coming into operation of the new legislation as well as other matters. Paragraph 15 deals with applications for trade marks in respect of services that were made between 1 January 1993 and commencement of the new Act.</P>
    <P>I believe there will be a general welcome for this Bill.  Its enactment will improve the environment for Irish businesses to register their trade marks and facilitate trademark owners in protecting against infringement.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill which, as the Minister said, is fairly narrow in its mandate.  The Bill will enact changes in our legislation which are necessary due to the EU directive on harmonisation of trade mark law throughout the European Union.  It is valuable legislation in that it will make it easier for Irish exports to compete in other EU markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> It is a rather technical Bill and, as the Minister has said, the directive itself deals with substantive laws.  Articles 2 and 3 are of vital importance and deal with the grounds for refusal or invalidity relating to the registrability of the mark.</P>
    <P>The essential requirement is for a legal mechanism whereby grounds for objection contained in articles 3 and 4 can be considered.  In that regard, a new and wider definition of the directive in article 2 is reflected in section 6 of the Bill which permits registration of geographic names and the shape of goods or their packaging.</P>
    <P>The fact that rights enjoyed by a registered mark will be broadened is a welcome development.  It means that in future another person's use of a mark on similar goods or services will constitute infringement.  It is important that under the Bill the owner of the mark will have recourse to trade mark legislation and will no longer have to rely on common law action to deal with infringements.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill will not only extend these broader infringement rights in the case of a mark that has a reputation in the State but will also make it more difficult for non-similar goods to have an unfair advantage as the result of infringement.  The Bill deals with the need to tighten up the whole area of trade mark legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision for the new Community trade mark under Council Directive 40/94 which established the office of harmonisation in the Internal Market for trade marks and designs. The Community trade marks system will operate in parallel with national systems.</P>
    <P>Another aim of the Bill is to enable the ratification of the Protocol to the Madrid Agreement on the international registration of marks.  Explicit provision is now being made so that we can meet our various obligations under both the Madrid Protocol and the Paris Convention.</P>
    <P>One of the most important advantages of the legislation is that Irish trade mark owners will now have European <Col N="1181" /> trade marks instead of having to protect marks in overseas markets by applying separately and independently for registration in each country where such protection is desired.  This is an important development towards ending the widespread bureaucracy encountered by Irish products in European markets.</P>
    <P>Another important development with regard to this Bill is the extension of trade marks to cover services.  Until now service industries were unable to have trade marks; the definition was confined to goods only.  The fact that section 6 of the Bill will facilitate the registration of trade marks in respect of services by broadening the definition of trade marks is an important development for what is a major growth area in Irish industry.  As the Minister has said, service industries will now be able to protect the goodwill associated with their marks and this should be of advantage in further developing the international service sector, which is becoming probably the most significant growth area in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Section 25 deals with powers of seizure and search with regard to infringing goods, materials or articles as defined in section 21.  I welcome the fact that the Minister strengthened the Bill by introducing amendments to provide for more effective deterrents to counterfeiting. Section 20 is welcome in that it offers mark proprietors the option of applying to the High Court for an order for the delivery of infringing goods.  It is significant that the Minister recognises this remedy may not be effective against professional counterfeiters who are likely to fail to obey the order and move their counterfeit goods to another place.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to expand on the extent of the problem of offending counterfeiters.  It seems to me that a significant amount of counterfeiting takes place and that we have major problems with regard to the copying of a range of products, including video and music tapes.  It is important that the Garda Síochána has powers of search and seizure and that it takes immediate action following an application to the <Col N="1182" /> District Court.  I welcome the Minister's attempts to deal effectively with counterfeiting and I would like him to spell out how the Garda can deal on a practical level with the problem.</P>
    <P>My main concern about the Bill stems from the fact that we have an uncanny ability to introduce good legislation but a poor ability to implement it.  The last regulatory Bill we passed provided for the control of banking institutions and the strengthening of the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs but we have done little since then to provide resources for the implementation of the Act.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that it might be difficult to implement the provisions of Part VI of this Bill.  I welcome the stringent measures with regard to imprisonment and fines to deal with people who infringe the legislation.  As a result of the Bill, will more resources be provided and initiatives taken to stamp out counterfeiting?  Can we realistically believe that people who will be in major breach of the legislation will find themselves in prison?  It is vital that this good legislation be implemented in an effective and practical way and that before too long people who engage in counterfeiting are brought to justice and face the treatment provided for in the Bill. This is the only concern I have and I would like the Minister to assure the House that the provisions of the final two sections will be implemented.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, I believe it will be of major benefit to Irish industry.  As I read the Bill and the Minister's speech I am reminded of the question of marketing and brand names.  It is a pity many of our European competitors have major brand names which are found throughout Europe and Ireland. Unfortunately, many traditional industries in this country died and those which remain are in a shaky position.  In the clothing industry there are big brand names, such as Benetton from Italy and Boss from Germany.  A Scottish company which produces golfing gear and for which Mr. Nick Faldo is promoter has a major brand name but I cannot <Col N="1183" /> now remember what it is.  There are several other brand names which one immediately associates with various European countries.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we do not appear to have been able to develop the brand name concept.  To a large degree our manufacturers, with the possible exception of Kerrygold, still operate within their own small brands and the marketing tools of brand names have not been developed to any great degree.  These marketing tools could be most beneficially used for the more effective marketing and promotion of Irish products in European markets.  This Bill should remind the Minister, officials in his Department and people in industry that we should develop a policy of having well known brand names which cover a range of Irish products, particularly in traditional industries which face major competition from imports.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for such a development, if it is not too late at this stage.  Kerrygold is a good example of a brand name in the food sector.  I often wonder why we have not been able to develop a common brand name for Irish meat products which are on sale throughout Europe.  This issue is not directly related to the Bill.  However, the Bill may provide the opportunity for a short discussion on the marketing of traditional Irish products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is welcome.  It is right and proper that we are following up on a three year old EU directive &mdash; although one might not agree with all European directives &mdash; and passing legislation so that the one office in Europe will be able to deal with patents and trade marks.  Two weeks ago I was asked at a meeting in New York about patenting products in Ireland and Europe.  I told the questioner that, as far as I knew, it had to be carried out in each country.  I was not aware that this Bill would be before the House so quickly.  People who are interested in coming to this country with their products or who wish to produce goods here <Col N="1184" /> are anxious to ensure that not only can they get a brand to protect their product but a patent for a product that is secured in Ireland will be effective throughout Europe.</P>
      <P>Many companies find their successful products being copied and marketed by others.  This legislation will protect people who probably have spent substantial amounts of money in bringing forward a product and who wish to secure a mark for it to protect it.  This is an important Bill and the Minister, following discussions in the other House, strengthened the penalties to ensure that the protection offered by the Bill was effective.  The establishment of the international trading centre in this country demonstrates to the the outside world that we are anxious and interested in doing business with people from other countries and that we can carry out that business effectively and efficiently.</P>
      <P>The EU office to deal with patents and trade marks is due to open in April. We are, as usual, just on time passing the legislation and following up on a three year old directive.  The cost involved in going to each country and seeking to protect the trade mark of one's product must be huge and must take a substantial amount of time.  I am sure many companies found, by the time they had gone through this procedure, that somebody else had got in before them in some countries.  It is difficult to protect products and good ideas from theft; somebody takes the idea, changes it somewhat and claims ownership.  This has happened in the past.  There are always people who are prepared to pick up on ideas and run with them, thereby taking from the success of the people who had the original idea and who actually spent the money developing the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have spoken about successful brand names on numerous occasions in the House.  The &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; brand name has been particularly successful. However, huge amounts of money are required to imprint a brand name in people's minds.  About two years ago it <Col N="1185" /> was reported that Baileys had spent £150 million in a ten year period advertising their brand name.  That shows what it costs worldwide to get into a market and make a lasting impression.</P>
    <P>Recently I watched a quiz programme on television.  As politicians we do our best both locally and nationally to represent people while we are often featured on the radio and television.  We are inclined to think that everybody recognises individual politicians and knows what their positions are.  On that programme six second level students, aged between 14 and 16, were asked the number of elected Deputies in two counties and none of them got the right answer.  We think we are well known and that everybody knows everything about the political system, which has a brand name in its own right in Ireland. One would be inclined to believe that second level students &mdash; there are probably only ten or 12 schools in each county &mdash; would know the number of public representatives in Dáil Éireann. It occurred to me watching the quiz that, although we spend a substantial amount of time in the Oireachtas and produce a huge amount of information and news for the print media, the cost to establish a brand name and sell something to the masses would cost millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important and positive step in the provision of a simplified system for people who wish to patent a product.  It is amazing that it has taken so long because it is about 22 years since we became involved in Europe.  The protection being given to patents in this Bill is worthwhile and welcome.  I am delighted that we are prepared to give people protection for their products. Every day people come up with excellent ideas but often they do not get the benefit or reward they should.  Can the Minister tell us the number of cases that have been taken for fraud against people using the trade marks of others? Has it been widespread?  How many people, if any, have been prosecuted in Ireland for that offence in recent years?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> I welcome the legislation.  It is right and proper that we should give people in different businesses the right to apply to one place and secure a patent that is valid not only in Ireland but throughout Europe.  This Bill should be passed without animosity.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and this Bill.  We will not have reason to delay it.  It is not legislation that will set the world alight and I doubt that it will be discussed in public houses by people drinking Irish brands of drink which are probably as well known as the &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; brand name. Beverages are good examples of Irish brand names that are well known throughout the world.</P>
      <P>This is important legislation for people trying to develop businesses in this country and abroad.  Legislation which helps to reduce costs for people trying to develop products is to be welcomed. This Bill will help to reduce marketing costs in a practical way because if one is selling in a number of countries one will now have the opportunity to register centrally with the World Intellectual Property Organisation in Geneva or with the Office for the Harmony of the Internal Market in Alicante.  This Bill will prove a cost saving measure for businesses.  It will offer clarity about how trade marks are registered and will give businesses greater protection, particularly with the amendment agreed in the Dáil for stronger search and seizure powers.</P>
      <P>The idea of having a one stop shop in accordance with the EC Directive 89/104 makes sense in view of the forthcoming currency convergence and, in general, in trying to harmonise affairs in Europe.  It makes sense to harmonise trade marks.  The change in the registration system whereby one registers for ten years and has a renewal period of ten years is logical.  This further clarifies the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State referred also to a &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; clause.  In other words, if one can be shown not to have used a brand name for a period of five <Col N="1187" /> years one can lose it.  There is no point having someone hold onto what might be a good marketable brand name without using it and, therefore, denying others the opportunity to use it effectively. I welcome the inclusion of services in brand naming.  Service industries have been the most beneficial for job creation and it is only logical they should be covered by the legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in section 25 which increase the powers of the Garda with regard to counterfeiting.  The most obvious examples of counterfeiting are watches and perfumes.  One can buy perfume in some countries which the vendor may describe as being the same as a known brand of perfume but which has a different brand name.  I do not know if that is technically counterfeiting; the Minister might clarify that point.  One can often buy tee shirts with recognised brand names from street vendors for a lower price than one might pay otherwise and I assume that would be covered by the counterfeiting provisions.</P>
    <P>About seven or eight years ago I holidayed in a well known Mediterranean resort.  Senator Farrelly referred to the success of Bailey's and the cost of its marketing and there was a drink for sale in the local supermarket called &ldquo;Wailey's&rdquo; which had a label very similar to the Bailey's label.  There was another drink for sale called &ldquo;Cordon's&rdquo;, a gin which had a label similar to a well known brand of gin.  There were many such examples of drinks with bottle shapes and labels similar to well known brands but they had a slight variation in the name.  I presume such trading would be covered under this legislation. I do not know if it was an infringement of the law in the particular country I visited, but it is clearly a misuse of trade marks.  The beverages were cheaper than the well known brands and it seemed an unfair method of trading. It probably cost the producers of Bailey's Irish Cream a lot of money.</P>
    <P>A wide variety of goods is available to the public and brand recognition is <Col N="1188" /> crucial to success in marketing goods.  It is difficult to broaden the market for a product without spending a lot of money on marketing.  The public increasingly tends to buy on the basis of advertising &mdash; a new brand of chocolate has to be made more exciting than an existing brand, although they probably taste the same.  Branding is crucial to the success of businesses and, in a small way, this Bill will make it easier for Irish companies trying to make it into new markets.  The WIPO is in its infancy but it has a lot of potential for developing an international register of brand names.  This will help the many Irish companies trying to expand their markets to eastern Europe, Australia and the Far East.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was being discussed in the Dáil Deputy McDowell made the point that we tend to be reactive rather than proactive in relation to EU directives. Sometimes we implement EU directives later than they are meant to be implemented and we often implement them just on time.  However, we seldom discuss them in any great detail when they are in draft form, as is the case apparently in other European countries.  We should have more say in EU directives while we still have an opportunity to influence them and before we have to implement them.  One hears complaints about the implications of EU law for baking brown bread in the kitchen or the shape of cucumbers. We should have more of an influence on EU directives at the draft stage when it might be more effective.  I welcome the Bill and commend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which updates the 1963 legislation and brings the law into line with EU directives on regularising and registering trade marks.  This must be done in such a way that there are criteria for highlighting the qualities of a particular article so that others cannot produce another article with the same brand qualities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trade marks have been subject to abuse &mdash; Senator O'Sullivan mentioned <Col N="1189" /> perfumes as a prime example of such abuse.  One may find imitations of the well known international brands of perfume on sale in local supermarkets or from street vendors.  It is time we regularised the law in this area, particularly for those goods which have the characteristics of a well established name so that it is not infringed by competitors. I am not sure from the Minister's speech what is meant by &ldquo;infringements&rdquo;, particularly if someone makes a similar product.  The public should be aware of what is meant by this EU directive in relation to updating the Trade Marks Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>The Minister is protecting the exclusive rights of the proprietor and, thereby, the goodwill of the trade mark.  Goodwill means different things to different people.  Suppliers and those trading under this Bill must help us, as legislators, by ensuring that they clarify how the trade mark was established and how it could be abused.  We are not as familiar with this issue as those in business and we may not get the opportunity for consultation.  We should have such information before we come into the House to discuss this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I would like the Minister to clarify &ldquo;infringements&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill because it gives effect to an EU directive and brings our domestic legislation into line with a number of international conventions and agreements.  It also gives effect to the EU's decision to have a common European trade mark.</P>
      <P>Many arguments were advanced in the other House and it is to the Minister's credit that he took a number of them on board.  This meant the Bill progressed quickly to Committee Stage which was unusual when one considers its size &mdash; seven Parts, 102 sections and three Schedules.  It affects 12 Acts which date back to 1851.  It is a tribute to the Minister and his officials that this Bill could be presented in such a way that it encountered little or no opposition in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> The Minister said:</P>
    <P>At the heart of the law governing registered trade marks are the key questions of how marks should qualify for registration and what rights are conferred by registration.  In order to be registered, a mark must be able to fulfil the essential function of a trade mark &mdash; that of distinguishing its proprietor's goods or services from those of his competitors; [that must be the purpose of the legislation, but I am worried that what follows is a qualification of what went before].  It may not, for example, be descriptive of the goods or be a word that another trader might legitimately wish to use to describe his goods. . . .</P>
    <P>If the law for the registration of a trade mark is that it is capable of &ldquo;distinguishing its proprietor's goods or services from those of his competitors&rdquo;, then the fact that it may not apply, for example, to another trader who might legitimately wish to use it to describe his goods seems to qualify what was previously stated.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said: &ldquo;Moreover, the registration of a word or device as a trade mark does not give an absolute monopoly to all uses of that word or device.&rdquo;  I do not know if there is a difference between a monopoly and an absolute monopoly.  I assume that if a trade mark must be able to fulfil the essential function of distinguishing a proprietor's goods or services, then that proprietor has a monopoly.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify this issue.</P>
    <P>EC Directive 40/94 of 20 December 1993, to which this Bill is giving effect, will establish a Community trade mark office which will register trade marks that affect all Community members.  We will also continue the service provided by the Patents Office of registering trade marks in the domestic area.  How will these two offices work together? Will a trade mark registered by the controller of patents here automatically be registered with the Community trade marks office, or will there be two categories of trade marks &mdash; those recognised <Col N="1191" /> by the European office and those recognised by the Patents Office?</P>
    <P>I recognise that, as the Minister said, we and the UK have a unique system of registration.  We both operate the same practice whereby an application for the registration of a trade mark receives a detailed examination and, when the officials are satisfied, registration is granted.  As he also said, other countries register first and allow conflicts of interest to be solved by litigation.  Am I correct to interpret the directive as permitting the continuation of that practice? If I am, does the directive allow for an inconsistency within member states in the methods used for registration?</P>
    <P>Earlier, I complimented the Minister on his approach to this complex legislation. Sections 12 and 25 were added as a result of the discussion in the other House and I applaud him for this attitude &mdash; if a weakness is identified, it is good that a Minister is prepared to recognise it and respond.  He did not treat the pointing out of a deficiency in legislation as a reflection on his ability to pilot legislation through the House, as so many other Ministers have. Section 12 deals with the honest concurrent use of a trade mark and section 25 deals with the power to seize counterfeit goods.  I welcome the provisions and rather than seek clarification now I will leave discussion of them until Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision in section 47 that the registration period will run for ten years with renewal periods of ten years to follow and the new measures in section 92 to provide stronger protection against the fraudulent use of trade marks and the counterfeiting of goods.</P>
    <P>Having read the Official Report of the debate in the other House, I ask the Minister to indicate if he has a timescale he is anxious to meet.  The Opposition in the Dáil suggested this Bill should be implemented by 1 April.  I have no desire to cut across that but as I wish to raise points on Committee Stage I <Col N="1192" /> would like to know the Minister's intentions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is welcome, timely and necessary but I am sorry other matters were not included.  Inventors who have spoken to me feel they should be safeguarded during the period after they come up with the idea.  Before they can apply for a patent, they must produce a prototype &mdash; which can cost a certain amount &mdash; but in that time their idea may be hijacked by someone else.  One entrepreneur said there should be a period of eight months to a year in which they could develop their products, have the prototype made and gear the product for the market and during that period there should be no danger that anyone else could hijack their idea.  There is a great future for innovators and developers of products. We should pursue this sector but we are not doing so strongly enough.</P>
      <P>The discussion of trade marks should be broadened to include ships which fly flags of convenience for a country other than the country of origin.  Ships from Belgium, for instance, may fly the Irish or British flag.  This Bill should prohibit this practice; people should not be allowed to fly a flag to enable them come here to poach fish, etc.  It should also prohibit the use of a phrase such as &ldquo;An tSeapáin tír a dhéanta&rdquo; on an article; it gives the impression that the item was Irish made when the Irish language is used on it.  That jargon should not be allowed as it is a way to get goods into a market.  All goods should clearly indicate where they are made.  It would help to promote Irish goods if one could clearly read on them that they were made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from those few points I agree with most of the Bill.  Heretofore, one had to apply to each country individually for a patent and I hope this legislation will mean that if one gets a patent for Ireland, automatically one will be covered in all EU countries.  I know it is not possible to legislate so that this procedure will apply worldwide but it should be.  It is now easy to make almost <Col N="1193" /> identical copies of articles, and there are many on the market.  The first to arrive were cameras; Kodak spent a lot of money developing cameras, then the Japanese introduced imitations which were equally good but with one little difference.</P>
    <P>We need to tighten up the law in this regard.  There is also a need to see where and how near imitations can resemble the real thing.  Those spending a lot of money and engaging in extensive research would want to know that they will get some return on their investment before their idea can be hijacked.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will try to incorporate the points I have raised to strengthen and reinforce it to ensure that products made in Ireland are safeguarded and secured so that we get the maximum from what our young people and entrepreneurs create and put on the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those Senators who contributed to the debate and for the positive tone of their contributions.  The Bill represents important legislation in the area of intellectual property.  It does not extend to covering patents, but it is comprehensive with regard to our trade marks law, which must be brought up to date.  Perhaps I inadvertently used the wrong word earlier when I said it was &ldquo;narrow&rdquo;.  I only meant it was narrow in the context of the rich agenda Senator Farrell had before I entered the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that trade marks do not receive as much attention as patents or copyright, but they are increasingly important business assets in the context of the Single Market.  For example, consumers who are faced with a multitude of products on supermarket shelves are most likely to opt for a brand which has an established reputation in the marketplace. This aspect intruded into the debate, but it is more a marketing question than one of protection of intellectual property.  Nevertheless, I accept it is important.  In a global market, one's <Col N="1194" /> ability to market one's product so that it is recognisable and strikes a chord with the consumer is especially important.</P>
    <P>However, as Senator Farrelly remarked, it costs a vast amount of money to launch products of this kind on the international marketplace. Senator Fahey referred to Kerrygold and Senator O'Sullivan referred to Baileys. It is interesting to note that, in the case of Baileys, there was a linkup with an international giant before it was feasible to do so.  Waterford Glass is the closest we have to an indigenous product that has some recognition on the world market, certainly in the USA. However, it is an extremely expensive business and costly for an indigenous Irish company to undertake alone.</P>
    <P>Companies which have invested in marketing and advertising their brands are entitled to protect their registered marks against infringement.  Section 14 defines those acts which constitute infringement, while sections 18 to 25 deal with infringement proceedings. Apart from the common law action for passing off, proprietors can take a civil action for delivery up of infringing goods, while section 25, to which Senator O'Sullivan referred, offers further remedy against infringement, whereby infringing goods, material or articles may be seized and brought before the District Court to be dealt with as the court sees fit.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey referred to the current extent of counterfeiting.  The information we have is that offences prosecuted to date have been of a relatively minor scale.  This is not to seek to give the impression that it is only ongoing on such a scale.  For example, a number of seizures, mainly of articles of clothing, were effected in the centre of Dublin in the run-up to Christmas.  Senator O'Sullivan described the kind of activity that can take place.  The business of teeshirts and jeans is a favourite where it is a relatively simple matter to stitch on the trade mark badge of a well known international manufacturer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> However, in discussions with the anti-counterfeiting group which I have had during the preparation of the Bill &mdash; it represents approximately 60 large companies with an international presence &mdash; I was persuaded that the danger of offences can arise in any area.  For example, in the UK the imitation of goods in the pharmaceutical sector underlines the indiscriminate pursuit of profit by counterfeiters.</P>
    <P>There is a need to protect consumers and the Bill tightens our legislation on infringement.  It should be remembered, however, that the trade mark owner has the primary responsibility to protect his mark.  He now has the choice of taking a common law action for passing off, a civil action for infringement or seeking to have infringing goods seized following the application to the District Court. In this respect, and with regard to the point made on the protection of Irish food labels, such as Kerrygold, I would draw attention to section 98 which facilitates my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, in preventing the registration abroad of marks which are misleading as to the Irish origin of the goods or services involved.</P>
    <P>I do not have details on prosecutions of patent or trade mark infringements, as queried by Senator Farrelly, but I refer to section 25, which I had inserted in the Bill by way of amendment during its progress through the other House. To reassure those Senators who raised this matter, let met say that section 25 contains a far reaching set of measures. In addition to the powers already provided, it gives the power of warrant and seizure to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the section is not just to address the fact that some of these products, to which reference has been made, are being sold in Henry Street or wherever, but to enable the Garda to take effective action at the source of production, which is the real problem.  If there are back street operations where teeshirts, jeans or whatever are being fabricated and being represented as <Col N="1196" /> something they are not, the gardaí now have effective powers and measures they can take to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I invite Senators to read the section. Its terms are draconian but I am persuaded as to its necessity.  It deals with the point made by Senator O'Sullivan. The Senator also mentioned the phenomenon of passing off, which is a separate offence and provided for in the Bill.  It is more appropriate to her description of perfumes that are being represented as something they are not, and so on.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the cornerstone of the Bill, Council Directive 89/104/EEC, which has substantially reduced the differences in trade marks legislation between member states.  I can confirm to Senator Howard that I would like to see the Bill enacted and the necessary rules put in place as close as possible to 1 April, the common deadline. However, some work needs to be done on it after it completes its progress through both Houses.  While this Bill took longer than anticipated to publish, I hope Senators find that it deals comprehensively with the changes which have taken place since the Trade Marks Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>I do not dispute the wisdom of Senator O'Sullivan's comments, which reflect comments made in the other House in relation to how we transpose Council Directives into domestic law.  I am persuaded that there ought to be discussion of the directives as they progress, either by one of the Houses of the Oireachtas or by a joint committee of both Houses.  It would be helpful to the Minister who is representing Ireland in Brussels on whatever issue if there was a sounding board here where the issue could be teased out while the directive is in progress at European level.  It takes a directive long enough, generally speaking, to be progressed for us to be able to catch up with domestic legislation and to have some meaningful discussion here.  I do not know whether the new Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs can facilitate that or <Col N="1197" /> whether another joint committee of the House would do so.</P>
    <P>Council Regulation 40/94 dealt with the creation of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market for trade marks and designs, which is located in Alicante in Spain.  This office will process community trade mark applications from April 1996 and applicants can obtain the protection of their marks through the Community by means of a single registration with this office.  In answer to Senator Howard's query, both systems will continue to obtain and both are quite separate.  Equally, ratification of the Madrid Protocol will enable proprietors to obtain wider protection of their marks in countries which are party to the Protocol.  Significant savings should accrue from making a single application to the World Intellectual Property Organisation in Geneva rather than applying to each national trade mark office where registration is described.  The new facility in this Bill to register service marks has also been warmly welcomed and over 3,000 applications have been received by the Patents Office to date.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan referred to drinks which have similar names and packaging to established brands.  In relation to counterfeiting, the Bill combats infringement by protecting the registered trade mark from use by unauthorised persons.  Where the mark itself is not infringed the trade mark owner must rely on an action for passing off, the particular offence to which the Senator referred.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard raised a query on my comments on how marks are registered and what rights are conferred by registration. These issues are set down in the directive; national legislation must adopt a common approach to them. There are also some discretionary elements in the directive but we must have uniformity on the key questions which are addressed in articles 2 and 3 of the directive.</P>
    <P>Our national system and the Community trade marks system are separate. The Community trade mark office will <Col N="1198" /> only register marks which are not in conflict with any marks on national registers.  It will be, therefore, harder to register a Community trade mark than a national one.  A national mark is registered if there is no objection, but if an application is received to register a Community mark, a search of national registers will be made.</P>
    <P>On the question of the &ldquo;absolute monopoly&rdquo;, my view is that a person might be allowed to use, for example, the word &ldquo;Euro&rdquo; in a trade mark.  This will not prevent other owners from obtaining registration of other marks containing the same word.  It cannot be an absolute monopoly; if this were the case a creative property owner could register a particular mark which, because it contained a generic word, prevented another person registering a perfectly legitimate product name containing the same generic word.  Section 17 provides for disclaimers.  The controller might require a disclaimer in respect of a particular element of a trade mark such as the word &ldquo;Euro&rdquo; which I used as an example in the case given.</P>
    <P>This legislation does not cover flags of convenience and goods which are presented to the consumer as being of Irish origin.  It does, however, include a provision in section 98 which allows opposition to be mounted in other countries against registration of marks which are misleading as to Irish origin.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general support for the legislation.  It is desirable, as has been hinted at by most speakers, that we conclude it as speedily as possible.  No substantive point of opposition has been raised.  It is predominantly a technical Bill and in many ways quite a complex one, but it seeks to achieve the three simple goals that I set out.  The main thrust of objections in the other House related to the question of counterfeiting and different aspects of fraud relating to that.  The measures introduced in the Bill greatly strengthen it and the representatives of some lobby groups have expressed their satisfaction arising from that.</P>

Is there a section within the Garda where this legislation will be policed?  Is anybody responsible at this time for investigating counterfeiting, for collecting intelligence on it, for giving the Minister a feel for what is happening in the market?

      <P>The substance of the main representations made to me by industry in general and the anti-counterfeiting group, which represents some of the leading international marks, was that it was a question of the powers available. <Col N="1200" /> I understand it is also the view of the Garda Síochána that this issue involves a question of the powers available as distinct from enforcement.  However, I should not mislead the House on the point of it being the primary duty of the trade mark owner to protect that mark. In discussions I had with trade mark owners they were generally satisfied with that fact, provided the law was updated and the Bill contained provisions to confer powers of action on the Garda.  I presume it is, though not exclusively, a matter for the fraud squad.</P>
      <P>Section 25 of the Bill states that any garda can act on foot of the powers provided. Following that, it is a matter for the trade mark owner to protect his own mark.  This issue involves the protection of intellectual property.  We can only set down the legislative framework which the trade mark owner can then use to vindicate his ownership.</P>

      <P>Section 8 (1) (c) states that the following shall not be listed as trade marks:</P>
      <P>. . . . trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which may serve, in trade, to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, the time of production of goods or of rendering of services, or other characteristics of goods or services;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Committee Stage has been taken unexpectedly and, therefore, I must be careful when I state that this provision was imported from the 1963 Act.  However, if memory serves, that was the case.  I am assured that this provision is internationally accepted. My main reason of confidence in this regard is that neither the industry nor the agents' association is concerned about this definition.  For example, electricity could not be registered as a trade mark or something which seeks to convey that generic impression.  While it might appear to be quite broad, I am assured the definition is internationally accepted or, to put it another way, that which constitutes a trade mark is internationally accepted.  We felt it necessary to include the explicit grounds for refusal of registration in this section.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister of State's argument on the grounds that the definition is internationally accepted and that is was imported from the 1963 Act.  If that is the case, the definition has stood for over 30 years and, if the fears I expressed have not materialised in that time, I am prepared to accept it.</P>

      <P>Section 9 deals with specially protected emblems which cannot be used in the construction of a trade mark.  On the spur of the moment I have tried to identify the emblems in question.  The national flag, the harp and the shamrock obviously enter the reckoning under this section.  I am aware that ministerial consent can be given for the use of specially protected emblems.  I do not foresee anyone using the national flag to construct a trade <Col N="1202" /> mark, but I can foresee a tendency to use the shamrock or the harp.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan referred to certain Irish beverages and, in that context, it has been a welcome development to see the number of Irish pubs being established in cities in central and eastern Europe.  I am aware of one such establishment which is situated in a country in south-central Europe &mdash; outside the European Union &mdash; which I recognised because there was a large shamrock on display at the front of the building.  Is there an expectation that many people will apply to use the shamrock, harp or other emblems in this manner?  What is the Minister of State's attitude to such applications?</P>

      <P>This provision is probably as old as the State and is certainly as old as the 1963 Act.  The saving grace is that section 9 (1) provides that trade marks consisting of such emblems shall not be registered unless the controller is satisfied that consent for their use has been given by the Minister.  A person may seek to register a product using the shamrock in some shape or form and, where this might normally be rejected out of hand, the controller reserves discretion as to whether that registration can proceed.  The experience is that this has worked reasonably well in practice.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Section 9 provides that the controller must be satisfied that consent for its registration has been given by the Minister.  The Minister of the day would need to be satisfied that unfair advantage was not being conferred on a particular company or, alternatively, that damage was being done to national standing as a result of permitting the use of an emblem which can be associated with the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reasonably satisfied with the provisions of this section when they are taken in conjunction with those of section 12.  However, section 10 (2) refers to &ldquo;the likelihood of confusion on the part of the public&rdquo;.  I am sure that the extent to which the public may or may not be confused is a matter which can be decided by the courts.  It is not a popular thing for a politician to state, but there is daily evidence that sections of the public are confused about certain issues.  If the Minister of State is satisfied with the inclusion of the term to which I referred, I accept his decision.  However, the matter of public confusion is a very broad one.  Is it correct that the courts will interpret this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately that will be the case.  The initial judgment would be of some value in the sense that it would be refused if it is likely to cause confusion in the public mind as between one product and another.  Ultimately, the court will decide.  It happens all the time and such a case is listed today.</P>

      <P>Services are a new element in the Bill.  For example, what is the position if I am a shoemender based in Limerick and I use a certain name for the business, but somebody else wishes to set up a shoemending business in County Donegal and use the same mark?  I have no intention of bringing my business to County Donegal. Is there more leniency in terms of one company using a brand name in one part of the country and another which wishes to use the same name in another part?  This aspect struck me in terms of services as opposed to goods which are not as easily transferred from one geographic area to another.  I may be catching the Minister on the hop regarding this matter but it might arise when services <Col N="1204" /> are brought under the banner of trade marks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The application of this law to services is relatively new but the phenomenon to which the Senator referred happens already in the trade mark area and such cases are contested from time to time.  If somebody carries out or provides a particular service and they have no interest beyond their local clientele, they are not likely to seek registration as it is of no value to them. However, the opposite point is that somebody elsewhere may consider that it is a great idea and steal it.  As I said, the primary responsibility is placed on the trade mark owner to protect the intellectual property in the mark. However, if they do not seek to do so, there is no recourse to the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>We are moving relatively fast and I overlooked a point I wished to raise.  Section 10 (2) states:</P>
      <P>A trade mark shall not be registered if because&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  it is identical with an earlier trade mark and would be registered for goods or services similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is protected,</P>
      <P>What is the position if a product, which should be registered as goods or services, is substantially or entirely different from those to which the earlier trade mark applies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the particular circumstances and the controller must decide.  Off the top of one's head, it would be difficult to understand the motivation if the goods being offered for sale are substantially different.  Why would one want to call margarine butter or Kerrygold if what one is selling is margarine?  Where a dispute arises, the controller must make the decision.  If it is an identical mark, one starts from the presumption that one is unlikely to be successful.  This is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> Subsection (3) implements article 4.3 and 4.a of the directive by conferring broader protection on trade marks which have a reputation.  It provides for a trade mark which is identical with or similar to an earlier such mark to be refused registration even where the goods or services for which registration is sought are not similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is protected. This broader protection may be invoked where the use of the later mark would take unfair advantage of or be detrimental to the distinctive character or repute of the earlier mark.  If one is seeking to register an identical mark, one is already starting on the presumption that one is likely to be refused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reverting somewhat to the discussion on section 10. Section 14 states that a person shall infringe a registered trade mark if that person uses in the course of trade a sign which is identical.  I refer in particular to the word &ldquo;identical&rdquo; as the Minister used it in relation to section 10.  Subsection (2) (a) also includes the word &ldquo;identical&rdquo; but subsection (2) (b) uses the word &ldquo;similar&rdquo;.  Ultimately, a court will adjudicate in that regard but will the Minister indicate why the word &ldquo;identical&rdquo; is used twice and the word &ldquo;similar&rdquo; once?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The first states the obvious.  If it is an identical mark, one infringes the right of the person who registered the mark.  That is straightforward. Subsection (3) provides that the <Col N="1206" /> registration of a trade mark does not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using in a particular locality an earlier unregistered trade mark which could only claim rights in that locality.  It must be read in conjunction with section 10 (4) (a) &mdash; where, ironically, the Senator raised the point.  This provides for the existence of an earlier unregistered mark which confers the right to prohibit use of a later mark, for example, through an action for passing off.</P>
      <P>To be a barrier to the registration of a later mark, the current subsection protects the rights of those who are unable to take advantage of section 10 (4) (a) because their rights apply only in an area so restricted that they cannot claim sufficient right to do this.  It cannot always be black and white in terms of the presentation made to the controller. As in section 10, if it is identical, one can start from the presumption that one will be ruled out.  However, elements of it may also be similar.  In that case, the other considerations come into play and, as the Senator identified, it refers back to section 10 (4) (a).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with orders for the disposal of infringing goods, material or articles and the type of order a court should make.  Subsection (1) (a) states: &ldquo;for an order that they may be destroyed or forfeited to such person as the Court thinks fit,&rdquo;.  To what type of person would the forfeited goods be returned?  In his reply to the debate on Second Stage the Minister of State referred to certain recent events.  I understand that situation, which involved clothing, although the value to the people to whom they would be <Col N="1207" /> returned is questionable.  I could accept a court making an order for the goods to be destroyed, but what is the justification for the court making an order for the goods to be returned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is a very wide ranging power.  As Senator Howard said, there is no point in dwelling on the kind of circumstances in which the court could order destruction. However, the section was framed in this way to give the court the sole discretion. For example, the Garda might stumble on stolen goods, such as glassware, to which a particular sign was being attached.  The court might then, in its sole discretion, decide, rather than ordering the destruction or simple forfeiture of the goods, to render them up to the company which could establish a claim to ownership.</P>

    <Title>Competition in Retail Banking: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. F. Quinn Mr. F. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, mindful of the wide benefits that could flow from greater competition in retail banking, calls on the Government to facilitate and actively encourage the early <Col N="1208" /> emergence of a third major banking group through the operation of commercial forces in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister for Finance to the House.  He attends this House regularly but I appreciate his attendance here because this motion is important enough to deserve to be considered as opposed to last minute attention.</P>
    <P>Essentially, this motion is about competition, so let me begin by saying a little about my views on competition.  I believe competition is and should be the main engine of business growth.  It is the most effective item in our toolbox to stimulate an efficient business economy which delivers what customers need. These beliefs are not ideological ones; they are purely pragmatic.  I attach no mystic significance to the concept of competition as such; I see it purely as a means to a desirable end.</P>
    <P>My beliefs are based firmly on my observations on what works and does not work in business.  In my experience competition is a powerful motivating force &mdash; perhaps the most powerful one. It motivates companies because it gives them the best possible reason to be good at their jobs, put the customer first and have the lowest prices possible.</P>
    <P>In my experience competition is also a powerful sanitising force.  Without competition, businesses tend to get lazy. They tend to look inward at themselves rather than outward at the real world. They give in to the temptation of suiting themselves, not their customers.  They become inefficient and lose their cost-effectiveness.</P>
    <P>For companies that suffer in any of these ways a strong dose of competition is a very good thing indeed.  Overnight, they have to transform themselves or risk going to the wall.  That is why it is good that so many State companies are now being forced out into the competitive world.  The EU is a factor in this, of course, as it pushes through the liberalisation of sectors, such as telecommunications and air transport; but I think the Government now acknowledges that full and open competition in <Col N="1209" /> the public sector is a desirable thing in itself, regardless of any pressure from the EU.</P>
    <P>This motion before the House tonight springs from the belief that full and open competition is equally desirable in all parts of the private sector too.  One part of the private sector which does not have satisfactory competition is retail banking, which in Ireland is dominated by a virtual duopoly of the two biggest banks: Bank of Ireland and AIB.  There are other banks, of course, but they lack the critical mass which the two big players have.  None of the smaller banks can compete effectively with the two big ones unless they grow considerably beyond their present size and the only way a smaller bank can grow in that way is by acquisition.</P>
    <P>Let me demonstrate how the Irish banking customer suffers from the existing situation.  If we look at the gross margins achieved by the Irish banks and compare them to the gross margins in other marketplaces, we see an interesting pattern.  The gross margin is the difference between what banks pay on average to borrow money and what they earn on average by lending it.  Just as in every other business one buys and sells, they borrow and lend.  In Ireland that gross margin is higher, much higher, than it is in the UK and it is much higher than it is in the US.  I picked those two comparisons because those are the markets in which the Irish banks have themselves been players. When they operate in those countries, they must accept a far lower gross margin than they are able to impose on their Irish customers.</P>
    <P>In reality, any comparison one makes between Ireland and any other country will show exactly the same pattern &mdash; the gross margin is higher in Ireland.  My contention is that this disparity flows directly from the absence of sufficient competition in the Irish retail banking market.  It was recognition of facts like this that led to the idea of a third banking force.  If there was a third player big enough to compete on equal terms with Bank of Ireland and AIB, the competitive <Col N="1210" /> pressures would be greatly increased to the immediate benefit of the customer, especially the business customer.</P>
    <P>Also behind the idea of a third banking force was the notion that Irish businesses were being held back by a less than entrepreneurial approach on the part of the two big banks.  Increase the competitive pressure, the argument goes, and banks will compete seriously with each other to lend funds to Irish business; in this way one stimulates economic growth.  The present lack of effective competition in banking, many people argue, is holding back our growth.</P>
    <P>The key question and the nub of this debate is; how do you bring about a third banking force?  You can do it in one of two ways: you can either have the State do it; or you can let market forces do it.  Many of the people who originally advocated the third banking force wanted the State to do it.  I was one of their number when I was chairman of An Post and I argued the possibilities of doing so &mdash; I have now changed my mind.  Those who advocate a State-owned third banking force wanted to throw together ACC, ICC, TSB and An Post to create a massive State owned bank to stand up against Bank of Ireland and AIB.</P>
    <P>However, when they tried to make that happen, the flaws in the approach showed up right away.  Those banks would not have mixed well together. Even if they had, they would not have produced the kind of animal that would compete effectively with the two big players.  There were other flaws, which I will come to later, but the important thing is that the idea of creating a third force in banking through State intervention has failed.  Whether people want to admit it or not, that is the reality.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, however, the need for a third banking force remains just as strong as ever and market forces are seeking to do what the State has been unable to do.  Unfortunately, far from facilitating and encouraging this highly desirable process as I believe it should, <Col N="1211" /> it seems the State is actively seeking to frustrate it.  This has come to a head over the issue of the sale of the TSB. There are potential buyers for the TSB and acquiring the TSB could take a buyer a long way down that road to where it could compete effectively with the two big players.</P>
    <P>The TSB wants to go along that route. It has done its strategic thinking and knows teaming up with another retail bank makes far more sense than getting into bed with the likes of ACC and ICC. A solution is emerging, therefore, which is based on market forces and market realities.  I believe we should be encouraging that way forward, not frustrating it.</P>
    <P>The refusal to approve the sale of the TSB appears to be based on ideology rather than practical realities.  It is not more competition which some people want; it is a State bank.  I believe they are wrong and that the State would be no good at running a bank.  There is always a great temptation to bring the State into banking, either by nationalising all the banks or by setting up State banks in competition with the private sector.  Either way one would go a long way around the world to find a single example of this working well.  When one nationalises banks, all of a sudden they become less efficient and less effective. They often start losing money where previously they made money.</P>
    <P>France is a good example of a country where they have nationalised and denationalised banks like the swings of a yo-yo.  They have not found that it worked or benefited the customers.  It has ended up costing the French taxpayer a packet, as the recent example of Credit Lyonnais demonstrates very well.</P>
    <P>What makes us so confident we could create a State banking force that could take on the might of AIB and Bank of Ireland on their own ground overnight? What makes us so confident that we could create a dynamic, thrusting, customer driven organisation from a merger of existing bodies?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> The real danger is that a State bank would end up with all the bad business, leaving the commercial banks to cream off the profitable business.  It is a crucial point which has not been made too often or strongly enough.  A new State bank could have the effect of increasing the existing banks' profits while at the same time putting a burden of loss on the State and the taxpayer.  Is that what we really want to do?  Surely not.  I can see the arrival of a State bank being welcomed by the two big banks as it would take all the nasty business they do not really want.</P>
    <P>We must face up to some hard facts. A fully commercial third banking force would be no soft touch.  Of course the State bank could be directed by the Government to have looser lending criteria than the other banks.  One could direct it to make riskier loans.  The inevitable consequence is not just that a State bank would lose money &mdash; perhaps a mountain of money &mdash; but that it would attract all the bad risks like flies to a honey pot.  The existing banks would be delighted and one would find them refusing people and businesses loans more readily in the knowledge that there is a State bank of last resort which is ready to handle all that rubbishy business.  That is why the concept of a third banking force run by the State is fundamentally flawed.  It would end up making things worse, not better.</P>
    <P>However, the thought behind the idea is sound.  The banking sector does need more competition and competition is the customer's best friend.  We are still living with the hangover of the old banking cartel which effectively removed choice from the customer and left too much power in the hands of the banks.  What the State should be doing is encouraging more competition, not by providing the competition itself but by creating the conditions under which competition can flourish.  I suggest that needs immediate action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a privilege to second Senator Quinn's motion.  I need not point out that I am in no way an <Col N="1213" /> authority, as Senator Quinn is, on this area.  Any expertise I have ends at about the 1890s and even there it would be questionable.  That is not a joke; I wish it were.</P>
      <P>I am taken by the logic of Senator Quinn's presentation.  I do not speak as a knocker of banks.  Any effective economy needs an efficient banking system and it is the last area to which ideology of any type should be applied.  However, we do not have the required level of competition in the retail sector.  We have two very big, and in many respects very successful, banking groups.  That is a small number even when compared with other small countries.</P>
      <P>I am open to correction but I understand that in Finland there are four banks of roughly comparable size &mdash; Finnish banks and three smaller ones &mdash; in addition to a number of smaller multinational banks.  I gather that there are three banks in Denmark.  Again I am open to correction because this information was gleaned at high speed recently, given the research facilities available in this institution when one wants to find things out quickly.  One of the Danish banks resulted from a merger between a savings bank and a post office bank, so post offices in Denmark are now banking outlets in some respects.  I am sure the Minister and his officials know far more about these things than I, but it would be interesting to make comparisons with other countries.</P>
      <P>We do lack competition.  The margins are very high by the standards of the economies in which our own banks are competing, as Senator Quinn has pointed out.  I am not an admirer of the American system.  It is a dreadful country in which to try and get cash quickly through the banking system, which is the major role of banking systems as far as I am concerned.  There is a question about the need for more competition.  It is curious to see the way the banks are sometimes used in debate when issues of competition and enterprise arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland was probably unfortunate, historically speaking, in acquiring the <Col N="1214" /> then English system rather than the continental system of banks in the 19th century. The assumption was that the English system was best for us because it was English.  The English system was based on the assumption that there was an adequate supply of indigenous entrepreneurs, which we did not have.  Our circumstances approximated much more closely to then continental circumstances. That tradition and mind-set has probably continued in a number of ways, even though circumstances have changed in terms of supply of entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>I represent a system which has itself been lambasted for failing to provide support for enterprise culture.  The Green Paper on Education contained a famous chapter which criticised the education system as responsible for the lack of indigenous enterprise.  When the spurious data on which that was based was exposed as grossly misconceived, to put it politely, I was amused to see that the banks came in as whipping boys for several months for failing to make the advances to small businesses which were deemed to be required.  It may be that the small business sector has legitimate gripes against the banks in certain respects, but the question still arises as to how one gets more competition.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn said it can only come from the State or market sector.  The proposed ICC, ACC, TSB merger is now generally accepted as ill conceived. It represented an effort to blend identities and mind-sets which are difficult to blend and which would not in any case give the scope which would be required to compete effectively with the two major banks.</P>
    <P>I do not speak as an anti-State ideologist, quite the contrary in many respects.  The idea of a State bank on this scale seems simply unacceptable for the reasons Senator Quinn detailed from a business perspective.  I would look at it from the point of view of political culture.  Whatever the success or failure of State banks in other economies and political cultures, the potential for abuse in our political culture, even <Col N="1215" /> though that culture may be changing, is simply too horrendous to contemplate. There is no way the State could allow the State bank to fail.  It could not allow AIB to fail when problems arose in that area.  There is no way it could allow a State bank, however inadequate or ineffective its management, to fail.  That would be a recipe for disaster in terms of the type of activity in which such a bank might engage.</P>
    <P>We are therefore thrown back on the market.  I too am a great believer in competition.  The only qualification I would make to his view that without competition businesses tend to get lazy is that it is not only businesses which tend to get lazy; we all tend to get lazy without competition.  Dare I speak for academe, which has enjoyed a certain immunity from the perils of competition? It is quite remarkable how well it has performed in the absence of competition, but I have no doubt there is scope for improving that performance with a little competition.  Similarly, I have no doubt there is scope for improving the performance of the banks.  One might argue that it is remarkable how well the two main banks have performed in the absence of competition in certain respects.  It is not simply that the service to the customer from a new bank would conceivably be better but everybody's performance would improve.</P>
    <P>We all know there are suitors for TSB and there are advantages and disadvantages in the case of each potential suitor. However, if it is the case that the proposals are being blocked by ideology, the time should be up on that.  We cannot afford the price of ideology in terms of the quality of performance of this economy now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>In many respects we are performing remarkably well.  That is partly because everything that could conceivably have gone right in the last couple of years went right.  If everything had gone wrong, many of the kudos we have been paying ourselves and the growth rates <Col N="1216" /> we achieved would have plummeted.  I do not wish to deprive policy makers of the credit they deserve for having got things right, but we have also been lucky in that a number of contingencies came together in our favour.  These could also turn because we do not have control over them.  Therefore, the time is ripe to try to introduce a degree of competition &mdash; in the retail banking market in particular, as Senator Quinn mentioned &mdash; and I urge the Government to give favourable consideration to his proposals. If ideology is blocking these possibilities, it should no longer be allowed to do so.</P>

      <P>I wish to respond to the cogent and lucid exposition made by my cousin, Senator Quinn, and by Senator Lee.  I know it was not Senator Quinn's intention to suggest, as he seemed to do by inference, that either of the two current State banks were open to political interference and, as a consequence, were unprofitable.  The record actually shows the opposite is the case.</P>
      <P>When I tried to suggest that members of political parties and local authorities should not be bank directors I had my wings severely and promptly clipped.  I admitted that I had perhaps misjudged the situation.  However, I still held the view that it was incompatible for elected representatives of any political party to be on a bank board, for precisely that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was in no way to suggest &mdash; and I am referring now to Senator Fahey &mdash; that the individuals involved were engaged in any political wrongdoing.  It should also be said that both ICI and ACC are making profits.  Furthermore, a recent survey undertaken by ISME, the small and medium enterprises association, found that ACC Bank had the lowest range of bank fees and charges for those services normally used by small business customers.  In this sense we have State banks that are efficient, effective and make profits. That was not always the case, and the <Col N="1217" /> history of ACC is a sad story of political interference.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Lee's comments on how AIB Bank got into difficulties with ICI, no Government in any open society can afford a major banking crisis. That is why the Bank of England stepped in to ensure that Barings was, in effect, rescued.  Of course, private banks fail as well.  The lending policies of Hervé Abrer in Credit Lyonnais caused him to lose his shirt in MGM in Hollywood along with some very rich Japanese companies.  There are other reasons why banks fail, but I take the point made by Senator Quinn.</P>
    <P>Let me return to his central point about competition, which I share.  This Government is committed to the creation of vibrant and competitive markets in every sphere of economic activity with the aim of promoting economic development in Ireland.  In this context the Government is advancing on a general front while making progress in specific areas.</P>
    <P>Certain legislative provisions are important in considering this matter. The competition Act, 1991, confers on the competition Authority power to examine and investigate activities which may have the effect of distorting competition. As the House will know, the Government is now progressing an amendment to the Act by way of the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, which is currently on Committee Stage in the Dáil and will come before this House in due course.  This Bill strengthens the role of the Competition Authority by giving it enforcement powers and provides for heavy fines for those found to be engaging in unfair competition.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the appointment of a director of competition enforcement who will be empowered to investigate, either on his or her own initiative or as a result of complaints, alleged breaches of competition legislation. This is a significant improvement in the structure of competition regulation and also a necessary one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> The old system, whereby the enforcement of the Competition Act would fall primarily to private civil actions, has proven to be less than successful.  The seriousness of anti-competitive activity in Ireland was underlined in the findings of the Culliton/Moriarty report, which states that: &ldquo;there should be robust prosecution of policies to eliminate anti-competitive practices&rdquo;.  This policy position was subsequently endorsed unequivocally by the OECD, NESF and NESC, who called for enforcement powers to be granted to the Competition Authority.</P>
    <P>The present Bill reflects the Government's commitment to the elimination of anti-competitive practices in all spheres and the pursuit of those who endeavour to engage in such practices. In the specific area of banking some concerns have been expressed in the past at the dominant position of the two major banks in terms of market penetration. Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks together hold approximately 70 per cent of the retail banking market.</P>
    <P>For any competitor to participate effectively in this market it is essential that they can generate sufficient presence to secure the type of scale economies which can be realised through significant market share.  Achieving the necessary market share through internal growth is a difficult process in any event and is not a realistic option for the smaller banks in the short term.</P>
    <P>Also, the changing nature of the banking market and in particular &mdash; and this is a very pertinent point &mdash; the capital investment necessary to deliver technology based solutions was recognised as a major emerging determinant of the future structure of the banking market.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, also essential for the future development of banking and competition in the market that the smaller banks should have the opportunity of gaining access on reasonable terms to the payments systems and network infrastructure which is essential to modern methods of retail banking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> Major changes were also occurring in the banking market internationally.  As in many other areas of industry, the international market is moving at an accelerating rate towards greater globalisation. This has been obvious for some time in the manufacturing sector, and Ireland has experienced both the benefits and the hardships of the globalisation of manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>The banking industry has not been immune to these developments and, indeed, the international dimensions and the implications of developments in international capital markets are all known to Members of this House.  It is also essential to consider any proposal for change against the background of the move to economic and monetary union on 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in considering the issue of a third force in banking it was necessary not alone to look at the banks themselves, but also at related developments in the area of consumer protection and regulation of markets via competition legislation, and wider issues concerning international developments in terms of capital markets and the implications of monetary union.</P>
    <P>In this context the most obvious solution is not necessarily the most effective or the most expeditious one. Improving competition in a banking market, dominated in both market share and geographical representation by two major recognised players, is a complex business.  The Government, therefore, has been concerned with considering all the various options available to it in relation to the banking market in Ireland generally against the background of developments in both the domestic and international markets.  To this end a significant amount of work has been completed and other work is ongoing on various elements involved in creating the basis for improved competition. Some of this work has involved the processing of legislation in relation to competition generally, which at the same time contributes significantly to the development of a comprehensive <Col N="1220" /> regulatory framework encompassing the regulation and monitoring of competition in the banking sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to the clearing system operated under the auspices of the Dublin bankers clearing committee, the rules relating to the operation of the clearing system have been examined by the Competition Authority, which found that the system is not anti-competitive. The European Commission has also examined the operations of the Dublin bankers clearing committee and found that their operations are not anti-competitive.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, the time is now right to upgrade our payments systems to cater for the increasingly sophisticated demands of the markets.  An international drive to standardise and co-ordinate national initiatives in relation to the settlement of large value payments has been ongoing for some time.</P>
    <P>I understand that the European Commission is at an advanced stage in drafting a directive providing for the legal regulation of payment systems within the EU so as to ensure the smooth functioning of an area wide money market based on the Euro.</P>
    <P>The growth of international trade, the size of daily settlements, the increased use of electronic payments, and the volatility of trade flows have caused individual central banks to take steps to address the various risks arising in their own domestic payment systems.  From a competitiveness and prudential point of view it is important that the processing of Irish payments is at least equal to that of other EU member states.  The Government is particularly concerned to ensure that payment systems in the State remain effective, efficient and open in terms of access, and that the systems themselves do not add to or cause instability in the operation of the financial markets.</P>
    <P>Ireland cannot be immune to international developments and, as such, it is proposed to confer powers on the Central Bank in relation to the establishment, supervision and operation of payments <Col N="1221" /> systems in the State.  Work on these issues is currently at an advanced stage within my Department in the context of a new Central Bank Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the powers of the Competition Authority to investigate abuses of competition law and uncompetitive practices is also being strengthened by the Competition Bill currently at Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I should also make reference to the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.  This Act gives power to the Director of Consumer Affairs to investigate the basis of charges levied by credit agencies and finance houses.  The Act also provides that banks must get the approval of the Director of Consumer Affairs for any increase in their charges.  I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, that the provisions of this Act are due to come into force on 1 May 1996.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances it has not proved necessary to take action to tighten the regulatory framework and the Government has noted the fact that a number of banks have indicated they no longer require persons setting up in business and seeking capital funding to put up their homes as collateral for loans.  This is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>The developments I have mentioned thus far relate to the creation of a structural environment which will provide a firm foundation for the regulation of competition and the elimination of any suggestion of overpricing or price fixing in the provision of retail banking services in Ireland.  These are essential components in any drive to create greater vibrancy in the market.</P>
    <P>In considering the issue of greater commercial competition in the provision of retail banking services, the Government's objective is to foster greater competition both as regards costs and also in relation to the availability of funds.  Such a development could contribute significantly to improved competitiveness and greater business activity, which, in turn, will contribute to increasing prosperity and reduced employment.  This is the central <Col N="1222" /> thrust of Senator Quinn's thesis and I support and agree with it.</P>
    <P>In July 1994 consultants were appointed by my predecessor to identify the various options available to the Government in respect of ACC Bank, ICC Bank and the TSB.  The consultants completed their report in October 1994 and presented it to the Department.  On the basis of this study, proposals were prepared for the Government which set out a particular view on the way forward.</P>
    <P>When I took up office as Minister for Finance in December 1994, I was advised of this position.  I examined the papers on the matter and I concluded that the contextual framework for the study was too narrowly based.  The sum of the considerations, particularly the role of credit unions, who are now a major player in the financial sector for a large number of people and control funds of approximately £1 billion, and the ongoing role of An Post, which reaches out to an enormous number of people who would otherwise have no connection with the banking sector, was not in any way seriously addressed in the study to which I referred.</P>
    <P>The financial sector in general in Ireland is currently going through a period of change.  The demarcation line between the services offered by banks and building societies is becoming more blurred.  Competition is intense in some sectors and is increasing in others, putting pressure on margins.  The competition in the mortgage market is at such a rate that suppliers go on their knees to ask people to take loans whereas previously people had to go on their knees to ask for loans.  This demonstrates one of the components of the thesis of the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>This situation is due to extra competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Together with advancing technology, this will require the sector to commit large sums to investment. In recent times An Post has made strong advances in retail services.  It has <Col N="1223" /> also invested heavily in information technology and the automation of its counter services.  The credit unions have also made huge strides in the past few years, including the extensive introduction of information technology systems and major expansion of its community based branch network.  A Credit Union Bill is currently being drafted &mdash; I regret the long delay of this drafting &mdash; which will have the effect of significantly expanding the range of services which credit unions can offer, subject to the approval of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  The Bill will also consolidate and update the credit union legislation, reflecting the role of the modern credit union movement as a major player in the provision of personal financial services.</P>
      <P>These significant and ongoing changes in the nature of the market in personal banking services were given insufficient weight in the proposals presented to me when I took over the portfolio.  For the most part, consideration was limited solely to the commercial banks within the State sector.  I was, therefore, disappointed that matters had not proceeded further and that the broader framework had not been sufficiently addressed.</P>
      <P>When I took over the portfolio, a major amount of work remained to be completed before any serious consideration of the available options could commence.  To this end I met a wide range of interested parties, including representatives of the boards and staff of all the State banks and senior management in those banks which have expressed an interest in participating in any proposed restructuring of the various institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the life of this Government the issue of the future structure of the State banking sector, including the TSB, has been under continuous consideration, because the Government wishes to facilitate the State banks so that they can maximise their impact on Irish economic development as well as their own business success.  The wider <Col N="1224" /> role of An Post and the credit unions was also considered in this context.  The options for restructuring the State banks continue to be examined by me and a number of my Government colleagues with a view to identifying the most effective solution having regard to the nature of the individual institutions, their particular customer markets, the needs of the whole community in its broadest sense and developments in the EU.</P>
    <P>I appreciate this matter has been under consideration for some time, but if the matters I referred to earlier had been taken on board when the initial consideration was ongoing we might be further down the road at this stage.  The issue of how one might best restructure the banks in order to achieve our objectives in relation to the creation of a vibrant and competitive banking market is complex.  I know the need for detailed consideration is understood and appreciated by all those involved and I am assured they are continuing to compete profitably in their chosen marketplace, taking full advantage of the opportunities presented by the current economic climate.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong of me at this stage to make detailed statements about what may or may not happen until the matter has been resolved by the Government. Having said that, I must add that I recognise the matter has been under consideration for some time.  I am keenly aware of the need to ensure that employees and management in the institutions concerned should not be adversely affected by uncertainty regarding the eventual outcome.  This is why I have been at all times available to those most closely involved and have had numerous meetings with all the participants.</P>
    <P>This Government would, rightly, be attacked as irresponsible if it abused its position in the financial sector in any way.  I have therefore approached this issue in a careful and constructive way. It would be remiss of me not to take into account all the possible scenarios before arriving at a recommendation <Col N="1225" /> which can be put to the Government. However, the Government is at one on the overall objective, which is to arrive at the solution which best addresses the interests of all, in particular customers of the credit unions and An Post.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, most of the legislative requirements relating to the market at a general level have been clearly identified and the process of putting the appropriate regulatory framework in place is proceeding satisfactorily. The more complex aspect of the configuration of any restructuring within the market which would have sufficient market impact to be a major force, increasing competition and consumer choice, and which is oriented towards the promotion of enterprise and a socially inclusive agenda, is under serious consideration by me and my colleagues in Government.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for the opportunity to put on record my concerns in this area.  I share the view that what is behind the concept of a third banking force is to improve competition in the market sector, which everybody recognises is absent at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Quinn for introducing this motion on a timely occasion.  It is interesting that his cousin, the Minister for Finance, is here to respond to the debate.  While both of them favour competition, I align myself with Senator Quinn's concept of competition rather than the one outlined by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I support the motion, which calls on the Government to specify if the promise contained in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to establish a third banking force is now officially abandoned.  The Minister's speech is part of a series of speeches made by him which have tried to consign the concept to the trash bin.  <i>A Government of Renewal</i> states that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to the promotion of a vigorous Third Force in Banking.  Policy will be directed towards ensuring a major <Col N="1226" /> role for the existing State Banks and the TSB in any future restructuring.</P>
    <P>We would all agree with this.  However, the commitment seems to have disappeared into the rainbow of oblivion. Each week media reports state that the proposal for a third banking force is on or is off.  The only Government decision following these stories was to initiate leaks investigations.  The Garda have been despatched to interrogate journalists, officials and politicians.  Two weekends ago the latest instalment in this long running saga took place when the Tánaiste was reported to have scuppered the plans of the Government's subcommittee.  This report has been denied by the Tánaiste and he has claimed that the person who leaked the report, who could only have been a member of the subcommittee, was being mischievous about him.  I wonder who the leaker could be.</P>
    <P>It appears that a three way ideological tug about the third banking force is taking place at Government level.  Fine Gael wishes to sell off a majority stake in TSB while Labour is pressing for a new State led third banking force. Democratic Left does not wish to upset Fine Gael but also does not want an outright sell off of a stake in TSB.  This chaos and confusion, which has gone on for 14 months, cannot continue.  The &ldquo;hurry slowly&rdquo; mode must end.  The Government should announce its position, even if that position is that the Cabinet is unable to take a decision and the <i>status quo</i> will apply for the duration of this Administration.  That, at least, would be a decision.</P>
    <P>There is no indication in the Minister's comments that our situation now is any different from what it was 12 months ago.  There was a Dáil debate on this matter in February 1995 and following that debate the Minister for Finance briefed journalists that it was imminent and that work would be carried out during the following two weeks.  Nothing happened.  The matter was raised again in the Dáil in October 1995 and the Minister said that it would be put to <Col N="1227" /> Government for decision.  He said it would be wrong of him to make detailed statements about what might happen until the matter was resolved by Government.  It is clear that there is no agreement at Government level.  With due respect to the institutions involved, particularly State institutions such as ACC and ICC, the Government should come clean and at least indicate that there is a problem and that no decision is imminent.</P>
    <P>I have great regard for Deputy Ruairí Quinn in his capacity as Minister for Finance; he has been most effective. However, I am seriously disappointed with his speech this evening.  I agree with Senator Quinn's desire for a more competitive banking market.  At present two major banks control 70 per cent of the market, so there is an urgent need for more competition.  I disagree with the Minister's belief that the way to introduce competition into the banking sector is through legislation or regulation. Citing the Competition Act, other legislation and the development of a single currency as being effective mechanisms for introducing competition in the banking sector is simply making excuses.  I do not accept the examples the Minister offered.</P>
    <P>There is only one way to bring more competition into the banking market and that is to have more effective players who can compete with the two main banks.  We have seen many examples which show that the two main banks are not interested in competition for as long as they have a monopoly.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, we have seen situations where they have been challenged and where competition has been introduced into the market.</P>
    <P>Home loans and mortgages are a good example.  As a result of good legislation which was introduced to make building societies more competitive, there has been a remarkable improvement in the provision of mortgages and home loans.  Instead of having to go cap in hand to the banks for mortgages, the banks are competing with each other to <Col N="1228" /> give them to us.  In addition, they are offering much lower interest rates and, in particular, lower administrative costs. It is interesting to see that Bank of Ireland or AIB will cover all administrative costs which 15 to 18 months ago would have cost the consumer up to £1,500.  That is how to introduce competition in banking.  It will not arise as a result of regulation and legislation but as a result of politicians creating a third banking force which will be able to provide the type of competition that is necessary.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Quinn's motion. The uncertainty has inflicted immense damage on TSB, ACC and ICC, three State banks which we are anxious to see develop and go from strength to strength.  I am concerned that this paralysis is damaging Ireland's banking reputation both at home and abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Finance; he is a diligent visitor to the House.  I compliment Senator Quinn on the motion, although I must agree with the Minister that this issue requires more debate.  The subcommittee set up by the Minister should consider every aspect of this matter before a final decision is made.</P>
      <P>There are three areas where we can make the banking sector more competitive. Some areas of the market are well catered for while others are not.  The mortgage market is very well catered for at present.  There is a large number of building societies in addition to banks in that market and it is extremely competitive. In the last two years we have seen a constant reduction in mortgage interest rates, particularly for first time buyers. We need not worry about the mortgage market because there is sufficient competition in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that a commitment was given by the main banks <Col N="1229" /> regarding clearing houses.  The smaller banks have to pay considerable amounts of money to enter the clearing house system.  In the recent past the main banks promised they would reduce charges for clearing houses.  Since they have made such promises they should honour them, and if they do so small players in the market such as smaller building societies, banks and credit unions will benefit.</P>
    <P>The third area I wish to mention is banking for business.  There are two aspects to this and one of them relates to larger business.  Larger business is well catered for.  A check on the double A rate and the triple A rate will reveal that over the last year or two the band between the triple A rate for big business and the double A rate for small business has widened considerably. These rates should be brought more into line.  Big business people are well looked after by the two main banks and they control 70 per cent of the market.</P>
    <P>The area that concerns me is small business.  As a small business person, I believe small business is getting a bad deal from the banks.  The Minister should call on the banking institutions to reduce interest rates to small businesses. About 90 per cent of all businesses in Ireland are small &mdash; ten employees or less &mdash; and they are the real breadwinners for the economy.  If we are to build indigenous industries we have to concentrate more on small business. The small businesses tend to operate with the small banks.  Mortgages and big business are well catered for but we have to look after small businesses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the substance of the motion but I do not agree with what Senator Quinn has said about how a third banking force should be operated.  We must be careful.  The Minister's contribution considered ways forward and the Government is at one on the objective of arriving at a solution which best addresses the interests of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want the creation of a cartel of three banks.  We have a cartel of two already, which has not been good, <Col N="1230" /> particularly for the small business sector. Within a three to four year period the two main banks will make £1 billion out of the Irish people and I do not agree with that.  We should not now be in a hurry to allow a cartel of three to make perhaps £1.5 billion in a ten year period.  Is that the right way to proceed?</P>
    <P>As Lord Mayor of Cork in 1991-92, I was involved in the buying of the Dublin Savings Bank by the Cork and Limerick Savings Bank and the subsequent creation of the TSB.  That change did not appeal to all of the savers who had put money into the Cork Savings Bank since the early 1940s.  We should not give the impression that the banks did not build fast enough.  Where did the Munster and Leinster Bank come from? The Leinster Bank joined with the Munster Bank and they created the AIB.  All the banks started small.</P>
    <P>A third of the people bank with the two major banks and each of them makes about £100 a year for every person in the country.  How does that come back to us?  Why should we not try to get the best out of what we already have?  If we have silver in ICC, ACC and the TSB it is worth gold and I do not want to give that up easily.  Ireland is the best place in the world for banking because there is nowhere else with higher margins &mdash; I do not think Senator Quinn would disagree.  I will not allow our silver, so to speak, to be taken away so that the people no longer have it.</P>
    <P>Let us be careful to get the best for all, our young people in particular.  That has been done with the building societies and mortgage provision.  The credit unions are working well; An Post is also working well and making profits.  I am in no hurry to create a cartel of three and there is a danger that could be the result.  However, I am in a hurry to create a third banking force, but we should put it in competition with those who want to earn £1 billion from the people over the next three to four years. I remember the banks were making profits of £14 million a year not so long ago, yet this year the AIB will report a profit <Col N="1231" /> of £365 million.  That is a large amount for a small State.  Should we not do the same for ourselves?</P>
    <P>If we want a third banking force why not give the managing director a large amount of money to run it properly? We should not refuse that simply because it may be a State operation.  Do we say that of ESB or Telecom Éireann because they are now being rationalised and make money?</P>
    <P>I do not want an impression to be given that we are in a hurry.  We should not be.  We have silver and it is worth gold and we should look for gold in return for that silver.  I am aware of how individuals can suffer at the hands of the banks.  I am also aware of the motivation that credit unions can give people to better themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the concept of a third banking force and I am in sympathy with the motion put forward by the Independent Senators.  Like many of my colleagues, I am a private consumer of banking services, unlike Senator Quinn, who is a business consumer. There are complex issues to be decided before a third banking force could become a reality.  The questions raised are valid and will require much deliberation by the Government and the proponents of the third banking force.</P>
      <P>Who will it benefit in the end? The groundswell of support for a third banking force developed as a result of what were perceived by the ordinary five eighths of the population as enormous profits being generated by two banking groups.  They seemed to have been in an anti-competitive, cartel situation which made life difficult for the individual consumer and small businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody once said of their philosophy that they were very left on some issues and very right on others.  I come down on the side of the right in this case because I am a subscriber to the concept of the free market, particularly in areas that impact on the consumer.  I would never suggest that Bank of Ireland or AIB are in the business of actively discouraging <Col N="1232" /> business.  They make enormous profits by Irish standards, but in the European context they are small players.  The international record of AIB and Bank of Ireland, particularly in the US, has not been covered in glory.  They do not have a monopoly on corporate wisdom other than their obvious success in Ireland.</P>
    <P>If the two main banks are successful in Ireland and in an increasingly global market where rationalisation is the order of the day and where, although small may be beautiful it is not very effective, they should not be penalised for generating profits for their shareholders. Much of this debate may be about whether the two main banks are carrying out best practice in their business methods and not necessarily just about creating a third banking force.  As Senator Cregan rightly mentioned, a third banking force may become a possible addition to the existing cartel rather than a panacea for the real or perceived difficulties consumers face because of the existence of two banks.</P>
    <P>Are these banks operating in the public interest, despite their profit motive and the fact that they are public companies owned by their shareholders rather than the State?  Are they operating in a competitive environment? Are they breaking the law? Statistics and research seem to suggest they are making as much money as they can for their shareholders while, at the same time, being conscious of their responsibilities to their customers.</P>
    <P>It may seem I am against the idea of a third banking force but I am not. Fianna Fáil policy is strongly in favour of it; it is part of our party's manifesto and it was part of <i>A Programme for a Partnership Government.</i> I have little difficulty with the wording of the motion which includes the phrase &ldquo;mindful of the wide benefits that could flow from greater competition in retail banking&rdquo;.  However, I remain unconvinced that the type of bank, a third State owned bank, is in the long-term interests of the consumer.  I am not anti-State; <Col N="1233" /> we have some excellent semi-State bodies which could hold their own in any competitive environment.</P>
    <P>Would a third State banking force, which is not mentioned in the motion but which seems to be the thinking in certain Government circles, be beneficial? The main difficulty is that there are three parties in the Government which have different philosophical approaches to a third banking force. This idea has been around for some years but it does not seem to have progressed very far.  References have been made to the Competition Authority and the Minister mentioned the complexities of a third banking force.  It would help if the Government outlined its thinking in this regard rather than referring to global views and nebulous attitudes.</P>
    <P>What advantages will a third banking force have for consumers?  I understand that approximately £10 billion is currently held on deposit in banks, which is generating 0.05 per cent interest.  If banks are concerned about being responsible, why do they not advise their customers that they could get a better rate of interest elsewhere?  We do not need a third banking force to do that.  Would a third banking force become part of the existing system where profit motive is its only <i>raison d'être</i> or would it help to reduce the high charges imposed on businesses in the private sector?  Would the recent move by building societies, such as the Irish Permanent, into a public company and the rumoured flotation of Irish Nationwide and First National have any impact on the creation of a third banking force?  What role would the post office network play?  It has been suggested that the banking facilities in post offices should be extended to respond to customers' needs.  It has also been suggested that the post office system is under-used.  This might help to allay the fears of people in rural areas where post offices are being closed.</P>
    <P>There are a variety of aspects to this complex question.  I agree with a third banking force if it will benefit this country <Col N="1234" /> in the long term.  We should publish a discussion document and then draw up proposals in this regard.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion and I compliment the Independent group for tabling it.  The motion includes the phrase &ldquo;mindful of the wide benefits that could flow from greater competition in retail banking&rdquo;.  This is an important note of caution.  The Minister concluded in the same vein by stating: &ldquo;It is a complex and difficult issue, but it is more important that we get it right than that we proceed with undue haste&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The idea of a third banking force was put forward by the Labour Party prior to the last general election and every party in the last two Governments included it in their Government programmes. That would not be the case if the idea did not have merit.  All Members are aware of the need for a third banking force.  There is considerable dissatisfaction among the public about the current state of affairs in the banking system.  People believe they are not getting a fair deal from the major banks.  They resent the high charges and their slowness in passing on interest rates when they benefit the customer. They want changes in this regard. Groups representing employers, particularly small businesses, also feel that the banking system is not playing its role in providing financial capital for enterprise.  Small businesses have the potential to deliver much needed employment growth.  If we have a third banking force and competition in this area, the problem of unemployment could be dealt with more effectively.</P>
      <P>Despite not having achieved our objective in relation to the establishment of a third banking force, there has been some progress in this area.  I refer to the Consumer Credit Act which comes into effect in May.  This legislation should buttress consumers when dealing with credit institutions and it should help to alleviate concern about banking operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> There seems to be cross-party support for some from of increased competition in the banking sector.  I presume this has been delayed for so long because of disagreements over how to implement it. Assuming there is widespread support for increased competition in the banking sector, it should be State led.  In response to the argument that all we need is further competition in this sector, the banks stated there is increased competition in the sector.  The recent floating of the Irish Permanent and the proposed expansion of the services supplied by the credit unions are cases in point.  Individual customers are likely to benefit from this increased activity. Nevertheless, to ensure this is carried through with or without a third banking force, there is a case to be made for a bank clearing system.</P>
    <P>I compliment the credit unions on the work they have done over the years. Circumstances often cause great difficulty for people who would never go to banks but credit unions come to their assistance and they have done tremendous work.  Everyone involved in that movement deserves our thanks for what they have done for the less well-off in our community and for enabling people to escape the trap of moneylenders when dealing with common expenditure such as First Holy Communion or Confirmation &mdash; they can borrow a small amount and pay it back at a reasonable rate.</P>
    <P>Better and cheaper services for personal customers is only one part of the argument for a third banking force. Another aspect is support for small and medium sized enterprises.  I reject the conspiracy theories which abound in this area; experience in my constituency indicates that banks are prepared to lend to some businesses but not to others.  Some find it easy to get start up capital: others, with ideas which are risky but more likely to be of long-term benefit to the community, do not fare as well.  Those starting up businesses under the enterprise boards sometimes find difficulty with banking services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> The existing State sector plays a useful role in this regard.  The ICC has managed the Government small business fund very well.  Take-up of this special fund was rapid, confirming the suspicion of Members of both Houses that there is employment generating potential which has not been tapped.  The problem is that private institutions are solely interested in profit.  They have responsibility not only to the community but also to their shareholders.  The advantage of a State-led third force is that it could take a longer-term view.</P>
    <P>The State sector also has the ability to deliver in a way that the other possibilities under discussion do not.  If we believe competition is necessary, particularly against the two larger banks, the size of the competing force must attain the appropriate critical mass.  The State has at its disposal the ACC, the ICC, TSB and An Post.  From these, and possibly only from these, can a bank of sufficient size be created.  An Post, for instance, has in recent years greatly expanded the level of retail services it supplies and, if anything, it is now a better potential partner in a State-led bank than it was previously.  It is difficult to see how the privatisation of any one or two of these banks could have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>Another reason the State should lead the challenge to the existing banks is its requirement, for reasons of general economic policy, to keep abreast of development in global banking.  If we proceed with economic and monetary union in a few years' time, the Central Bank of Ireland will become a subsidiary of the European Central Bank and at that stage a third banking sector could play a useful role for the State.</P>
    <P>Similarly, a State bank would at least ensure the provision of Irish banking. Given the imminent changes in the banking system, we cannot be certain that all the existing banks in the private sector will remain in Irish hands. Already the possibility has arisen of the Irish Permanent falling out of Irish ownership.  If we had a State owned banking force, we would be assured of <Col N="1237" /> at least one bank with its focus singularly on Ireland.</P>
    <P>In a contribution on the Adjournment in the Dáil last month, the Minister for Finance reported on the current position of this issue.  I understand the difficulty for him; in particular, the concerns of employees must be paramount.  I reject the idea that this is simply an issue of privatisation <i>versus</i> State control. If we draw an analogy between this matter and the problems facing Telecom, the results are instructive.  A decision has been taken for Telecom to have a strategic partner.  This view has been adopted to enable the company to expand and diversify its level of services. It is a strategic decision based on the future development of the telecommunications market.  What applies to that sector should also apply to banking. We must re-examine why this proposal was made in the first place, whether that problem continues to exist, and address our response accordingly.  A third banking force, properly developed, would give us increasing prosperity and provide the back-up needed for the enterprise boards to create jobs so that people can get working again.</P>

      <P>A third banking force is vital to the development of a social agenda in banking but I am afraid Senator Quinn and other Senators of like mind approach this topic from a totally different perspective.  They want the Government to facilitate the emergence of a third banking group from existing market forces.  I, on the other hand, remain committed to the concept outlined in the Programme for Government, which states:</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the promotion of a vigorous Third force in Banking.  Policy will be directed towards ensuring a major role for the existing State Banks and the TSB in any future re-structuring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it disappointing that the debate on the creation of a third force appears to have lost momentum in recent months, although there have been other pressing <Col N="1238" /> issues, ranging from budget preparations to Northern Ireland.  However, society and the citizens who comprise it cannot be left to the not-so-tender mercies of an unfettered market, free of all social control or duties.  At a time when national economies find themselves increasingly subservient to the imperatives of the global market, the need for a State policy on banking is perhaps greater than at any time since the emergence of mercantile banking in the middle ages.  Any State framework for banking must reassert the wider social and economic role of banking.  In this regard, developments such as the Consumer Credit Bill, the forthcoming credit union legislation and the promised Central Bank Bill, to name just a few, will help create a climate favourable to the development of a State policy on banking.  The creation of a so-called third banking force, which I favour, is only one aspect of such a policy, albeit an important one.</P>
    <P>Institutions such as the TSB, the ICC and the ACC have in the past performed valuable service.  We now have an unprecedented opportunity to build on the achievements of these institutions and to prepare them for competition while, at the same time, ensuring there is an effective counterweight to established retail banks.  I do not believe the decision can or should be postponed any longer.  Apart from other considerations, both the ICC and the ACC are in need of early capital injections if they are to compete effectively.</P>
    <P>Last year, Democratic Left examined a number of relevant issues and brought together several proposals in a discussion document called <i>Putting Competition into Banking.</i> That document set out an agenda for change which would put the social and wider economic role of banks on a par with their narrow, purely for profit remit.  If that agenda was implemented, it would enable the creation of a third banking force which would place consumers, whether private or business, above profit. The document also sets out a risk taking vision of banking, with bankers <Col N="1239" /> engaged in the business of investing in business for the long run rather than lending to companies in the short-term and running away at the first fall of snow, as it were.</P>
    <P>A broad view of the third force idea would include consumer rights, liberalisation of credit unions and capitalisation of State banks.  We have an unprecedented opportunity to create a comprehensive banking policy and it should be grasped.</P>

      <P>I support the motion.  It is important that we ensure we know what we are talking about and that we draw the distinction between the word &ldquo;group&rdquo;, as used in the motion, and the other word, &ldquo;force&rdquo;, which is frequently used in this context.  There is all the difference in the world between a third banking group and a third banking force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing to recommend the proposals regarding a third banking force.  Banking is not the business of the State, unlike the regulation of banking, which is.  The Government refers to the Competition (Amendment) Bill and the need for increased competition within the sector, sentiments which I endorse. However, this is achieved by way of legislation.  To introduce a third banking force run by the State will not provide the degree of competition and the edge required to ensure that the existing <Col N="1240" /> banks perform the functions required of them by the economy as a whole and by those borrowing from them.</P>
    <P>Given that we are living in a time of political correctness, we had to declare our interests in the past week.  In this respect I declare an interest in that I am a shareholder in one of the banking groups within the State.  However, banking is not the business of the State. When it gets involved in this sector it frequently makes a mess of it with the result that, as with Aer Lingus, it eventually has to find money to bail out the bank involved, which is a very curious way of running a banking operation.</P>
    <P>While there is an onus on the State to regulate the way banking works and to ensure there is competition within the sector, it is not the business of the State to be involved in banking.  An exception can be made, because there are certain circumstances where the State may involve itself.  For example, after a period of economic depression in this country there was a great need for investment in agriculture to improve buildings, machinery and farming in general.  In this regard, the Agricultural Credit Corporation played a useful and important role, and in doing so assisted the economy.  When it was established it could not have been described as a bank.  It is now ACC Bank; at that time it was the Agricultural Credit Corporation. There is an important distinction to be made here.</P>
    <P>Some Senators referred to banks not supporting community effort or small businesses.  I have a degree of sympathy with this point of view, but it is more appropriately dealt with by way of grants or some kind of State subvention, rather&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When one is enjoying oneself time flies.  The banks are somewhat risk averse.  They should take the <Col N="1241" /> risk at times, because those who should be assisted are not always assisted.  In addition, there is no competition.  For example, on any high street in Ireland the banks offer the same kinds of rates and conditions, whereas on any high street in Europe different rates and conditions will be offered.  This is what we need here, which is why I support the idea of a third banking group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate about establishing a third banking force. I also thank Senator Quinn for raising the issue.  Over the years, banks have played an increasingly dominant role in our lives and the face of banking has changed dramatically.  It is now possible to bank over the telephone and to do business with a bank in a faceless fashion.  Banks as we have known them have undergone a revolution.</P>
      <P>The new charges they levy are very high and undoubtedly contribute to their level of profits.  According to its latest annual report, AIB Group now earns profits of £360 million per year, which is more than £1 million per day. What percentage of these profits is made from customer charges?  This high level of charges is a major bone of contention to many, both inside and outside the House.  Customers have suffered and have been penalised.  They deserve better treatment from the banks.  Competition will reduce charges and improve services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cartel operated by the big banks does not benefit customers.  It should not be forgotten that, between them, AIB Group and Bank of Ireland Group, the two big banks, control over 70 per cent of the retail banking market, which is crying out for competition.  Irish bank customers will relish the opportunity to conduct business with a bank that does not charge such high rates.  This is why a third banking force, as advocated by the Labour Party in the 1992 <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i><Col N="1242" /> and in the programme, A <i>Government of Renewal,</i> is needed.</P>
    <P>Ireland had a short lived State bank in the period 1919-26.  The National Land Bank was established to provide loans for the purchase and subdivision of estates and for those setting up farms. It is regrettable that this bank was not nurtured and allowed to develop.  Had this happened, there may have been no need for this debate.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes a third banking force is required for three reasons.  In the first instance it would improve banking services for small and medium sized enterprises; second, it would enhance competition in banking; and, third, it would maintain a State presence in Irish banking.  I urge my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, to ensure that Government presses ahead with the proposals contained in the present and previous programmes for Government.</P>
    <P>We need a third banking force to cater for a wide range of customers, from business to regular non commercial customers.  I have met many small business people who have had problems in dealings with their bank.  While there are banks who say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, we too often hear of those who say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  A third banking force would be more responsive to the needs of business people, especially to those who run small businesses. Small businesses offer huge potential growth in employment. However, they need adequate financial capital, on suitable terms, for their investment requirements.  A third banking force would fulfil this role.</P>
    <P>An Post and the credit unions, located in many villages and towns throughout the country, could play a major role in a third banking force.  As a lifelong member of the credit union, I advocate that they be included in such a force.  I hope both of these options will be considered in the context of the establishment of any third banking force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> I thank the Minister for attending the House and updating us on this issue.  Let us not make the mistake that was made when the first State bank was opened and then closed.  I urge the Minister to ensure that all the necessary work is done before such a bank is again established. It is an issue of vital importance and one which we cannot get wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the general thrust of the arguments put forward on the motion.  A third banking force is emerging in Ireland.  It is taking from the increasing role of the Trustee Savings Bank and the banking facilities emerging from former loan companies for houses, such as Irish Permanent and First National Building Society.  Competition is growing from this force, which is not connected with the main banking groups, whether it be AIB Group, Bank of Ireland Group or National Irish Bank.</P>
      <P>As a business customer of a bank for many years, I have had more than my share of problems with banks.  Problems were always resolved on the basis of face to face confrontation, based on figures which were or were not produced and the delivery by me on the one side and by the bank on the other side.  They were also based on the trust built up between individuals and between the institutions through individuals.</P>
      <P>Retail banking is going through a phase at present where individuals do not count anymore.  In most of the banking groups, the customer does not know who is responsible for approving the loan.  Those working in the banks will suggest that the customer gets on to headquarters and say that once the customer gets on to headquarters, things will start to happen.  I am talking about smaller businesses, not about the major international or national businesses, which have their own way of doing business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> Retail banking for the smaller customer is changing and the personal content is being left out.  When the personal content goes out of retail banking the customer suffers.  Customer services in banks are being reduced.  The banks would like us to use plastic cards, the telephone or the Internet &mdash; anything rather than deal with them face to face. In the major banking groups at present personnel are changed around at the whim of the regional manager or somebody above regional manager level. Someone working in a particular branch of a bank today might be in another branch tomorrow.  There is no branch manager in certain AIB offices, only subsidiary managers; the personal contact is not there.  Without personal contact, trust cannot be built up and banking becomes depersonalised.</P>
    <P>The lad with the big hands has been forgotten about.  The man who can dig a ditch, who can make money out of muck, as they used to say long ago, is gone.  Many senior people have been released by banks.  When a customer tries to borrow money to buy six JCBs, the computer does not know what a JCB is; neither does the young lad behind the counter who has his MBS. He wants a computer printout of the prospects for the particular business; he would not know a JCB from a pen. Older bankers are now being brought back in as consultants.  Many banks have no employees over 50 and they would not know what a quarry or what a JCB is, but they know what a computer is.</P>
    <P>The banks advertise new products all the time.  When I was in the bank &mdash; I was in the Provincial Bank, which was one of the old established banks years ago &mdash; business was done through personal contact, the same way as deals were done at cattle fairs.  People got to know how to deal with each other through relationships.  There were people one could trust and people one could not trust and these things emerged through personal relationships. <Col N="1245" /> Most of the people who set up businesses in the 1950s in Ireland would not get a loan to start a business today, because the young people who are in banking today would not know the difference between a shovel and a pencil, but they know about computers.  They know about the Internet and the worldwide web but they do not have a clue about people.</P>
    <P>The third banking force I would like to see created is an extension of the credit union system.  Everybody in the credit union is a shareholder; everybody is involved.  The credit unions are multimillion pound businesses.  Smaller banks, such as the TSB, are expanding at present.  They are competing very strongly in the marketplace because they realise that relationships and businesses are built through face to face contact.  The third banking force should not be a State imposed system.  This kind of system cannot work.  I would not deal with a State imposed banking system; neither would most people.</P>
    <P>If a survey was carried out of the results from investment in Ireland other than personal investment in one's own business, the biggest results gained by any investors in any shares in this country in the past 50 years were gained by those who invested in the Post Office. This is proven by analysis of pound for pound investment in various kinds of shares.  An post has given the highest return and still gives the highest return on money invested.  The State should raise the limit any one person can invest in An Post savings schemes; then we would have the basis for the third banking force.</P>
    <P>The third banking force is not the fight I will have with my bank manager in the morning.  It is a system of genuine competition in the market, not the present artificially generated competition, which is being eaten into at the retail end.  I sincerely hope that there is a third force and that it heralds the repersonalisation of the banking system.  I <Col N="1246" /> hope that people become important again in banking and that banking and profit become things we can live with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion and I thank our Independent colleagues for bringing this issue up for discussion, albeit briefly.  The third banking force is already underway in the reaction of the community to the current banking system. I am thinking in particular of the credit union movement.  The growth in participation in the credit union movement and the confidence which people feel in the credit union movement is in itself a clear indication that even if we were never to suggest the introduction of a third banking force, it is already underway throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Every single community in my constituency, and I am sure it is no different in others, has its own credit union.  The level of responsibility and sharing and caring, which is a very essential part of any properly enlightened banking system, is demonstrated in the huge growth, not only of the assets but of the business of these movements.  It is significant that one person, Mr. John Hume, who has done more than any other person in the interest of his community, was very involved in the development of the credit union movement many years ago in his own local area.  For that and other reasons, we should support that movement as vigorously as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should remove any unnecessary restrictions, some of which were not intentional, on the credit union movement, and actively encourage the growth and development of that movement, which can be channelled both for business development and necessary social purposes.  This debate allows me to commend that movement.  I hope the Minister, in looking at whatever amendments need to be made to the statutory regulations in respect of the credit union movement, will do so in a spirit of support for this excellent movement which <Col N="1247" /> is growing apace throughout the country.</P>
    <P>For historical reasons which I do not have time to go into, the existing banking structure in Ireland differs greatly from the banking system throughout Europe and in the epicentre of growth in the world economy at the moment, that is, in the ASEAN and Far East region, including countries such as Japan and China.  The banks there do not see themselves as being set apart from the entrepreneur or the risk taker. They consider themselves part of the entrepreneurial and risk-taking spirit and they take shares in risk.  They are involved in success when it occurs but they also accept losses.  Irish banks have not learned to play a dynamic part, as is demonstrated throughout Europe and particularly in the Far East, which, let us face it, will become a driving, dynamic world economy.  They see their role as being involved in promoting and supporting risk-taking and taking losses wherever they occur.</P>
    <P>Irish banks have developed on the basis that they operate in an environment where they have an almost statutory protection.  I welcome this motion because it is time that secure and protective atmosphere changed.  I have no inherent objection to profit. However, when I consider that Allied Irish Banks made profits of the order of £360 million &mdash; to which I made my own measly contribution &mdash; I ask if this is the function we wish to see our banks discharge in order to pay their shareholders? What contribution are those shareholders making socially and economically to the development of the economy?</P>
    <P>When I served as Minister for Agriculture, I had some experience in determining national priorities.  On taking office in 1987 it was clear that the country was faced with a situation where the national beef herd had decreased to the point that we risked <Col N="1248" /> the decline of the entire industry.  For that reason I decided to introduce special incentives for the promotion of the suckler herd within the agricultural economy.  I invited the banks to take part in that venture and pointed out that they would be the main beneficiaries if it proved successful.  Most of the banks were prepared to participate but one &mdash; I will not finger the guilty party &mdash; refused to become involved.  As a result, a necessary national venture never got off the ground.  That was a terrible indictment of a bank which likes to be associated, in name and otherwise, with Ireland.  In my view, that is not indicative of the kind of response one should receive.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Agriculture, I was involved in encouraging the promotion of change within the ACC Bank.  The manner in which that bank adjusted toward a vigorous participation in the banking system is one of the most encouraging developments I have recently experienced.  I pay tribute to the bank's chairman, Mr. Dan McGinn, who has vigorously adopted the position that development takes priority but that the customer relationship must also be given priority.  One sometimes meets people who, because of circumstances outside of their control, have fallen on hard times and the ACC Bank has discharged a great responsibility in dealing with them.  I pay tribute to the chairman and those responsible for that major contribution.</P>

      <P>Having listened to those who spoke about the benefits of the credit union movement, An Post savings scheme, the ICC, ACC and other banks and building societies which have entered the business of banking, I am now more than ever convinced that competition represents the way forward and we must find a way to encourage this.  This was a very healthy debate because contributors concentrated on the area of competition.</P>
      <P>I tabled this motion because I am concerned that we do not stifle competition. I am still not convinced that we recognise the importance of competition. If we can generate competition and ensure that it is present we will have a healthier banking force which will benefit the entire community &mdash; small and large business and individual citizens. The reason for my concern is the existence of the pitfalls that await us. The Minister for Finance referred to the advent of European Monetary Union on 1 January 1999 and the fact that competition will become increasingly fierce as a result.  If we have not established a spirit of competition in the Irish marketplace which is capable of competing, we will be faced with a serious situation. The market is changing constantly and dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The business of banking is a fluid one and is, therefore, very difficult to control centrally.  This brings me to a crucial <Col N="1250" /> point to which a number of Members referred.  During his contribution the Minister referred to the Competition Authority, the powers of the Central Bank and controls.  I fear these will not cater for the fierce and rapidly changing competition that is required.  As the market changes, we must also change.</P>
    <P>In the 1970s I entered business by borrowing money from the bank.  I returned to seek further loans when required.  At a Banker's Institute dinner, the chairman of the bank made my day when he asked me to sit beside him and informed me that good borrowers are scarce.  I had never heard that before and had assumed for some time that the banks were doing us a favour by providing loans.  I was stunned to discover that bankers needed us because they made money from us.  I had never realised this and enjoyed my meal as a result.</P>

    <P>The Minister stated that the Government's objective is to foster competition. I say to him &ldquo;By their works shall ye know them.&rdquo;.  Senator Sherlock stated that the movement toward competition has lost momentum.  However, the Minister also stated &ldquo;this is under continuous consideration&rdquo;, &ldquo;it will continue to be examined&rdquo; and &ldquo;it has been under consideration for some time&rdquo;.  I am glad to hear that it is being considered by Government.  I accept this but I am not sure we should accept it in six months.  Senator Cregan stated that we should not be in a hurry but I believe that we have no time to wait.  Our patience will be tested if the Government does not provide an answer to this problem within six months.  This debate has been useful because it has focused our attention on the importance of not only <Col N="1251" /> considering this matter but making sure that action is taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter and giving me the opportunity to raise it in the House.  I also thank the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications for attending to reply to the debate.</P>
      <P>The Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant is just over 100 miles east of Ireland and the statements over a number of years regarding the concerns of Irish people cannot be overemphasised. The project has an extremely poor safety record and poses a serious threat to the health and safety of the Irish people.  The site contains four ageing reactors which were built in 1956 and which have exceeded their expected lifespan by 20 years.  One cannot be but concerned about any process which, in addition to the inherent dangers of a nuclear station, involves such obsolescence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent incident at Sellafield, in early February, is the third such incident at British nuclear plants about which the Government has been notified this year.  The Minister outlined his concerns about the situation at that time, but is he satisfied with the amount of information being made available to him by the British Government and authorities on the recent incidents?  If he is not satisfied, action must be taken to ensure high quality information is made available on which he can assess the <Col N="1252" /> seriousness of the threat posed by these incidents.  Will the Minister outline the range of legal actions the Government intends to take to force this issue onto the European agenda in order to raise standards at this plant and ensure as much transparency as possible regarding its operation?</P>
    <P>We must continue to seek the amendment and updating of the EURATOM Treaties to take account of the concerns of non nuclear jurisdictions sharing land or maritime borders with countries operating nuclear power and reprocessing plants and include stringent regulations for decommissioning nuclear facilities.  The Acting Chairman will recall that a very good debate was held in the House last session on the opening of the THORP reprocessing plant on the Sellafield site.  This increased the traffic of radioactive waste in the Irish Sea and, allied to recent revelations of the dumping of radioactive waste at Beaufort Dyke between the north east of Ireland and Scotland, it raised the question of safety in our seas.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his action regarding NIREX Limited and the Government's submissions at the recent hearings regarding the possibility of building an underground nuclear dump virtually on the edge of the Irish Sea.  This raised most disturbing questions about the future of nuclear development in the UK, our nearest neighbour.  I commend the Minister and the Government on their action.  It is one of the most comprehensive and coordinated approaches taken by the Government to date to redress the problems caused by Sellafield. However, the task faced cannot be underestimated.</P>
    <P>The Government has a long and slow battle before it to have the concerns of this country, all its politicians and its people taken seriously.  It involves persuading one of the world's major industrial nations to forego a quarter of its energy source.  It is an uphill battle but <Col N="1253" /> a most important one when one contemplates the likely consequences of even the smallest type of accident.  Such accidents have occurred to a small extent, but if one put ten or 15 of them together in one event, it would have severe consequences internationally and particularly for Ireland, which is just 100 miles from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>We must continue to be concerned and raise questions at the highest level. It is unacceptable that the series of incidents, including three this year already, is taking place.  The Irish people are not alone in their worries about this matter; many people in the UK share their concerns. Chernobyl demonstrated the potential impact of a major nuclear accident. The consequences of a major incident at Sellafield would be horrific; it would probably wipe out Dublin.  The risks to health and the environment posed by accidents means we must be continually vigilant and active on this matter.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the Government to raise this matter at every opportunity and endeavour to address it during Ireland's EU Presidency.  It is an excellent opportunity for the Government to highlight at European level the concerns of all Irish people about the real dangers of a serious accident at Sellafield.  The evidence exists; smaller incidents have occurred on a regular basis.  The worry is how far we are from a much more major incident which would have catastrophic effects that would last for generations or centuries.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Neville for raising this important matter. Given the time available, I regret that I will not be in a position to reply as comprehensively as I wish.  However, I will try to cover most of the points he raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incident to which the Senator referred occurred in the vitrification <Col N="1254" /> plant at the Sellafield complex on 2 February. Under the relevant UK nuclear incident procedures, the operators, British Nuclear Fuels, notified the relevant regulatory authorities.  In accordance with existing bilateral reporting arrangements, my Department was notified of the incident that afternoon by the UK Department of the Environment. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland was immediately contacted to assess the radiological and health implications of the incident for Ireland, if any.</P>
    <P>Based on the information received, the RPII advised me that the incident had no radiological or health implications for Ireland.  There was no release of radioactivity to the environment. However, some radioactive liquid was found within pipework in the vitrification plant.  I take the Senator's point about the quality of information available to the Government through the current system.  The British authorities have been asked to review it and examine how the information flow to the Irish Government could be improved.</P>
    <P>This plant is not a nuclear reactor or a reprocessing facility.  It converts high level liquid radioactive waste into a dry form which is then vitrified in glass.  This in turn is stored in stainless steel containers in a purpose built above ground storage system.  As a precautionary measure the staff involved in the incident were moved to another part of the plant until the situation had been checked and declared stable.  I have been informed that all detection and safety procedures worked satisfactorily. Under the International Atomic Energy Agency's eight point international nuclear event scale, the incident has been classified as level one, that is, &ldquo;an anomaly&rdquo;.  I stress that this is an initial rating and when the incident has been fully investigated by the regulatory authorities it may possibly be assigned a lower or zero rating.  I have asked the <Col N="1255" /> British authorities for a report of its investigations into the cause of this latest incident.</P>
    <P>While this particular incident had no environmental implications for Ireland, the Government is committed to pursuing realistic and effective courses of action to convey to the British authorities the concerns of the Irish people about the British nuclear industry. Developments affecting nuclear safety have been a matter of major concern to me personally and it has been one of my priorities for attention since taking office.  This latest incident is yet another addition to the growing list of incidents in British nuclear power stations and highlights once more the ongoing and unacceptable nuclear risk that Ireland faces from Britain's nuclear industry.</P>
    <P>To date in 1996, my Department has been notified by the British authorities of three incidents &mdash; at Heysham in Lancashire, Wylfa in Anglesea and this latest one at Sellafield in Cumbria, all located on the west coast of Britain.  The proximity of these installations to the east coast of Ireland and to centres of population here only serves to increase the anxiety felt by the Irish public about each successive incident.</P>
    <P>Three days after this latest incident, I met with the British Ambassador, Veronica Sutherland, in my office and I expressed my grave concern about this and other recent incidents and about other aspects of the British nuclear industry, including in particular the ongoing pollution of the Irish Sea, which is unacceptable; the NIREX proposals for an underground nuclear dump near the Sellafield complex; the continued existence of Magnox reactors, which are past their sell by date and ought to be decommissioned; and my concerns about the safety implications of privatising the British nuclear industry.</P>
    <P>I stressed that the Government was firmly opposed to any expansion of the <Col N="1256" /> nuclear industry in Britain.  In that context, I repeated my welcome for the recent decision not to proceed with the commissioning of two new nuclear reactors. I sincerely hope that decision signifies the beginning of the end of the nuclear industry in Britain.</P>
    <P>I am realistic enough to know that the nuclear industry will not close down overnight.  It plays a significant role in Britain in terms of power generation and employment.  However, the time is now ripe for the British authorities to turn their attention to developing an energy strategy for the future that excludes nuclear power.  In the meantime, this Government remains committed to using every available opportunity in all appropriate fora to voice its concerns about the safety aspects of the nuclear industry, to press for the highest possible safety standards to be maintained and to strive to prevent and eliminate radioactive discharges into the marine environment.</P>
    <P>This Government is continuously monitoring, examining and reassessing all available options open to it to ensure the safety of the Irish public.  In line with this, officials from my Department and other relevant Departments and agencies will participate in an international nuclear emergency exercise, INEX 2, which is designed to test our degree of preparedness in the event of any nuclear emergency.  This exercise is due to take place later this year and my Department will be greatly assisted in its role by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Seanad may also be aware of my recent attendance at a planning inquiry in Cumbria into an application by UK Nirex Limited to site a rock characterisation facility or rock laboratory near Sellafield.  I took the unprecedented step of personally attending this inquiry in order to emphasise publicly to the British authorities the extent and depth of my concern, and that of the Government and all the Irish people, about the <Col N="1257" /> NIREX proposal.  I told the inquiry that I objected to the facility because I saw it as a first step, and indeed a significant precommitment, to an eventual underground nuclear waste facility virtually on the edge of the Irish Sea.  Copies of my full submission to that inquiry are available in the Seanad Library.  I have also written directly to the EU Commissioner with responsibility for the Environment, the UK Secretary of State for the Environment and the UK Minister for Energy about the waste facility.</P>
    <P>The task force of Ministers which was set up last year has developed a co-ordinated strategy to progress the Government's policy in relation to Sellafield as set out in the Government's policy agreement.  A blueprint for action was drawn up to implement the various proposals on Sellafield and the Irish Sea and action on each commitment is proceeding.</P>
    <P>One of the commitments is to reassess legal opinion on the possibility of taking a court case over Sellafield.  The committee of Ministers on Sellafield has asked the Attorney General to reassess the possibilities for legal action against Sellafield.  Scientific evidence is, of course, a vital element in this matter. There are ongoing inquiries in this regard and the position is kept under constant review.  At the recent public inquiry in Cumbria concerning my objections to the NIREX rock laboratory, I set out a number of legal submissions which provide options which we might pursue in other fora if the NIREX appeal is successful.</P>
    <P>Recently in the Supreme Court, counsel for the State supported the four Dundalk residents in their action against an appeal by BNFL over the decision of the High Court last year which established the jurisdiction of the Irish courts to hear the substantive case against BNFL.  Although the Government and the Attorney General are named as codefendants in the substantive case, our support of them in the <Col N="1258" /> appeal process clearly illustrates the Government's commitment to do all in its power to eliminate the threat posed by Sellafield and THORP.  My Department is also making available to the Dundalk plaintiffs, on a voluntary basis, its files and documentation concerning Sellafield and other related aspects relevant to the Dundalk plaintiffs' substantive case.</P>
    <P>At the request of the ministerial committee on Sellafield, and using expert material supplied by my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs made formal high level diplomatic approaches last year to the countries which signed, or which were contemplating signing, reprocessing agreements with the THORP facility, outlining the concern of the Irish Government in this area.  The countries in question were Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands and Switzerland.  The Irish position was generally sympathetically received by the authorities concerned and the concerns were then conveyed to the nuclear electricity companies.  However, it was pointed out by the Governments concerned that they could not intervene directly in contractual agreements entered into with British Nuclear Fuels. The Government will continue to make known its concern and its opposition to the operations at THORP through all diplomatic channels.</P>
    <P>These actions and positive steps that I have outlined here this evening are clear evidence of my commitment to action, and not just words, against Sellafield and the British nuclear industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of <Col N="1259" /> State to the House and thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter, the purpose of which is to look at the dental profession, particularly the orthodontic side, in an attempt to reduce the enormous costs of such treatment.</P>
      <P>Most public representatives get calls on a weekly basis from parents about the huge cost of orthodontic treatment. The health boards provide treatment for a number of children with serious dental problems, but they do not cover cosmetic problems.  Parents have to bring their children to orthodontists for such treatment and are often asked for huge sums of money for relatively simple cosmetic treatment &mdash; in the region of £1,000 or £1,200.</P>
      <P>I discovered some very interesting facts on this subject.  Orthodontic work is rarely carried out by dentists in this country whereas in other jurisdictions up to 80 per cent of orthodontic work is carried out by ordinary dental practices. That raised my eyebrows to some degree.  I also discovered that charges are much less in other jurisdictions.  I decided I had to bring to the Minister's attention the fact that Irish parents are paying through the teeth &mdash; if one wanted to make a pun &mdash; for the service. I am sure the Acting Chairman receives similar telephone calls from parents about the cost of orthodontic treatment. Those costs should be reduced because they do not need to be so high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the simpler treatments could be carried out by dentists.  The business of straightening teeth and treating people with crowded mouths, where a tooth or two must be removed and the other teeth pulled into different positions, is relatively simple.  It is usually achieved by fitting some sort of device. I do not believe it is necessary for a person to have specialist education to fit those devices.  Every dentist I know would be capable of doing it.  Why do they not do it?  I think it is just a matter <Col N="1260" /> of practice; in other words, it is not done.  Talking to the Minister a few minutes ago, we agreed lately qualified dentists and the students of today are probably receiving more tuition in orthodontics.  Over the years, we will probably find that more dentists will practice orthodontics, thereby achieving what I seek tonight.</P>
    <P>There are also restrictive practices in the dental profession which promote that kind of ethos anyway.  Dentists stick to their own corner and leave everything else &mdash; and even work they could do themselves &mdash; to others.  For example, the code of practice for dentists is quite antiquated in my view and out of kilter with the kind of world in which we live.</P>
    <P>Dentists are not allowed to advertise and are protected and cosseted by the code of practice in a way which prevents competition.  Such competition as exists is of an accidental nature; you really do not know much about a dental practice until you get a toothache and go looking for one.  They never advertise their wares and, as a result, dentists' prices tend to be higher also.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the legislation which dates from the 1980s &mdash; I looked at it at one stage but I do not have a copy of it in my possession &mdash; to see whether he can open the window and let some fresh air into the area of dentistry with a view to making it more competitive and providing the public not with better care &mdash; the care offered by dentists is of a very high standard &mdash; but with more modern care so that dentists may operate in the same competitive world as other professions.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to spend some time on this matter.  To give an example of the antiquated nature of the documents presented by the General Dental Council, on incentives, section 46 (ii) of <i>Professional Conduct and Fitness to Practise</i> dated May 1993, states: &ldquo;the Council would not approve of a financial incentive being paid to a <Col N="1261" /> third party by a dentist in return for encouraging or promoting the uptake of dental care by individual members of the public;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When you read that you ask &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; it means there is no advertising.  Why not? The Dental Council will tell you that if there is advertising, the persons likely to suffer will be members of the public.  I cannot see how that could be.  If dentists want to promote their business, they should be allowed to do so.  If they want to offer a service at a different or cheaper price to that of other dentists, they should be allowed to do so.  They should be allowed to advertise in the newspapers the same as anybody else who offers a service.  If that was done and the Minister legislated accordingly, we would all have a better and more competitive service and orthodontics, in particular, would benefit.  More people would avail of the service and they would get it at a much lower price.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour this any further.  I know the Minister of State has a positive approach to this matter and that his Department understands the costs, because the health boards are paying huge amounts every year for orthodontic treatment for children.  The Minister will have all those facts and will know much more about it than I.  I look forward to his response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cotter for raising this important issue and giving me the opportunity to outline the present position.  I take his various suggestions on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Orthodontic treatment services to eligible children are provided by health boards on the basis of guidelines provided by the Department of Health to ensure that those most in need receive treatment.  Additional funds have been provided over the last number of years for the development of health board orthodontic services.  There is now over <Col N="1262" /> £2 million extra in the health board allocations each year for the provision of additional orthodontic treatment services. This additional funding has allowed for the recruitment of additional dentists together with support staff to work under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant orthodontists to provide an increased level of orthodontic treatment services.  In addition the Minister has invested heavily in the necessary facilities and specialist equipment to assist in the provision of secondary care orthodontics. For example, in the Senator's own region, the North-Eastern Health Board, the Minister provided an additional £80,000 in 1995 to enable it to carry out additional secondary care orthodontic treatment on children.  With the assistance of the Department the North-Eastern Health Board has significantly increased the number of children undergoing orthodontic treatment over the last couple of years.</P>
    <P>It is estimated in the dental health action plan, which is now being implemented on a phased basis by the Department, that a total of nine consultant orthodontists, supported by appropriately trained dental staff, are required by the health board dental service to meet orthodontic treatment needs at secondary care level.  There are now five consultant orthodontists working in the health boards with dental and support staff.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board &mdash; through the Local Appointments Commission &mdash; recently advertised for the appointment of two consultant orthodontists.  The North-Eastern and Midland Health Boards were again unsuccessful in recent attempts to fill their vacant consultant orthodontist posts through the Local Appointments Commission and have made arrangements with private specialists to provide services.  In St James's Hospital a consultant orthodontist works full time in the national centre <Col N="1263" /> for the treatment of cleft lip and palate.</P>
    <P>Under the Department's strategy for the development of the orthodontic services, it is envisaged that the consultant orthodontists will organise and co-ordinate a programme of training in orthodontics for existing health board dentists.  In this way significant improvements in service levels for orthodontic treatments will be possible.</P>
    <P>At present, average waiting times for children seeking orthodontic treatment vary considerably throughout the country but I am confident that, with the recruitment of the consultant orthodontists and the development of the consultant led services, there will be considerable improvements in the waiting times.  In this regard a primary task of the consultant orthodontist is to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training to sub-consultant level for health board dental staff to enable health boards to provide a greatly increased volume of service.  The Department and the health boards will continue to develop the orthodontic services over the course of the dental health action plan so that the <Col N="1264" /> level of service provision will be brought to the level of actual treatment need.</P>
    <P>As you are aware, orthodontics is a discipline within the practice of dentistry. The practice of dentistry is regulated by the Dental Council under the Dentists Act, 1985.  I have outlined above orthodontic treatment services in the health boards for which the Department of Health has responsibility. Orthodontic treatment services in the private sector are provided by registered dentists with a competence in orthodontics.  The question of the cost of private orthodontic treatment is not a matter for the Minister for Health. The cost of private orthodontic treatment is subject to the prevailing market forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his response and, in particular, for his statement with regard to the organisation in the public sector, at least of organising and co-ordinating programmes so that dentists will be able to carry out orthodontic services.  It is a step in the right direction.  I hope he will get time to examine the legislation.</P>
