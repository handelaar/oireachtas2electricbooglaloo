      <P>I have notice from Senator Mullooly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter.</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to amend Part IV of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 (S.I. No.86 of 1994) so as to give discretion to a planning authority in relation to the plans, drawings and maps which may accompany a planning application in any case where the development to which such planning application refers is deemed not to be of a substantial nature.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to include in the Intergovernmental Conference discussions a complete and meaningful section concerning the rights of young people in the European Union, and that such a commitment be included in the next Treaty of the European Union which is presently under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2110" /> I have also received notice from Senator Mooney of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to ensure that elected councillors who are members of county enterprise boards receive out of pocket expenses for their attendance at meetings of the respective boards similar to other members of such boards.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senators Mullooly's and Hayes' matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Mooney may give notice on another day of the matters which he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2, 3 and item 23, motion 22. Item 1 is to be taken from now until 1 p.m. and it is proposed that there be 15 minutes per speaker.  Item 2 will be taken from 2 p.m. until 6 p.m. Item 3 will be taken with the Fifth Stage of item 2.  If items 2 and 3 have not concluded by 6 p.m., they will recommence after Private Members' time until completed and I think I will fix that for 8 p.m. even if Private Member's time ends earlier. Senator Lee's Private Members' motion will be from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in saying that all stages of items 2 and 3 will be dealt with after 8 p.m. but they could be completed before 6 p.m.?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment announced a policy for health waste yesterday.  He spoke on behalf of the Minister for Health and both Departments are obviously involved.  Either Minister might welcome an opportunity to discuss this matter in the House and, while the Leader may well say that it would be more <Col N="2111" /> appropriate to raise this matter on Private Members' business or on the Adjournment, he may consider allowing Government time for this important matter next week or the following week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The business as proposed by the Leader is satisfactory as far as I am concerned.  With regard to item 1, I have no objection to the proposal of 15 minutes per speaker but I am not sure of the arrangement when we debated this earlier.  It is general practice that the same time limits should apply for contributions in a resumed debate as applied during the previous discussion.  Some Members who did not contribute during the earlier debate will have grounds for complaint.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise the matter of the inquest into a young girl's death during a concert at the Point.  The jury at the inquest suggested the introduction of a code of practice for events of that nature. Will the Leader bring to the attention of the relevant Minister the need for a review of existing statutory regulations governing the operation of such events?  Will he also ask the Government to consider any revisions which might be required to ensure the safety of young people attending large concerts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader make time available for a debate on the implications of the single currency?  Its introduction in 1999 will have major repercussions for business, services and agriculture.  I am far from satisfied that small and medium businesses are equipping or preparing themselves for that event.  It does not matter whether Ireland enters European Monetary Union because the core countries will invoice their products and carry out their business in euros from 1 January 1999.  Therefore, we must get our act together and I ask the Leader to consider making time available for a debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Portraits of 17 distinguished people, the Cathaoirleach and his predecessors, <Col N="2112" /> were recently placed on the walls of the corridor outside the Seanad Office.  I compliment the people responsible for this because it portrays a unique part of history.  Every Member of this House can be honoured to walk down the corridor while looking at the faces of 17 distinguished individuals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is very important to the dignity and status of the House.  When I looked at the portrait of the first Cathaoirleach I discovered he was robed in a very distinguished and embroidered gown.  I made the mental transformation of placing that garb onto the present Cathaoirleach and I suggest he give serious consideration to being attired in that manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is being stretched to its limit.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges made the decision to place the portraits in the corridor.  I compliment Verona Ní Bhroinn for the help she provided to the committee in that regard.</P>

      <P>In case anyone is of the opinion that Senator O'Toole left his front bench without its riding instructions, we also agree to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I raised the issue of old people living in fear.  An old woman living in the county in which the Cathaoirleach resides was severely injured when her house was burgled by thugs.  Yesterday I spoke to a person whose 80 year old father lives in fear of being burgled in his home in County Mayo.  Old people in rural Ireland live <Col N="2113" /> in fear of this happening.  Operation Shannon was introduced last year and a similar system must be put in place to ensure that senior citizens are not forced to enter nursing and geriatric institutions against their will because they are afraid to live alone.</P>
      <P>The Estimates will come before the Houses in the near future.  Will the Leader contact the Minister for the Environment to discover whether water charges will be abolished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator for or against such charges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must find another way to raise that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek a definite answer as to whether the Minister intends to abolish water charges.  We must know where we stand when the Estimates are debated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will discuss item No. 2 later today which is very important.  Costs pertaining to the free legal aid system have increased by 25 per cent during the past 12 months.  Is it not correct that the House should debate this issue and ask questions of the Legal Aid Board?  It is difficult to understand how such an increase occurred.  Will the Leader make time available for a debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions I requested a debate on sport. When one considers the debacle of the recent All-Ireland Football Final, the situation in Northern Ireland last weekend when the match between Cliftonville and Portadown was called off because of sectarian violence, the <Col N="2114" /> behaviour of Paul Gascoigne and others&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the issue of a 50 metre swimming pool, it is apparent that time should be made available for a debate on sport.  Violence is creeping into sport and one must condemn the Administrative Council of the GAA for not dealing sufficiently with those who behaved in a thuggish fashion at the All-Ireland Final.</P>

If Senator Kiely feels he has been unfairly treated in what was a heated debate, I advise him to bring the matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. That committee is conscious that full protection must be given to the integrity of the Members of this House and I guarantee he will get a fair hearing. However, we cannot give a guarantee on behalf of anyone else.  The debate was heated and harsh things were said on both sides.  If the Senator feels his integrity has been impugned, the committee will vigorously protect his interests.</P>

      <P>Senator Wright raised the problem of clinical waste and I will invite the Minister to come to the House to discuss it at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to a certain inconsistency in the ordering of today's debate and I accept his point.  If speakers feel they need more than 15 minutes that can be arranged.  In my experience Members have never been denied their full chance to speak.  The Senator also raised the circumstances surrounding the inquest into the death of the girl at the Point Depot.  What happened there may not have been an isolated incident and could happen again.  I am not sure how we can best discuss the matter but I will pass on the Senator's concern to <Col N="2118" /> the Minister.  We may find a way for the House to examine the regulations.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard is the third Member to request a debate on the single currency. I have contacted the Minister for Finance and he is willing have such a debate.  We will try to organise it in the near future.  I agree with Senator Howard's point about the portraits of the Cathaoirleach and his 16 predecessors. I hope it is the beginning of a process whereby those who have done great service to the House in the past will find a permanent record to them in Leinster House.  There should be a record to those who have served in the past indicating Parliament's continuity.</P>
    <P>I would not go as far as Senator Howard to suggest that the Cathaoirleach might wear a wig and gown.  He might try it and we could vote on whether he should continue to wear them.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell raised the issue of local government funding and there will be a debate on that matter shortly.  The Minister has agreed to come to the House to discuss the various relevant reports.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan raised the issue of free legal aid.  There will be a criminal justice Bill before the House in the near future and that may afford him the opportunity to discuss the matter he raised.</P>
    <P>In a <i>tour de force</i> Senator Maloney managed to refer to seven different sports in two sentences and to include Northern Ireland.  We should have a major debate on sport.  The Minister of State responsible is keen to have such a debate and it would be of interest to Members on all sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I referred to the issue of copyright on coats of arms produced by the Genealogical Office.  If I asked the Genealogical Office to produce a coat of arms for me would I or the office own the copyright?</P>
      <P>The Genealogical Office does a large amount of work for local government bodies, the GAA and many other organisations.  The county boards of the GAA have logos or crests of arms many of which are provided by the Genealogical Office.  The amount of good work that has been done in the Genealogical Office over many years is underestimated. I did not realise the amount of work it does.  It is often contacted by bodies in other countries seeking help in devising coats of arms.  A certain bank changed its logo a couple of years ago at a cost of about £1 million, yet it could have got an Irish logo in the Genealogical Office for less than £10,000.</P>
      <P>The Genealogical Office should be supported and should not be run down. In his reply on Second Stage I hope the Minister will outline exactly what he has in mind for that office.  If his proposals are not in line with our thinking we will propose amendments to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mummified bodies in St. Michan's Church were recently vandalised by thugs.  Such thugs can do irreparable damage in a short space of time.  Once a cultural or heritage object is destroyed it is lost forever.  The Bill provides for monetary compensation to be paid for damage to books or other artefacts. However, no amount can compensate for an object which is destroyed and lost forever.  I have great time for county libraries, especially the one I know best, Kerry County Library, whose librarian, Mrs. Browne, is a marvellous person. The main issue is money.  Libraries do not have enough staff to deal with all <Col N="2120" /> their material, much of which is gathering dust in cellars and rooms.  It is a pity money could not be provided to make these articles and books available to the public.</P>
    <P>I have experience of this.  Dingle Harbour Commissioners have records dating back to 1840 and going back further than that in respect of boats which came to and went from Dingle and the cargoes they carried.  Many of the extracts from <i>Ireland's Sea Fisheries: A History</i> by John de Courcy Ireland are from these records which were then in the possession of Dingle Harbours Commissioners. Some years ago I felt these were valuable to our history and decided they should be given to the library in Tralee.  They are now in safe keeping but that is all that has happened. I would love if there were some means for the people of Kerry to examine these records and see the trade between Dingle and other European countries, especially Spain.</P>
    <P>There is much similar material all over Ireland which is in safe hands in county libraries.  Some plan or Bill must be devised to ensure this material becomes the responsibility of one body and will be cared for, displayed and made available or at least properly catalogued. The county libraries and the National Library are far behind in their cataloguing work.  I urge the Minister to provide the necessary funding for this to be completed.</P>
    <P>Church records, such as birth and death certificates, are becoming of immense interest.  From my experience, considerable numbers of Americans wish to trace their antecedents as far back as possible.  When they cannot research any further, many depart disappointed although their relatives could be here.  A lady from Germany and her husband requested me to assist them in their search.  It was by accident we discovered she was a granddaughter of a man who lived on Inishvickallane, which is owned by a friend of ours.  I must bring the Minister on a visit to that man someday for a little tomhasín.  All church records are of immense value <Col N="2121" /> and benefit.  A huge percentage of tourists are visiting to research their ancestry. The records in many places are not up to standard and are in a haphazard way.  It would be better if they were organised and in a place where people could more easily research their ancestry.</P>
    <P>Dúirt mé é an lá eile go mba mhaith liom go mbéadh áit speisialta sa Bhille i gcomhair na teanga Gaelaí chun é a bheith clúdaithe agus freisin go mbéadh airgead curtha ar fáil ag an Aire chun foclóir Sheán an Chóta Uí Chaomhánach ó Dhún Chaoin a fhoilsiú.  Bheinn an-sásta leis ansin.  We should never forget the Irish language whether we can speak it or not.  We should always be proud it is a special language.  I do not push the language down anyone's throat.  I only occasionally speak the few words.  The Minister should consider some small amendment to the Bill to provide a special place for the Irish language and books so they will be protected for life, that there will be an onus on the boards he nominates to abide by the Bill and, in doing so, that there would be a special place for the Irish language and literature in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sin é an méid atá le rá agam.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille agus b'fhéidir go mbéadh cúpla leasú againn mar gheall ar an Genealogical Office.  Sin é an ceann mór.  I welcome the Bill.  There will be a few amendments dealing with the Genealogical Office.  However, these depend on the Minister's answers. Maybe we misunderstand the Bill, but we are firing the warning shot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to make a brief contribution.  I welcome the Minister to the House where he cut his political teeth a decade ago.  This is a Bill which has been widely welcomed.  People appreciate the wide range of consultations which took place before it was published.  Apart from the question of the Genealogical Office on which there has been much misunderstanding, little in this Bill has provoked any great opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2122" /> This is an important and welcome piece of legislation for the National Library which provides a legislative skeleton to enable it to continue as a national repository and research centre whose main focus is as a memory bank for Irish people.  The Bill is consistent with a recent body of legislation on national libraries across Europe and further afield.  Almost all national libraries in Council of Europe states have either revised or are revising their legislation to take cognisance of the enormous, continuing and unpredictable developments in the fields of technology, information retrieval and storage. It is important that our legislation be capable of not just absorbing the implications of these changes but of anticipating future changes, such as the rate of change.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains key provisions on State indemnity for exhibitions and items on long-term loan, the establishment of a register of national treasures, and the extension of copyright deposit to other materials of vital importance to the library.  These essential provisions must be ring-fenced during the Bill's journey through both Houses.</P>
    <P>In his interesting contribution Senator Fitzgerald referred to the staffing and funding levels of the library. The move to greater autonomy evident in this Bill is welcome, but autonomy without essential resources may become neglect.  It is acknowledged by commentators on all sides in recent years that the National Library, the National Museum and in more recent times the National Archives have been understaffed and underfunded.  This is not necessarily because the State has been parsimonious, it is a function of the growing range of activities carried out by and demands made on these three institutions.  Nonetheless, setting this right will require a concerted effort. Every year which passes without the two essential components of funding and staffing being tackled means that more material is lost to the nation through lack of purchasing funds and the ever greater backlog of material <Col N="2123" /> awaiting cataloguing.  Perhaps imaginative ways can be found to tackle the cataloguing problem, such as FÁS schemes or short-term summer work projects with universities &mdash; that may be happening already.  This backlog is a serious issue but the current opening hours of the National Library are scandalous. That is not the fault of the library, it is because of the absence of proper staffing.</P>
    <P>I heartily welcome the transfer to these institutions of two major functions hitherto performed by the parent Department.  Those are the financial administration and human resources management of the library and museum. However, the staffing arrangements are vital in this context also.  While I welcome the legislation, we must be clear about the financial and staffing implications.</P>
    <P>The Minister might clarify a number of points in his concluding remarks. Section 18 (2) concerns the right to dispose of material under certain specific and rigorous conditions.  It costs money to keep, preserve, conserve and catalogue each item in the National Library's holdings.  There is a need to enable the director and the board to make informed decisions about duplicate copies of low grade material.  This section has been interpreted by a number of trustees of the library as meaning that it will dispose of any material which does not relate to Ireland.  That is not the view of the library and I do not think it is the intention of the legislation, but there is some confusion on that point.  The library would like to have the freedom to dispose of certain materials which are not Irish and can be disposed of without detriment to the interests of students and researchers.</P>
    <P>Concern has also been raised about section 19, which deals with the membership of the boards.  There is a view that bodies such as the heads of universities, the Library Association of Ireland, the Royal Irish Academy and perhaps the Irish Management Institute should have the right to nominate <Col N="2124" /> members of the boards.  A person currently serving on one of the boards expressed the view, unusual in this age, that the fact that board members may receive a small payment is a retrograde step.  This person said that members may like to do this work for the value and for the sake of the work itself, they do not see themselves having a similar function to members of State boards and they might be happy not to receive a fee in case it compromised them in some way.  It is not a point I will push too far but I raise it because it has been raised with me.</P>
    <P>The other issue concerns the Genealogical Office, which has been the only controversial part of the Bill thus far. Much of the debate is based on the notion that the office is to be abolished and that it has been an independent, autonomous body since 1943.  My reading is that none of these presumptions is correct and perhaps the Minister will bear this out.  The Government must make a choice at this point &mdash; either to establish an independent, autonomous organisation or to tie the office legislatively to another national institution.</P>
    <P>There are arguments for and against on both sides.  Could the State be better served for both heraldry and genealogy by the establishment of a separate institution? The implications of that move include major cost factors such as relocation, staffing, security, etc.  There is also a notion abroad that the Genealogical Office has a distinct staffing complement but this is not the case and never has been.  All the staff who worked in the office since 1943 were staff recruited by the National Library to work across several divisions within the library.  Neither are there any training or qualifications specific to the staff.  My understanding is that each succeeding generation has learned what it could from its predecessors. That has been the practice up to now and the staff have learned their trade extremely well.</P>
    <P>Should the Genealogical Office be established as an autonomous body, the National Library, with its current hard-pressed staff, would not be able to <Col N="2125" /> release the five staff who currently work in the office when the new organisation is established.  Apart from the five normally dedicated to the office, there are the normal support staff &mdash; security, administration, conservation and preservation &mdash; none of whom would be available to a separate body.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply on this point.  My view is that the current provisions in the Bill are an awkward but honest attempt to protect the Genealogical Office and its functions by placing it firmly within the overall structure of the National Library, where it need have no fear for its existence or future.  I would be concerned about the fate of the genealogical manuscript collection, which is currently accessed under careful environmental and security conditions in the manuscript room of the National Library.  Would that require to be moved to a separate office, with substantial additional expenditure being necessary to enable the collection to be housed securely and safely?</P>
    <P>I appear to be in a minority but I do not see a dark plot to abolish this Genealogical Office.  I read the Bill as a guarantee of its future.  I might accuse the Minister of some things &mdash; not many &mdash; but no Minister of any Government would consider darkly plotting to abolish that office.  There has been a fair deal of misunderstanding.  If there is to be a new Genealogical Office it would add further to the burden placed on researchers &mdash; it is another place they would have to visit to add to the National Library, the National Archives and the General Registry Office which they go to today.  We need a greater degree of cohesion rather than splintering in this area.  Having said that, I do not want to go over ground already covered.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a good day's work and I look forward to a long series of discussions on Committee Stage.  It was needed, it is enlightened and it will stand the test of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire agus roimh an mBille, nó ar a <Col N="2126" /> laghad roimh na cuspoirí taobh thiar den Bhille because good though it is, the Bill can be improved with further modification. I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill.  It is part of his overall radical reform of our attitude towards heritage.  When historians look back on this and the previous Government and ask what Minister made a difference, this Minister will be to the forefront and may, indeed, stand in splendid isolation.  He has certainly made a difference. While there may be a dispute as to whether it is positive or negative, I believe it is very positive.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as part of an ongoing overall strategy for finally establishing on a secure basis the heritage and culture of the country in so far as institutions can do so.  I also congratulate the Minister on his speech because of the cogency with which the case for heritage was expressed.  The quality of the expression was first class, making it even more difficult to understand how another part of the Government, perhaps even another part of the Minister's party, has not displayed the same concern for heritage and also making the views of another Minister not only uncomprehending but incomprehensible. I am glad we have this statement to the contrary.</P>
      <P>I echo other Senators in saying that if there are three words missing from this they are &ldquo;money, money and money&rdquo; because without money the powers conveyed to the boards under the Bill are largely meaningless.  Without resources the Bill will remain a kind of mausoleum to what might have been rather than a contribution which the Minister intends it to be.  The explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill states that there are no specific staff number implications arising from the Bill.  This is frightening.  The following sentence states: &ldquo;However there are staffing requirements that need to be addressed in any event&rdquo;.  There have been for years, and it must be asked if there will be for years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without resources for both material and staffing the good intentions will <Col N="2127" /> come to nought, all the more so in that the latent responsibilities in the Bill require resources.  The role of the institutions, whether it is the museum, library or National Gallery, in diffusing the outcome of the work they do takes money and resources in the first instance, and requires diffusion at national and international level in a more systematic way than has been possible hitherto.</P>
    <P>What the new boards are being asked to do cannot be done without resources. The Minister is perhaps more aware of this than most of us, but it is the unanimous view arising from this debate that resources are at the centre of the implementation of this Bill.  Without such resources it will remain largely rhetorical.</P>
    <P>There is a certain level of hypocrisy when we talk about the National Library specifically and about library policy generally and recollect how little has been done on foot of the motion tabled on the Oireachtas Library, whose neglect is a disgrace to us all, introduced by Senator Magner and Senator Manning approximately two years ago.  The lack of resources invested there in terms of turning it into an adequate centre of information for the Members of the Oireachtas, and perhaps for others, is a continuing reflection on the shallowness of a great deal of our rhetoric about what we ought to be doing for other institutions.  I do not accuse the Minister of this; blame attaches to all of us who have not kept pushing this issue and have failed to find out where progress is being blocked.</P>
    <P>I welcome the emphasis on diffusion. The principal function of the board of the museum and of the library is to increase and diffuse knowledge of human life in Ireland, etc., in and outside the State.  That is a crucial educational function which ought to be seen as an integral part of the activities of these institutions.</P>
    <P>Section 12(2)(g) refers to functions of the institutions, &ldquo;to foster and promote contacts with other libraries and educational <Col N="2128" /> establishments&rdquo;.  How far are these establishments aware of a reciprocal responsibility to try to enter into contact with the museum and the library to see how they can mutually contribute most effectively to their common purpose where that exists?  The initiative should not be left to central institutions to chase others.  It will depend partly on resources and partly on the enthusiasm of individuals.  I wish to see a network emerging to try to ensure continuous emphasis on this area.</P>
    <P>Section 13 has generated the longest debate so far and appears to be the most controversial issue in the Bill.  I am a strong believer in the importance of genealogy as part of our cultural heritage. I am not a genealogist but I work extensively on population records and the history of Irish emigration.  I also have a fair degree of knowledge of the requirements of a number of people in the area.  Its relationship to the diaspora is very important and, even though the diaspora has become more fashionable both as a concept and a cast of mind especially since President Robinson drew attention to it, we still have a long way to go in raising consciousness about it.  Genealogical activity has a significant contribution to make in this direction.</P>
    <P>However, my concern is not with institutions but with ensuring the best possible service to all those who require it.  I approach this from the point of view of the customer, those interested in finding out more and those who perhaps need to have their own consciousness raised.  I have a very open mind on what the ideal arrangement ought to be.</P>
    <P>In her cogent contribution, Senator Kelly said that section 13(1) is unfortunately phrased.  It is very negatively phrased yet I do not read negativity into the rest of the section.  While it requires clarification, it appears that the intention behind the section is meant to be positive towards genealogy, but, given the way it is expressed, it can be interpreted negatively.</P>
    <P>Everybody would admit that Dr. Pat Donlon has earned the right to comment <Col N="2129" /> on this issue by virtue of her outstanding stewardship of the National Library.  It is a sad misfortune that she has to retire prematurely.  In the latest edition of <i>Irish Root</i> she has written an article which, for anybody who reads it carefully, indicates that a great deal of work requires to be done in rationalising the organisational side of genealogy. I am not fully familiar with the background to some of the phrases she uses. She states:</P>
    <P>The service is being streamlined in such a way that it is intended to provide all comers with sufficient key information that we will no longer witness long queues of frustrated clients and harassed staff at the National Library's issue desk.</P>
    <P>Anybody who works in the National Library will have witnessed this.  She goes on to state:</P>
    <P>All of these [services] will be provided on a fee basis, but with the fees so pitched that it is hoped no one will be excluded because of lack of resources.</P>
    <P>Does this point to exclusion of people hitherto because of lack of resources? What exactly is involved?  Dr. Donlon concludes:</P>
    <P>... if one were to ask the question whose baby is genealogy?  The answer must surely be everybody's and nobody's...  To date there is no cogent national policy on genealogy and genealogical records.</P>
    <P>She then goes on to list numerous Departments which have bits and pieces of the action, or inaction, as the case may be.  Dr. Donlon stages that what we have at present is &ldquo;a patchwork quilt&rdquo;. She goes on to state: &ldquo;At present the pattern resembles a crazy patchwork and not the planned co-ordinated design so pleasing to the eye.&rdquo; Clearly there is much scope for improving institutional co-ordination in this area.  Whatever the intention behind it, I hope that what emerges will contribute significantly to improving the quality of service and <Col N="2130" /> enhancing the status of genealogy as an integral part of our cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>I am glad there is significant demand for a genealogy course in UCD.  Genealogy should be integrated in the mainstream of academic and historical activity.  Academic historians have been remiss in not enabling genealogy to achieve a more central role.  This issue is important and I look forward to the Minister clarifying the intention.  He will have much goodwill for any proposals which improve the current unco-ordinated and in some ways underdeveloped service.</P>
    <P>Section 14(2)(a) states that the board may make by-laws for &ldquo;the regulation of access to the Museum or Library&rdquo;. Senator Manning mentioned opening hours but I have some difficulty with the approach to the membership of boards. One of my problems relates to representation from outside Dublin on the boards of these national institutions. Given the distribution of such people in the State, the majority are probably in Dublin and I do not oppose facilitating them.  However, matters such as opening hours are of specific concern to those who must travel.  Opening hours are restricted occasionally due to lack of resources but it is vital there is adequate representation on the boards of people who can bring a different client perspective to bear from those who live within a few miles of the institutions.</P>
    <P>I approve of the gender quota and there should also be a geographical quota.  I would not necessarily push this in principle, but I am anxious there is adequate representation on the boards because their references for customers are important given that they are national institutions and in terms of the implications of their relationship with other institutions around the country, to which Senator Fitzgerald referred.  It is no use having a gender quota with males and females from outside Dublin if they are told they have nothing to complain about because there is an adequate number of their gender on the boards and the services are not conscious of the demands and needs of <Col N="2131" /> clients from outside the city.  The Minister is familiar with the difficulties which can arise if one lives beyond the magic distance from the centre of Dublin.  I have confidence in his ingenuity and resourcefulness regarding this matter.</P>
    <P>However, I am uneasy about the ministerial powers in this area.  It appears the entire board will be appointed by the Minister.  The RDS and the RIA will submit names but I am not sure of the proportion, whether it is one from four or two from eight.  This is a bad principle. If institutions are asked to nominate people, it should be left at that. The Minister should accept it in principle because if one trusts them to do the job properly, presumably they will come up with names which deserve to be included.</P>
    <P>When a Minister has such power regarding the appointment of the remaining members of the boards, it introduces unnecessary divisiveness and potential rivalry in the institutions where two or four names are submitted and one is selected.  It also, arguably, casts doubt on the Minister's motives in terms of why one person rather than another is chosen if two or four appear equally qualified to the institution.  This measure is unnecessary and the consequences are potentially unsavoury in various directions.  There is no need for it given that the Minister has so many direct appointments of his or her choosing. As a general principle, I am unhappy with this manner of proceeding with nominations.</P>
    <P>Section 20 states that a member shall not be eligible for reappointment if he or she has served two consecutive terms but section 20(6)(b) states that if a person is appointed for part of a term, they may be reappointed for one further consecutive term.  Does this mean people may be reappointed five years later or that they are not disqualified for life once they have served two consecutive terms?  I ask the Minister to clarify this aspect.</P>
    <P>In relation to the museum section 17 states that the board may at its discretion <Col N="2132" /> organise within the State public exhibitions of museum heritage objects in its collection.  However, the phrase &ldquo;may at its discretion&rdquo; is too permissive. If national policy is that there should be more such exhibitions in the State, the board should be encouraged to do so in the section; it should not be at its discretion.</P>
    <P>I was not aware that board members may be remunerated until Senator Manning mentioned it.  The Bill states that there may be remuneration but the Senator implied that board members will be remunerated.  I oppose remuneration for service on the boards.  If members of the RDS or RIA are nominated, there should not be an implication that they will receive money for it.  If these people are genuine, which is the case, they will not be there for the money.  It besmirches the idea of service on such boards to introduce the issue of money.  If there was a class quota as distinct from a gender quota, and poor people were on the board, something could be said for remunerating them as a type of indoor welfare payment. However, this does not arise regarding the type of people who will be involved.</P>
    <P>The quorums are too small.  Section 23(4) states that a board may appoint a person to be chairperson of a committee, but what happens if the board does not appoint one?  A number of aspects need to be clarified in that regard.  I am most uneasy with the phrase in section 28 that a person may be removed from office by the board of the museum with the consent of the Minister.  I hope this will be for stated reasons.  There are other areas where it appears the Minister has too much power but I will not linger on them.  The Minister understands the drift of my philosophy.  The Minister should have ample power but it is unnecessary for him to have total power in these matters.</P>
    <P>Section 29 states that an adequate number of the members of the staff of the board should be competent in the Irish language so as to provide service through Irish as well as English.  I presume this is an improvement on current <Col N="2133" /> requirements.  In terms of employment on the boards, I hope it would normally be expected that people have an adequate knowledge of Irish and that it is not exceptional.  I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that it should not be compulsory, but perhaps the measure should be rephrased in terms of people who would normally be competent in Irish and English.</P>
    <P>I am unclear about the precise relationship with the Heritage Council regarding the functioning in certain respects of the institutions.  Various sections mention that after consultation with the Heritage Council, certain things may be done.  Why is this necessary in certain cases, for example in relation to library policy?  I have an open view on this matter but I do not understand why the Heritage Council would be more competent to make judgments than the library authorities in terms of lending, etc.</P>
    <P>Many aspects of the Bill arouse interest among those of us who have spent some of the happiest days of our lives in some of the institutions, second only to days in the Seanad.  I congratulate the Minister and I will conclude with the words &ldquo;airgead, airgead, airgead&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in this Bill generally but in section 13 in particular. This section states that the Genealogical Office shall, on the establishment day, become and be dissolved.  This disturbs me.  It also states in 13.3 that:</P>
      <P>the board shall, from time to time as occasion requires, designate a member of its staff to perform the duty of researching, granting and confirming coats of arms.  Such members shall use the appellation Chief Herald or, in the Irish language, Príomh-Aralt na hÉireann while performing such duties.</P>
      <P>That sounds laudable but I am not sure that it is and I look forward to the Minister's explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take particular exception to the words &ldquo;from time to time as occasion <Col N="2134" /> requires&rdquo; and &ldquo;a member of the staff&rdquo;. We are talking about something more than a member of staff in the Office of the Chief Herald.  The Minister should be trying to establish the Office of the Chief Herald rather than diminishing it. Every western European nation state is possessed of an inheritance that supports the self esteem of its people and gives them credence as members of a civilised community.  That inheritance comprises spiritual and artistic strains and, in the case of historic architecture and artefacts, is tangible and symbolic. Some countries such as Ireland, situated on the edge of Europe, have long maintained distinctive art forms but these, in time, were affected by the intrusion of external influences.</P>
    <P>Ireland did not experience the classical world at first hand.  The introduction of classical learning and thought came with the Latin language and Patrick's mission.  The Norman invasion increased European influence on Ireland as it had earlier done on England.  In Ireland it merged with the reforms of the church under Malachy to provide the basis for a new social order, the feudal system.</P>
    <P>In that carefully layered feudal society everyone had their place &mdash; the nobleman, the knights, the barons, the kings and so on.  The military side of the social structure was of primary importance in the maintenance of order.  Those who operated it had to be identified if they were to lead and be followed. Special offices called heralds, appointed by authority, signalled out these people and gave them distinctive badges appropriate to their military role.  The insignias were painted on shields and became known as coats of arms.  These arms were later embellished with symbols of enhancement and, in time, became particular to families.</P>
    <P>As the military side of the herald's work diminished their social significance increased as a regulatory device in a society where social conformity was important for official positions.  For example, the exiled wild geese petitioned the Irish herald for confirmation <Col N="2135" /> of family status in their application for military positions in the armies of Europe.  There was a need for an official who could adjudicate in matters of succession, the keeping of family records, the granting of arms to petitioners, the recording of acts of state and the arrangement of ceremonial.  All of these functions were the preserve of the herald. This heraldic responsibility has been in operation in Ireland for nearly 500 years, the office having been set up in Dublin as Ulster King of Arms in 1562.</P>
    <P>It has always been the duty of the herald to act for the State in the granting and registration of coats of arms of Ireland.  This would entail the registration of the seals of office of officials, the protection of the armorial symbols of the State, the granting of coats of arms to corporate bodies, schools, colleges, universities, towns, county councils and boroughs, the giving of ecclesiastical arms at home and abroad, the registration of Irish chieftains and the inspection and granting of personal arms to the many Irish people native to the country or of ethnic origin who petition the Irish herald as an appropriate authority for special enhancement of their family.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to abolish the Office of the Chief Herald.  Perhaps &ldquo;abolish&rdquo; is too strong a word but there will be a redefining and, eventually, an abolishing of the office.  I do not know if the Minister looks upon this as some kind of levelling, given his philosophy. Let me quote Michael Merrigan, Secretary of the Dún Laoghaire Genealogical Society, who says:</P>
    <P>We as Irish genealogists are very proud of our Republic, its institutions and our Constitution.  Therefore, we are very concerned that some might erroneously contend that the Chief Herald grants official recognition to titles or nobiliary titles inconsistent with our constitutional position as a republic.  This is not the case and to do so would conflict with article 42.1. <Col N="2136" /> Though what is actually granted is official recognition of designation, for example, the O'Connor Don or the Maguire of Fermanagh, the granting of official recognition to these designations is not inconsistent with our Constitution.  This practice recognises the antiquity of our nation, our culture, and our genealogical heritage is one of the oldest in Ireland and, therefore, is very important in the context of our wider European heritage and identity.</P>
    <P>The importance of this office was recognised in 1943 when the Taoiseach Eamon de Valera was at great pains to reserve this position for the Irish State. His Government quite correctly assumed control of the rights and prerogatives formerly exercised by the British Crown.  The Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland is the successor to Ulster King of Arms, a Crown office which was established in 1552 to regulate all heraldic matters in Ireland.  Originally it was based in Bedford Tower, Dublin Castle, and continued after the creation of the Free State in 1922 to exercise all heraldic functions in Ireland until 1943.  In that year Mr. de Valera tasked Edward MacLysaght with the responsibility of assuming the function of the Ulster King of Arms so that it might be brought under the control of the State. In 1945, when it became clear that the traditional work of the office was continuing as it had under the British Government, Dr. MacLysaght was given the title of Chief Herald of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The wide ranging scope of the Chief Herald's functions is such that the grants are made not only to Irish citizens but also to the Irish diaspora.  This is very dear to the President's heart but also to numerous individuals.  For example, a previous Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, has a grant of arms with supporters, an unusual embellishment in that it is very rarely granted.  Many of our top businessmen obtain grants of arms &mdash; for example, Dr. Michael Smurfit. <Col N="2137" /> These people see it as an important part of being Irish.</P>
    <P>The Chief Herald carries out many other functions, perhaps one of the most important being the maintenance of a register of arms.  This register dates from the inception of the office in 1552 and contains a record of all heraldic insignia granted over that period, each carefully hand painted on one of its pages.  This register is not only a priceless historical document but also provides legal protection to these heraldic insignia as a species of property belonging to the individual or body in whose name they are registered.  Such is the prestige of heraldic insignia granted by the Chief Herald of Ireland that no fewer than six Presidents of the United States have accepted grants from this office.</P>
    <P>Even if this office was given independence, it would be a money making office for the Government.  Rather than it costing money, it would actually generate a profit for the State.  I know the Attorney General's Office has been computerised recently and I am sure that the Office of the Chief Herald could be likewise updated.</P>
    <P>The staff of the Office of the Chief Herald lecture worldwide to the Irish cultural circle.  There is no one more widely versed in the cultural traditions of the indigenous Gaelic families, the Hiberno-Norman families and those Irish families of French, English, Welsh and Scottish antecedents than the Chief Herald of Ireland.  As a cultural spokesman, the unique function of the Chief Herald bridges any divide and brings together as Irishmen and Irishwomen individuals from our culturally rich and diverse society.  The Chief Herald of Ireland is at once the keeper of our historically important heraldic heritage while simultaneously adding to that heritage for future generations of Irish people.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Chief Herald not only keeps alive the artistic skills of the 16th century, of which we as a nation can be proud, but its staff serve as cultural ambassadors worldwide and share <Col N="2138" /> with others the richness of our great heraldic past while allowing them to take part in our shining heraldic future. In response to the considerable interest in heraldry among the Irish diaspora, the Chief Herald attends meetings and conferences abroad and represents, if not in a formal sense in the eyes of those who attend, the Irish State, its culture, history and dignity.  The Chief Herald of Ireland also deals with representatives of other heraldic authorities, all of whom come directly under the Government or head of state in their respective countries.</P>
    <P>The Bill fails to recognise the artistic, cultural and linguistic importance of heraldry.  All grants of heraldic insignia are made in the Irish language.  One of the brilliant proposals of the Constitution review group is to reduce the status of the Irish language, but that is another day's work.  The Bill also fails to take cognisance of the legal standing of the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland and the effect the proposed change will have on the validity of any future grants made by that office.</P>
    <P>Every country which exercises its prerogative to grant or regulate heraldic insignia does so by appointing a heraldic authority which functions as an office of the State.  These officers, whether coming under the aegis of the ministry of justice, as is the case in Spain, or the head of state as in Canada, function independently.  Their grants of heraldic insignia are made on behalf of their respective Governments or states. These grants are considered under law as effective grants in so far as they derive their authority from the sover-eighty of their respective countries.</P>
    <P>For far too long the position of Chief Herald of Ireland has been clouded internationally by its attachment to the National Library.  As a courtesy, other heraldic institutions have recognised Irish grants as effective on the assumption that, having assumed the prerogatives of the former British authority in the Republic, the Chief Herald of Ireland continued to function as an officer of State.  However, under this <Col N="2139" /> Bill, which would abolish the office which gives the Chief Herald the ability to make effective grants, it is quite clear the Chief Herald would not be an officer of the State.</P>
    <P>It follows that should the proposed Bill come into effect grants of heraldic insignia made by the National Library could not be regarded as effective or as valid by other heraldic authorities which would, quite rightly, decline to record them in their national registers, thus depriving the grantee of any legal protection in foreign heraldic jurisdictions. As a consequence of this lack of recognition, Irish citizens would be forced to apply to Ulster King of Arms in London for effective heraldic grants and protection. That would be appalling.  It would be a bitter irony if some 50 years after the de Valera Government secured the heraldic rights of the nation those rights were discarded and Irishmen and women were obliged to deal once more with the British Government to secure and protect their heraldic rights.</P>
    <P>In effect, this Bill will greatly lower the status of Irish grants of heraldic insignia.  It will remove any prestige from an Irish grant of heraldic insignia. It will effectively reduce the value of a grant to the same level as a reader's card for the National Library &mdash; hardly a suitable item for presentation to a visiting head of state of Irish descent.  It could be argued that it would be improper for the Government to charge a fee for a document with no more legal validity than a similar document concocted in an artisan's garret in a Hong Kong back street.  It would have decorative value but as a valid, effective, heraldic document it would be of questionable value.</P>
    <P>Arguably there might be some merit in merging the Genealogical Office with the National Library.  Both bodies are concerned with the storage of information for later retrieval, unlike the Chief Herald's Office which actively creates heraldic documents of a personal or corporate nature every day. The Government will have to be very <Col N="2140" /> careful to ensure that documents on deposit in the Office of the Chief Herald remain in that office because they are not the property of the Genealogical Office but are private property on loan to the Chief Herald.</P>
    <P>Should the Government or the Minister feel it is desirable from an administrative point of view to abolish the Genealogical Office, they must take care to preserve the function of the Chief Herald as an independent office of State, in much the same manner as the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is separate from that of the Attorney General. Just as the function of the Chief State Solicitor is different from the duties of the Attorney General, so too must the function of the Chief Herald be preserved as different from the duties of the Director of the National Library.</P>
    <P>To fail to protect the legal rights of our citizens to our heraldic property in the future is to arrogantly turn one's back on a cultural tradition shared by all segments of Irish society, at home and abroad.  That cultural tradition was preserved by Mr. de Valera in 1943 when he claimed the heraldic office in Dublin Castle for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I received a letter on this subject from Mr. Thomas Ryan from Robertstown Lodge, Robertstown, Ashbourne, County Meath, the last paragraph of which is very apt.  It states:</P>
    <P>What no viceroy laid hands on, what Mr. Cosgrave accepted as a useful and enhancing agency in a new state, what Mr. de Valera in similar regard confirmed for the use of the country in the title Chief Herald of Ireland as successor to the departing Ulster, an office whose ordinance encompasses the entire country, and that without contention or political objection, is now, in an action as mysterious of purpose as it is unmindful of history, to be abolished.  Should this purpose succeed, it may save a salary but it will diminish a nation.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister look again at section 13 of this fine Bill?  This is a special <Col N="2141" /> office.  I approached the Minister before on this issue and we had gentle words about it.  He is a man of culture, great learning and intellectual ability who can appreciate what this is all about.  Preserving the status of this office would not offend his Labour Party principles; I assure him that it would only enhance the status of the Government and the country.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill in principle, as have most bodies within the State.  It is an important Bill.  It is great to see the huge change in attitude regarding the protection of our history and heritage.  I applaud the efforts by the Heritage Council to enforce the view among the public that our past is as important to our present and future as what we are doing now and that we must preserve it.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate FÁS on the great, practical efforts it continually makes to put in place community projects.  As Senator Lee said, it is a matter of &ldquo;airgead&rdquo; but &ldquo;obair&rdquo; is also important and the obair would not be done in various areas without the efforts of FÁS.  I wish it could be involved in more projects.  I am dismayed by some situations, particularly those of small Church of Ireland churches which have very small or no congregations.  The church in Rathcormack has a particularly important interior but, unfortunately, much of the stained glass has been broken.  If only we could encourage more of the public to take a greater interest in trying to protect our heritage.  As Senator Fitzgerald pointed out, we have extremely difficult problems with vandalism.  The more we can do to promote the importance of our past, the better.  I greatly welcome the Bill and the work the Minister has done in this area in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to see how important heraldry and the granting of arms are considered in a republic.  I thought there was some question about the constitutionality of the 1943 legislation and whether we were entitled to set up such an office.  However, I am glad the office is there.  We should try to alter the Bill <Col N="2142" /> to reassure anybody who feels there is a dark threat to abolish the office.  The office is important.  There should be greater cohesion rather than a feeling that the office is somehow being split up.</P>
    <P>The office and the post of Chief Herald are important because they are on an all island basis.  They are used by people from all over the world and are also referred to constantly by people from both traditions in Northern Ireland.  It is most important to protect our institutions because we have enough difficulties making progress on the ones we want to establish without damaging the existing ones.</P>
    <P>The office is very important to people working professionally in this field.  This has been pointed out by many previous speakers. While there is a course in genealogy in UCD now, none of the universities gives degree courses in this area so the Chief Herald does not have to be called on very often to give a valuation for higher degrees.  A formal link with the universities is needed and we must recognise that this area has to be protected on an international basis. Senator Lydon gave a very detailed description of the importance of the office so, if I leave my comments at that I hope no one will think it is because I do not consider it to be extraordinarily important.</P>
    <P>This legislation is an awkward but honest attempt to protect the office, but there seems to be some idea that the Genealogical Office has an independent staff.  It does not.  Its staff are from the National Library.  This area has to be looked at very carefully because we have to be very concerned about the protection of the genealogical manuscript collection.  It has to be kept under very careful security in the manuscripts reading room of the library.  We want to be sure there is no diminution of the importance of this office or of access to the office.  Many of those who consult the office come from abroad and it is difficult enough trying to do work on this area in another language without <Col N="2143" /> finding any further obstructions to research.</P>
    <P>No reference is made in the Bill to the Irish Film Archive although the archive holds the remit for the national collection of Irish film.  That is a serious omission. The sections of the proposed Bill which deal with the legal deposit of certain material to the National Library replacing section 56 of the Copyright Act, 1963, talk about the scope of the deposit which has been extended to include audio visual materials including film.  However, the collection of non-print material, such as film, is at the discretion of the board of the library and is not mandatory.</P>
    <P>Section 46 of the 1963 Act specifies that the board of the library, if it decides to collect material such as film, can transfer this material to any other cultural institution designated by the Minister. These provisions combined may provide a mechanism for the legal deposit of film at the Irish Film Archive. However, its implementation is dependent on too many variables, for example, the goodwill of the National Library and the Minister.  There could be problems if a film production company refused to lodge a copy of one of its productions at the National Library for transfer to the film archive.  Will the library staff pursue the matter on behalf of the archive?  Specific legislation for the deposit of audio visual material at the archive would be preferable.  The present Minister championed the Irish film industry and the issue of a properly resourced national collection of film has never been more pertinent.  Perhaps when he is concluding this debate he could discuss that matter.</P>
    <P>I wish to touch briefly on what the Minister said about the National Gallery. The National Gallery is of incredible importance.  It does not come totally under this Bill but the Minister mentioned provisions in relation to annual reports, accounts and borrowing powers.  Perhaps we could use the lending powers to the Houses of the Oireachtas more.  The National Gallery <Col N="2144" /> has an enormous collection which is not on show and it is a great pity that the Houses of the Oireachtas do not seem to be in a position to borrow more from the National Gallery.  We were very fortunate that the National Gallery loaned the magnificent portrait of Countess Markievicz to the Houses of the Oireactas some years ago, but it would be splendid if we had more paintings from the National Gallery on display here.</P>
    <P>Few Houses of Parliament I visited have such a deficit of art.  If the Minister could influence in any way either the Houses of the Oireachtas or the National Gallery to come to an <i>entente cordiale</i> on the subject, we could have some of the large landscapes by Nathaniel Hone and so forth on display within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That would enhance the building enormously. I have brought up this matter before without much success but perhaps the Minister could put some thought into it now and devise a mechanism by which we could enjoy all those paintings which are being stored in the National Gallery at present.</P>
    <P>The National Library, as has been pointed out, has a serious staffing problem and this creates great difficulties for the work in the library.  This problem has to be tackled because it has been going on for a very long time.  The hours of opening are very short and this makes it very difficult for people to work there.  There are major implications for anyone trying to do research in the library because, unless we can do something about staffing and funding and unless money can be found, whatever fine words we say about the library they will be as nothing.</P>
    <P>I want to talk briefly about section 18, which gives the library board the right to dispose of material under certain specific and rigorous conditions.  It costs money to keep, preserve, conserve and catalogue all the items within the library's holdings, but I wish to talk about a problem that can arise and which I ran into myself the other day. This may apply mainly to scientific books but it could apply to many other <Col N="2145" /> areas as well.  The disposal of books of a certain date may leave you with very little knowledge of the state of scientific knowledge at a specific time.  I ran into this problem when I was trying to do work on the hepatitis C disaster and trying to pinpoint the state of knowledge, let us say, in 1977, ten years later and then some time after that.</P>
    <P>It is almost impossible for libraries to keep every edition.  There is constant updating of editions but being able to look retrospectively at a state of knowledge can be very important.  The College of Physicians, for example, stopped buying contemporary books about 20 years ago, but we have to be sure that somewhere within the State we have a repository of the state of knowledge at various times and if it is not the National Library, I do not know where it can be.  While I can understand the problems and the cost in keeping, preserving, conserving and cataloguing items, it is important to remember that it may be absolutely essential to be able to look back at the state of knowledge of a specific field at particular times. While it is important that the library should be free to dispose of certain materials, it is most important that this should not be to the detriment of students, researchers or other members of the public who may wish to read this material at a later date.</P>
    <P>The membership of the board may cause similar problems and perhaps it should be broader.  Would it be possible to have heads of universities on the board, people from the Irish Library Association, the Royal Irish Academy, the Irish Management Institute and so forth?  As Senator Lee said, geographic diversity would probably be advisable as well.  The National Museum has been in need of improvement for a long time and I am glad the Minister has tackled this situation.  The quorums that have been mentioned for board meetings are small and, surely, the composition of the board could be wider.</P>
    <P>Some of the Bill's definitions are narrow, as other Senators have pointed out. <Col N="2146" /> For example, under &ldquo;archaeological objects&rdquo; it would be important to stress decorative arts, history, industry, natural sciences and Irish folklore.  While the primary purpose of the board is the collection and preservation of Irish heritage, non Irish material is of great educational importance also.  That should be part of the collection policy.  There is a considerable amount in the museum already.  Admittedly, a great deal of it is not on display, but it is hoped it will be on display after the museum moves to Collins Barracks.  Deacquisitioning has been addressed regarding the National Library but not for the National Museum.  While there are mixed views about this, perhaps future policy for the museum should be looked at here because it is extremely difficult to keep, preserve and conserve a huge collection, even though one might hope to do so. When one has only limited funds, parts of collections which duplicate others have to be removed.</P>
    <P>It is important that the board is set up on a statutory basis but it is felt by many that the board should have representatives on it from the Royal Dublin Society and the Royal Irish Academy in view of the enormous amount of work that they have put into the building of the museum.  Reservations have been expressed about the section regarding the loan of objects from collections because it is felt that some of them are so unique they should not be transported outside the museum.  A list of objects should be prepared which would be subject to review from time to time. Again, only archaeological objects are mentioned for lending in the Bill.  The RIA, in particular, feels that it should be consulted regarding the lending of objects from its collection which have been put on display in the museum.  It has concerns about the purchase of national treasures which are in public care and feels that this is infringing on its rights.  It has also expressed concern regarding the export of heritage objects because it is felt that the definition of what can be exported is too narrow and the RIA is seriously concerned about <Col N="2147" /> the export of decorative art such as silver, glass, furniture, paintings and sculpture. There is not enough control over exports.</P>

      <P>I realise the Minister is making great efforts in that area.  It is good that there is such concern about these objects being exported because until about 20 years ago they were being exported by the boatload.  Another worry was that the valuation put on objects for export was too low.  £35,000 was the highest valuation and there was concern about the export of small objects which could be of great value. The criticisms expressed are important because it shows that many people are anxious that the legislation the Minister is introducing, which they support, is comprehensive so that there are no loopholes for the outrageous incidents of the past when some of our most valuable material was exported.  Again, they are concerned that only archaeological objects are mentioned in the section on lending.</P>

      <P>Ba maith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadoírí a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht.  Bhí mé ag tógáil nótaí agus ag éisteacht go cruinn leis an méid a dúradh.  I thank Senators for their interesting and valuable comments on the Bill and I have <Col N="2148" /> noted them.  Some of the points raised have been addressed in the course of drafting the legislation &mdash; for example, the extension of the definition of &ldquo;archaeological object&rdquo; to &ldquo;cultural object&rdquo;, which is more inclusive.  The agencies and bodies which were concerned about this Bill made valuable representations, including two Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many issues have been raised and I regret that if in the course of my reply I do not deal adequately with some of the issues raised, but they can be discussed on Committee Stage.  The Bill has many facets and there has only been time to focus on a few of them but I am pleased to note the general tone of support for the Bill.  Anyone seriously concerned about the cultural institutions at the end of the 20th century would realise that modern legislation and effective administration are needed.  They also need resources and a strategic relationship with expanding public interest and demand.  In their structures they must be able to innovate and deal with change in a way that serves the specialist scholarly interest and, more particularly, the public right of access.  There is no point in saying that the one thing should not happen until the other is made available because I will not speak politically.  I ask Senators to reflect on what I inherited with regard to these institutions in terms of inadequate resources and structures.  Legislation had never been attempted.  Some of the institutions, which I pointed out in my Second Stage speech, are operating under agreements signed in 1881 and 1889.  Did it not matter until now that the legislation was inadequate?  There was comprehensive neglect.  I appreciate the point made by Senators that if we get the legislation, the administrative structures and the relationship with other institutions right, we must provide resources.  I also appreciate the support from all sides on making such resources available.  However, that will only come about when there is public and political backing for adequate support for the cultural dimension of the national identity. At present there is a huge interest <Col N="2149" /> in Ireland externally.  More importantly, it has been indicated that when all the froth is taken away people believe in national self-respect.  This national féin mheas, which is important to many, is more important than any other commercial benefits.</P>
    <P>I would like to respond positively to a suggestion made in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 13 October in the same spirit in which it was offered and to put an end to confusion which has arisen.  It referred to &ldquo;a detail in the stonework of the Genealogical Office in Kildare Street which Michael D. Higgins plans to close.&rdquo;  It stopped short of suggesting that I would use a sledgehammer and break the piece of stone.  There was never a proposal to close that building, abolish the Genealogical Office or to do anything other than put the Office of the Chief Herald on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to Senators Mooney, Taylor-Quinn, Norris and others who specifically mentioned the proposals on the Genealogical Office.  I repeat there has never been a wish or an intent that the work of genealogy or heraldry should be adversely affected by legislative changes, quite the contrary. These proposals, in their attempt to set out in primary statute &mdash; this is where the contrast with the 1943 Order arises &mdash; the functions of heraldry and genealogy, to recognise and specify the Chief Herald's role and in clearly establishing the overall authority of the board of the library, were designed as enabling positive initiatives for the purpose of strengthening the public's involvement in these fields.</P>
    <P>I recognise I had a choice to make. When I finish speaking I hope there will be only one issue between us, that is, whether the Genealogical Office should be a separate office with no relationship to the library.  I would like those who advanced that idea to think about it and I will also deal with the historical origins of such an idea and its implications.</P>
    <P>The debate has shown that there is still some confusion and concern about what is proposed.  I was struck by Senator Mooney's view that while he <Col N="2150" /> understood my approach to clarifying the legal anachronism, he was concerned that the wording of the Bill might imply a cavalier approach to an old tradition and might be perceived as, for example, ignoring the wishes of interested groups in Northern Ireland. That was not my intention and I appreciate the Senator's comments.  I undertook a detailed re-examination of the issue to see if there was an alternative approach to achieving my objective of placing genealogical and heraldic work within the framework of the National Library while providing a statutory basis for this work.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear on this issue.  I hope some of the outrageous letters written to the newspapers will, on foot of what I have said today, be corrected and withdrawn.  Some have been outrageous in their abuse of the facts.  I emphasised that I was giving a statutory base to an office for which there was no clear definition and an express relationship on a statutory basis to functions for which there was no clear designation. The part of the row which will survive will be among those who say genealogical functions should be treated separately and that if a librarian comes into the room, genealogical functions will be diminished.  I have heard that extreme view.  The onus on those who hold it is to show how it has been in the past and how it will be in the future.  I have an open mind on that.</P>
    <P>A missing component in the contributions on the Chief Herald, particularly in that of Senator Lydon, concerns the function of the Chief Herald. What is present practice and international practice?  Is there such a thing as best practice and, if so, how has the Irish experience measured up?  We would have to treat the conjunctions in history between the 16th century and the present.</P>
    <P>When preparing the legislation I looked at the files from the 1920s and 1940s and found the Government in the 1920s was interested in the furniture in the office and the records rather than in the title.  In 1943 it was recommended <Col N="2151" /> that the functions of the office be given to the Department of Education.  At a conference of the Departments of Finance, Justice and Education on 19 February 1943 it was agreed that the office would continue to discharge under Irish administration the functions which it has hitherto carried out in relation to the grant of arms, tracing of genealogies, etc.  It was also agreed that the office be assigned to the Department of Education with a view to its being placed under the supervision of the Director of the National Library.</P>
    <P>As I said, I appreciated the comments because they were correct in suggesting that there could have been more than one interpretation of the text.  I reexamined the issue to see how we might achieve a better text.  The wording contained in section 13(1) only dissolves the Genealogical Office rather than creating it and dissolving it as I wished.  I accept the point by Senator Mooney that it is possible that construction could be put on it.  The detail involved in this topic needs further teasing out.  It is our shared objective to protect and enhance the potential of the cultural resources of genealogy and heraldry within a clear governance structure involving administrative accountability.  Surely, one must see the functions of which we are in favour benefit from that being clear so it need not deconstruct into personality differences which would be to the destruction of the proper functions to which the citizenry are entitled.</P>
    <P>So I am planning to introduce some changes on Committee Stage in a further attempt to clarify and accurately reflect this intent, and I appreciate the assistance of the House.  These changes will replace the formal dissolution of the office with a word which for the avoidance of any doubt, declares that the Genealogical Office is a branch of the National Library.  I am advised by the Attorney General's Office that these will both provide a statutory recognition for the office and link it administratively to the National Library.  When I use the term &ldquo;National Library&rdquo;, I am of course <Col N="2152" /> referring to the structures which will be in place in the Bill, but the House will recall that the 1943 suggestion was to link it to the office of the Director of the National Library.</P>
    <P>In the process of drawing up new proposals I am mindful of Senator Mooney's suggestion that the long-term interest of genealogy and heraldry might lie in a separate office of State for these functions.  I listened with great care to his suggestion and I might have some reservations about it.  The establishment of a separate office is a multifaceted issue involving, at the physical level, accommodation, staffing and budgeting aspects and, as Senator Mooney pointed out, important issues relating to access and the care and management of valuable manuscripts also need to be dealt with.  The scale of the work would make it difficult to argue for a completely separate structure with all the supporting infrastructure required.</P>
    <P>However, I am conscious that the issue of genealogical research is a wide one which spans a number of the cultural institutions and there is a need to examine how genealogy can best be developed across the various bodies involved.  Senator Kelly, among others, mentioned the widespread interest in this.  Accordingly, I have decided to formally ask the Heritage Council, whose remit extends to genealogy, to examine how the development of the cultural resources represented by genealogy, inclusive of heraldry, might best be achieved and to report back to me in due course.  I stress that I have no wish to predetermine the outcome of that examination; my mind is open.</P>
    <P>Senators will notice that I said &ldquo;genealogy, inclusive of heraldry,&rdquo;.  I will not be provoked into speculating on what heraldry, non-inclusive of genealogy, is because others have written extensively and humorously about such practice, but it is interesting that genealogy and records are there as sources from which comes practice.  It is a very entertaining debate about which I am sure there could be not only regional and national <Col N="2153" /> but also many international conferences.</P>
    <P>I was struck by Senator Norris' observation that the birthday of James Joyce coincides with the date on which the Chief Herald of Ireland was created. Clearly, as I too alluded to Joyce in my opening speech, we share a common sensibility so, far from &ldquo;doing in&rdquo; the Chief Herald, I am in the style of Finnegan's Wake making sure the man is resurrected. The purpose of section 13(3) is to recognise the existence of the Chief Herald in primary statutes of the Irish State, that is, to recognise the practice of heraldry.  Senators will notice I have said a previous word about best practice being a consideration here which has been missing in all the correspondence to the papers but to which my attention has been drawn by people from abroad who have commented on the standard of heraldry, etc., and this is very interesting.  To ensure this practice is also continued within the framework of the library long into the 21st century, we must at least ensure we avoid a situation where Joyce's brilliant prose would be lost to a contemporary audience due to the State inadvertently sweeping away material cultural resources.</P>
    <P>I can readily accept Senator Fitzgerald's special interest in heraldry matters, given his illustrious name and its association with Leinster House.  He referred to the issue of the permanence of the appointment of Chief Herald, that the words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; in some way make the appointment temporary.  This is not the intent.  The board is being obliged to carry on this activity.  The only significance of the words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; is to recognise that a person may not be appointed for life and that, due to transfers of duties, illness or incapacity, mental or physical, the board would be empowered to appoint someone else to the position.  This is to take care of the transience to which all of us, whether we like it or not, are committed.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald astutely pointed out the usefulness of owning the copyright of coats of arms.  Hitherto the <Col N="2154" /> copyright position has not been as clear as it should be, so I provide in the Bill for an affirmation of the State's stake in such copyrights by assigning it to the National Library.  This will provide a greater measure of protection than is currently the case.</P>
    <P>I note Senator Mooney's points about the desirability of some system of awards for meritorious conduct or good citizenship.  While I appreciate the Senator's concerns in this area, this would primarily be a matter for the Taoiseach and there are constitutional issues involved.  As he knows, Article 40 states that titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an interesting point and, again, I have a personal view on this matter, which was discussed in files which date from the 1940s in which people wanted to confer titles on each other.  It was suggested in an interesting discussion at one stage that the Chief Herald be called a &ldquo;Bolscaire&rdquo;.  I will not give Senators any more etymological detail in the interest of time as this was changed to the title involved, but it makes interesting reading.  I must restrain myself.</P>
      <P>It is important that we realise a great deal of effort and energy went into the Bill.  It is a great pity in many ways that this matter, the text of which, I accept, should have been clear from the outset, has dislodged concentration, so that I have been accused of doing the very opposite of what is in the Bill, which provides a legal base for the functions, office, accountability and procedures and ensures it continues in the powers of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, the concept of an award for meritorious citizenship, for instance, is an interesting one and I accept the point made by Senator Mooney and others that there is a distinction between an award for meritorious citizenship and a predilection for alleged nobility.  Mind you, the pursuers of nobility have not been in short supply <Col N="2155" /> either, as some of the applications for different notifications would reveal.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney also made some important proposals about the governance structures of the museum and library and I am satisfied that what is provided is appropriate for the institutions concerned.  I agree with Senator Lee who said that the most democratic structure is one where the Minister of the day is responsible for appointing all the members of the boards for fixed terms of office and for all appointees to serve in their personal capacities.  The fact that a person is not there simply as the representative of one view but is able to take account of managing change and the staff implications of the total picture has proved to be very important.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of specified roles for the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society should be seen in the context of pre-existing formal agreements which were in place in relation to the National Museum and National Library.  In my opening Second Stage speech I referred to the 1881 agreement and the later agreement of the 1880s.  I acknowledged and appreciated their role as repositories, people who handled the making of gifts and their crucial role in the evolution of the present institutions. The arrangements which were entered into were by agreement between these institutions and my Department.  There was a need to have those agreements renegotiated in accordance with the requirements.  The Senator should note that I have provided in section 19 that, in making appointments to the boards of the museum and library, there should be a reasonable balance of expertise reflected on the boards.  I see this balance as including those with specialist library or museum expertise as could be expected to be available from those within the Library Association of Ireland or, for example, through the Irish Museum Association.  I will consider what account can be taken of this <Col N="2156" /> before Committee Stage but I am satisfied that the balance is right.</P>
    <P>Before we become carried away we must realise that Ministers are elected by the people they represent.  In many ways, those whose names were suggested do not represent the public. People stand for election to the Dáil or Seanad and are appointed to ministerial office by decision of the House.  It appears there is an assumption that, because he or she makes a nomination, a Minister is being less than democratic. I know of nothing more democratic than an election.  I am aware of people in very high positions in different institutions who are not enormously moved by democracy.  I acknowledge that the process in place is democratic but I do not state that we should not take account of special qualifications, expertise and functions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">

      <P>I agree that the legislation cannot substitute for basic shortfalls in terms of staffing numbers and yearly funding.  I also agree that the resources of the National Library and National Museum need to be greatly improved and I am working hard to see that these institutions receive more funds annually.  If I am succeeded in this Ministry by someone else, I hope the same arguments will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I inherited a wasteland of neglect in this area across all headings.  Legislation was old and inadequate, institutional arrangements were archaic, imprecise and grieved those working within them. In relation to section 13 (1), I accept that the language is perhaps capable of ambiguous construction.  There are unresolved questions regarding the balance between the public interest and the institutions which belong to members of the public and the capacity to deal with change and innovation.  I have enjoyed some success in this regard.  The National Library grant-in-aid funding for 1996 shows an increase of 78 per <Col N="2157" /> cent on the allocation in the Department's first year in existence, 1993.  I am the first to admit that this originated from an inadequate base.  In an equivalent period the museum's grant-in-aid funding showed an increase of 300 per cent, an increase reflecting a need to facilitate planning in connection with the Collins Barracks Museum development.</P>
    <P>On the capital front I committed £33 million to major development of the National Museum infrastructure at Collins Barracks and at a regional location near Castlebar.  Major capital projects for the library recently completed, under way or planned include the establishment of a new photographic archive located in Temple Bar, the development of new conservation facilities in the Racquet Hall and a major development in the College of Art building.  Recently introduced tax breaks and special capital grants have allowed the museum and library among others to acquire significant cultural treasures &mdash; the DeVescii papers, the Norah McGuiness archive and the portrait by Leo Whelan of the leaders of Ireland's fight for independence are examples of recent acquisitions.  These are significant developments.  That is not to state that the level of resources is adequate but it represents a significant activity improvement.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Senator Quinn's concerns that the boards of the museum and library should be enabled to engage in joint ventures with the private sector and he expressed disappointment that the proposals in the Bill seem to take little account of the needs of the information era.  I am concerned to establish institutions that will be in the forefront of modern technology developments and the various proposals are intended to enable a lead to be taken.  As the Senator mentioned, the boards will have a general power to engage in fund raising activities and this is considered a useful way of involving the private sector.</P>
    <P>I believe there should be an element of plain speaking on this matter.  There <Col N="2158" /> is an organisation called Cothú, which is staffed by members of the private sector, that has discovered a way to assist the arts.  There are wonderful companies in Ireland, many of them foreign, who are assisting the arts.  However, there are a large number of people who are members of different kinds of commercial organisations who regularly take from the increased cultural energy of the country and give nothing in return.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time to stop referring to the private sector as a generically generous entity.  Cothú is a wonderful organisation whose members teach companies how to become involved in assisting the arts.  Many generous companies have been associated with the arts in this manner.  However, there are those who should examine their consciences with regard to how much they are giving back to the community and where they might assist the public interest.  Senator Quinn, because of his idyllic view of the private sector, encouraged me to make that remark. My main point is that public institutions will be provided with updated technology.</P>
      <P>The boards will receive autonomy, be able to construct policy and their functions will be very general.  Therefore, it is not felt that they should be inhibited in forging any strategic alliance where necessary.  Some benefit may be derived from a more explicit spelling out of the possibilities in relation to the exploitation of information technology.  We are already indebted to private companies which assisted the National Library and other institutions through the donation of expertise and technology. This is a heartening development and I will return to it on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to draw attention to the important provisions of section 64 which provide for extension of library deposit arrangements to include non-print forms of media.  As regards links with Trinity College, I look forward to <Col N="2159" /> the day when, in a formal sense, there is close co-operation between Trinity College and the National Library.  I regard the initiative, again in section 64, whereby existing reciprocal arrangements with the United Kingdom may be expanded to include new formats of library material, as an important vehicle whereby the role of Trinity College and the National Library can be seen as complementary and not in competition.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn for her supportive comments.  It is very sad that so much of our national patrimony has been exported without our taking adequate steps to encourage such artefacts to be kept in the State.  The export licensing provisions being introduced are an attempt to begin to stem the tide. In themselves they constitute but one aspect of the overall strategy, another important strand being the introduction of tax reliefs to encourage the donation of significant cultural artefacts to the State instead of their being sold on the international market.  The levels of penalties are set according to the seriousness of the offence involved.  I am concerned that controls being introduced might be in danger of being undermined if excessive penalties, in proportion to the offence, were introduced.  I favour pushing the sanction as far as possible because those who steal from the heritage of the nation must be taught a lesson. I have given my staff that basic direction.  We must strike a balance between the rights of the individual citizen and those of the society of which he or she is a member and of which the heritage is a part.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senator that the taking of artefacts from local archaeological sites is an act of pillage not unlike the ravages of the Vikings, even though they in their turn provided a rich legacy in terms of moveable heritage.  The National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, was a concerted attempt to stop the pilfering of artefacts from outdoor sites and this legislation has been a useful instrument of control. However, we must be forever vigilant. <Col N="2160" /> As Senator Taylor-Quinn said, everybody has a stake in what belongs to the people.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Norris's concern about the removal of valuable objects from our public institutions.  The idea that the Joyce papers from the National Library might be removed and destroyed, from the perspective of the common good, is appalling.  The purpose of the registration of cultural objects &mdash; section 47 &mdash; and the provisions permitting compulsory purchase of such registered objects &mdash; Part V of the Bill &mdash; are to ensure any such proposed piece of vandalism could not happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly spoke about the need to have a network of local and regional museums to complement the development of the National Museum.  This is an area I am keen to encourage through the disbursement of moneys at my disposal for capital projects.  This policy has led to the development of the Hunt Museum in Limerick which is nearing completion and, through the cultural development incentives scheme, to the development of the museum in Cork and a new county museum in Tipperary to be situated in Clonmel.</P>
    <P>These are all capital projects.  When I discuss something like this there is a tendency in the media to add in my responsibility for the Gaeltacht, take the theatre in Galway, the price of the piers in Inismean and Inisheer, the capital programme for Údarás na Gaeltachta and put the whole lot together.  They comment that I am only funding projects for Galway.  People should do their sums better.  The figure for Galway is about 7.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>There are capital initiatives around the country which will open up possibilities that have been sought for years. How can one have best practice in curatorship, security and exhibition skills without buildings? Buildings are now being provided for first time.  I hope such initiatives will allow our national treasures and those of international calibre to be appropriately and <Col N="2161" /> safely exhibited in regional museum centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald spoke about the need to maximise the visitor potential of the National Museum and the National Library and contrasted our lack of success with similar institutions abroad. The provisions in the Bill will give the institutions autonomy to develop their own operations.  They are designed to enable them to maximise visitor potential among other things.</P>
    <P>The Senator also said that the role of the Irish language in the core institutions in the museum and the library needs to be protected.  I agree wholeheartedly. I will examine the legislation in that regard before Committee Stage. It would be unthinkable if the National Library or the National Museum were ever lacking in this sphere.  The Senator wishes to ensure this is not the case in the future and will be pleased to note that section 29 of the Bill requires that there always should be an adequate number of staff in the institutions who would be competent in the Irish language so as to provide a service through Irish as well as English.  While there are limits to what can be achieved by way of statutory action in a provision of symbolic importance in section 35, I provide that the annual reports of the institutions should be in English and Irish.</P>
    <P>In focusing on the exact provisions of the Bill Senator Kelly has noted the intent to empower and enable.  She quoted extensively to show the ways and means by which the museum and library will be able to develop into the 21st century.  Her comments are very perceptive.  The Bill attempts to weave together the strands and interrelationships that are to exist between the cultural institutions.  The purpose of the Bill is to fit the pieces of the jigsaw together.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning raised the issue of the disposal of material by the library. This is intended as a provision for the disposal of material which, because of the donations and acquisitions policy of previous years, would not fall within the library's purpose and <i>raison d'être</i> as the <Col N="2162" /> repository of the record of Ireland.  The term &ldquo;relate&rdquo; in the provision will be used in the widest sense to include any association with Ireland.  We can return to this point on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Given some concerns expressed to me I will introduce an amendment to this section on Committee Stage which would oblige the board to publish its intention to dispose of material in advance of any such disposal.  If there were a difference of view as to the significance of the material there would be an opportunity for it to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee raised the issue of staffing, particularly in the context of the role of the institutions to diffuse knowledge. The position in the institutions needs to be improved.  However, I am happy that in the case of the museum we have agreement on some new posts to be filled, in particular in the context of the Collins Barracks development. These posts will include a strengthening of the educational remit of the museum.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised the issue of the terms of office of members.  Once a member has served two consecutive terms he or she cannot be appointed for a third term.  However, they may be reappointed at a later stage having had a break in service.  With regard to the payment of fees to board members, it is standard practice in most State boards, although there is no obligation that a member receive such fees.  The Bill uses the term &ldquo;may&rdquo;; it is a matter for the board.  There is nothing to stop a member giving the fees back out of humility, dedication and commitment.</P>
    <P>Another side to the argument is the idea that only those who are wealthy and independent can serve.  That idea has a smack of &ldquo;landlordism&rdquo; and more than a whiff of the &ldquo;big house&rdquo; about it. Those who offer public service are not mercenary.  Perhaps there should be discretion in these matters and we can examine it.</P>

      <P>With regard to consulation with the Heritage Council, there has been a certain tension between local museums and the National Museum about the lending of parts of collections.  The requirement in the legislation for consultation with the Heritage Council, whose remit covers the development of heritage, is intended to ensure it will have an input in the development of policy.  When I put the Heritage Council on a statutory footing and gave it functions across a wide remit, including the consideration of the national interest, I was anxious that the policy of an institution could not frustrate the strategic policy of access of those interested in heritage in a more general sense.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry raised the question of the deposit of film material in the National Library.  The provisions in this sense were not previously designed to deal with the Irish Film Archives but to deal with the definition which, in the National Library context, was too narrow given developments in technology. The provision was included at the request of Trinity College to allow for greater synergy and co-operation between the National Library and Trinity College.  I will look at these elements again, although I think I have arrived at the best formulation.</P>
      <P>Material could be deposited with other bodies, such as the Irish Film Archives, but given the scarcity of resources it is my firm intention to avoid duplication of activity or overlap of collections policy between the various bodies active in this area.  The user wants to know who does what.  The bodies must be adequately staffed and we must target our resources where we can get the best practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be intolerable in a major cultural institution to have people working together in the same building and paid by the same body yet not knowing where their administrative accountability lies.  Such an arrangement might be appropriate to 19th century clerks where there might be discussion as to who was supposed to lift the ledger. <Col N="2164" /> However, one cannot run a cultural institution in that way.  Now that I have given these clarifications I hope the matter will be let rest, the distortions will cease and there will be a move towards best practice.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of the export of objects.  Although not in my original proposals, the decorative arts have been incorporated.  The figure of £35,000 referred was in the EU regulations. I will examine it between now and Committee Stage.  The difficulty is if the figure is reduced, significant objects could be sold for as little as £6,000 or £7,000, efficacy in control and management is lost and the register becomes something less than real.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill proposes to amend the Constitution through inserting a new Article 40.4.7., which will state:</P>
      <P>Provision may be made by law for the refusal of bail by a court to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Justice I have made clear my belief that changes need to be made to our bail regime to tilt the balance in favour of the victims of crime and the protection of the community <Col N="2165" /> generally.  If the amendment is passed by the people, as I believe it will be, it will do just that.</P>
    <P>No Government lightly brings forward a proposal to amend the Constitution but it is the strongly held view of this Government that, in the public interest, changes need to be made to our bail laws and that the effective way of making those changes requires an amendment to the Constitution.  While conventional wisdom suggests that the amendment which we are now proposing has the support of a large majority of the people, I would nevertheless appeal to people to follow the public debate which will continue over the next few weeks as to whether this fundamental change should be made to their Constitution.</P>
    <P>The amendment which is being proposed is relatively straightforward. There are no great complexities of law involved nor sophisticated technicalities at issue.  What people are being asked is whether they agree with the idea that it should be possible to introduce laws which would allow a court to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence if it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware the amendment arises against the background of the Supreme Court decision in the O'Callaghan case in 1965.  Following that decision bail can be refused by our courts on two grounds only, the likelihood that an accused will not turn up for trial or will interfere with witnesses or evidence.  This means that it is not open to our courts at present, when considering a bail application, to take into account the question of a person committing serious offences if released on bail even where, for example, the accused has a long track record of being involved in serious crime while on bail on previous occasions.  If people believe that is wrong, then the only way to change it is by amending the Constitution along the lines proposed.</P>
    <P>Since the amendment was published groups which are opposed to it have put <Col N="2166" /> forward a number of criticisms and I believe it is important that I should address these issues head on in the course of my contribution.  First, it is argued that changes can be made to our existing law which would deal with the problem of offending on bail without the need for an amendment of the Constitution. The Government accepts that some worthwhile reforms of our bail laws can be made without an amendment to the Constitution and I am preparing legislation to this end.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the legislation is to make changes in three areas.  At present bail is often granted on the promise by someone to pay money if the accused fails to turn up for trial -at that stage no money changes hands.  The new legislation will provide that, generally, some cash or equivalent of cash must be put up as part of bail.  The proposed legislation will also allow a condition to be attached to bail that an accused is of good behaviour and bail money can be forfeited if an offence is committed while on bail.</P>
    <P>Further, the legislation will strengthen the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, relating to the imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed on bail to ensure that, as far as possible, an offender is always worse off in terms of penalty where an offence is committed on bail. However, while these changes are worthwhile they cannot ensure that offences will not be committed on bail. They do not, and cannot, address the central issue: should a court be allowed in certain circumstances to take into account the question of someone committing a serious offence if granted bail?</P>
    <P>Another suggestion has been made that providing for speedier trials would do away with the need for the bail referendum. A wide range of measures have been taken to ensure speedier trials. These include the appointment of additional judges, extended sittings in the courts, and, perhaps most fundamentally, the establishment of the Working Group on the Courts Commission which is involved in a radical <Col N="2167" /> overhaul of the operation of the courts. I should mention also that last week I announced the establishment of an advisory group on criminal law and procedure which will also have a useful role to play in this regard.</P>
    <P>However, the reality is that despite all the improvements which are being brought about there will always be some lapse of time between a person being charged with an offence and the trial taking place &mdash; not least so as to give the accused an opportunity to prepare a defence.  Again, the provision of speedier trials does not, and cannot, address the central issue: should a court be allowed in certain circumstances to take into account the question of someone committing a serious offence if granted bail.  It is worth putting on record the fact that traditionally the courts give priority to hearing cases where the accused has been remanded in custody. Recently I spoke with the President of the District Court about this issue.  He again assured me that the courts are giving priority to cases where the accused has been remanded in custody.</P>
    <P>Opponents of the amendment have also suggested that our prisons will not be able to cope with the extra numbers of prisoners who will have to be accommodated on remand.  This seems to me to overlook entirely that the changes we propose in our bail laws are being brought forward against a background of a major programme of prison building which will involve the provision of about 800 extra places, an unprecedented increase of about one-third on our existing accommodation.</P>
    <P>It would be fair to describe the criticisms I have mentioned as being to some extent tactical in nature rather than going to the heart of the issue. Opponents of the amendment believe that, as a matter of principle, it is wrong to deprive someone of their liberty without that person having been convicted. It legitimate to argue in favour of that principle but the question which arises is whether, given the modern realities of crime, we can afford to make that principle <Col N="2168" /> absolute or should it be modified in the interest of providing an appropriate balance in our law?</P>
    <P>Treating the principle as an absolute means that there would be no circumstances in which a person is deprived of his or her liberty on remand, no matter how strong the evidence that an offence will be committed by that person if granted bail.  In fact, under the law as it stands at present the courts are allowed to detain a person in custody pending trial on the basis of taking a view of the accused's likely behaviour if released. This arises where a court has to take a view as to whether the current grounds for refusing bail apply &mdash; the likelihood that an accused will fail to turn up for trial or interfere with witnesses or evidence. So the concept of taking a view as to someone's future behaviour in deciding whether bail should be granted is not, despite what some opponents say, entirely new.  What is at issue in the amendment is whether the question of offending if granted bail should also be a matter which can be taken into account by the court.  There are two current reasons that can be considered for refusing bail.  The amendment, if passed, will add a further ground for consideration.</P>
    <P>It is argued that the proposed amendment flies in the face of the presumption of innocence but it is worth making the point that the fact that bail has been refused has no relevance to the trial of an offence where the full presumption of innocence continues to apply.  The reality is that our bail laws are regarded as very liberal compared to those which apply in other jurisdictions.  In its report on the law on bail, the Law Reform Commission examined the position in many other jurisdictions and found that all allowed the question of offending on bail to be taken into account by the courts in deciding whether to refuse bail.  It is not a sustainable proposition to argue that our crime problems are so uniquely different to those in other jurisdictions that we need not arm ourselves with provisions in our law to <Col N="2169" /> prevent offending while on bail which are readily available in other countries.</P>
    <P>Obviously a balance has to be struck in relation to our bail laws between the rights of the accused and the rights of the community.  The present proposals represent a measured way of retilting the present balance in favour of the victims and potential victims of crime and the community generally while building in necessary safeguards.  What is at issue in passing this legislation is to allow the people to express a view in the light of their knowledge of the modern realities of crime, and, unfortunately in too many cases their experience of those realities, and to decide whether we, as a society, can afford to have the liberal bail laws which we have at present.  What is simply at issue is giving the people an opportunity of having their say as to how one particular aspect of our crime problem should be tackled.</P>
    <P>Much consideration went into the task of devising a suitable amendment to the Constitution.  On the one hand we did not want to bring about a situation where people would be refused bail for relatively trivial offences.  On the other hand we wanted to produce a wording that would make a genuine difference in practice in relation to the bail regime where serious offences were at issue. We finally settled on a proposed wording which we believe strikes this balance and has two practical advantages.  First, it is relatively straightforward and will be easily understood.  Second, and in the longer term, it has the advantage that it is based on the relevant part of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Article 5(1) of the convention allows for the deprivation of liberty &ldquo;... . when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent a person committing an offence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Government has made available an outline of the main provisions of bail legislation which it would propose to introduce should the Constitution be amended.  The Government believes that these proposals should help inform public debate on the proposed amendment <Col N="2170" /> of the Constitution.  The outline legislation sets out the serious offences to which the new bail regime would apply and the criteria to which the courts would have regard in considering whether the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.</P>
    <P>A dual approach is taken to specifying the offences to which the new bail regime can apply.  First, a &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; is defined as an offence carrying a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment or more.  Second, a Schedule is included setting out the wide range of offences covered by the legislation.  This approach means that, while all offences to which the legislation will apply must carry a maximum penalty of five years or more, not all such offences will be covered by the legislation &mdash; primarily on the grounds that some of the offences in our current law carrying such a penalty are archaic or unlikely to be ones where the questtion of reoffending is relevant.  It is not, therefore, automatically an offence that carries a maximum penalty of five years that would be included in this; they would also have to be included in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>Refusal of bail will not apply automatically in respect of any specific offence or category of offence.  I want this to be clear to those, especially those outside the House, who are concerned that everybody is going to be refused bail as a result of this amendment to the Constitution being passed.  It is not going to be refused automatically.</P>
    <P>Refusal of bail in relation to any specific offence is a matter for the courts to decide in the light of the criteria set out in the legislation.  The outline legislation sets out seven matters to be taken into account by the courts, where appropriate, in deciding whether it is reasonably considered necessary to refuse bail to prevent the commission of a serious offence.  These include first, the nature and degree of seriousness of the offence in respect of which the accused person <Col N="2171" /> is charged and the potential penalty; second, the nature and degree of seriousness of the offence apprehended and the potential penalty; third, the conviction of the accused person in respect of an offence committed while on bail on a previous occasion; fourth, any previous conviction of the accused person including a conviction under appeal; fifth, any other offence in respect of which the accused person is charged and is awaiting trial; sixth, the nature and strength of the evidence in support of the charge and, seventh, whether the accused has a substance addiction.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the outline legislation provides that in determining whether refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence it shall not be necessary that the commission of a specific offence is apprehended.  To have to prove that a specific offence would be at issue if bail were to be granted would be likely in practice to impose a standard of proof which could rarely, if ever, be met.  The specific provision which I have mentioned will ensure that the new bail regime will be workable and effective.</P>
    <P>Since the outline legislation was made available some public comment has focused on the reference it contains to an accused having a substance addiction. It has been suggested that the fact that someone has a substance addiction would in itself represent a ground for the refusal of bail.  I am glad to have this opportunity to make it clear that those concerns are misplaced and are not based on a full reading of the proposals in the outline legislation.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed constitutional amendment one test applies to bail being refused and that is if the refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence.  That test is repeated in the outline legislation which also sets out the criteria to which the courts should have regard in applying the test.  One of the criteria relates to an accused having a substance addiction.  However, the question <Col N="2172" /> is only relevant in the context of deciding whether refusal of bail is necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence and it must be considered against the background of the other criteria which relate mainly to an accused's criminal record.  There is no question, therefore, of a person with a substance addiction, who does not represent a threat to the community, being refused bail on the grounds of substance addiction alone.  I am glad to have this opportunity to explain this point fully because people may have misunderstood it.</P>
    <P>The outline legislation provides for a review of bail applications if the trial has not commenced within four months of the initial refusal of a bail application. While the granting of bail would not be automatic in such circumstances, the court is to have regard to any undue delay on the part of the prosecution in bringing the case to trial and to order the release on bail of the accused if satisfied that the interests of justice require it.  This point has not been fully understood by people who oppose the Bill and who say that people may spend 18 months or two years in jail.  In other jurisdictions with similar regimes, people spend such lengths of time in prison. However, the Government has included a safeguard that, if hearings have not commenced after four months, cases will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The issue of bail has been discussed in the House on numerous occasions in recent years.  Some Members have expressed frustration at what they regard as delays in dealing with changes in our bail laws.  However, all Governments over the past 30 years have grappled with this issue, but this is the first one which has succeeded in grasping the nettle and bringing forward comprehensive, considered and practical proposals which should deal with the issue once and for all.  Oppositions brought forward proposals but they did not implement them while they were in Government.</P>
    <P>I am sure it will be possible for all sides to put aside political differences <Col N="2173" /> and not detract from the message which most Members wish to go from the House that this is a necessary change to the Constitution which will help in the fight against crime.  If some Senators are reluctant to support the proposed amendment, I remind them that the only issue which arises in passing this Bill is allowing the people to have their say on whether the proposed amendment should be enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Government is anxious that the public debate on this issue should be as fully informed as possible.  In this context I am sure Members of the House welcome the decision to establish an <i>ad hoc</i> commission for the purpose of supervising the production and publication of an information statement setting out concisely the case for and against the proposed constitutional amendment.  The Ombudsman, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad will be the distinguished members of the commission.</P>
    <P>Amending our bail laws is not a panacea for dealing with all our crime problems. However, the referendum provides a practical opportunity for people who are understandably concerned about crime to use their democratic franchise to make a difference for the better to the quality of life in our society.  I commend the Bill, ultimately to the people, but, for now, to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the Fianna Fáil Party's position on the proposed amendment.  We support the Bill because it has been a long standing contention of the party that the bail laws need reform.  These laws have been frozen in a time warp since 1966; the O'Callaghan case was heard in 1965 but its correct citation is 1966.</P>
      <P>I wish to quote the judgment in the Supreme Court of the then Chief Justice, Cearbhaill Ó Dalaigh, at paragraph 1.26 of the Law Reform Commission's report.  He rejected the likelihood of committing further offences as a reason for refusing bail when he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2174" /> This is a form of preventative justice which has no place in our legal system and is quite alien to the true purposes of bail....  In this country it would be quite contrary to the concept of personal liberty enshrined in the Constitution that any person should be punished in respect of any matter upon which he has not been convicted or that in any circumstances he should be deprived of his liberty upon only the belief that he will commit offences if left at liberty, save in the most extraordinary circumstances carefully spelled out by the Oireachtas and then only to secure the preservation of public peace and order or the public safety and the preservation of the State in a time of national emergency or in some situation akin to that.</P>
    <P>The then Chief Justice reiterated the primacy of the right to liberty as enshrined in Article 40 of the Constitution. Members do not have any argument with that primacy, but times have changed and the public perceives that it is under threat from the menace of crime.  People are afraid and vulnerable. Changes to the bail laws are long overdue. If somebody made a bail application and said: &ldquo;I will turn up for my trial and I will not interfere with witnesses but, if you let me out this afternoon I may be on the job tonight&rdquo;; it would not be a good reason to refuse bail.  That offends against common sense and in the view of the people it offends the common good.</P>
    <P>As a general principle, the Fianna Fáil Party unequivocally supports the Bill.  Unfortunately, the Minister cannot take credit for this great innovation and act of courage upon which she feels the Government has embarked by proposing to introduce a bail referendum.</P>

      <P>On the issue of bail reform the Government is guilty of gross delay which amounts to negligence. On 25 January 1994, the then <Col N="2175" /> Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, referred the matter of bail to the Law Reform Commission via the Attorney General, which is the correct channel.  On 17 August 1995, this report was submitted to the Attorney General and also, presumably, to the Government. What did the Government do in the remainder of 1995?  What did it do for the first half of 1996 in relation to bail reform?  It did nothing.  The Minister conceded earlier there was no legal complexity to cause a delay.  She said there are no great complexities of law involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read the entire paragraph so that the Minister can be sure she is not being misinterpreted:</P>
      <P>The amendment which is being proposed is relatively straightforward. There are no great complexities of law involved nor sophisticated technicalities at issue.  What people are being asked is whether they agree with the idea that it should be possible to introduce laws which would allow a court to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence if it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has admitted that this was a relatively straightforward amendment. Unfortunately, as both she and I know, and as the people of Ireland know, this Government was in a deep sleep of complacency when it came to the law and order question until the terrible murder of Veronica Guerin on 26 June 1996.  Lo and behold, six days later on 2 July 1996, there was a press release and an announcement that a bail referendum was to be held.  Why was that announcement not made a few weeks <Col N="2176" /> after the Law Reform Commission report landed on the Minister's desk on 17 August 1995?  Why did the Minister sit through one of the worst crime waves in the history of this State without bothering to bring forward what she has called a straightforward and non-complex matter?  Could she explain why she took it upon herself to defeat Deputy John O'Donoghue's Private Members' Bill bringing forward such an amendment? That Bill was defeated on 4 October 1995.  How many victims of crime could we have saved from bail related crime if the Minister had moved with more alacrity?  It is embarrassing for the Minister, but as Deputy O'Donoghue pointed out in the Dáil, her rationale for going against his Bill was flawed.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Not alone has Deputy O'Donoghue brought forward his amendment at the wrong time [whatever that means, certainly too early] but he is putting it in the wrong place.</P>
    <P>The Minister argued in the Dáil, and I am sure she will contradict me if I am wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then she accepts what I am saying is correct.  She argued that Article 38 of the Constitution should be changed.  Having criticised Deputy O'Donoghue and saying that Article 38 should be amended, what does she do? She amends Article 40 of the Constitution which was the Article Deputy O'Donoghue proposed she amend. Therefore, the Minister's speech to the Dáil rejecting his Bill was flawed.  The facts speak for themselves and, if the Minister is big enough to accept that and say that her reasoning was flawed, she would be doing honour to both Houses.</P>
      <P>The second reason this Bill has been delayed is that the Minister's colleague in Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Deputy Quinn did not provide enough prison places to effect the change in the bail laws.  On 9 October 1996, speaking on the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, the Minister for Finance said:</P>
      <P>I am the person who proposed postponing Castlerea prison because, at the time [I presume we are referring to February 1995] the programme for its construction would not have created extra prison places until 1998.</P>

      <P>My apologies.  This Government is guilty of gross negligence and delay with regard to its handling of the bail issue.  In January 1994 the Minister for Justice submitted this matter to the Law Reform Commission and its report has been available to this Government since 17 August 1995. Through the remainder of 1995 and during the first half of 1996 this Government <Col N="2178" /> sat on the report and did nothing. By the time the necessary bail legislation has passed &mdash; presuming the referendum is passed &mdash; we may well be in 1997 before we have new bail laws. Because of this the Government should apologise to all the victims of bail related crime between the date they voted down Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill and when we have new bail legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the Bill.  For many years I have called for a change in the bail laws.  The present situation is ludicrous where criminals are released onto the streets to reoffend on the same day as charged and the courts are not in a position to deny bail. We have debated this issue on many occasions over the past seven years.  I remember raising this issue as far back as 1989 when we outlined the difficulties which were arising in the area of bail, especially in Dublin, and the fact that drug offenders were released on the same day as arrested to commit further offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can recall in the four years before this Government came into office there were three attempts by a Fine Gael spokesperson to introduce a Bill to amend the bail laws.  Deputy Barrett introduced a Bill which was voted down <Col N="2179" /> by a Fianna Fáil led Government. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe introduced a Bill in 1992-93 which was voted down by the Government.  In 1994 Deputy Gay Mitchell introduced a Bill which the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, said in the Dáil she would refer to the Law Reform Commission. That was the response after four years of campaigning by Fine Gael to have something done on the bail issue.  She did send it to the Law Reform Commission but she did not ask for recommendations because that was only a ploy after four years of campaigning by Fine Gael.  After 22 months in office, this Minister has brought a Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the criticism levelled at the Minister by the previous speaker. This Minister will go down in history as one of those who tackled the law and order issue in a very professional way. We are already seeing the fruits of the work she did before the summer recess in the law and order area in the many arrests in Dublin and the attempt by certain serious criminals to flee the country because of changed circumstances. We should take this opportunity to congratulate the Garda and the new Garda Commissioner on their work in using the laws introduced by this Minister which will reduce professional crime &mdash; unfortunately, we can never eliminate it &mdash; and drug trafficking which has been a cancer on this society, not just in the past 22 months but in the past ten years at least.</P>
    <P>There is a growing confidence and belief, which did not exist until quite recently, that this problem can be tackled.  Before the changes in the law were introduced people felt that drug trafficking and the escalation in professional crime could not be halted.  We now see it being reduced and we should compliment all those involved.  Some of Senator Mulcahy's party colleagues have recognised the improvements which have taken place over the past six months in the area of crime and it would be gracious of him to do likewise.  It is <Col N="2180" /> to be hoped that, with the continuing introduction of changes, such as those in this Bill, the application of more resources, the 800 prison places which will come on stream and more efficiency in the courts, the criminal fraternity will see the writing on the wall and there will be an increase in the level of convictions, serving of longer sentences and more control of criminal activity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes proposed by the Minister in regard to deposits for bail.  I was amazed to learn that little money is ever forfeited by people who secure bail for others.  I assumed that if somebody deposited £10,000 or £20,000 as security for a person to be released who then did not turn up for trial, the money was forfeited.  It is a welcome change that cash or its equivalent will have to be put up front by those securing the bail of others and if a person commits an offence while on bail the security can be confiscated by the State. That will be a significant, although not the most important, motivation for someone not to commit a crime while on bail.  We welcome the recent appointment of additional judges and the extension of court sittings.  We look forward to an early report from the working group on the courts.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the issue of bail I have always raised the question of the right to silence.  It is difficult to understand how professional criminals can use the loopholes in the law to avoid giving a reasonable account of their whereabouts or activities.  Anybody who is innocent or has nothing to hide has no difficulty accounting for their actions.  Professional criminals and subversives are very apt at not answering questions by staring at a point on a wall for indefinite periods.  Nobody is saying that anybody should be convicted on the basis that they remained silent, but there is a precedent for the courts taking inferences from it.  If one refuses to give a blood sample when charged with drunken driving, the court may take an inference from that when considering the case.  The Revenue Commissioners also take inferences from a failure to <Col N="2181" /> provide proper information.  It should be handled delicately but it should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>We have discussed this at length over the years and the issues are well known. We hope the Bill will have a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  We had a debate on this and related matters in the House some time ago and the Minister indicated her position at that stage.  She has been very consistent since her appointment in her commitment to this issue.</P>
      <P>There will be a general welcome for this Bill, although it raises concerns for many people in regard to the issue of civil liberties.  Over the last number of years, in order to protect society it has become necessary to restrict it; the common good is determining tighter parameters and constraints on normal civil liberties.  That is a reflection on a changing world and is not to be welcomed.  On the other hand, people have spoken very loudly on this issue.  There has been a strong reaction to the wave of crime, the stories of godfathers and the criminal activities of nicknamed figures who have become well known through the media.  These people are giving the impression they have taken over the streets of the city and seem to have taken control of people's lives.  They are in charge of the supply of and demand for drugs, and this House has debated the difficulties which that creates.</P>
      <P>It is a worrying problem and a poor reflection on society that the vast majority of the prison population should come from easily recognised, definable areas of high disadvantage.  This correlation between areas of higher disadvantage and high prison population is and must be a matter of huge concern. Whereas I recognise that law and order is a huge item on the political agenda, that there is great public demand for it and that the argument &ldquo;the harder you hit them the better&rdquo; finds a great resonance in the pubs, clubs and lounge bars, we have to take a clearer and broader line on it than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2182" /> On the question of bail, I have been reading with interest the Irish and English versions of the proposal.  Bhí mé ag féachaint go speisíalta ar an áit a chuir an tAire an focal &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; and I found the syntax of it odd in English.  Ag féachaint ar an leagan Gaeilge, feicim go bhfuil sé mar an gcéanna agus go bhfuil an rud céanna á rá sa dá leagan, sé sin &ldquo;sa chás go measfar le réasún é a bheith riachtanach&rdquo;.  The English version uses the form &ldquo;where it is reasonably considered necessary&rdquo;.  I take it the Minister means not that it is something which might be considered to be reasonably necessary but something which would be considered to be necessary after reasonable consideration.  It is a fine distinction which has not come across in the debates to date, or at least if it did I missed the subtlety of it until now.</P>
    <P>I agree with the distinction the Minister has made.  It is important that it would be necessary to refuse bail and, therefore, whether it is necessary that it be decided after reasonable consideration, or as it says sa leagan Gaeilge, &ldquo;sa chás go measfar le réasún é a bheith riachtanach&rdquo;.  Caithfear an rud a bheith riachtanach.  Muna bhfuil sé riachtanach ní chóir go dtógfar an chéim sin in aon chor, ach i gcás go bhfuil sé riachtanach agus go measfar le reasún é a bheith riachtanach, it is a very fair course of action to take.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that in her response.  I agree with it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the outline of the proposed legislation, it is very difficult to write a speech such as this because the speech itself will be half a page and the Minister will then describe the legislation she plans to bring forward.  Everybody will agree with the requirement in the planned legislation that cash or its equivalent would generally be required to be lodged in court.  I cannot imagine any reasonable person objecting to that.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that in the new legislation conditions will also be attached to bail, that the accused must be of good behaviour and that bail money can be forfeited if an offence is committed <Col N="2183" /> while the accused is on bail.  That is an interesting concept.  I presume the Minister is suggesting that, in the event of a person being found guilty of an offence committed on bail, the bail money can be forfeited.  I would be interested to see how the legislation provides for that.  I applaud the intent but I am not sure how the Minister will make it work.  This will be an argument for another day and I look forward to it.</P>
    <P>I confess some disappointment at the third proposal.  We raised this issue the last time we discussed this issue.  The Minister proposes that the new legislation will strengthen the provisions of the 1994 legislation relating to the imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail to ensure as far as possible that an offender is always worse off in terms of penalty where an offence is committed on bail.  Perhaps I misunderstand it, but I do not think what the Minister says here is logical.  She wishes to ensure as far as possible that an offender is always worse off in terms of penalty where an offence is committed on bail.  I will take a simple example.  A person is accused of a crime and is granted bail.  While on bail he or she commits another offence and is charged with it.  He or she is found innocent of the first offence but guilty of the second.  That person will not be any worse off for having committed an offence while on bail.  There is an issue here and I hope I can progress this argument logically.</P>

I am only making the point that the fact the second offence was committed while on bail becomes irrelevant if the person is not found guilty of the first offence.  Consecutive sentences can only be imposed where there is more than one conviction.  I raise that because the last time we discussed it I put forward the proposal &mdash; I also put it forward privately in discussions <Col N="2184" /> with the Minister &mdash; that the only way to deal with that issue is to ensure that any fine or prison sentence imposed for crimes committed while on bail should carry a 50 per cent increase or be doubled.</P>
      <P>Enabling legislation would be needed to implement this.  It would mean that any time a person was convicted of an offence committed while on bail, they would be worse off.  I know that is simplistic; it has to be at the level at which we are talking here because the legislation has not been drafted.</P>
      <P>I also recognise that under the 1984 Act &mdash; I stand to be corrected on this &mdash; judges have the power to make the penalty more severe when a crime has been committed while on bail but, as the Minister says, they will not do it.  That is why &mdash; I never thought I would hear myself say this &mdash; the arrangements made in this regard must be mandatory. I am against mandatory sentences and have always opposed them because judges should be required to think and to make a judgment and judgment does not sit well with mandation.  Judges should be good at their jobs, they should come to a decision, form a judgment and impose a penalty.  The exercise of these functions always has to be subjective and judgmental.  I do not like mandatory sentences for that reason but there should be some mandatory aspect to the imposition of penalties for crimes committed on bail.</P>
      <P>If I take the Minister's last sentence in that particular section, which reads &ldquo;to ensure as far as possible that an offender is always worse off in terms of a penalty where an offence has been committed on bail&rdquo;, we could get rid of the words &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo; and make it mandatory.  There would be wide acceptance of this and I think civil liberties people would agree with it because it does not take from any of the protections in law for civil and personal liberty and for the requirement to be proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt. All those things would still stand and I would go along with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2185" /> The Minister might consider another provision.  Perhaps she has already considered it, although it might annoy some people.  People would welcome the idea that, following a conviction and before sentence is imposed, a person's previous record for sentencing would be made available to the judge.  I do not know if this is done in some cases.  I am not sure where the law stands on this, but it is fair in any code of discipline that penalties would increase in severity where an offence is committed more than once and that a judge would be entitled to take the person's previous history in those areas into consideration.  I am not sure of the extent to which that can be done at the moment.  It is important to go back to fundamental principles.  The law is there to protect the common good and the common good is best protected by the judge imposing a sentence in the knowledge of how the common good has been threatened and has suffered because of this person.  I would like to hear a detailed response to that.</P>
    <P>I accept and support the idea that where bail is being granted, money has to be put up front.  I also support the idea, though I find it difficult to visualise legislation for it, that if an accused person is found guilty of an offence while on bail, some of the bail money should be forfeited.  I am not sure how those crimes can be linked.  On the issue of imposing a penalty on a person who commits an offence while on bail a mandatory arrangement should exist which would require a higher sentencing level.  In all legislation which carries maximum and minimum fines, the fines should be increased by 50 per cent or whatever factor is agreed.  This could only be done through enabling legislation. I am not suggesting that all relevant Statutes of the last 400 years should be checked and changed.</P>
    <P>The fourth issue is that a person's previous convictions should be known prior to sentencing.  This is as relevant as many other things that are considered prior to sentencing.  The basic principle of the law is to protect people from <Col N="2186" /> those who will hurt the common good or hurt an individual.  Therefore, in punishing somebody who has done so, it is reasonable that a judge would be able to query a person's previous criminal record.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the supply of drugs and the correlation of disadvantaged areas with the prison population.  The only way to tackle with the drugs issue is to deal with demand rather than supply. Drugs, like any other business or industry, works on the basis of supply and demand.  People want them and will commit crime to get them; people will do whatever is necessary to supply them.</P>
    <P>There are a number of ways we can deal with crime.  One is &mdash; and I am not proposing this but it is important in the context of this argument &mdash; if drugs were decriminalised and made freely available it would no longer be necessary for people to kill in order to get them.  There are people who put forward this proposal but I do not support it.  The Minister should have a serious look at decriminalising heroin, for instance, and making it a controlled substance. I looked at experiments in the UK, including one in the Wirral near Liverpool, where heroin was used instead of methadone.  It was supplied by doctors on prescription using proper, tight arrangements and it was found that people lived a reasonably normal life. Two or three worked as civil servants and the rest had ordinary jobs, but they needed a daily heroin fix to behave normally. That appeared to work.  When people see drug addicts on television they realise it is like the picture they had of alcoholism years ago when it was associated with people lying in the gutter. Today people know that an alcoholic can hold down a job and look reasonably normal for long periods of the day.  Junkies are similar.  They do not look different to a person who does not recognise the signs.  In that experiment heroin was decriminalised by making it a controlled substance.  We should do more work to see if it can be dealt with that way.  I am not suggesting <Col N="2187" /> that it will because I do not know enough about it but I want to have it looked at.</P>
    <P>The importance of training young people to say no to any type of drug is a difficult job.  This is an area which needs to be advanced.  I said time and again, speaking on behalf of teachers, that no matter how difficult it is to take on additional responsibility in schools, I feel that, as teachers, we have a professional responsibility to protect our young people from the scourge of drugs misuse and from becoming victims of exploitation by unscrupulous drug dealers.  I do not invite a hang them and flog them response from anybody in the House but even at primary school level we have seen situations where drugs are freely available.  There is a problem here and training children to say no is difficult in the current drugs culture.  It exists even in terms of the amount of alcohol that is consumed in Ireland.  It is part of what we do and what we are.  There is nothing wrong with it but a great deal of input is required to explain to children the social nature of drinking as opposed to having it control lives.  It is important to invest in this area at education level because it does reap results, however small.</P>
    <P>Most of the prison population comes from clearly defined areas.  If it is the case that these highly disadvantaged areas are where most of the prison population comes from, we should invest in those areas to try and protect them.  Speaking here seven years ago, I made the point that we were fast approaching the time when somebody would propose putting walls around some of the disadvantaged areas; it would be cheaper than building prisons because many of these people were on their way to prison anyway.  They were in a vicious cycle of deprivation.  They were born into disadvantaged homes and reared in overcrowded substandard houses in areas where poverty and unemployment were endemic.  There was no respect for law and order and no trust in the education system.  We failed <Col N="2188" /> them in many ways and they simply got into a life of crime and eventually finished up unemployed or in prison. Instead of dealing with why we need more prison places, the reduction of the prison population should be dealt with at an earlier stage by taking action to stop the demand for prison places and for drugs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and the proposal to amend the Constitution.  Like many people I too have reservations about the area of civil liberties.  I have to live with those restrictions but I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation. The people are being asked whether they agree that it should be possible to introduce laws which allow a court to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence if it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  I always favour a referendum because it allows people to exercise a democratic mandate on issues that they often feel are beyond them and are decided by the powers that be in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I commiserate with the Minister who came into office at an unfortunate time. Crime had been increasing for a number of years and it erupted during her ministry which made life difficult for her.  As a result this Government has put forward a comprehensive package of measures to tackle crime.  All too often we deal with one aspect of crime and forget about the rest.  Looking back over legislation, including that introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, to confiscate the assets of those involved in the drug scene, the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act and the Courts and Court Officers Act, it is clear we have been busy over the past few years bringing forward legislation to tackle crime and the related problems.  I congratulate the Minister in this regard and on the provision of more judges, extra prison places and the Courts Commission. Each of these measures are necessary in tackling crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2189" /> We should be slow to amend the Constitution as far as the deprivation of liberty is concerned.  However, we live in a world where many believe the system defends and protects the perpetrator of crime more than the victim. That is the perceived reality and it is a matter which must be tackled.  Too many people have stories to tell about being robbed on numerous occasions. When my brother's flat was broken into recently it brought home to me that nobody is safe in their home.  People in rural areas are frightened to answer the door.  We cannot accept or tolerate such a situation.</P>
    <P>The bail referendum will not be the solution to all our problems.  According to a Garda report, 5,500 crimes were committed by people on bail in 1995; a small proportion of the total number of crimes.  The proposed amendment will be only a small part of the solution.  We must understand and accept that.  I believe the expectation of what the bail referendum will deliver far exceeds what it will achieve.  The ultimate aim of the criminal justice system is to put convicted criminals behind bars and to deal justice to those who did not do so to others.  It should not be to use the bail laws to take people off the streets and not worry about what happens to them. The system must remember that our primary concern must be directed at convictions and not only detentions.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, we must deal with the reality that the interpretation of 1965 O'Callaghan case has been restrictive in terms of what the Judiciary can do.  If read carefully the O'Callaghan judgment provides for more than just two grounds for refusing bail.  However, it is taken as read that the case allows bail only on two valid grounds &mdash; the danger of somebody absconding or interfering with witnesses.  In terms of its subsequent interpretation it has tied the hands of many judges who felt there was a danger a person would commit further crimes.  In a system which did not penalise a person whether they committed a crime, it mitigated against what a judge could do in terms of justice.  It <Col N="2190" /> is on that basis I favour the extension of the discretion of the judge.  I am happy to rely on the discretion of judges who have served us well in the past and I trust they will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>If an accused person has a history of convictions or has committed an offence while on bail, they should not be given bail and the judge must be given discretion in such circumstances.  How far we go beyond that warrants further consideration. The proposed amendment to the Constitution allows us to define the right to liberty in accordance with our law.  However, we should avoid a knee-jerk reaction.  I hope we will be able to stand over the legislation ultimately brought before the House and that it will stand the test of time.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for us to accept that we have legislation in place which, for one reason or another, is not being used as it should and as it was intended.  Previous speakers referred to the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which allows for consecutive sentencing.  Judges have failed to use their powers under that legislation to impose consecutive sentences.  This week there were convictions for the use of angel dust.  Four concurrent sentences were given for four different offences for which someone had been convicted.  I fail to comprehend why that is the case.  Each offence warrants an individual sentence.  The construction given by the Judiciary that it would consider the ultimate sentence vis-a-vis the nature of the crime is not one which warrants absolute protection at a time when those awaiting trial feel they may as well be hung for a lamb as a sheep and commit further offences because they have nothing to lose.  Consecutive sentencing, as provided for in law, should be implemented.  It will be a sad day if we are forced to come back to the Legislature to amend the legislation and make it mandatory to impose consecutive sentences.  That is a matter about which I am concerned.</P>
    <P>The issue of suspended sentences has not been raised.  People often receive suspended sentences which are not reactivated if they commit a subsequent <Col N="2191" /> offence.  If a person has been let off lightly having been given a suspended sentence, there is no reason it should not be reactivated if they commit another offence.  It is essential to speed up trial dates.  Many of the concerns about detention while awaiting trial are based on the fact that we are depriving someone of their liberty, a fundamental right, pending trial.  Every effort has been made by the Minister to appoint more judges and to have longer sittings but procedural amendments could be made to the system, such as introducing pre trial motions more regularly.  This would deal with the issue of whether evidence is admissible at an earlier stage.  That would either force the accused into an admission of guilt and thus bring the matter to a head or let the prosecution realise it does not have a case.  There is no reason that should not become part of the system of legal procedure.  It would help speed up the progress of trials.</P>
    <P>I have a number of queries about the Bill outlined by the Minister.  I noted what Senator O'Toole said with regard to the interpretation of the words &ldquo;reasonably considered necessary&rdquo; and that the Minister confirmed the wording was taken largely from the European Convention on Human Rights.  I accept that, but UK legislation requires substantial grounds and legislation in Canada requires an unacceptable risk of offending while on bail.  I wonder which is the heavier onus of proof and which is the easier?  I certainly do not want a situation where it becomes the norm for a garda to give evidence that he has &ldquo;reason to believe...&rdquo; in objecting to an application for bail and that the matter would be a foregone conclusion. That requires more thought.  I accept the Minister's interpretation of &ldquo;reasonably considered necessary&rdquo;, that it must ultimately be considered necessary, but I hope that will be quite clear in the ultimate legislation and in how it is subsequently interpreted in the courts.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the time limit.  My reading of the outline for <Col N="2192" /> legislation is that there will be a review after four months of somebody being held prior to trial.  If there has been undue delay in the prosecution, it would be dealt with.  However, there is no maximum period for which a person can be detained prior to trial and, having read the report of the Law Reform Commission and studied the system in other countries, it seems most if not all countries provide for a maximum period of detention.  I admit the provisions vary but I feel strongly that when one is depriving a person of his or her liberty, it should be for the shortest period of time.  When we hope ultimately to have speedier trails, I do not see why we cannot introduce a maximum period because I can only hazard to guess what it would be like to sit in jail and not know when the case is to be heard &mdash; that could go on indefinitely.  On the basis of justice for all, we should consider a maximum period.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I am concerned that while the Bill provides for review after four months, it is not clear on the outcome of such a review or the resulting action.  I would ask the Minister to consider having a review for every subsequent month thereafter?  The legislation as presently outlined is not clear on that point.  It is not good enough to provide for one review after four months and then leave the matter in mid air.  I would welcome clarification on that point.</P>
    <P>In studying other countries' legislation, it seems that compensation should be available to some degree or in certain circumstances to those who are unfairly detained and subsequently found innocent and acquitted.  Other countries provide for this and, if I may be so bold as to refer to the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 5(5) of the convention also provides for compensation.  We cannot be selective in what we take from the convention when it suits us and not provide for redress where a person has been unfairly detained.  The issue of compensation needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2193" /> There are smaller points.  How are we to handle this when it comes before a judge?  Must those objecting to bail specify the reasons?  This is not clear to me and I would welcome the Minister's clarification on the matter.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the reasons for the judge's decision to refuse bail must be specified because justice dictates that a person deserves to know why he or she is being detained.</P>
    <P>The right of appeal already exists under the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  Will that right of appeal apply automatically with regard to the proposed legislation?  This is not clear from what I have read to date so I would appreciate the Minister's clarification on the matter.</P>
    <P>I presume there will be provision for a different judge at the trial to the one who dealt with the initial application for bail.  That would be very important. Whether the history of the person ultimately convicted should be brought into consideration in terms of sentencing, as suggested by Senator O'Toole, is also worthy of consideration but that is a different matter.  Everybody going to trial before a judge deserves to be considered innocent until proven guilty through criminal procedures and this should be clarified as the matter is going before the people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government is providing about 800 prison places and I know that the work on Castlerea Prison is almost, if not already, completed.  We must take note of the fact that remand prisoners are innocent in the eyes of the law until proven guilty and they have rights under international and European conventions. This is not provided for in Ireland as yet and we have discussed this before in the House.  If there is to be a separate remand prison, we must ensure we comply with the international and European regulations in that regard.  Sometimes I feel we are being asked to decide on the issue at a very preliminary stage when no remand prison is in place yet to ensure the system is adequate.  It would be important to address that issue when <Col N="2194" /> the matter is being put before the people because I do not like to see people voting in a vacuum, with a knee-jerk reaction or in the belief that this will be the panacea for all our problems. We need to be honest with the people. We must tell them of the current provisions and what we hope to provide. That is the best circumstance in which a decision can be made.</P>
    <P>I have outlined my concerns to the Minister.  It is important that we reach a balance between allowing judges the discretion they need in dealing with granting bail and the necessary procedural safeguards.  We do not want miscarriages of justice in Ireland.  Our system has been good to date and we should not go head over heels with rushed legislation or a knee-jerk reaction. We need to consider the wording of the legislation which will follow the referendum to make sure it will stand the test of time, be constitutional under various tests and provide justice for the victim and the accused.</P>
    <P>In that sense I hope this will be a job well done by this Government.  Until now, I felt we sometimes place too much emphasis on the need to reform the bail laws, but extreme circumstances necessitate extreme solutions.  Although I do not like to presume the outcome of the referendum, my concerns will be dealt with at a later stage and I am happy to let the matter go before the people.</P>
    <P>The time element was referred to earlier with regard to the delay on this matter, but when one considers the facts in dealing with the technical areas of liberty and the provisions of the Constitution in that regard, these matters must undergo proper drafting procedures.  I do not want to see this rushed as it is too important.  I want to see it right.</P>

      <P>A special unit should be established for drug abusers.  As a previous speaker stated, certain people are sent to a special unit in Dundrum when they are charged with a crime.  A similar unit should be established to cater for drug abusers; not drug barons who do not use drugs.  Unfortunate drug users should be given access to a treatment centre outside Mountjoy Prison.  The authorities are not able to keep drugs out of that prison.  Many people enter Mountjoy Prison clean and by the time of their release they have become drug addicts.  That must be corrected.  The only way to do so is to remove drug users from prisons containing criminals. These people need treatment and entitled to receive it.  Such treatment should be provided at a high security unit so that they cannot gain access to the streets.  Many judges have stated that there is no space available to house young offenders.  These individuals are the &ldquo;Bugsy Malones&rdquo; of today and they <Col N="2198" /> will be the &ldquo;Generals&rdquo; of the future. What is being done to change that situation? Nothing.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the residents of housing estates for their brave actions.  They should be given more support by the Government and the authorities.  There is no point in appointing one garda to serve as a community police officer on a housing estate.  There should be a small barracks in each housing estate with two to three resident gardaí.  There might be a cost involved but it would help to solve long-term problems in those areas. There would be co-operation and unity between the gardaí and the people who could get to know each other.  Until small barracks are placed in housing estates and problem areas, we will never resolve this situation.  Gardaí driving around areas in squad cars cannot solve problems and there is no point shouting at the green man.  There must be physical communication and people must have access to gardaí they know and trust.</P>
      <P>What is being done in our schools? There have been 25 years of free education, etc., and a conglomeration of organisations were established to help people in disadvantaged areas. However, such areas seem to be becoming increasingly disadvantaged.  It appears there are no controls regarding whether children are attending school. Why have more officers not been appointed to check that children are in attendance at school?  Why is the law not being enforced in this regard?  Every child is born good but the environment in which they grow up decides the course their lives will take.  If parents will not care for their children, a public school should be established in order that they can be educated and trained. If their parents are not prepared to take action, someone else should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fewer than 3 per cent of people living in housing estates cause trouble. However, a small boil on the back of one's neck can irritate the entire body. That percentage of disgruntled people can make life hell for everyone.  We should be strong enough to remove <Col N="2199" /> those elements and place them in an environment where they can be educated and trained.  They should not be prosecuted or persecuted; they should be shown that they can live decent, respectable lives and become part of the community in a successful and positive way.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as complete freedom, only controlled freedom. Everyone who obeys the law lives under a form of controlled freedom each day. However, those who violate the law do not understand that concept and do as they please.  One only has to watch Channel 4 and look at some of the American television programmes broadcast by Sky to see how the youth in such countries behave.  They inform their peers and parents that they live their lives as they please.  A 14 or 15 year old child has no right to make such a statement because we are subsidising them.  If their parents do not do so, it is society's responsibility to inform them that they must obey the rules.</P>
    <P>Recently I visited a certain area of the city.  There is a religious community there whose property is wrecked by youths riding horses through it, breaking down gates and smashing buildings. It is costing a fortune in security to keep it in order but it is a losing battle.  What is being done?  Those youngsters should not be allowed to wreck the lives of the members of a religious community who have given their lives to education and helping youth.</P>
    <P>Law and order has broken down and unless the Minister puts resources into this area society will become worse.  An old man living in County Wicklow was robbed recently and the thieves came back the following week.  On telling them he had nothing the old man was shot in the knee.  Such criminals go to court only to be given a small fine and to be told they need to see a psychiatrist or some such nonsense.  It is not acceptable that a poor man should be lying in hospital having been shot in the knee. An old woman in County Roscommon was locked in a room in her house and, <Col N="2200" /> in her desperation, she tried to get out of the window.  She broke her arm and is now in hospital in Roscommon.  Is that how senior citizens should be treated?  If the problem is that bad in rural areas we must expect it to be far worse in urban areas.  We must get to grips with it.</P>
    <P>Just like bullies in schools, criminals operate by making their victims afraid. It is time the law made the criminals afraid and stopped patting them on the back.  A case may go to court and be adjourned for a month to allow assessments to be carried out on the defendant, who is set free while these assessments are done.  These criminals have a good laugh at what they call the &ldquo;head shrinkers&rdquo;.  They are more alert than the experts who are assessing them.</P>
    <P>We must bring in severe laws to deal with the problem.  The 97 per cent of the population who live good lives cannot be disrupted and abused by a small group of highly organised and clever thugs.  I ran a garage for 15 years and I would not be able to hot wire a car as fast as some youngsters.  They are intelligent but their talents are not being channelled in the right way.  They grow up in an environment conducive to crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a tough job and she can rely on the support of Fianna Fáil in her efforts.  She must be firm and positive.  She must find the money to create prison places and end the revolving door system.  There is no point in putting young offenders who are drug addicts into Mountjoy Prison.  There should be a secure facility for them so they can have treatment.  If necessary, visits should be curtailed to prevent drugs being brought into prisons.  This is a serious problem which must be tackled.</P>
    <P>Unless we tackle the underlying problems no amount of laws will work. There are many areas of high disadvantage around the country.  I have always been against concrete jungles.  When I hear planning objections against building in the countryside on the basis that it would affect amenities or views, I <Col N="2201" /> think of the people in disadvantaged urban areas.  If they want to escape from that environment the people in rural areas should help them.  We must ensure a better dispersal of the population because we cannot allow the position to continue where one and a half million people live in Dublin while the west is denuded.</P>
    <P>The pressure on services in areas of high disadvantage should be relieved by moving them to areas of high advantage. If need be, small schools might reopened. What is the point in having low pupil teacher ratios if the pupils can do what they like in the playground?  If children are kept in neat environments in small areas where they can receive good training they will become proud of themselves.</P>
    <P>We must encourage our children.  The examination system is failure oriented, particularly the points system.  People who do not get a certain number of points should not be considered to have failed.  We must move away from the attitude of failure and engender a positive attitude.  It is almost impossible for teachers to educate children because they are almost afraid to look at a pupil lest they be charged with an offence.</P>
    <P>We must have controlled freedom. The hooligans must be taken off the streets whatever the cost.  The time for kid gloves is over because society must be straightened out.  We will not come to grips with the problem by putting all the criminals in one large jail or by having gardaí in squad cars.  Police stations should be erected in housing estates so that the gardaí can develop a relationship with the people.  In that way we will come to grips with crime and drugs.</P>
    <P>When Veronica Guerin was shot many people were named in the newspapers yet nothing was done.  I hope a monument is erected to her.  Her work has shaken every right thinking person. We are now coming to grips with this terrible situation which is making life a misery.  Victims are at last to be considered.</P>

      <P>The crime wave in rural areas declined at certain times and increased at others.  There is a question as to whether rural Garda stations that were closed under previous administrations should be reopened.  Many people committing robberies in rural areas are not from the area.  They have mobile phones and hijack or steal vehicles.  While local gardaí have knowledge of what is happening in their area, this aspect must be addressed. Resources are a problem but the Garda need equipment, such as mobile phones and transport and these must be made available to enable them to arrest these people.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, much Garda time is taken up investigating crime.  There should be a greater Garda presence on the street.  In the last 12 months Garda checkpoints were established making it more difficult for criminals to move around the country and watch the houses of vulnerable people they could burgle.  This made a significant difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures must be implemented in a short time.  It would not be necessary to do so had there been an ongoing programme over the years.  It is easy to say the crimewave started when this Minister came into office but people do not believe that as <Col N="2205" /> various opinion polls have proved. People are not stupid.  The Opposition can make contributions and put their spin on the issue.  People are employed full-time to do so for the media. However, people take important issues such as crime, violence and drugs seriously.  It is advisable for anyone in public life not to blame an individual Minister who is doing her utmost to deal with the matter.  One can only play the hand one is dealt and the Minister was dealt a difficult hand of cards.</P>

      <P>There were years of neglect when nothing was done.  The nearest we came to providing extra prison spaces was building a wall without a prison, which never happened before in the history of planning.  People asked politicians why criminals could not be put in Castlerea, because they were under the impression that the prison had been built.  Under this Minister part of that project has been completed and the main project will go ahead.  There will also be 70 new prison spaces in the Curragh this year.  This is constructive progress.  It is not an outstanding boast for a Government or its supporters to announce that it has built or is providing for a certain number of spaces, but it must be done because people are entitled to the right to live securely and safely in their houses &mdash; that is the issue.</P>
      <P>This referendum to change the bail laws will help but it is not the overall answer.  The Minister has treated this in a constructive manner by providing more spaces, gardaí and legislation.  The correct approach is to provide an overall package, not to deal with matters in isolation. I congratulate her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are here to discuss bail, the subject of the proposed sixteenth amendment to a Constitution written in 1937.  We must be careful about any changes we make to the Constitution and the matter deserves serious <Col N="2206" /> consideration.  We have reason to look favourably on this legislation.  Senator Farrell referred to Veronica Guerin, whose death drew the nation's attention to the need for action.  The Minister has been able to grasp this nettle because of the change of attitude on the part of the nation after this murder.</P>
      <P>I came to know Veronica Guerin in the weeks before her death.  The talk at her funeral was of her death being in vain, but I suggest it will not be if the successes seen in recent weeks are part of the progress made in the fight against crime.  That progress was difficult to achieve because the nation did not give the necessary tools to those who have an obligation to do that job.  In recent weeks the Garda Commissioner has given commitments and the Garda team can now be confident the nation is behind it in the fight against crime.  We are now giving the Garda, through this legislation, the ability to fight crime without one hand tied behind its back.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's speech, particularly her reference to preparing legislation for which constitutional change is not needed.  She said one of her objectives was to introduce a procedure whereby bail money could be forfeited if an offence is committed while on bail.  The bail area has been a contentious issue in our Constitution since the court case in the 1960s.  As the Minister said, a crime committed while on bail deserves a deterrent punishment and a procedure for forfeiting bail money should be introduced along with this measure.  I also welcome the Minister's announcement of additional court sittings, speedier trials and the appointment of a working group on the courts, but this is only part of the action that she &mdash; and we as legislators &mdash; need to take.  The right to silence is another restriction on those who are trying to enforce the law and I urge the Minister to consider that issue seriously also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have concerns about anything which suggests that a person may not be innocent until proven guilty.  This has been the difficulty with bail legislation. However, we have faced up to that in <Col N="2207" /> three other areas in recent years.  If a person does not disclose information on a tax return, the assumption built into our law is almost that he is guilty unless he proves himself innocent.  Under the drink driving laws, the refusal to give a blood test can lead to a presumption of guilt, although the person may be innocent. In recent months we passed laws on competition which require a person to prove his innocence.  We must be careful when taking these steps because we are interfering with a Constitution which has lasted us almost 60 years.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of changing the law on bail and for several years have argued for a constitutional amendment similar to that before us.  According to market research surveys, my attitude is shared by an overwhelming majority of the public.  I welcome that as an indicator of the likely outcome of the referendum. However, the balance of public opinion raises a concern.  I hope we see a detailed and calm public debate on the matter before the poll takes place.  The amendment should not be put through on the nod.</P>
    <P>Every time we amend the Constitution there is a price to be paid &mdash; we give up something and get something else in return.  Nowhere is this more true than in the present case.  In return for improving our ability to prevent serious crime, we are taking away part of the guaranteed framework of rights and freedoms of our citizens.  This is a most serious matter but I am in no doubt that this is a reasonable trade off.  The benefits will outweigh the costs, perhaps by a large margin.  It is also vital, however, that the electorate not only votes &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but does so in an informed fashion.  We should not take short cuts simply because 80 per cent of people appear to favour this change.  We should have as full and comprehensive a public debate on all issues involved as we would if opinion was finely balanced between the two sides.  In this context, it is good that public funding will be provided for both sides in a constitutional amendment referendum.  This is particularly <Col N="2208" /> valuable in this case, where public opinion is heavily in favour of one side.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope the people vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, but it should be an informed &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  If that is to happen, we need a debate not only in these Houses but among the public in the next few weeks.  An onus of responsibility is on us and we must ensure we discharge it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is in the House with this legislation.  There has been much discussion for many years on the necessity for changes to the law on bail.  Governments have promised referendums on the issue similar to that proposed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The present situation is serious.  Following the O'Callaghan case the courts have been very restricted in what they can do in this area.  They can only refuse bail in two specific instances, first, where there is a likelihood that the accused would not turn up for trial and, second, where it is considered that the accused would interfere with witnesses or evidence.  The proposed change is sensible and I hope it will have the support of the majority of the public.</P>
      <P>The Minister has rightly judged that public opinion is unhappy that over the past ten to 15 years people have continually committed crime while on bail. This needs to be addressed.  Many people facing serious charges commit further crimes while on bail &mdash; for example, by amassing money through armed robbery &mdash; on the basis that while charges relating to apprehension for committing such crimes are taken into account, sentencing will not be greatly increased.</P>
      <P>Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, specifies that where a person commits an offence on bail a consecutive sentence may be imposed on the sentence for the original crime.  Regrettably, this has not been properly enforced, giving rise to the urgent necessity for this amendment, which I welcome and support because it is in the public interest that it be passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will also support any efforts made to inform public opinion on the advantages <Col N="2209" /> and disadvantages of the legislation. There will be discussion at local and national level because there is a significant body of opinion opposed to the measure.  Many able, active and intelligent people will put forward the opposing viewpoint.  It is important, therefore, that both sides to the argument be listened to carefully to enable people make up their minds on the issue.</P>
    <P>A number of changes could be made to the present regime which may in many instances avoid the necessity for remanding people on bail.  In the past a person could be remanded by a peace commissioner.  This was changed because it was not an appropriate judicial function for such a person to undertake.  At present a person can be charged at a Garda station with commissioning an offence and can be released on station bail to appear in court.  Alternatively, a person can be charged in front of a judge and detained.</P>
    <P>A Garda superintendent can direct that a person be charged with the misdemeanour of common assault, which is not a serious assault.  However, under section 47 of the Offences against the Person Act, a case involving a person charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm must be referred to the DPP for a decision as to whether the person can be prosecuted.  Similarly, section 18 of the Act provides for an offence causing grievous bodily harm. Again, this is a felony and must be referred to the DPP for a decision on prosecution.  Given that the Office of the DPP is exceptionally busy, it should be possible for the local Garda superintendent or chief superintendent, acting on the advice of the local State solicitor, to prosecute some of these offences without reference to the DPP.  Similarly, offences detailed under section 47 of the Act should be proceeded with in the same manner as misdemeanours.</P>
    <P>There have been many desirable changes in the District Court and Circuit Court regarding civil matters.  The Minister and some of her predecessors <Col N="2210" /> have extended the size of awards that can be made in the Circuit Court from £5,000 to £15,000 and these have now been increased to £30,000.  Similarly, a civil decree in a District Court was increased from £500 to £2,500 and again to £5,000.</P>
    <P>However, a District Court judge only has the power to impose a sentence of one year, although he can give a consecutive or concurrent sentence of a second year.  Will the Minister give such judges extra powers where necessary? For example, providing that an assault occasioning actual bodily harm should be treated as a misdemeanour while allowing a District Court judge to impose a two year sentence would benefit the courts and the legal system.  At present most files involving such cases have to go the DPP for a decision on prosecution.  Some of those who apply for bail may be held in prison if they committed previous offences in case they intimidate witnesses.  The Minister should consider changes along those lines because they would improve the overall position.  The District Court would have greater power and cases would be processed more rapidly.</P>
    <P>Rather than opting for sections 47 or 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act, many gardaí charge people with common assault.  It is one thing for a person to get a black eye but it is a different matter if they get a broken nose, jaw or rib.  These are serious injuries but given the problems associated with having matters heard, many such cases are treated as common assault although they are more serious offences.  I ask the Minister to consider this aspect.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and the Garda Síochána for their efforts in tackling the major crime bosses in Dublin, particularly in relation to drugs.  Major improvements have been made and the new Garda Commissioner has adopted a very positive approach.  The obvious co-operation between the Minister, her Department and the Garda Síochána is welcome.  Great strides are being made <Col N="2211" /> in the efforts to solve the serious drug problem in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the Minister's actions but I ask her to consider extending Operation Shannon, which has been most successful in the last year. A similar operation should continue in the area and I ask the Minister to consider how it could be expanded to different parts of the country.  People are concerned about the level of horrific crime committed by certain groups against vulnerable people.  Every effort must be made to ensure the perpetrators of these crimes are tracked down and charged.  Every part of the machinery of the State must be used to ensure these people are prevented from continuing to commit crimes and are imprisoned.</P>
    <P>The results of the Minister's efforts last year are splendid and I hope that, in co-operation with the Garda Commissioner, she will consider how Operation Shannon, or a similar operation, can be extended to ensure that the perpetrators of crimes &mdash; for example, the people who assaulted the two brothers in County Wicklow &mdash; are apprehended. Regrettably, irrespective of which Minister for Justice or Garda Commissioner is in office, crime will always exist. However, it is our duty to make every effort to ensure crime is curtailed.  The Minister's proposals are worthy of support. There have been problems with regard to bail in recent years but the Bill is positive and I support it.  I wish the Minister well in her difficult portfolio.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I welcome the Bill but the Minister is not a member of the whippings and lashings brigade and she must have given much thought to the matter before she decided to introduce the legislation.  As Senator Quinn said, anything which takes away people's liberty is a source of concern.  I am much more enthusiastic about some other measures the Minister has taken to deal with people involved in crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2212" /> The appalling delays in the courts have led to many people being out on bail for years and committing other crimes before their cases were heard. This aspect has been important in making the public feel that changes in the bail laws are essential.  I am sure many people thought as I did that, when people absconded or committed other crimes while on bail, some of the money lodged for bail was confiscated.  I was amazed to discover some months ago that this is not the case; Senator Gallagher made this point earlier.  I saw a report which stated that of 189 cases, money was confiscated in only one.  It is more important to change such measures than the Constitution, which is a serious step.</P>
    <P>I am worried about some of the practical implications of the Bill.  The Minister pointed out the ongoing building programme, but it will be some time before those prison places are available. I gather that the second development at Wheatfield will be a remand prison.  I hope this will be ready soon because it is important to separate remand and convicted prisoners.  This is one of the most serious problems regarding Mountjoy Jail where remand and convicted prisoners are kept together.  This is not suitable.</P>
    <P>I applaud the appointment of more judges and the fact that the courts sat during the summer to reduce the delays in trials, but more money should be spent on the rehabilitation of prisoners to ensure that when they are released they are not likely to become recidivists and return to Mountjoy Jail within a short time.  It is not good that there is only one probation officer for 70 prisoners and the appointment of more prison probation officers is most important not just to deal with people while they are in prison but when they are released.</P>
    <P>I am sure I bore the Minister by repeatedly raising the same issues, such as the provision of hostels for people when they are released from prison. However, the fewer people who are committed to prison the better, and not <Col N="2213" /> just from the perspective of the high level of recidivism.  I was sad to hear on a recent television programme the Governor of Mountjoy Jail and the chief medical officer admit there was nothing they could do at present about the drugs culture in prison.  The Minister is making efforts in that regard, such as the establishment of a special unit in Mountjoy Jail, but these matters take time.  I continually hear reports of people who were not involved in drugs when they went into prison but regrettably had addiction problems when they were released.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages of being a University Senator is that I have learned constituents who occasionally send me advice.  Given that the Minister is in the science rather than the classics stream, I will paraphrase &ldquo;<i>Facilis descensus Averno</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;easy is the way down to the underworld&rdquo;&mdash; from Virgil's <i>Iliad:</i> easy is the descent into fascism.  We must be extremely careful about the introduction of measures which interfere with civil liberties; they must be based on the utmost conviction.  I hope the legislation will be implemented as the Minister expects, but I will keep a close watch on this issue if the referendum is passed, which appears certain on the basis of public opinion at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been a useful debate and I compliment the Minister for bringing forward this enabling legislation to ensure a referendum on bail can be held.  The serious crime problem is ongoing.  Some people with the benefit of good lawyers, were able to use the system and decisions handed down to their advantage.  This could no longer continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been various viewpoints expressed but the Minister has been consistent.  She made her statement over 18 months ago having fully considered the matter.  Not everybody agreed with her at that time but since then many people have come around to her way of thinking.  The Minister reviewed the legislation, the workings of the courts in relation to bail and how a decision <Col N="2214" /> handed down over 31 years ago was not in keeping with today's requirements. Why was this matter not reviewed in the interim?  I have called before for legislation to be reviewed on an on-going basis.  Finance legislation is updated every year so why should legislation relating to an issue as important as bail and the treatment of crime and criminals not be reviewed regularly?</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure although it will not be a panacea for all our ills. Hopefully it will be one part of a package to reform our criminal law in relation to how we deal with people who commit crimes.  There are people in prison who should not be there and these matters should and can be addressed in other ways.  There are others who should be in prison but because of the legal system or overcrowding they are not.  Community service orders have been imposed and these have worked in some areas.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a problem which has evolved over many years.  This measure will not be mandatory but it will give the courts an option beyond the two current grounds for refusal of bail; fear of a suspect not turning up for trial and interfering with witnesses.  This new measure will partly improve the situation particularly regarding drug related crime.</P>
    <P>We all welcome this.  I will advocate a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote and it behoves all elected representatives to avoid being complacent as far as this important referendum is concerned.  In some ways it may be more important than previous referenda because, hopefully, it will ensure convictions particularly in cases involving serious crime where people have been injured and attacks on the elderly.</P>
    <P>While the drugs issue has been central in recent times, petty crimes are still carried out.  We need to ask ourselves how much do people suffer as a result of this?  By petty crime I mean everything from handbag snatching to intimidating people in their homes, acts of wanton vandalism particularly in areas where the elderly are suffering at the hands of <Col N="2215" /> a few bully boys in the street.  These trouble makers can cause as much fear as the bigger criminals.  Petty crimes infringe people's rights, particularly those of the elderly.  Some of us have had our car windows smashed.  The Minister had a problem near this House some years ago, but at least at our age we are reasonably capable of recovering from such an event.  An older person would live in dread of another attack. While petty crime may not be as serious in the great scheme of things one should not forget some of the smaller incidents that occur.</P>
    <P>If one is walking down the street at night and trips over a loose kerb one can sue Dublin Corporation, similarly if one slips in one of Senator Quinn's establishments one could sue.  In the old days if you slipped you got up quickly and hoped no on saw you.  Today people lie down and hope for a large compensation settlement.  We should look at introducing a compensation scheme for people who have been attacked, maimed and psychologically scarred. There may have been abuses of and problems with such schemes &mdash; perhaps a cap on awards is needed &mdash; but if Dublin Corporation can pay out £10,000 for an inadvertent act, the State should give something to the victims of crime.  This could operate along the lines of the Motor Insurance Bureau.  You will not get people deliberately setting up muggings in order to claim compensation.  I hope the Minister will consider such a scheme.</P>
    <P>When does the Minister see the legislation being ready if and when the referendum is passed on 28 November?  Will it be early in the new year and is it at an advanced stage?  Many people might like to vote on their way into work. Could an extra hour be added to polling time?  I would favour that as it would facilitate those who cannot vote during the normal polling hours.</P>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, support this measure.  There will be much debate and it is important that we inform people of the issues involved. <Col N="2216" /> The Minister is to be congratulated on identifying the problem a long time ago and sticking with it despite criticism from certain quarters, which have been mute in recent months.  They have come to terms with the reality that the Minister was right about the difficulties which have evolved.  It is not a knee-jerk reaction but has been thought out over a long period and deserves our support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who participated in the debate and who, by and large, welcomed the Bill.  We would prefer in our hearts not to have to enact this legislation but the reality is that we must.  We cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand and pretend the issue of people committing offences while on bail does not require our attention as legislators. Even those who were less than robust in their welcome for the Bill indicated they felt it was a necessary and appropriate response to the situation we have faced for a number of years.</P>
      <P>I also thank the Senators who paid tribute to the new Garda Commissioner, Pat Byrne, and the Garda in general. There is no doubt that a huge amount of work, dedication and commitment are being put into breaking the backs of the criminal organisations which have preyed on society for years.  I commend that work but I wish to put it in context lest the impression is given, in praising the current commissioner, that the outgoing or previous commissioners were not equally willing to give the same commitment.  However, the present commissioner, with his background in operational matters, is very capable of and suited to taking on these criminal gangs which have developed a system of operations to thwart the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Government came into office we recognised very quickly that one of the difficulties in tackling organised criminals was, as Senator Quinn and others said, that the institutions of the State were not working together as they should have been, although each was working validly and with commitment in its own area.  As a result of <Col N="2217" /> initiatives which I, as Minister for Justice, took in July 1995, having worked on them for the previous months, we began to put together the basis on which the Customs and Excise, Revenue Commissioners, Garda, Naval Service and Department of Social Welfare could share their experiences and work together.</P>
    <P>I have heard criticisms that nothing happened as a result of those initiatives. However, we would not have the effective Criminal Assets Bureau working and in statutory form if we had not commenced work on bringing those bodies together a year earlier.  There were many meetings between the institutions so they could begin to work together and not thwart each other's efforts.</P>
    <P>Such co-ordination does not happen easily in other European countries which are now looking at what we have managed to introduce.  At a recent meeting of the Council of Ministers I explained about the Criminal Assets Bureau and the way the Naval Service, Customs and Garda were working to find the drugs being brought in here. They said they wished a similar arrangement was working in their countries.</P>
    <P>I discovered on a recent visit to the European drugs unit in the Hague that police forces, customs officers and revenue commissioners from some countries only realise that other people in their country are investigating the same crime when they come to that unit.  It is only then they find ways to co-operate. Our institutions have agreed and committed themselves to work together, share information and not get in each other's way.  We will be an example to other countries.  There has been a sense of frustration in this and other debates on crime at that lack of co-operation. We have that co-operation now and Senators can see the results &mdash; they do not need me to spell them out.</P>
    <P>I was aware today's debate would run the gamut of all the issues related to crime.  You will forgive me, a Chathaoirligh, if I do not answer every question which was raised because it was a very <Col N="2218" /> wide ranging discussion.  However, I will try my best to touch on most of the points raised.</P>
    <P>It is not open to our courts at present when considering a bail application to take into account the question of a person committing serious offences while on bail, even where the accused has a long track record of being involved in the commission of serious crime while on bail.  For example, it is not open to a judge to refuse bail to someone who has been charged with a serious sex offence and who has already committed a crime of the same nature, for which they might have been convicted, on the grounds they might commit a similar crime while on bail because of their record.</P>
    <P>It is particularly not open to a judge to refuse bail to an offender who has scrupulously turned up on time for all their court appearances and has not interfered with witnesses.  Such criminals often make sure they do not breach any of the existing regulations so that a judge has to give them bail because they have turned up in court every time, although the judge would prefer to refuse bail.</P>
    <P>No matter how much we change the laws, improve court efficiency or tighten the existing laws within the current constitutional constraints, a judge cannot take such offending into consideration without a change in our Constitution. As some Senators said, changing the Constitution is pretty serious, but it is appropriate and necessary to ask the people to make that change.</P>
    <P>In devising the amendment to be put to the people the Government was very conscious of striking an appropriate balance and avoiding, as Senator Henry said, a descent into fascism.  We have all been protected as law abiding citizens by the protection of the State against false accusation and false imprisonment. We must bring a balance to our laws and I believe we have struck the right balance in this wording.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole questioned the wording.  Perhaps, as a teacher, he was concerned that it sounds a little clumsy to say &ldquo;reasonably considered&rdquo; as <Col N="2219" /> opposed to &ldquo;considered reasonable&rdquo;. The reason for that was, first, it is the wording of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Second, it is incumbent on the judge and those involved to ensure they have considered with reason whether it is necessary to refuse bail rather than that it is considered reasonable because everybody's view of what is reasonable can be different.  It is important that the judge has to be satisfied that it is reasonably considered necessary to refuse bail in order to prevent the commission of a serious crime &mdash; it does not have to be proved what kind of crime might be committed.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher raised a number of important issues which I had considered before bringing the amendment to the Government.  She raised issues such as the need to ensure that somebody is not just locked away for long periods once their bail has been refused without that consideration.  The time frame of four months is to ensure that there is a list of people who have been refused bail and that a mechanism will be available to the court on an ongoing basis to continue to review the cases of people who have been refused bail.</P>
    <P>As the law stands &mdash; I am making amendments to it in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996 &mdash; a person can only be remanded for up to eight days and must then be brought back to court for further remand.  We are changing that in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill so that the second time around the period will be 15 days.  It will not be a case of people being put into prison as a result of not getting bail and being forgotten about, even for those four months, because they have to be brought back to court for a continuation of their remand.  I am building in a provision to ensure that if the trial has not commenced within four months there is an examination of whether that bail should be continued to be refused.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher made a suggestion at which I am willing to look: if the trial has not commenced but the judge is <Col N="2220" /> satisfied that the person should continue to be refused bail, we should have a further look at it sooner than four months later.  It is not appropriate to put that kind of provision into a constitutional amendment but it would be appropriate to consider it when debating the legislation.  I will take note of that suggestion.  All I have published is an outline of the legislation because I am precluded from drafting and passing the legislation until the constitutional amendment is passed, if it is passed. This debate gives us a chance to look at what will be in that legislation.  The legislation will, of course, come before both Houses and during the debate all sorts of discussions can take place and amendments can be made.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher made a valid point when she said that perhaps the second period of remand should be shorter than four months lest a person could be eight months on remand.  In this way, there is an in built protection if the judge is concerned that somebody is being kept on remand for too long.  It could be that either the defence or the prosecution is thwarting the preparation of the trial papers.  There could be some such reason which a judge would have to take into consideration.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy had a lot to say.  I should not be surprised because from what I hear he does this every time.  I thought there was a certain amount of blowing one's trumpet.  That is perfectly in order because Deputy O'Donoghue brought forward a Bill last year but I would have expected some maturity and a certain amount of graciousness from him.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that over the last 30 years, certainly in the 15 years I have been in politics, I have often heard this debate about bail and the need to change it.  It comes up every so often. The only two serious attempts to make some changes in this area were when a Fine Gael-Labour Government was in power.  In 1984, when a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition was in power, legislation was brought in which allowed judges to impose consecutive sentences for crimes <Col N="2221" /> committed on bail.  That was a genuine effort by the Oireachtas to send a message to those who were committing crime while out on bail.  This Fine Gael-Labour-Democratic Left Coalition is making a real difference to the regime on bail.  All this noise about who said what to whom and so on is nonsense, because the proof of the pudding is in the eating and it was during a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition in 1984, and now during a Fine Gael-Labour-Democratic Left Coalition that a real effort was made to bring in appropriate legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy is right when he says that when Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill was introduced in the other House I raised a question mark &mdash; no more and no less &mdash; about where this amendment should go in the Constitution.  I am woman enough to say now that I said then I thought Article 40 might not be the right place.  I only questioned this issue and I am willing to say that. Article 38 deals with the trials of offences and at the time I thought it was probably a more appropriate place, but on examination &mdash; and that is the advantage of giving oneself time to examine things &mdash; I am willing to accept that Article 40 is the right place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy O'Donoghue is more gracious and generous than Senator Mulcahy.  Perhaps it is the maturity of the few extra years and the few extra grey hairs.  I have no doubt that in ten years' time when Senator Mulcahy is older he will show the same kind of maturity and graciousness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Enright raised a number of issues in regard to the powers in the District Court.  He is probably aware, although it has not come into this House yet, that we are in the process of amending the law in the area of misdemeanours and felonies; under the present law there is an antiquated method of deciding whether something is a serious or a less serious offence. <Col N="2222" /> What are now treated as misdemeanours are quite serious offences and some crimes treated as felonies nowadays would not be considered so serious.  It is necessary to do away with that antiquated system and this will have an effect on how the Garda and the District Courts deal with various crimes.</P>
    <P>There is probably a case to be made that, because there have been such delays in the Circuit Court, offences are tried in the District Court where there are fewer delays.  I am glad to tell the House that, as a result of my initiative and the co-operation and initiatives of the Denham Commission and the Presidents of the District, Circuit and High Courts, the extra sittings in September, the first time ever for the courts, allowed 504 cases to be taken, including 40 very serious criminal offences of rape and murder.  That is phenomenal and I pay particular tribute to the newly appointed judges who serviced those extra sittings because we are now beginning to shorten the delays.</P>
    <P>I remind Senator Mulcahy that the delays in the courts did not build up over the last two years; they have built up over a long number of years.  Regrettably, because they took so long to build up it may take longer than I want for them to be done away with, but in six months time we will see a phenomenal difference.  A solicitor complained to me yesterday that they have been called in to account for themselves as to why cases were being listed for a year from now when, if they really put their minds to it, they could have those cases listed much sooner.</P>
    <P>Perhaps certain habits in the way people dealt with court cases have become institutionalised because the delays had become institutionalised. Perhaps solicitors and barristers automatically told clients they have no hope of getting their case into court for another year.  Now they are being told they had better have them ready within three or six months.  Cases that were listed for October 1997 are now coming forward to the beginning of next year. <Col N="2223" /> That phenomenal change in a few short months is as a direct result of initiatives taken by me as Minister and by the Government in appointing 21 extra judges in an 18 month period when only ten extra judges had been appointed in the previous ten years.  We have to give credit where it is due, even if I have to take it on myself to give myself and the Government that credit.</P>
    <P>A number of other issues, such as the right to silence and escheatment of bail, were raised.  Senator Henry is right.  Escheatment of bail has not been happening. It is not a matter for the Minister for Justice but is for the prosecution services of the State.  In cases where it has occurred, representations are made begging the Minister to intervene and stop the escheatment of bail because the person who put up bail can no longer pay it.  That legislation will be tightened up and it will lead to bail being refused because people will not be able to come up with the bonds when they have to give a commitment that the person will be of good behaviour.  I have to be careful because the Constitution clearly allows people the right to a fair trial. Setting bail too high has always been a problem because it means that only wealthy people or those with many criminal assets can obtain bail.</P>
    <P>As a result of the 1984 Act, which the Oireachtas thought would have the effect of giving consecutive sentences, the judges decided in many cases they would continue to give concurrent sentences or suspend one sentence.  They gave sentences of two years for each crime and suspended the second one. This had not been expected to happen and because of this I am changing the law to ensure where a person is being tried in court for two offences, one of which was committed on bail, there will be an additional penalty.  Judges will have to be conscious that they cannot suspend all of the second sentence.  I perceive it will work that way when the amendment is made and Senators will <Col N="2224" /> have an opportunity to discuss that when it is introduced.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell made a wide ranging speech on revolving doors, etc.  I did not invent the revolving door and I hope no one is implying that.  I read the Dáil debates from 1991 to 1994 and it was spinning wildly during that time as indicated by the questions and debates of that time.  This Government has put in place a realistic programme for cutting down on the speed of that revolving door and by 1998, when this programme will be completed, over 800 additional places will be available in the prison system. Already this year I made 70 extra available and by the end of it there will be another 100 additional places.</P>

    <P>Senator Farrell raised a number of other issues.  Nothing was done by successive Fianna Fáil Ministers about drugs in prison for eight years before I took office.  Within three months of entering office I erected a net over Cork Prison which has almost totally excluded drugs from there.  Within six <Col N="2226" /> months I modified the cameras and visiting area, and built a search room to cut down the amount of drugs going into Mountjoy Prison.  I have opened the first drug free facility in this State in the training unit where 96 prisoners are able to serve out their sentences in a drug free unit.  I introduced a new methadone system in Mountjoy Prison and opened a drugs treatment facility for 52 prisoners where they receive full treatment while serving their sentences.  A drug free regime has been introduced in three other prisons and hopefully it will be extended to all prisons.  That will not ensure drugs will not get into prison because they get in through many nefarious ways, not just through visitors.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell suggested that I remove all visiting rights.  It is a descent into fascism to do away with all visiting regimes.  I will not be driven by anybody in this House or anywhere else to do away with prison visits.  It is a humane way to deal with people, but visitors must also be conscious they should not do anything that damages the possibility of their kin receiving rehabilitation in prison.  If visitors pass drugs to their loved ones, I will make sure action is taken.  We are proceeding with prosecutions against some visitors who have taken drugs into prison.  We have camera proof of drugs being handed over during visits.  Prisoners get drugs also when they go out to court, doctors and for education and training reasons.  If they are found bringing drugs in they immediately lose prison benefits.</P>
    <P>I did not introduce rural policing into this country and some of the questions the Senator raised should have been raised when it was introduced.  Rural policing has been good.  There are difficulties in making sure people who are assigned to communities can stay there, but there will always be times when the police have to be removed from a rural village or town if a major crime has to be investigated elsewhere.  That will continue to happen, but the Garda Commissioner deploys the police he has at his disposal.  This is a police force that by the end of 1997 will have been <Col N="2227" /> increased by the addition of 350 recruits in 1996 and 1997, plus 400 extra agreed by Government, plus the availability of 200 extra police officers who will be released from administrative duties by the employment of 200 civilians.  If that is not an increase in the police force, I do not know what it is.  Some 700 plus 400 extra police will be in place by the end of 1997 and I will leave it to Senator Mulcahy to add up those figures.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher referred to the availability of judges to decide whether someone should get bail.  There will be a &ldquo;mini&rdquo; trial and the judge who will hear that evidence will not hear the full trial.  If someone's record is being put out, judges will have the power to exclude certain people.  Where a court is hearing an application for bail and evidence is being given in relation to the criminal record of the accused &mdash; it is important the presumption of innocence exists when a person goes to trial &mdash; the court may direct that the whole or any part of the proceedings shall be <i>in camera</i>, shall exclude the public or any particular portion of the public or any particular person or persons except bone fide members of the press during the whole or any part of the proceedings. No person shall publish or cause to be published any information relating to the criminal record of the accused person referred to during the course of the proceedings or other information which would indicate or tend to indicate any such information has been so given.  If any person contravenes subsection (2) he or she shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months or both.  That will give protection to somebody who is being refused bail that such evidence will not form part of their subsequent trial.  That is the present position and I hope people will accept that it will be included in the legislation.  I do not intend to make any change.</P>
    <P>Part of the Government's programme is to build a 400 place remand prison in <Col N="2228" /> Wheatfield.  Senator Henry said remand prisoners were detained with convicted prisoners.  Remand prisoners represent about 10 per cent of the prison population, so at any one time there are about 200 to 250 prisoners on remand from the courts.  In Mountjoy Prison they are, by and large, held separately in Wing B.  I cannot say with certainty there are not times when some remand prisons have to be held with convicted prisoners because of the pressure on space.  When on remand, prisoners experience an easier regime, which includes extra visiting time, access to telephones and extra post.  In other prisons it is not always possible to keep remand prisoners separate, but the numbers would be small.</P>
    <P>We need a remand prison so prisoners on remand can be kept separate, which is the reason the Government has decided the prison in Wheatfield will be a remand one.  The type of prisoner on remand is very different to that of ten or 15 years ago when a large number were first time offenders.  Sadly, nearly all our remand prisoners are convicted criminals.  It is not always a case of segregating first time offenders from convicted criminals.  The nature of crime is such that many of our criminals are multiple offenders.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised the question of creating a new offence of committing a crime while on bail.  We looked at that but we faced the danger of a double jeopardy.  I decided not to create a new offence of committing a crime while on bail because although somebody may be convicted of that crime, they may not be convicted of the original offence.  We would face the risk of people being doubly convicted for something of which they were not guilty.</P>
    <P>I would like to explain to Senator Mulcahy what I mean when I say the wording in the amendment is not complex. Everybody with a rudimentary knowledge of English will be able to understand what is being put to them when marking their ballot paper.  The complexities have arisen since the Law Reform Commission published its <Col N="2229" /> report in late September or early October.  It was given to the Attorney General's Office in August to be proof read, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I paid the Senator a compliment. I will try to explain this using the smallest words I can.  I said the amendment is relatively straightforward. Everybody who has read it can understand it.  The complexities arose in relation to what went on behind the scenes.</P>
      <P>If this was not a complex issue, why did successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice fail to deal with it?  Deputy O'Donoghue introduced legislation last year because he knew his party had failed to take action.  In fairness to Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, she was only in office for a year.  However, the previous Minister successively refused efforts made by Deputy Barrett, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and Deputy Gay Mitchell to do something about bail.  Fine Gael/Labour or Fine Gael made these efforts.  Successive Fianna Fáil Minister refused to accept those efforts.  Eventually, in 1994 when Deputy Gay Mitchell's motion was tabled in the House, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn referred the issue to the Law Reform Commission. As it happens, the Law Reform Commission provided us with a deep analysis of the issue.  However, the problem was that it was not asked to make recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normally, when a report of the Law Reform Commission is published, there are a series of recommendations which the Minister of the day can quickly take up.  I had to look at this report without <Col N="2230" /> recommendations and decide what was the best action to take.  A range of things could have been done, as has been witnessed by this debate.  I was conscious of holding a referendum on bail in isolation from the other actions I was taking, like speeding up the courts, preparing a proper prison building programme and appointing extra judges.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave asked when I thought the legislation would be introduced. If this referendum is passed on 28 November &mdash; and representations I have received over the past two years lead me to believe it will be &mdash; we will be able to prepare the legislation, although we have an outline.  Other issues may come up during the debate which I might want to include.  The Dáil will go into recess on 20 or 21 December, so it will be in the session starting January 1997 when the legislation will be debated in the House. There will be no delay introducing it. My hands are tied finalising the legislation because I do not want to be found to be acting unconstitutionally. Members can be assured there will be no delay introducing it.</P>
    <P>When introduced the legislation will be in the hands of the Judiciary in which I have great confidence and hope; it too is a member of the community and not an isolated body.  Judges will go to the polling stations to vote in this referendum. Like politicians, they will be conscious when they sit on the bench to pass judgment on an application for bail, that this is something in which the people will have cast their vote.</P>
    <P>I thank Members who spoke for the wide ranging discussion and I hope we will be able to complete the Bill so there will be no delay in putting this referendum to the people.  The House must also deal with Committee and Final Stages and the statement for the information of voters which must be put on the card which is sent out.</P>

      <P>As the substance of the debate on the Bill will relate to the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment contained in the Schedule to the Bill, and since it would be appropriate to have that Schedule decided upon before deciding on section 1 of the Bill, which actually provides for its insertion into the Constitution, I am suggesting that the House postpones consideration of sections 1 and 2 of the Bill until after the Schedule shall have been agreed.  This is a procedure which has been adopted on Committee Stage in the Seanad in the case of previous Bills to amend the Constitution, and which I suggest would lend itself to a more logically ordered debate.  I would, therefore, formally ask the Leader of the House to move, in accordance with Standing Order 89, that consideration of sections 1 and 2 of the Bill be postponed until the Schedule shall have been disposed of.</P>

    <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">SCHEDULE</P>
    <P>1.  In Part I, page 6, line 6, after &ldquo;a dhéanamh.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Aon duine a athchuirfear i gcoimeád go dtí go dtriailfear é, agus a bhfuil bannaí diúltaithe dó de réir dlí, ní athchuirfear i gcoimeád é mar gheall air sin amháin go ceann aon tréimhse singil is faide ná nócha lá.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>In part II, page 6, line 11, after &ldquo;person.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Any person remanded in custody pending trial, who has been refused bail in accordance with law, shall not be remanded in custody for that reason alone for any single period greater than ninety days.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy John O'Donoghue's Bill, which was ordered to be printed in June 1995 and debated in October of that year, proposed that a person who was remanded on the basis that bail had been refused would not be remanded in custody for that reason alone for a single period not greater than 90 days.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider adopting that amendment?  Many speakers would agree that it would be unfair to somebody, whoever that person <Col N="2233" /> might be, to be remanded in custody in a case where bail had been refused and to have their trial postponed or delayed for a long period of time.  Such a long period would negate the very rationale articulated by Chief Justice Ó Dálaigh in the O'Callaghan case in terms of the personal liberty of a person.</P>
    <P>Many speakers today said bringing forward such an amendment is a regrettable step because finding ourselves in a situation where bail must be refused in the first place is not a welcome scenario. The Minister accepted that she got it wrong when she replied to Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill in the Dáil.  She accepted that Article 40 rather than Article 38 was the correct one to amend. I ask the Minister to accept there is a great deal of common sense in providing for a ceiling of 90 days because if the proper changes are made to the laws of criminal procedure and the by now ridiculous system of the preliminary examination in the District Court is done away with, it is entirely feasible that trials could commence within 90 days of a person being charged with an indictable offence.</P>
    <P>This will give an opportunity to those Members sitting opposite me who expressed reservations to cast a vote in favour of this restraining order on the general power to deprive people of their liberty when, in fact, no charge has been proved against them, which is what we are talking about in this case.  We are asking a court to say to somebody who is presumed innocent that he or she will be deprived of his or her liberty not because of the alleged offence but because there is a possibility or probability that he or she will commit another offence if granted bail.  If we are making that change to one of the most basic tenets of our judicial system and democracy it is entirely reasonable that there be a 90 day limit.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes after &ldquo;person.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Any person remanded in custody pending trial, who has been refused bail in accordance with law, shall not be remanded in custody for that reason alone for any single period <Col N="2234" /> greater than ninety days.&rdquo;  The words &ldquo;for that reason alone&rdquo; are critical and they echo the draft in Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill.  That is not to say that the person might not be in custody for a period greater than 90 days but it would not be permissible to hold the person in custody for a period greater than 90 days on the bail issue alone, and that is a very important distinction.  There may be other reasons to keep somebody in custody and that is why the words &ldquo;for that reason alone&rdquo; were used in Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill and in this amendment.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend this amendment to the House.  The Minister will agree that in some other European jurisdictions where the right of bail is more severely restricted, there have been many cases where people who have been refused bail were held in custody awaiting trial for one year, two years or even a more lengthy period.  I know of a case where an Irishman was accused of a crime and held without bail in a Spanish prison for more than 18 months.  I regard that as excessive.  To the best of my knowledge, the person was not subsequently convicted of the offence for which he was charged and he was not entitled to any compensation under Spanish law for having served 18 months in prison.  There is a great deal of common sense in inserting a time limit in this Bill to amend the Constitution which, as other Senators said, we should be very slow to amend.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, Fianna Fáil supports the principle behind the Bill and we are determined that no person who is likely to commit a serious offence should be given bail but that is not to say that the State should have an unlimited licence to keep that person in prison without trial at its pleasure.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>suppose it comes as no great surprise to the Senator that I will not be accepting this amendment for a number reasons not least of which is that when we amend the Constitution we must be <Col N="2235" /> scrupulous in examining every single word to be inserted.  If one looks back at the history of the 15 other constitutional amendment Bills, an effort was made each time to keep the wording as tight as possible because every single &ldquo;and&rdquo;, &ldquo;but&rdquo;, comma, colon and apostrophe can have an interpretation which one did not intend and might be interpreted differently in the courts than the way intended.  The wording was kept as tight as possible during preparation.</P>
      <P>That is not to state that I have not considered the issue raised by Senator Mulcahy.  It was for this reason that I built into the outline of the legislation a safeguard that people would not languish in prison without having their application for bail heard a second time.  I was particularly worried that people who find themselves on the wrong side of the law might be more vulnerable in that regard.  I do not believe that some of the more articulate members of the criminal fraternity would be slow to ensure that their lawyers made a case for them.  However, there are others whose friends and relatives might not be looking after their welfare and they might find themselves languishing in prison for six to ten months because someone failed to review their case. More intelligent criminals would scream blue murder within two to three weeks if they were refused bail.  I included the safeguard to ensure that the courts will have access to the mechanism of a rollover list to check the length of time people are on bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I briefly considered the wording in the amendment and, apart from adding to the Bill and confusing matters, I believe the present wording is simple and without complexity.  If it were adopted, the new wording would give rise to certain questions.  For example, would it not be open to the defence to delay a case until the 90 day period had elapsed and their client would then be released?  As drafted, the amendment states &ldquo;for any single period greater than 90 days&rdquo;.  However, when that period had elapsed could people not obtain <Col N="2236" /> a further period of 30 or 40 days?  The amendment implies that the court case must take place on the 89th day and cannot take place on the 91st, which could represent a travesty of justice.</P>
    <P>There are some cases that will take longer than 90 days to prepare from the date on which a person is refused bail. Let us consider some of the awful cases where someone is charged with between 20 to 100 counts of sexual abuse.  There is huge amount of work involved in ensuring that the necessary statements were taken and prepared to ensure that a conviction can be validly prosecuted. In the brief time available to consider the Senator's amendment, I discovered that it contains in-built dangers and might have the opposite effect to that intended.  I believe the reasoning behind the amendment is the same as that which prompted me to include the four month safeguard into the outline legislation. It would be very unwise to include the Senator's wording in the amendment on which the people will be asked to vote because many defects could be discovered in it.  I can imagine the courts driving a coach and four through the wording and it would then have a completely different effect to that which was intended.</P>
    <P>I ask Senator Mulcahy to accept my bona fides.  I have built protections into the outline legislation that there will be an examination after four months.  I also gave a commitment to Senator Gallagher that further consideration would be given where a judge decided that a person should continue to be remanded without bail at the end of the four month period.  We will consider the possibility of granting continuing periods of one month for further reviews.  A similar position obtained regarding the seven day detention period in the Drug Trafficking Act where the prosecution must cross further hurdles at the end of each period of 24 or 48 hours in order to keep someone in custody, which is valid.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy quoted liberally from Deputy O'Donoghue's contribution to the debate on the Bill in the Dáil.  The Deputy was the author of the <Col N="2237" /> other Bill and he did not move an amendment to the Schedule in the Dáil. He was correct in this regard.  He made comments about the wording and stated that he might have done things differently but that would only involve moving the deck chairs around.  Deputy O'Donoghue did not see the need to alter the wording and took my word that there is an in-built safeguard that a person in custody will have their application for bail reviewed again.  It would be unwise to divide the House on this issue.  I am not against the import of Senator Mulcahy's argument but the voting paper is not the correct place for his wording.  I ask him not to divide the House on an issue on which everyone is in agreement.</P>

      <P>I compliment Senator Mulcahy who has not had a good day in that regard.  His intention is worthy and understandable but I cannot support the amendment on the grounds outlined by the Minister.  A wording such as this is not suitable to the Constitution. However, it would be suitable in legislation. The Minister's intention to include it in legislation is the correct route to take.  I urge Senator Mulcahy to reconsider his intentions regarding the amendment.  I understand those worthy intentions because they would solve problems for Members who are concerned about any amendment to the Constitution which removes certain rights.  However, the Senator's amendment would be better dealt with by means of legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to answer some of the points raised by the Minister. I do not accept that we cannot &mdash; the Minister did not say so but I believe it was the basis of her contribution &mdash; place time limits in the Constitution. However, a time limit of sorts was included in the divorce amendment.  The Constitution contains the <i>habeas corpus</i> procedure which enables an aggrieved person to come before the courts almost immediately to ask that they adjudicate on the legality or otherwise of a detention. <Col N="2238" /> If the Minister is satisfied that cases will not arise where people are detained for unnecessarily long periods, I have no problem withdrawing the amendment.</P>
      <P>For the reasons the Minister articulated, a time limit in the Constitution has a greater force than any procedure contained in legislation.  I would have been more comforted had the Minister stated that the legislation will contain an absolute time limit.  Can she not conceive of a situation where a person could be held without trial for two to three years?  Will there be any ceiling? The Constitution or the legislation must contain such a ceiling.  There must come a time when everyone knows that the game is up or that a case cannot be prepared.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the Minister's point about a defendant somehow frustrating the prosecution's case.  It is not up to a defendant or his or her lawyers to assist the prosecution in any way in the preparation of its case.  In terms of this debate, if a defendant is already in prison awaiting trial, the State and the prosecution must prepare a book of evidence, serve it on the accused and proceed to trial.  I do not understand the Minister's statement regarding a defendant frustrating the preparation of a case by the prosecution.</P>
      <P>Albeit that we do not agree intellectually with the Minister on the points she raised, my party's primary concern is that the referendum will be passed.  The Minister has indicated that she believes adding these words would result in confusion. That would be the last thing we want.  Given the Minister's assurances, I will withdraw the amendment. However, this issue must be addressed in legislation in a concrete fashion.</P>
      <P>Most people want convicted criminals to serve their time in prison and do not want habitual criminals released on bail to freely commit other crimes for which they pay no penalty.  Nobody wants people held without trial or bail for extended periods.</P>

      <P>This motion is put pursuant to section 23(1) of the Referendum Act, 1994, which provides that at a referendum a statement in relation to the proposal which is the subject of the referendum may be prescribed by a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  The purpose is to assist voters at the referendum on the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1996, by making available to them a statement relating to the proposal which is the subject of the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed statement is set out in Irish and English in straightforward neutral terms.  It is appropriate that a statutory statement of this type should not attempt to paraphrase or interpret the proposed constitutional amendment. It simply quotes the words which the Constitutional Amendment Bill proposes to add to Article 40.4 of the Constitution. The statement will be printed on polling cards sent to electors and on posters displayed in and in the precincts <Col N="2240" /> of all polling stations.  A copy of the statement will also be sent to each postal voter and elector on the special home voters list to whom polling cards are not sent.</P>
    <P>Under section 23(2) of the Referendum Act, 1994, presiding officers are authorised to assist electors with a sight impairment or other disability and electors with reading or writing difficulties by reading out the prescribed statement to them where necessary.  Having read out the statement the presiding officer will ask the elector whether he or she wishes to vote in favour of or against the proposal and will mark the ballot paper in accordance with the voter's answer.</P>
    <P>This information arrangement is additional to the standing provision of referendum law under which copies of the Bill to amend the Constitution may be inspected or obtained free of charge at any post office.  The arrangement proposed in the motion is identical with arrangements at all previous referenda, including the referendum on divorce last year.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for bringing forward the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1996.  It has the full support of Fianna Fáil.  The public is dismayed when it is reported that serious crimes have been committed by people on bail.  On a rough calculation the number of indictable crimes detected which were committed by people on bail amounted to about 10 per cent of all indictable crimes detected.  For every ten indictable crimes committed one was committed by a person on bail.  This figure is outrageous. The public has demanded action and we must respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important Bill.  I agree with the Minister on the need for an informed public debate on this issue. The Minister should write to the commission she set up asking it to communicate with all the television and radio stations asking them to give equal time to both sides of the debate.  The recent referendum on divorce has shown us that a full debate is essential.  Hopefully, <Col N="2241" /> the Members of the Oireachtas will engage in debate so that the public will be better informed when it votes on 28 November.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil urges a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum.  This is one of the most important amendments ever put to the people.  If we can save hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people from becoming victims of crime the work on this Bill will have been worthwhile.  There have been too many victims of crime, especially in the recent past, and we must do all we can to combat crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the passing of the Bill and congratulate the Minister for her work on it.  It is an issue that has been raised on this side of the House in the past.  In 1990 I prepared a Private Members' Bill on this issue only to discover when the work was done that it could not be introduced in the Seanad because it dealt with an amendment to the Constitution.  We have been consistent in our concern about crimes committed by people on bail.</P>
      <P>We have a task to inform the public over the next four weeks.  Hopefully, there will be a large turnout to express the view of the people.  I am confident the result will be in favour and the opinion polls show that.  I hope people do not assume their vote is unimportant because they think the referendum will be passed regardless.  They should register a strong protest on the deteriorating crime situation of the last ten years and say to the Minister they support her on this and other measures she is taking against crime and that they urge her to do more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I add a few words similar to those expressed in admiration for the Minister's grasp of the situation and the manner in which she handled questions and the passage of this Bill.  It is one more step along the path of fighting crime and one the nation will welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions and the expeditious <Col N="2242" /> manner in which business has been conducted. I thank Senator Mulcahy, who was on the receiving end of much comment, for the support of Fianna Fáil for this legislation.  It is an important message to send out to people that we, when needs be, can unite to enact effective legislation and put aside our differences. I thank the Senator for his interventions and the other Members of his party who spoke.  I also thank the Independent Senators who participated in the debate because that again sends a message to people that we are not divided on this issue.</P>
      <P>We are as concerned as the many people who have taken to the streets in recent months, as the victims of crime, as the people suffering from crime and as the parents and relatives of those involved in crime.  We tend to think that because someone is a criminal about whom we have nasty things to say, they do not have a family suffering terribly. These people also deserve our attention.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment will be to act as a method of protecting people against themselves and against something they might do.  Someone may have committed a crime for which they are answerable to the people by serving a penalty.  If they were out on bail, they might commit a worse crime and even take a life.  By a judge deciding they should not be out on bail, they are protected from committing a crime which would entail life imprisonment for them and create more victims.  What we are doing today is not one-sided.  People should remember that when casting their vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I especially thank the officials of the Department of Justice and of the Office of the Attorney General.  A huge amount of work has been put into this. The wording is simple and straightforward, but there have been long hours into the night debating and considering the complexities of this and the long submissions we received from concerned people have all been read and examined to ensure we do not bring this amendment forward lightly or in a frivolous <Col N="2243" /> fashion.  I thank the members of the public who talked to me and officials in my Department and sought deputations from and received hearing from Department officials.  I thank the Office of the Attorney General for its great assistance and wisdom in this issue.</P>
    <P>Radio and television stations must be conscious of the McKenna judgment and RTÉ have seriously considered their responsibilities as a result of that case.  I and Senator Gallagher have participated in one programme in which there was equal representation for both sides on the panel and in the invited audience.  All debates on the radio have thus far included representations from both sides.</P>
    <P>I remind people of the importance of voting.  It is easy to say this referendum will be passed by a majority but I wish to hear the opinion expressed by people through their vote.  It is the best message we can send to judges and we as legislators can receive so that we know what we do is responsive to people's needs.  I remind people they have until 13 November to register if they are not registered. People may have changed addresses or not noticed they had reached 18.  They should be conscious of that and register at their post office.  I also remind students at college and away from home that, in accordance with law, they can register in the town where they are at college.  The law was changed so that they did not have to return home, perhaps at an inconvenient time, and at expense to themselves and their parents.  Students can register in the location where they are at college or university.</P>
    <P>I thank all who participated in this debate.  We can now proceed to make arrangements for the referendum on 28 November and I hope people will vote in good numbers.</P>

    <Title>National Guidance Forum: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the establishment of the National Guidance Forum and urges that Government facilitate the activity of the forum with a view to enhancing public consciousness of the importance of guidance counselling in an era of life long learning involving rapid and sustained change in the education system and in the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is intended to be entirely non-adversarial and is not in response to spectacular public demand at this time for an instant solution to a problem. However, the issue it highlights is important and will become more so in years to come.  It behoves us to see how <Col N="2246" /> the Oireachtas can contribute towards improving public understanding of its importance.</P>
    <P>I presented the issue in the phraseology used in the motion to give it a focus. The National Guidance Forum was established a little over a year ago and has met a number of times since then.  It is an entirely independent and voluntary organisation, bringing together a variety of the interests involved in guidance counselling and advice at all levels, including formal education, adult education, FÁS and various placement services. It is an excellent example of the voluntary co-operation which is at the kernel of a healthy civic society.</P>
    <P>Part of the object of this exercise is to enhance public awareness of the existence and objectives of the forum.  The bodies comprising it provide an example of that capacity for co-operation which is one quality that guidance counselling is increasingly intended to inculcate in all its clients, whether they be teenagers in schools or people changing jobs and looking for alternative careers at a more advanced and mature level.</P>
    <P>One should welcome the establishment of this forum.  It came together from a common realisation that change is all around us and the only thing we can predict is that it will be even more rapid in the future than it is at present. The idea that one chooses a career path and remains in it for life belongs to history. If we live in a world where nothing is as permanent as it once seemed, it is important that we try to get the best quality of adjustment to change.  All commentators agree that what they call &ldquo;the human factor&rdquo;, meaning people, is central to all future development, including economic development.  The fewer round pegs there are in square holes the better for national performance and productivity as well as for the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>This can be seen in every area of activity.  Many middle-aged, financially successful professionals are deeply dissatisfied <Col N="2247" /> with their jobs.  It might even be seen in these Houses from time to time.  It is rather sad that people may enter a career path between the ages of 17 and 21, make a lot of money and by the ordinary criteria of the wider world be successful and yet may be frustrated because they do not derive the satisfaction they once thought or hoped they would, or because they were put on that career path without thinking of job satisfaction but purely of monetary reward.  The ability to give good advice on the activity which is most conducive to an individual's personality development and satisfaction is a contribution towards the type of civil society in which most of us would wish to live.</P>
    <P>Historically, when jobs were available, we put enormous pressure on our young people by forcing them into choices at an early age.  Even now, when the transition year opens all sorts of possibilities and most young people finish second level, we ask them to make choices at that point which may determine their path for many years ahead.  We ask them to choose at a younger age than their peers in most western countries.  It is, therefore, more likely that some of those decisions will be less mature and informed.  If they decided a year or two later, they would decide differently.</P>
    <P>I will not criticise the points system as such in this debate; it has many merits but it is implemented with extraordinary rigidity &mdash; perhaps it must be.  Two years after making a choice, people may decide they have chosen wrongly and may wish to change.  Of those perhaps 10 to 15 per cent will find they cannot change in the short-term.  Fortunately, a degree of flexibility is being introduced to the leaving certificate and to more mature education whereby there are more alternative paths to third level but there are not enough of them as yet. There should be a greater opportunity for flexibility and integration of the entire education system to allow people <Col N="2248" /> to take different paths more frequently than is the case at present.  Although matters have improved markedly in recent years, the mindset which regards educational paths as open to people coming from a variety of different directions rather than just one has yet to pervade adequately among the decisions makers involved.</P>
    <P>We must ensure as far as we can that pupils at school level get the quality of guidance to enable them to make the most informed choice from a variety of view points.  I do not look on guidance counselling as simply a service that exists parallel to or tops up the teaching pupils receive in school.  Guidance counselling is an integral part of the entire personality development of pupils.  It should be a central part of the curriculum and of our concept of education and not simply an optional or luxury extra.</P>
    <P>I will not debate the issue of resources.  Doubtless the Minister of State would argue that resources are inadequate for everything and that choices must be made.  However, I urge the centrality of guidance counselling to education in the widest sense and to the development of young people to enable them make the type of choices which will ensure that they are as successful as possible and that they provide to employers the quality of service required, whether it be in the private or public sector.</P>
    <P>I do not want to confine this debate to the schools.  A great advantage of the National Guidance Forum is that it is equally concerned with guidance for adults and that it regards guidance as part of a life long experience.  Learning is increasingly becoming life long.  Our rhetoric probably still runs ahead of our practice in responding to the reality of this, but if the rhetoric is going in the right direction that will pull the practice after it in due course.  It is important, therefore, that the right rhetoric emanates from Government and from all <Col N="2249" /> those who can influence public perceptions.</P>
    <P>People are going to be changing jobs frequently, which historically we have equated with losing jobs.  When I look at my own graduates &mdash; a privileged group &mdash; who may be five to eight years out of university, three points come to mind.  First, most of them are in good jobs as far as conventional criteria apply.  Second, very few of them would have predicted they would have been in that job on graduation.  Third, most of them would have been in at least one other job, and often two other jobs in the five or six years after graduating and before their present job.  They are searching, which may be a good thing up to a point.  Given the level of counselling available and the plethora of both jobs and courses, they are inevitably making their choices on the basis of limited information.</P>
    <P>While one never has access to perfect information, there is a better balance to be struck.  Anything that can be done to encourage the type of commitment this forum has shown is to be welcomed.  I am not seeking resources, indeed the forum's independence is a major factor in its favour.  Nevertheless, a contribution towards achieving its aims can be made by public figures and politicians taking cognisance of its work and encouraging the wider public to appreciate the importance of what it is endeavouring to achieve.  It is a process and not an event.  It is not a response to any perceived instant crisis, but it is an important part of the type of society and economy we are striving to become in as efficient and humane a manner as possible for all those involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  It is praiseworthy to raise this issue at this time, especially when we are about to commence negotiations on the successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  The number of career changes that the normal person <Col N="2250" /> will now undertake in the course of a working life &mdash; there could be six or seven &mdash; is central to the motion.  It raises the need to look at the issue under discussion.</P>
      <P>When I decided on my career the prevailing view was that one took a course, adopted a career and stayed in it until pensionable age.  To paraphrase the famous words of Louis MacNiece, one was expected to sit on one's unmentionable for 40 years and hang one's hat on a pension.  That time has changed, and because of this pensions have become an important part of the advice which young people should get.  People should be required to look after their pensions arrangements for every year worked.</P>
      <P>For decades the job of career guidance counsellors was to match a student with a job.  This is still happening; but it is no longer enough and it is often the wrong thing to do for a young person, who may be directed towards the wrong career having undergone the various tests which measure career suitability.  I take the simple view that most people can do most jobs.  It is wrong, closes down options and creates a sense of dissatisfaction and underachievement if people fail in the pursuit of a career they were advised to take up.  It is better to tell people that they can do many different jobs.</P>
      <P>The world is now such that it is difficult to do any job for longer than ten years.  We need, therefore, to encourage flexibility.  This will be difficult for those pursuing an educational path that arrives at the points system.  The points system is useful for enabling people to get from second to third level by engaging in the correct regurgitation of a body of fact.  However, it will not allow for flexibility, which is the key issue.  If I am to employ somebody I will look for flexibility, enthusiasm and energy.  In addition, I would only employ or recommend people who have potential, which is the greatest quality in terms of finding employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2251" /> The job of the career guidance counsellor is to find peoples' potential, to explain that their potential can be fulfilled in a wide variety of directions and to encourage them to try them.  As Senator Lee remarked, a person may attempt two or three careers over several years.  Being in my late forties I have difficulty in coming to terms with this concept.  I have a lack of confidence in telling young people whom I know well to change and take up different jobs because my upbringing was in the opposite direction.  I have had to force myself to change.</P>
    <P>With change and flexibility the job of the counsellor becomes most attractive because of what it can do to improve the quality of peoples' lives.  Perhaps for the first time ever we can now have a generation of successful young people, whether they be involved in enterprise, services, the professions or a mixture. People will learn how to be flexible and will therefore balance their time between their professional, leisure and domestic lives.  Most in this House came through the previous system and are workaholics.  Many of us should be ashamed of the number of hours we consider it correct to work to be successful in a career.  It is something that can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Why is this issue important?  The best answer to that is to ask what is the shelf life of a degree in engineering or physics? People have come up with answers, but the one which comes closest to my position, and which bothers the people who pay most of my salary, is the shelf life of a teaching degree.  There is something wrong if teachers are doing the same job now as they did when one could not cash a cheque in a bank at lunch time, it took four people to drive a bus and one could not buy a suit on a Sunday.  This element of change must be included in the lives of people in whatever area.  It must be recognised that no degree or qualification has a 40 year <Col N="2252" /> shelf life and that it must change in order to reflect the needs of the people being served, helped or supported.  This aspect is crucial.</P>
    <P>I spoke recently to the head of a multinational corporation about this issue.  The company has many people in marketing and specific engineering areas and I was delighted when he said it had reached the conclusion that it is better off employing people with a good general degree who have indicated flexibility and a capability to change and move.  He said the company has no difficulty if it gets a bright person who can do the job it wants after two months training.  It is much more interested in somebody who can do this five years later than a person who is an expert in a specific area, such as the brightness of light, but who will be out of touch in a short period and may have to hide behind the quality of their degree.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to deal with change because people are told that if something is not broken it should not be fixed.  Other put downs are that one should take it easy and do nothing or that somebody is too busy.  People often say something cannot be done because it is against policy or it would establish a precedent.  We should strive to have a generation of young people managing industry, services and professions in the future who will take just one decision, that as long as they are in charge, the only decisions they want to make are those which create a precedent; other decisions can be taken by somebody down the line.  This would ensure an unbeatable economy and country.</P>
    <P>We need a challenging and sceptical group of young people to emerge from the educational system.  We do not need them to be passive and accepting but questioning, challenging, sceptical and ready to adopt and embrace change. Not every fad becomes the road, but people must stand in the middle of the field and decide whether proposals should be blocked, diverted, changed or <Col N="2253" /> implemented.  This is why counsellors are required and I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion, which is obviously supported on all sides because a Government amendment has not been moved.  It is an interesting motion from my point of view because I taught in a post-primary school for a number of years.  I value the guidance system with which I was involved for many years.  Its value in schools cannot be overestimated.</P>
      <P>Given the upbringing and crowded lifestyles of young people nowadays, many people would consider that they are more mature than children in the past.  However, the reverse is the case. Psychologists tell me that young people nowadays are much less mature than we were at that age.  Initially I found this difficult to accept because, given the experiences of children now in comparison to my barren childhood, I thought they would be much more mature at 17 than I was at that age.  However, psychologists tell me that is not the case and a good guidance system in schools is essential.  Youngsters need help to make crucial decisions about their future, particularly in that type of milieu where life is crowded and they do not have a chance to assess and discover themselves. The guidance systems in schools try to provide that assistance.</P>
      <P>Another interesting aspect of the motion is that Senator Lee is not screaming for resources.  When motions are moved by the Opposition or people who are not on the Government side&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they usually scream for resources for various organisations. However, that is not the case in this motion and I am surprised and happy. Senator Lee said support for the forum and recognition that it exists and is beneficial <Col N="2254" /> to the community is required at present rather than financial resources.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole would agree that collegiality is important in schools. When one is working as part of a team in a school, mixing with people who teach the same subject, collegiality assists one's personal development and the fertilisation of ideas.  It brings about better workmanship and teaching. Career guidance teachers are often isolated because in many cases they are the only ones working in that area.  They do not have opportunities to exchange ideas in the same way as other teachers. This is why I was most impressed with the work of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors over the years.</P>
      <P>The institute was established in the early 1970s and produces useful literature for teachers.  Its annual report is interesting and the forum is an offshoot of the institute.  I understand somebody in the institute suggested the establishment of the forum, and it is not before time.  Although schools are at the heart of communities, teachers tend to spend their time working in the mainstream and are often isolated.  Opportunities for cross fertilisation between important non educational organisations in community life do not happen because people are too busy.  This is why the forum is such a good idea.</P>
      <P>FÁS, ISME and other important organisations are involved in the forum and this provides a wonderful opportunity for guidance teachers to discover what makes things tick in industry and the massive problems with which FÁS is trying to cope.  It provides overviews and pushes back the frontiers for teachers.  It helps them to be better guidance counsellors.  FÁS is also involved in the guidance area and I am impressed by the effects of the community employment scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know people who were wandering along aimlessly in life, who did not have jobs, drew the dole each week and had no motivation.  However, their lives <Col N="2255" /> have changed following their involvement in a community employment scheme and the chance to assess their value in life, which is essential in terms of their input to society if they had a job.  They were motivated by the experience. If that happened a dozen times in 12 months it would justify the huge amount of money that is spent on it.  We should support the National Guidance Forum.  I note that the Department of Education supports it and one of its senior psychologists sits on the forum. That is an indication of the value the Department attaches to the forum and I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on that.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Lee and Senator O'Toole for the opportunity to discuss this.  I have a better insight now into what the forum is trying to achieve than I had this morning.  We should try to let people know what it is about and what it is trying to achieve, and we will be all the better for it in the end.</P>

      <P>It is nice to hear us all singing the same song.  This is a worthwhile motion although when I saw it last week I asked what is the National Guidance Forum.  Being a guidance counsellor I asked my colleagues the same question, they did not know.  I went to FÁS and they did not know.  I went to Léargas and they had an idea.  I went to the Institute of Guidance Counsellors and members of the officer board did not know.</P>

      <P>The forum started about 18 months ago.  It was a tentative arrangement mooted by the Institute of Guidance Counsellors because of the overlap which existed with so many bodies offering career guidance.  The forum has met a few times.  It is not State funded and meets at different venues, for example, the Léargas office.</P>
      <P>Nobody seems to know what it has done so far.  No minutes have been kept. There are no terms of reference so it is really a talking shop but I do not know what they talk about.  It is important that the forum has terms of reference and that it percolates through the system so that guidance counsellors understand that it may eventually have teeth and so we can exchange views on how best it can be used to improve the system.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the role of the guidance counsellor and I am very pleased to see that role expanding.  I did not know there were so many areas that I was not dealing with.  What is guidance counselling?  It is vocational and educational guidance and it is counselling. It should start in primary school so as to give children an opportunity to look at themselves in terms of their interests and what they are good at.  We do not have such a guidance system until second level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In second level schools guidance counselling is a developmental process. At each stage of a children's development their achievements, aptitudes and interests are assessed in whatever way possible to give each child an overview of its self image.  Self images keep changing no matter what age we are and need to be re-evaluated at different stages in our lives.  I would hope that my role as a guidance counsellor would be <Col N="2257" /> to educate and prepare children for a way of life rather than for a specific job.</P>
    <P>With the rate of change that is taking place today that role is becoming more important.  Look at the many changes that have taken place in second level education.  We have three different leaving certificate programmes; academic, vocational and applied.  In all of this there is a role for the guidance counsellor to prepare young people to the best of their ability for a particular job, for a way of life or for third level education. This is not an easy task.  For example, a single guidance counsellor may have six leaving certificate classes and is supposed to educate each one for a way of life.</P>
    <P>However, what happens after the leaving certificate?  There are post-leaving certificate programmes.  The link with FÁS overlaps so considerably at this stage that half way through a programme one might discover that FÁS is doing the same one.  Guidance should form part of the FÁS programmes but that does not happen.</P>
    <P>Some of those who may be long-term unemployed may return to education. These people need adult guidance and this is where the crux arises.  There is little or no structure for dealing with those who wish to return to work.  There should be links with the national forum but I would prefer to see a local or regionalised forum to begin with.  These could then be linked through a national policy.  The best interests of students is served by co-ordinating schools, FÁS, NRB, adult education programmes and VTOS programmes at local level.  Such an approach would enable us to see how we could facilitate the flow of information from the schools to third level institutions and to employers.</P>
    <P>I did a little research into apprenticeships and I would like to make one criticism. This is a golden opportunity that should not be missed.  Two and a half percent of school leavers were absorbed into an apprenticeship in the last year. <Col N="2258" /> Are the employers involved in the national forum?  What are the employers doing for young people coming out of school?  There is something wrong when young people who want to work and want to get into an apprenticeship cannot avail of the opportunity that FÁS is talking about.</P>
    <P>The national forum is a welcome concept but I would prefer to see it localised. After 18 months it needs to be more structured.  I would like to think that minutes will be kept and that they will percolate through to guidance counsellors and FÁS.  I would like the public to know what is going on.  Those who are in transition from school to third level education and those who come back into the education system need guidance.</P>
    <P>I hope we can return to this issue. This is a voluntary organisation.  I am not asking the Minister to do anything about it but the motion seeks to facilitate public awareness.  Concerns have been expressed about the huge change taking place in education and the adult world.  The huge range of careers and jobs which exist mean we need guidance and counselling now more than ever, not just up to leaving certificate level but throughout people's entire life span. I would welcome another opportunity next year to discuss this forum and to see how far down the road we have gone as a result of this discussion.</P>

    <P>Senator Lee told us he did not expect a confrontational debate, which is how it has worked out so far.  I sometimes tend to be confrontational, as the Senator can be, but even I would have difficulty being confrontational about a statement such as &ldquo;Many people are dissatisfied with their jobs&rdquo;.  I am not dissatisfied with my job.  When I get up in <Col N="2259" /> the morning I say how lucky I am to be doing a job which I always wanted to do &mdash; and did for a number of years without any financial recompense.  I am lucky to have a challenging job but I know I am not typical in that respect. The Senator said that we are asking children to make choices at an increasingly younger age, which we are.  I also find it difficult to be confrontational about that statement.  He then said that he was not looking for resources, and I find it difficult to be confrontational about that.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole spoke about the number of career changes people now make in their working life, which makes it more necessary to have guidance counselling.  He put so much emphasis on career changes that I began to wonder if he was about to make a major announcement which would shock the political and educational world, particularly in view of the announcements made by so many of our colleagues in recent weeks.  However, he rather disappointed me by leaving without making an announcement -perhaps he forgot.  Apart from that, I found it difficult to find anything confrontational in what he said.</P>
      <P>Rather surprisingly, I did not find anything confrontational in what Senator Cotter or Senator Ormonde said.  However, it struck me that Senator Ormonde made so many telephone calls in order to find out what this issue was about that Telecom Éireann must have made some money, which I welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my pleasure to welcome the establishment of the National Guidance Forum.  It provides for a gathering together of all who have an interest in guidance, whether as consumers or providers. The members of the forum come from a wide variety of backgrounds but <Col N="2260" /> share a common vision.  They seek to inform themselves of the key issues in guidance and counselling at present, to discuss their implications and to share ideas.  I have no doubt of the value of such opportunities for discussion and debate.  The chosen method of my Department in preparing for the publication of the White Paper on Education was to convene a National Convention on Education, consisting of all the interested parties.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, my Department issued to all schools a document entitled <i>Guidelines for the Practice of Guidance and Counselling in Schools.</i>  The first sentence in this document states &ldquo;In the course of their lives, people are faced with the need to make significant decisions that affect both themselves and those around them&rdquo;.  It goes on to define guidance broadly as the full range of interventions which assist people to make such choices about their lives.</P>
    <P>As the motion states, our society, including our education system and the labour market, is going through a period of unprecedented change.  Security of work is no longer guaranteed; it is no longer the case that young people finish their formal schooling and proceed to a career which they will follow for the rest of their lives.  Effective guidance will be essential if people are to respond flexibly to these changes in society and the economy.  The establishment of the National Guidance Forum recognises that guidance counselling is a lifelong process.</P>
    <P>Indeed, 1996 is the European Year of Lifelong Learning and at the end of June a national conference on that theme took place in Dublin Castle.  During the Minister's opening speech she stated that formal schooling is only the first stage in the process of lifelong learning and she stressed the importance of the provision of guidance and counselling at every stage of that process. This will mean that guidance may <Col N="2261" /> be provided for the same person by a variety of agencies and Departments at different stages in her or his life.  If each person is to receive a coherent, lifelong programme of guidance, then co-ordination and communication between the agencies involved is vital.</P>
    <P>The important role of guidance is also recognised in the Operational Programme for Human Resources Development 1994-99 of the European Union.  This programme supports guidance provision in more than one Department.  In the training of trainers programme of the Department of Education, the improvement of career guidance is one of six objectives.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak now in more detail about guidance in education, as it provides the basis for all guidance which follows.  The work of the guidance counsellor in education encompasses more than vocational guidance.  The model favoured has always been a developmental one which includes educational, social and personal guidance.  Guidance counsellors in schools are, of course, affected by changes in society.  They are, to an increasing extent, preparing young people for unemployment as well as for employment and dealing with more serious social and emotional problems than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The school guidance committee convened by my Department summarised guidance in education thus:</P>
    <P>Guidance and counselling is grounded in the recognition of individual differences.  It recognises and respects the dignity and worth of each individual and seeks to individualise the student within the school situation.</P>
    <P>Guidance in education is, in fact, an essential facet of most of the aims outlined in the White Paper on Education, <i>Charting our Education Future.</i>  I shall mention, in particular, the vocationalisation of the curriculum, the school plan, especially in relation to health promotion, <Col N="2262" /> and the greater involvement of the partners in education.</P>
    <P>It is my Department's policy that vocational education should be integrated within the programmes offered in schools.  The reform of the senior cycle is now being implemented.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has been specifically requested to increase, where relevant, the vocational orientation of each subject available at leaving certificate level.  This will help to ensure the relevance of subjects to the needs of students.  Work on the revision of syllabuses is continuing.</P>
    <P>In addition to the established leaving certificate programme, students are now offered the chance to engage in three new curricular programmes, each of which contains elements of vocational education.  Transition year is a year long programme between the junior certificate and the beginning of leaving certificate. Because there is no formal examination at the end of transition year, more time can be allocated to guidance. Transition year students can be helped to review and to reflect on their past performance in school and to take appropriate remedial action, if necessary. They have the opportunity to explore their aptitudes and interests and to sample different subjects so that they make more informed educational choices. Preparation for work is facilitated through the provision of work shadowing, work simulation and work placement and through the acquisition of job-search skills.  Community work is also a feature of transition year.</P>
    <P>The leaving certificate applied is a self-contained programme aimed at preparing students for adult and working life.  It concentrates on forms of achievement which have not previously been recognised by the established leaving certificate.  The programme has three main strands.  Some 30 per cent of the time is devoted to general education, 30 per cent to vocational education and 25 <Col N="2263" /> per cent to vocational preparation.  The vocational education strand is concerned with the development of skills required by various sectors of the labour market.  All students following this programme are required to study information technology, the arts and leisure and recreation.</P>
    <P>The vocational preparation strand includes preparation for work, work experience, enterprise education and communications.  The third programme, the leaving certificate vocational programme, strengthens the vocational dimension of the leaving certificate by linking subjects into vocational groupings which students take.  In addition, all students must take three link modules on enterprise education, preparation for work and work experience.</P>
    <P>Preparation of these programmes has involved teachers in new ways of working, for which they have been helped by an extensive programme of career development.  Teamwork is essential, not only within the school but between the school and employers, parents and community agencies.  I envisage the National Guidance Forum as an important focus for discussions between all the interested parties on the practical issues raised by the vocationalisation of the curriculum.</P>
    <P>Chapters 12 and 13 of the White Paper on Education deal with the school plan and with the role of the school in promoting health and well being.  They show that guidance is not an optional extra service, but is rather an integral part of the education offered by each school and college.  An effective guidance service functions in a proactive way, developing programmes which promote physical and mental health and which therefore help to prevent the occurrence of personal crises in the majority of students.  Examples of such programmes are the substance abuse prevention programme, the health promoting school network, and the <Col N="2264" /> relationships and sexuality education programme.</P>
    <P>Guidance counsellors have been involved in the development of these programmes, and many of them are now trainers of their colleagues in their use. The effect has been an increase in the network of teachers who are becoming involved in the provision of guidance. This means that trained guidance counsellors should be able to develop a somewhat different role than previously, becoming fully integrated in the core work of the school, acting as specialist resource people for their colleagues, and being able to devote more time to those students who unfortunately face personal crises.</P>
    <P>The guidance counsellor has the responsibility of working alongside the principal, the board of management, parents and the community to develop a school plan for guidance.  This will involve examination, among other things, of the resources available both in the school and the community, the options being offered at senior cycle, and any programmes of social, personal and health education being used in the school.  The result should be a coherent, developmental plan of guidance without unnecessary duplication and repetition, but allowing for reinforcement and revisiting for those students who may need extra help.  Again, I see the National Guidance Forum as having valuable potential to contribute to this process.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the greater involvement in recent times of parents and the community in the educational system has been most beneficial.  In guidance, it is accepted that one of the most important influences on young people who are making career choices is their parents.  The involvement of the National Parents' Council in the National Guidance Forum is therefore most welcome.  I have received within the past days the report of a joint project of the Petra II Action Programme <Col N="2265" /> of the European Union, led jointly by Ireland and Belgium, entitled <i>The Role of Parents in Guidance.</i>  This report includes materials and suggestions which I know will be of practical use in schools.</P>
    <P>As resources have permitted, the support made available for guidance in education has been increased.  Each year, my Department allocates £13 million for guidance provision in schools.  In 1995, the Minister established the National Centre for Guidance in Education as the agency to produce relevant material and resources, to support guidance practitioners, and to provide for the exchange of information within and outside the country.  The centre has produced a report entitled <i>Guidelines for the Practice of Guidance and Counselling in Schools.</i>  Its representatives are working with representatives of my Department to examine how the report may best be implemented.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister has sanctioned the creation of 100 additional guidance posts in second level schools during 1995, given additional resources for programmes of training in guidance counselling in the constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland, embarked upon a programme of phased expansion of the schools psychological service to primary schools, initiated a pilot project which involves the appointment of teaching counsellors to a number of primary schools in areas designated as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The achievement of integration between the guidance counselling service in the educational system and that provided at later stages is an important challenge.  It is vital that it should be achieved if every person in our society is to have access, at all the crucial stages of development, to effective guidance, without unnecessary duplication and without omissions.  It is essential that the Government Departments concerned should liaise with one another in order to achieve this aim, and they do. <Col N="2266" /> However, it is equally important that there be opportunities for guidance practitioners from the various sectors to meet face to face and to work on the practical implications.  The National Guidance Forum provides this opportunity.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned that guidance provision should support and capitalise on measures which have been put in place to promote equality by increasing access to further education and training for people with disabilities, for young people who have become disaffected with the educational system and for people who feel debarred from particular career options by stereotyped views of what is appropriate for them. Such measures can only be effective in the context of an integrated approach between practitioners of guidance in education and training and in the labour market, and between formal and non-formal sources of guidance.  I welcome the participation of bodies such as the National Rehabilitation Board and the Youth Information Monitoring Committee in the National Guidance Forum.</P>
    <P>There is a general acceptance now that it is appropriate to demand quality standards and value for money from all groups of professional workers.  Quality issues for the consumers of guidance services must be addressed.  The National Guidance Forum has the potential to include all the guidance services provided through a person's life. Most importantly, it also includes representatives of the consumers.  This should make it possible to institute longitudinal studies of the effectiveness of guidance and to share knowledge about evaluation procedures.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to thank the Senators who have already participated in this debate.  It has been a valuable debate and I thank the Senators for the work they have put into preparation for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate. Let me tell you about the company in which I work.  A supermarket is a big operation.  The manager of a typical supermarket has 200 people employed, 700 to 800 items in stock and up to 20,000 customers each week.  We have found in our search for a manager that traditional methods of recruitment did not always apply.  The talents or abilities that he or she had were not necessarily measured in the traditional leaving certificate examination.  The driving force behind career guidance is that people have different talents and abilities and these must be matched with careers for them to pursue.  This thinking is reasonably new and was not recognised as an important element of education until recently.</P>
      <P>I am chairman of the steering committee under the National Council of Curriculum and Assessment of the new leaving certificate applied.  I have learned much in the past few years because career guidance has a central role in that examination.  In the past it was assumed that in order to get a good job a student had to have a good traditional leaving certificate.  When a job involves managing 200 people and 20,000 customers you need an ability to communicate which is not necessarily measured by two years of leaving certificate study and a three hour written examination at the end of that. Oral communication is the ability needed to run that operation.  It is more important than written communication and, yet the traditional leaving certificate does not measure oral communication except in language subjects. Career guidance as it applies to the leaving certificate applied recognises different talents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The American professor Howard Gardiner who speaks about and writes on this subject came to Ireland and addressed the committee last year.  He refers to skills and talents as &ldquo;intelligences.&rdquo; Oral communication is <Col N="2268" /> another form of intelligence.  The Irish mindset has to be changed to recognise that there are other careers suitable for people that are not necessarily measured by either the traditional leaving certificate or university degrees.  I am enthusiastic about the changes taking place in secondary education, particularly because career guidance plays a central role in it.  Senator Lee's proposal welcomes the establishment of a National Guidance Forum because it enhances public consciousness of the importance of career guidance and I welcome this.</P>
    <P>The career guidance aspect of the leaving certificate applied recognises that jobs are not for life.  It tries to steer students in the right direction and teaches them the skill of how to learn. Have they the ability to learn because they will have to learn over and over again during their careers?  Are they good at teamwork?  Can they work with other people?  It measures their ability to interact with the community but, more importantly, it includes work experience as part of their leaving certificate. Assessment takes place during the two years, not at the end, and it measures their ability to participate in work.  It is not only geared to preparing students for work but also prepares them for life.  Career guidance will take that into account when steering someone in the right direction because an individual has other skills, talents and &ldquo;intelligences&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is essential that career guidance has a central role in education.  The developments which the Minister introduced, for example, different forms of the leaving certificate and the transition year, will take us a long way towards preparing people for work and life.  This motion draws our attention to the importance of career guidance and raises public consciousness.  The Minister has taken this into account and I wish these developments well.  In future years the nation will look back and recognise that this was a step in the right direction.  Senator Lee said that this was <Col N="2269" /> one of the few proposals for which he was not seeking funds.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire agus roimh an tairiscint seo.  This is an issue about which I have had a great deal of concern.  When my children started school, I realised my concerns were groundless in many ways. I have been invited by local schools to talk to girls about the need to be flexible when they are planning their career.  I am in my fifth career and I was asked by a student at the end of one talk if I has stopped changing careers.  I said that I had no intention of doing so and that I would try a few more before I revert to the invalid bed.  We must instil in pupils the need to be flexible in their approach to life and what they can do given their abilities.  The guidance counsellor has a dual role, guidance and counselling, and although the two are interlocked, there is a slight difference. If somebody fulfilling that role moves completely into the area of guidance, they could push a person in a particular direction.  On the other hand, if a counsellor soaks up the concerns and worries most teenagers have without offering guidance, we run into difficulties.  In many ways guidance and counselling is a marriage of abilities in terms of talking to pupils, assessing their abilities and giving them a gentle push in one direction or another or, as the case may be, not to push them because children often make up their own minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the National Guidance Forum recognises the role of parents.  In the past the role of guidance counsellor was filled by parents who have an enormous <Col N="2270" /> influence on their children's career decisions.  I am reminded of the joke about Munster mothers who hit their children on the head and tell them to go to Dublin to get a job in the Civil Service.  That was the traditional form of guidance in many homes.  A job in the Civil Service, a job for life with a pension, or teaching, nursing, the Garda or the bank were the apex of one's ambitions.  One did not have a good job if one did not fall into those categories. Thankfully, we have a more enlightened view of careers and opportunities available now.</P>
    <P>Parents and guidance counsellors enable children to build up their self-esteem and confidence, get them to make decisions, take on responsibilities and realise that they can make a change. Because one makes a decision at 19 years of age, does not mean one is stuck with it.  Life is a learning experience and we can learn new skills and move on to a different career.  Empowerment is very important.</P>
    <P>I see the guidance counsellor not as someone extra to whom one sends problem children but as someone with a central role in the school.  His or her advice should be sought by all teachers who, as Senator Cotter said, should work together as a team.  Career guidance should not be seen as an extra service outside the curriculum but as an essential part of the role played by the school.</P>
    <P>The Minister's role in providing different forms of certification falls into that area.  It is a move away from the inflexible attitude which existed in the past that one had to have the leaving certificate and without it one would go nowhere.  That did not take into account the range of abilities which Senator Quinn needs in his employees.  We are beginning to realise people have many abilities or, as he said, intelligences which are not measured by the leaving certificate.  That issue must be dealt at some stage.</P>
    <P>I would like to tell a story about a wealthy man who arrived in a hospital after a car crash.  He could not sign the admission form because he could not <Col N="2271" /> write.  The nurse admitting him said: &ldquo;You are a wealthy man but you cannot write.  If you could read and write, what would you have done?&rdquo;  The man replied: &ldquo;I would have been cleaning the toilets in the hospital.&rdquo;  The nurse was taken aback.  He proceeded to tell her that when he applied for the job as caretaker he did not qualify because he could not read and write but he went on to make a fortune.  The skills he needed to amass that fortune were not those he would have learned in school.  That is not to downgrade education but to highlight the narrowness of the curriculum in the past.  I hope the Minister continues her good work in support of guidance counsellors.</P>

I acknowledge the use of the Seanad in dealing with an issue on which we have much to say.  I will look at the debate to see if there are indications of change.

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí a thug óráidí agus don Aire as ucht a cuirtéis agus as ucht an méid atá ráite aici.  I thank the Minister for covering both Chambers this evening.  It occurs to me, having listened to the discussion, that I should have taken a little more time to introduce the forum and its origins.  I understand it emerged from an initiative by Fr. John Dunne at a meeting in January of last year at which people from different organisations were present.  It has brought together several partners, including IBEC and the ICTU, which were not mentioned hitherto.  They have met six times and are compiling a directory <Col N="2272" /> of services.  It is sensible to begin by trying to identify what is available and what is going on.  The reasons for coming together were the sense of duplication or overlapping and the gaps which were not being serviced.  These are time consuming activities.</P>
      <P>The one emphasis in Senator Ormonde's speech I would query &mdash; she made a valuable contribution &mdash; is that when voluntary bodies come together, and we know how difficult it can be to get two bodies, together much less a cluster of bodies, it is important they establish an atmosphere of mutual trust and that they go at their own pace initially.  This facilitates more rapid advance subsequently than if somebody appears to be trying to force the pace for a particular agenda.  This then facilitates a more rapid advance subsequently than if somebody appears to be trying to force the pace for a particular agenda, because where there are potential conflicting interests or turf wars, it is vitally important that guidance counsellors should be inculcating the teamwork of which we all spoke.  It is something which they demonstrate in the way they co-ordinate their activities. I would have said that they had gone at just the right pace for them at this particular stage.  I agree it would be worthwhile to return next year to ask what has happened in the intervening year to take the progress further and see what has occurred.  They ought to be encouraged and thanked for their initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It so happens that we are all singing the same song.  My concern is that we should sing it louder and it should be heard more clearly outside.  I say that for a number of reasons.  We are very conscious of the changing world of work and life and of change as an integral part of the type of world into which young people are emerging, and the Minister's paper refers to that clearly. Many parents are not yet alert to that and one can see it in the response of parents to their child's leaving certificate results.  If a child does not get a particular result, somehow they are failures <Col N="2273" /> and they are branded for life as such because they did not achieve the objective which the parent had marked out based on the parent's recollections of the appropriate career path of their own generation.  It is vitally important to break down that barrier between generations and change that cast of mind in the face of changing realities.  That is one reason raising consciousness about these matters is important for both parents and children.</P>
    <P>I will run through the paper and pick out a few points, some of which I want to respond to positively.  It talks about ensuring the relevance of subjects to the needs of students.  If there are two words in the entire vocabulary of Her Majesty's English which disturb the normal tranquility of my temperment, they are the words &ldquo;relevance&rdquo; and &ldquo;needs&rdquo;. I am not of course opposed to relevance. Who could possibly be opposed to relevance?  It is like being against virtue. Nor am I opposed to needs.  They exist, but who decides and on what critieria does one decide what needs are at any given moment and what is relevant to those needs at that particular moment?  &ldquo;Relevant to needs&rdquo; is a facade which simply pushes the thought process one stage further back and obliges one to ask what one really means by it.  In particular, where we accept we are in a stream, if not a torrent, of change, where young people have 50 or 60 years ahead of them, how far ahead can we anticipate needs, what is relevant to this particular moment or to our capacity to see a few years ahead if, that is possible?  How are we to determine what is relevant to the totality of their needs over their entire lifespan?</P>
    <P>However, I was mollified on reflection when Senator Quinn stressed that the essence of education at all levels, vocational leaving certificate, traditional leaving certificate and university, is not what to learn but how to learn, because that is a need which is relevant throughout the entire 60 years.  I agree entirely with him.  That is the essence of really good teaching.  I always tell my history <Col N="2274" /> students in first year that I will not teach them what to think historically, but if I had not succeeded in teaching them how to think historically it is because I am a failure, they are a failure or both.  If that is what is meant by the paper, I am in entire agreement with it.  Otherwise, I go very cold when I hear &ldquo;relevant to needs&rdquo; as an educational philosophy unless one explains what one means by needs &mdash; whose needs, what timespan, how far ahead, etc.?  It is a shorthand which can frequently conceal more than it actually reveals.  However, the Minister sees how graciously I have withdrawn the original implied rebuke.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks of the importance of the work of the guidance counsellors becoming integrated with the core work of the school.  That is exactly the objective of a great number of this evening's contributions, and we would be entirely in agreement with her on that matter.  It is a question of chipping away at it and ensuring it happens.  When she talks about the guidance counsellor having the responsibility of working alongside the principal, parents and the community, that is the crucial issue, because of course parents are traditionally central to pupils' choices.  What do we now find in the period of change?  I must add that much of the change is positive; I am an enthusiast for change, by and large. We find a generation of parents who, unlike their children, have not had access to education.  Parents, however well intentioned, will in many cases through no fault of their own be in no position to advise their children on their choice of the 3,000 courses on offer at third level, for instance.  How on earth are they to decide how to advise on such matters?</P>
    <P>In a sense, many parents are and feel marooned by the pace of change in education. They are looking around for good advice.  I saw the Minister's later reference to providing extra resources for disadvantaged areas, etc.  Where we find that guidance counsellors must, in a sense, cope with the parents as well as with the children of those parents who come from very disadvantaged backgrounds <Col N="2275" /> and are the victims of society at large and not simply of the school they attend, different skills may be required in certain cases for counselling pupils and counselling their parents.  That is where I would see scope for co-ordination and co-operation between counsellors who come from different backgrounds and organisations.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde said she would like to see local development precede national developments.  I would be an enthusiastic advocate of local developments because that is where it must happen; but I would not see them as mutually exclusive, and I am sure she would not either, because if there is no sense of direction from the national organisations it is very difficult for people at local level to subsititute their own individual sense of direction for a vacuum at the top.  These must be coordinated and they are mutually supportive rather than mutually exclusive.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's list of additional posts, etc.  All those steps are very worthwhile.  I thank her for them and I appreciate them.  Her comments on training for people with disabilities and guidance counselling are welcome as is the emphasis on the integrated approach between practitioners.</P>
    <P>There is a slight hint throughout the paper of Government, agencies and Departments as if they are the driving forces.  I am not saying the Minister intends this but, this is as it comes across in terms of the tonalities.  She talks of the National Guidance Forum having a useful role to play in implementation.  I would say it has a useful role to play in conceptualising and injecting ideas as well as simply implementing policy decided elsewhere.  It seems it is very much a parallel body and not in any way subordinate to the formation of policy by Departments, etc.  Again, the degree of co-ordination between official policy and voluntary organisations is a test of our capacity for co-operation and co-ordination.</P>
    <P>This paper emanates from the Department of Education and, therefore, <Col N="2276" /> rightly focuses on the guidance counsellors in the schools, but this motion stresses the lifelong learning aspect of the matter.  I know, as I said in my introduction, that we are well ahead on the rhetorical and reality stakes in implementing the philosophy of lifelong learning; but it seems the need for effective guidance counselling for adults in terms of the range of career changes and adjusting from job loss to new jobs, if the unemployment problem can be contained, is an equally important aspect of the activity.  Part of the role of the job of the forum is to blend education in the formal sense and the advice and counselling for adults.</P>
    <P>This both imposes enormous responsibilities and offers enormous challenges and opportunities to guidance counsellors.  They must keep abreast of the change, of which they are a part.  Therefore, an integral part of guidance counsellors' ability to discharge their responsibilities effectively is their having the opportunity to continuously re-educate themselves for the changes occurring.  Guidance counsellors must be at the heart of returning to education, in-service training, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to <Col N="2277" /> raise this matter.  I also thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to listen to the case I shall make.  I hope he will give a positive response to my arguments and that he will be convinced that the regulations must be amended as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Sections 18 to 23 of Part IV of the Local Government and Development Regulations specify in great detail the documentation which must accompany a planning application.  I will quote briefly from the sections concerned. Section 18(1)(f) states:</P>
      <P>A planning application shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>be accompanied by four copies of a location map, to a scale of not less than 1:10,560 (which shall be indicated thereon) and marked or coloured so as to identify clearly the land or structure to which the application relates and the boundaries thereof.</P>
      <P>Section 23(1) states:</P>
      <P>Plans and drawings and maps accompanying a planning application shall comply with the following requirements&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) site or layout plans shall be drawn to a scale of not less than 1:500 (which shall be indicated thereon), the site boundary shall be clearly delineated in colour, and buildings, roads, boundaries, septic tanks and percolation areas, bored wells and other features in the vicinity of the land or structure to which the application relates shall be shown,</P>
      <P>(b) other plans, elevations and sections shall be drawn to a scale of not less than 1:100, which shall be indicated thereon,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e) plans and drawings of floor plans, elevations and sections shall indicate in figures the principal dimensions (including overall height) of any proposed structure <Col N="2278" /> and the distances of any such structure from the boundaries of the site.</P>
    <P>The extracts from which I quoted make it clear that there is no room for flexibility or discretion on the part of planning authorities in relation to the documentation which must be provided so that an application for planning permission will be valid.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with this level of documentation being required when a planning application relates to a substantial development.  The problem is that the same level of documentation is required whether the proposed development is large or small, major or minor. For example, the regulations do not differentiate between an application for planning permission for a large apartment block in a major urban area and an application for a cattle pen in a remote rural area.  I believe they should differentiate in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the regulations specify a range of developments which are exempt but not all minor developments are exempt.  For some technical reason, certain developments which could be described as minor or non-substantial are required to have planning permission. In the case of such developments, the applicant is required to provide the elaborate documentation to which I referred.  This can involve considerable cost to and hardship on the applicant.</P>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of the 1994 regulations, in the case of minor or non-substantial developments the planning authority in my area was prepared to accept plans and drawings which, although not professionally prepared and perhaps not drawn to scale, clearly showed the nature and extent of the proposed development.  I am sure this also obtained in other planning authorities. However, since the introduction of these regulations, the planning authorities will no longer accept plans, drawings <Col N="2279" /> or maps unless they fully comply with the terms of the regulations.  I will provide a number of examples to illustrate the difficulties caused on the ground.</P>
    <P>I recently became aware of an elderly person in poor health and living alone who applied for and was approved for a disabled person's housing grant.  The grant was provided in order that the individual could install bathroom and toilet facilities.  The applicant lives in a rural cottage and, because the work involved the building of a small extension and the provision of a septic tank, they were notified that planning permission was required and work on the provision of the facilities could not commence until such permission was obtained.  Before the 1994 planning regulations came into force, the builder carrying out the work or myself would have provided plans or drawings for the person which would have been acceptable to the planning authority for the purpose of obtaining planning permission. However, this is no longer the case.  It transpired that it would cost the person in question £400 to obtain the maps, plans and drawings which would meet the requirements of the new planning regulations.  The person could not afford to pay that amount.  I am pressing the local authority to have the necessary documentation prepared by a member of the staff but there is an understandable reluctance to do so because of the precedent it would create.</P>
    <P>Another case with which I dealt in recent weeks involved a farmer with a herd of 35 to 40 cattle who wishes to construct a cattle pen and crush.  For technical reasons, this development was deemed to require planning permission. The farmer submitted an accurate sketch of the proposed development and every detail was shown.  However, because the plans and drawings submitted were not in accordance with the 1994 regulations and did not show <Col N="2280" /> sections, elevations and the necessary details required, this was not acceptable to the planning authority.  The farmer must now pay several hundred pounds to provide that elaborate, and in my opinion, totally unnecessary documentation. This is crazy, but the planning authority is adamant that it must insist on the documentation which complies with the regulations.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter at county council level and everyone, including the county manager, agrees that, in the case of developments which are not substantial, it is neither necessary nor reasonable that such elaborate documentation should be required when planning permission is sought.  However, the country manager insists he has no choice in the matter until the regulations are changed.  Therefore, I request that urgent and favourable consideration be given to amending the regulation in the case of applications of planning permission where the development in question is not of a substantial nature.  The planning authorities would then have discretion in relation to acceptable documentation.</P>
    <P>It would be a simple matter to devise guidelines in respect of such cases by reference to the nature, purpose and estimated cost of the proposed development. By giving such discretion to the planning authorities, the Minister would remove many difficulties for applicants who are required to obtain planning permission for minor works.  He would also speed up the planning process and relieve many applicants of considerable costs.</P>
    <P>Amending the regulations would also remove some of the red tape and bureaucracy which tends to annoy people.  Common sense dictates that the level of regulation and detail is unnecessary and unreasonable.  I hope the Minister sees merit in my case and gives favourable consideration to amending the regulations.</P>

      <P>All developments, except those specifically exempted under the planning Acts or regulations, require planning permission from the relevant planning authority. The procedure which all applicants must follow when applying for planning permission is set down in Part IV of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, which provides a set of clear-cut ground rules to aid the efficient operation of the system.</P>
      <P>Articles 18 and 23 of the regulations set down the requirements with which planning applications must comply. They specify, among other things, the detailed plans, to specified scales, which must be supplied by the applicant in conjunction with drawings of the proposed development and maps indicating its proposed location.</P>
      <P>Every planning application must contain sufficiently detailed information to enable not only the planning authority but also any interested third parties to assess the potential implications of the proposed development.  It is then open to interested parties to write to the planning authority setting out any submissions or observations they may have and these must be taken into consideration by the planning authority in making its decision.  Site or layout maps indicating the site boundary and roads, septic tanks, etc. are obviously essential in order to facilitate the decision making process of the planning authority. Equally important for the planning authority is the requirement that drawings of elevations of any proposed structure show the main feature of any building which would be contiguous to the proposed structure if it were erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirements of articles 18 and 23 of the planning regulations are applicable to all planning applications but the amount of work involved in meeting the requirements will obviously vary a great deal depending on the nature <Col N="2282" /> and scale of the development.  There is a great deal to be said for having a set of requirements common to all applications in terms of efficiency, consistency and clarity.  Senators will appreciate that it would be difficult to legislate in a workable way for the submission of different levels of information for different types of development.</P>
    <P>In addition, if discretion were given to planning authorities to dispense with all or any of the requirements where they consider that a scheme is not of a substantial nature, inevitable there would be an element of subjectivity and different standards would be applied by different planning authorities.  This could easily lead to confusion, uncertainty and delay which would more than outweigh any possible benefits and it could also be unfair to third parties.</P>
    <P>Many small developments are exempt from planning permission.  For instance, extensions to dwelling houses are generally exempt where the floor area does not exceed 23 square metres.  Where there have been previous extensions the floor area of the proposed extension taken together with the earlier extension must not exceed 23 square metres. Works to the interiors of buildings are usually exempt as are many other minor works within the curtilage of a dwelling house, including, in most cases, the conversion of a garage into a living space. In relation to dwellings, therefore, it is generally only larger scale works which would be required to seek planning permission. The provisions regarding exemptions are reasonable and ensure that the planning control system does not impose excessive controls on small private developments.</P>
    <P>The present requirements of the planning regulations regarding plans and drawings are an essential feature of the system as it currently operates and I am not convinced it would be advisable to change them in the manner proposed. However, if a case is made for granting an exemption from planning permission <Col N="2283" /> for additional categories of small scale development or for specific changes in the present regulations we will be happy to review the matter.</P>

      <P>We are often told by politicians that young people are our greatest resource and that we must do all we can to advance their development.  One failure of the Maastricht Treaty, as eloquently outlined by the National Youth Council of Ireland and its umbrella group in Europe, the Youth Forum, has been the omission of a specific provision for young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this matter in the run up to the successful review of the Maastricht Treaty, particularly given the role of the Government until December, to ask the Government to take a fresh look at the Intergovernmental Conference discussions to ensure that the new treaty will give a proper and meaningful role to young people.  The National Youth Council has pointed out that the failure in the Maastricht Treaty was evident in Articles 126 and 127.  Those articles included the headings &ldquo;education&rdquo;, &ldquo;vocational training&rdquo; and &ldquo;youth&rdquo;. While the commitments of the EU were specified towards education and vocational training, youth was simply left as a heading.  The National Youth Council of Ireland and the Youth Forum wish to make it clear that this is <Col N="2284" /> not good enough.  I ask the Government, particularly as it holds the EU Presidency to re-examine this matter so that young people will be given their proper place in the new treaty.</P>
    <P>About 43 per cent of our population is under 25 years of age as are 60 million people in the EU.  They have specific concerns that need to be addressed.  We must include this in the new treaty and give it substance.  We could thus afford young people a proper place in our community.</P>
    <P>When the new European treaty is negotiated it will have to be ratified by the Irish people.  We must sell Europe and the idea of European integration to young people.  We are not setting a good standard by omitting them from the very Treaty we will ask them to support and ratify.  I ask that this issue be included as part of the Intergovernmental Conference discussions so that, when we hand over the Presidency at the end of this year and move towards agreement on the Treaty, this important element of young people and their role in the European Union will be included and not forgotten as it was when the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated.</P>

      <P>I welcome the moves by the National Youth Council of Ireland to have a specific amendment for a special position for youth inserted in the new Treaty.  Ireland holds the EU Presidency and, if the amendment is to be inserted, it should be done during this period.  There are 60 million people under 25 in Europe but in the new draft document printed there is no specific paragraph for young people.  I commend the work done by the National Youth Council of Ireland, especially Eamonn Waters and Colm Keaveney.</P>
      <P>This amendment will not cost much. All that is asked is for 30 to 40 words be included in the new Treaty to give a specific position to youth.  They will be the new Europeans and we will be inviting them to vote for the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2285" /> I welcome the fact that the Tánaiste, who met with the National Youth Council of Ireland in 1995, has intimated to me he is prepared to meet with them after tonight's vote in the Dáil to set a specific time to give the situation full consideration.</P>
    <P>I support the case outlined by Senator Hayes and ask that the case made by the National Youth Council of Ireland be taken on board and that the amendment be inserted in the Treaty.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Hayes and Senator Maloney for bringing this matter to the attention of the House and for the positive manner in which they have expressed their views and the reasonable views of the National Youth Council of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The European Council meeting in Florence in June of this year requested that &ldquo;a general outline for a draft revision of the Treaties&rdquo; be submitted to the Dublin European Council in December.  The European Council indicated that it expects its meeting in December will mark decisive progress in the negotiations so that the Intergovernmental Conference will be able to complete its work by mid-1997. Overall, work has been advancing well with a view to producing the outline draft Treaty which has been requested for the European Council in December.</P>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference must not lose sight of the fact that, while institutional and other questions are a necessary part of the its agenda, the people's verdict on the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference will be governed largely by the extent to which it addresses and is seen to address the direct concerns of citizens.  Senator Hayes' motion on the rights of our young people concerns an issue which is undoubtedly of concern to citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have made it clear that the overriding objective for our Presidency as a whole, of which the Intergovernmental <Col N="2286" /> Conference is one important part, is to contribute to the advancement of Europe in a manner which corresponds to the aspirations of her peoples, is relevant to their everyday concerns and responsive to their needs.  We have stressed time and time again the importance which we, both as President and as a member state, attach to addressing effectively at European level a number of specific issues of direct concern to citizens.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Dublin, political agreement was reached on proposals to enhance co-operation between the member states in the fight against the sexual exploitation of children.  The Irish Presidency is now working to ensure that those proposals are adopted without delay.</P>
    <P>As far as the Intergovernmental Conference is concerned, it should be recalled that the conference has been convened specifically to consider amendments to the Treaty, which is in a sense the constitution of the European Union.  Any progress in that context does not prevent but rather complements progress in the day-to-day functions and business of the Union, one example of which I have just described.</P>
    <P>Under the general heading of bringing the Union closer to its citizens, the Irish Presidency has already submitted for discussion at the Intergovernmental Conference draft texts on employment, justice and home affairs, citizenship, fundamental rights, transparency and the environment.  All these issues are of direct interest to citizens, including our younger citizens.</P>
    <P>Under the broad heading of fundamental rights, the Irish Presidency has put forward at the Intergovernmental Conference a suggested approach concerning the possibility of strengthening the non-discrimination provisions in the Treaty.  The Presidency's approach suggests the incorporation of non-discrimination <Col N="2287" /> provisions in the Treaty, including the possible establishment of a legal basis in the Treaty which would permit the European institutions to adopt appropriate legislative provisions in respect of discrimination.  Discrimination on the grounds of age is one of the aspects covered in this regard in the Irish Presidency paper.</P>
    <P>The strengthening of the Justice and Home Affairs provisions of the Treaty in order to assist in the fight against international crime is also being given priority at the Intergovernmental Conference. It is clear that a strengthening of the Treaty provisions in this area will contribute to making those provisions more effective and more responsive to the needs of all citizens, including our younger citizens.  Ireland has raised the question of including among the specific matters to be dealt with at the level of the Union a reference to the protection of the external borders of member states from the illegal trafficking of people, an issue of obvious concern in the context of young people's welfare. In that context, the Presidency has raised the question of including an explicit reference to &ldquo;trafficking in persons&rdquo; as a separate matter of common interest among the member states.</P>
    <P>All member states agree that the issue of employment is of major public concern. It is a particular concern of younger people.  Already there are <Col N="2288" /> arrangements in place since the European Council at Essen for co-ordination and development of common strategies at Union level on the question of employment with a view to strengthening action at Union level.  The question at issue in the Intergovernmental Conference is whether these arrangements could be improved and strengthened. At the present stage of the negotiations, it appears that there is fairly wide support for this.  It is one element for which both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have pushed.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to deal in more detail with all the various issues under consideration at the Intergovernmental Conference which impact on citizens. There can be no doubt, however, about the commitment of the Irish Presidency to ensuring the needs and rights of all citizens are given a high priority at the Intergovernmental Conference.  The attitude of our partners to addressing the concerns of citizens has, I am glad to say, also been generally quite positive. However, it is very important to recall that, at the end of the day, all Treaty amendments must be approved unanimously by the member states at the Intergovernmental Conference.  It is too early to predict definitively what the final outcome will be on any of the issues under consideration at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
