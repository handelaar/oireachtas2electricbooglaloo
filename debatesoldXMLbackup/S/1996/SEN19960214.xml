      <P>I have notice from Senator Maloney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide funding to Letterkenny General Hospital for an increase in nursing staff at the hospital, which is at present inadequate.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to include the Army and Garda representative associations in the negotiations leading up to national wage agreements.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Norris on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to issue an invitation to the representatives of ISHOF to make a presentation to the Government regarding the possibility of establishing an international equine centre at Ringsend.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Honan on the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> To ask the Minister for Health when he proposes to introduce the child abuse register as recommended in the report on the Kilkenny incest case.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Maloney's and Senator Neville's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matter they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>There was a small mistake on the Whip's notice which was issued last week.  This indicated that business would cease tomorrow at 1 p.m.  This is not correct as the Waste Management Bill, 1995, will be taken all day tomorrow.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to take item 1 until 6 p.m. with a limit of 30 minutes per speaker and item 15, motion 27 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>We agree with the proposed Order of Business and I thank the Leader for correcting the notice concerning tomorrow's business.  Members on this side have asked for a debate and statements on Northern Ireland.  After what Cardinal Daly termed &ldquo;black Friday&rdquo;, I ask the Leader to provide time for the House to express its support for the Government's efforts to restore peace to this island.  A great national effort is needed by all concerned to renew the peace process.  If the Leader proposes that we have a debate or statements on Northern Ireland next week, my party would have no objection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, with the greatest deference I wish to correct something to which you referred.  When outlining the matter I wished to raise on the Adjournment, you referred to an equine centre whereas this should have been an aquatic centre.  If you are insistent <Col N="447" /> on the equine element, I will attempt to include sea horses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an easy mistake to make.  I was surprised to note that the Government tabled an amendment to item 15, motion 27, which will be taken during Private Members' time.  I talked to Members from the Government side, who were reasonable, and I will talk to the Minister and the Chief Whip this afternoon.  I hope the amendment will be withdrawn and I will speak on this matter this evening.</P>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Wright's call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I draw the attention of the House to motion 28, which is a motion in the names of Senator Henry and I.  This proposes:</P>
      <P>That, in the light of the recent tragic event, Seanad Éireann requests the Government to convene a special sitting of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in the immediate future to include all existing delegates and representatives of political parties in Dublin Castle.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Seanad sends a message to the Government that the forum should be reconvened.  I have felt for some months that the forum was just marking time and doing little which was of use.  This is a time when it can be used to include the representatives of Sinn Féin.  I listened to Mr. Adams demanding meetings with the Taoiseach and others.  He should look for a meeting with the armed forces in the background; I hope he is currently talking to them.  Senator Henry and I frequently represent the Seanad at the forum.  This is a time when that body could be useful. Doors must be kept open and I hope the Government will take on board our suggestion that the forum be reconvened as soon as possible to include all delegates so that we can do something useful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I asked for a debate on Northern Ireland.  Before that point I was not enthusiastic about such a debate.  I made the request last week because of the report of the drafting committee of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  We must condemn the events which took place over the weekend but it is important that language be moderate and that the tone of what we say is prudent.  It might be no harm to reflect on this matter and it would be preferable to discuss it next week.</P>
      <P>I note the motion put down by the Independent Group about the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  I am glad it is still in existence but it is correct to introduce a lull in its proceedings.  If we had gone to the forum at the end of this week, the language might not have been as moderate as it should have been. From that point of view, it is no harm to have a break.  Our record shows that we have always approached this matter in a responsible way and have tried to keep the peace process going.  When we made ritual condemnations over an extended period of events that had taken place, we hoped and prayed it would be the last time; unfortunately we have to do it again.  However, it would be no harm for us to reflect on this for a while and discuss it next week.</P>
      <P>There is something odd in the air. Last week, Senator O'Toole made an excursion into County Roscommon and Senator Norris is going to Ringsend. What is happening in the Independent bench that is making them spread out into&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I had wondered about Senator Norris' interest in equine affairs; I did not notice him at any of the race meetings I attended recently.  I am relieved to see the Senator is interested in aquatic affairs.  It should also be recorded that he described the Government as reasonable.  This is an uncharacteristic word for Senator Norris to use in the context of any Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also supported the call for a debate on Northern Ireland last week; the appalling incident in London has totally changed the situation. However, it would help if we had a debate on Northern Ireland.  There is a difficult and delicate balance there at the moment; there are signs of hope and of getting the peace process back on track and we can play a constructive part in that.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Dardis in that having the forum meeting immediately may be more divisive than anything else in the context of the current situation.  It would be advisable if it did not meet for some period of time until we see a way forward and what constructive approach it could take in the current situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I associate myself with all that was said in respect of what would be a positive debate on the Northern Ireland conflict.  The Leader of the House could feel reassured that this would be our approach.  I have been asking for this debate for some time.  It would give us an opportunity to clearly signal that we support the peacemakers with all the conviction and energy we have.</P>
      <P>I met my old friend John Hume last Friday afternoon, before the horrific events of Friday night.  He expressed the apprehensions and anxiety he had at that time, not in relation to having any information on a particular incident that might happen &mdash; he had no knowledge of that &mdash; but about the stalemate which had been allowed to develop and which would cause great frustration.  It is too sad to think that such a peacemaker &mdash; he is the real personification of that word &mdash; was expressing that frustration and that, a few hours later, these horrific events took place.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that our contributions will be positive and reassuring. However, we should leave no one in any doubt that those who take risks for peace &mdash; no one has done more than John Hume &mdash; will have our full and enthusiastic support.</P>

      <P>While I can understand delaying the meeting of the forum for a short time to discuss Northern Ireland, I would not like to see the delay to be too long.  Those of us who have been to the forum realise what a flexible body it is.  It is not essential that we all sit down together in one room.  One of the most important parts of the forum was the lunch where no one sat with their own group; we were expected to mingle. People who felt that, just at that moment, they could not sit down with certain people did not have to.  We could perhaps bring the Tánaiste's ideas of proximity talks a little further forward; I am not being facetious in saying that perhaps we could have a &ldquo;proximity lunch&rdquo; of the forum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make a speech about Northern Ireland.  If we have a debate on Northern Ireland next week, could it be extended to include the new Senator, who is to be elected at the end of next week?</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to consider bringing the Minister for Health, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education into the House to explain the rights and wrongs of the current nurses dispute.  People in this House should be enlightened why the nurses are refusing a paltry offer of £20 million while the teachers are about to loot the national treasury for about £65 million.  We deserve an explanation of this situation which has been hidden by other events.  It is a matter of great public importance and concerns the public finances, to which we should address ourselves.  Politicians are frightened to address the issue of the early retirement for teachers and teachers' pay because there are so many teachers in both Houses, but the deal which they are hatching is so exorbitant that the issue should be raised immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request for a debate on Northern Ireland.  In that debate we should examine the reasons for such delays on the so-called peace process.  We should also examine <Col N="451" /> the relationship between the Unionist Party and the Orange Order.  Indeed, their closely interwoven relationship begs the question whether talks are possible in the current context of that relationship; the Unionist Party may not be allowed have talks with nationalists. An examination of the constitution of the Orange Order shows that it does not provide much accommodation for such talks.  We all have to moderate our language and make every effort to support the peace process but all the facts must be on the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everybody else we support a reasoned debate in this House, but such a debate should nonetheless give a message today that the quest for peace is unstoppable, that we will keep faith with those who kept faith with us.  I do not exclude Mr. Gerry Adams from that equation, but it should be said that no atrocity, from whatever side or for whatever reason, will escape our condemnation.  This House should send its sympathy to the families of the two people who were blown to eternity because the IRA army council wish to make a political point.  That will never be acceptable to Members of this House or to any Irish citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a couple of points.  For many months now I have been asking that the Minister for Defence come in here and make statements about the reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  I do not want to raise points that could be raised by every Member &mdash; that a barracks is to close here or that there is to be a change of personnel from one place to another. However, a huge number of psychological problems have been caused because those serving in the Defence Forces do not know where they are going.  I have been asking for this debate for nearly a year now and we keep being fobbed off. I would like the Minister to come into the House and make a definitive statement on what is happening within the Defence Forces, if he knows what is <Col N="452" /> happening.  I am not disparaging him by saying that; there could be conflict between what is happening at Government level, at departmental level and Defence Force level.</P>
      <P>This is the month of February and we still do not know what is happening overall regarding the ferocious problems caused by flooding throughout the country.  A debate on this issue has been requested many times.  It is not just a matter of localised flooding as it appears changes are taking place which are causing flooding in places which never experienced it previously.  There is a sustained level of interest and concern throughout the country about this problem and it is time the Minister came to the House to discuss it.</P>
      <P>On a lighter note, I am glad the newspapers yesterday reported that officials worked very hard to root out a cause of great concern.  A man from Carrickmacross has been charged with sunbathing in the nude and I am sure the Garda and others&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>On numerous occasions I have called for a debate on Northern Ireland.  Since Senator Gordon Wilson passed away, a strong unionist voice has been missing in the House; a large vacuum was created in which little discussion on Northern Ireland took place. It is sad that, because a bomb went off last weekend, which we all condemn unreservedly, it has been decided to hold a debate on this matter.  A discussion should have been held long before now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> I came across the Border yesterday and the ramps were back up again in Strabane where the barriers and checkpoints had been removed.  It is very sad if this is an indication of what is to come.  We must move as quickly as possible to get all party talks under way.  I was in Belfast recently and people from all sides of the divide said all party talks should have taken place.  The politicians in the North are not talking on behalf of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Maloney's call for a debate on the provision of funding for Letterkenny General Hospital.  As I am also a representative of the area and a member of the North-Western Health Board, perhaps the Leader could arrange time for me to contribute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request of my party leader in the House for a debate on Northern Ireland.  In common with Senator Maloney, I too must travel through the North to get to Dublin.  The people who set off the bomb in London must be condemned.  Whatever else it does and irrespective of political posturing, the House should pass a vote of sympathy to the families of those killed and totally dissociate itself from the mistake of those who ordered the bomb explosion.  They are misguided people who are struggling for political recognition. They do not have the support of the Irish people.  I support Mr. John Hume's proposal for a referendum on both sides of the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Leader provide sufficient time to have a full and open debate which will cover all aspects of the problems regarding the North of Ireland, including the bombing and murder of the people in London?  The debate should also indicate how we believe these problems should be addressed at a political level in the future.  We should not use the procedure of statements, rather enough time should be provided to ensure that the House makes a worthwhile contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I support those who favour a debate on Northern Ireland.  We need time to reflect on what happened <Col N="455" /> last Friday when the peace process appeared to be coming to an end.  It is a very sad development, especially for those, like myself, who come from Border counties.  For 25 years violence caused widespread inconvenience to those in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  The ceasefires of the past 18 months brought enormous comfort to Northern Ireland as it did to the people of County Monaghan, County Cavan, County Sligo, County Leitrim and County Donegal.  Will the Leader convey the views of the House and my concerns to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the relevant people involved in the peace process about the need to try to get the process back on the rails?  Time is of vital importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to the request for a debate on the North at the earliest opportunity.  Time is indeed of the essence.  If we delay too long there is a danger such a debate would be academic because the decision will already have been taken which will determine the direction of events for many years to come.  I echo Senator Maloney's call for all party talks, if only because if the peace process fails, and it may fail within the next week, it is impossible to see how a Sinn Féin Leader can ever go back to the IRA with any prospect of persuading it that a peace process is worth risking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request for a debate on Northern Ireland.  Although I live approximately 260 miles from the Border and a long way from London, the reality struck home when a young girl, a neighbour, was in the building when the bomb exploded.  She was lucky to receive only some minor injuries and she is fine, thank God.  It could have been more tragic for her and then the reality would have hit us in west County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Magner that the sympathy of all Members of the House should be <Col N="456" /> extended to the relatives of the two people who were killed.  They were innocent people, not part of any conflict and their lives were sacrificed in a way that was brutal and needless.  The House must condemn the deed itself; it was evil.  Those who planted the bomb were the people who broke the peace process, nobody else.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Leader of the Opposition and others for the positive and supportive way in which this question is being addressed today.  A striking aspect of the past couple of days has been the absence of recriminations and the realisation that recriminations, however well they may be earned or justified, do not help the universal desire to get back to talking.  It is an absolute imperative that the process must be set working again.  This has been the desire of the two Governments and of all parties.</P>
      <P>There will be a debate on Northern Ireland next Tuesday and I will endeavour to provide as much time as possible so that everyone who wishes to make a point will get an adequate opportunity to do so.  It is fair to say that in the past our debates on Northern Ireland were too short and I will try to remedy that.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris asked about the Adjournment debate.  The Senator is always reasonable and he will find the Government is reasonable in this also. We will discuss the matter later to avoid any break in relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Item 15, motion 28, was raised by Senator Norris and Senator Henry among others; it concerns the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  My understanding is that it is not the Government who call a meeting of the forum, it is the parties to the forum who decide.  There appears to be broad agreement among the parties that for the moment it would not be advisable for the forum to meet. In relation to Senator Henry's point, it is my understanding that the social aspects of the forum &mdash; by which I mean people meeting and exchanging views &mdash; will continue over the coming weeks. It will be possible for forum members to <Col N="457" /> meet within its precincts and under its aegis to consult and discuss with each other informally.  It is not a question of a complete breakdown in communications &mdash; all of us wish that the forum would be functioning fully as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Most Senators raised the issue of Northern Ireland.  Senator Haughey made an interesting and valuable point and in <i>The Irish Times</i> today there is an article by Mr. Dick Grogan which is worth reading.  He writes that words and their meanings are one of the major casualties of the Northern Ireland conflict. There is not much point having a debate next week if there is not plain speaking or if people are not able to say exactly what they mean.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross asked about teachers.  It is open to him to put down a motion on that subject; I have no difficulty having the matter discussed in the House. Senator Lanigan asked for a debate on the Defence Forces; he has raised this issue on many occasions and I will look for such a debate as soon as possible. He has been uncharacteristically patient and I will do my best to organise this. On the question of flooding, legislation left this House some weeks ago; it is now in the other House and should be implemented shortly.  We had a debate on flooding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to bring this Bill before the Seanad.  Its primary purpose is to make provision for the Environmental Protection Agency to establish its permanent headquarters on a site in Johnstown Estate, County Wexford. The estate is currently vested in Teagasc but under existing legislation a site cannot be sold or leased to the Environmental Protection Agency.  The Bill proposes to amend the legislation governing the use of the estate in order to give Teagasc the necessary power to lease a site to the agency.</P>
      <P>When the Government decision to locate the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency in Wexford was announced in July 1992, Johnstown Castle became the focus of attention. The possibility of using the castle was considered by the Government but following a detailed survey of the building by the Office of Public Works in 1993 it became clear that its internal dimensions would not accommodate the intended headquarters.  The five directors of the agency and up to 80 staff will be based in this new headquarters, but the castle would accommodate no more than 50 people.  Having reviewed the alternatives, the Government decided that new purpose-built accommodation on a site in Johnstown Estate would be the best option for the agency's new headquarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Johnstown Estate is situated about four miles south-west of Wexford town. It comprises the fine 19th century Gothic revival castle and a demesne of approximately 1,000 acres of land, including ornamental grounds, gardens, <Col N="459" /> lakes and woodland.  The estate, as we know it today, remained in private ownership up to 1944 when the then owners &mdash; Dorothy Violet Jefferies and Maurice Victor Lakin &mdash; made a generous gift of it to the nation.  The agreement under which the gift was accepted is incorporated in the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College Act, 1945.  The property was to be used as a lay agricultural college, the ornamental nature of the gardens and pleasure grounds was not to be altered, ornamental timber was not to be felled and sporting rights and rights of way were reserved to the donors and their heirs.</P>
    <P>In 1959, amending legislation was enacted to transfer ownership of the entire estate from the Minister for Agriculture to An Foras Talúntais and to extend its use as a lay agricultural college to include the conduct of agricultural research.  The Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Act, 1959, also included a provision which precluded An Foras Talúntais from disposing of any part of the estate and introduced additional caveats regarding any proposed alteration, demolition or construction works in or around the castle.  During the 1970s it was recognised that this absolute statutory prohibition on any disposal had proved to be unduly restrictive and that no response could be made by An Foras Talúntais to locally desirable initiatives.</P>
    <P>The Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Act, 1980, made provision for the disposal by An Foras Talúntais of a number of small, designated areas of land to meet requests from various local interests, including Wexford County Council.  It also included a general provision for the leasing of part of the estate by the State. However, this general provision does not permit the leasing of a site to the Environmental Protection Agency nor can a valid sub-lease be provided from the State.  Remaining areas from the land designated for disposal under the Act are not suitable for purposes of the agency headquarters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> In 1988 An Foras Talúntais was dissolved and Teagasc was established. Under the provisions of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, ownership of the Johnstown Estate transferred to Teagasc, subject to the same conditions of use and limitations on disposal.  The estate is currently used by Teagasc as a research and development centre specialising in soils and environmental research.  The environmental programme at Johnstown is concerned with the creation of a scientific and technical basis for good farm practice and is aimed at the protection and sustainable management of soil and water, two of our key natural resources.  The work carried out by Teagasc at Johnstown and the functions of the Environmental Protection Agency will complement each other and confirm Johnstown as a centre of environmental and agricultural excellence.</P>
    <P>The Bill which is now before this House is simple and straightforward.  It provides that the existing use of the estate may be extended to enable Teagasc to lease a site to the Environmental Protection Agency and to dispose of a limited area for use for environmental, heritage, amenity or recreational purposes. It also eases the restriction on Teagasc with regard to disposal of land under section 27 of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, to enable the extended uses to be undertaken.  In preparing the legislation, the Attorney General has carefully considered the legal issues arising from the special status of Johnstown Estate and the special status afforded to it under various Acts of the Oireachtas since 1945.  Both original donors are now dead, but I have notified the legal representatives of their heirs of the proposals now before this House which the Government has approved.</P>
    <P>I confirm to this House that the rights reserved to the donors in perpetuity in the original agreement, that is, the sporting rights and rights of way, have been recognised from the outset in preparing my proposals.  These rights, and the additional caveats to which I have <Col N="461" /> already referred, will be respected by Teagasc in any proposed sale or lease of part of the estate under the provisions of the Bill.  I have assured the legal representatives of the donors' heirs that they will be consulted in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>Johnstown Estate is a prestigious setting with a good environmental image. Everyone who visits it cannot help but be impressed.  The location of the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency at this site will underpin the status of the agency as the national guardian of our environment.  The enactment of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and the establishment of the agency in July 1993 are widely recognised as milestones in the development of our environmental management and protection capabilities.</P>
    <P>A progressive build up of its resources has ensured that after just two and a half years in existence it is fully operational in terms of the range of functions assigned to it under the 1992 Act.  This year the agency's overall budget will total almost £8 million.  It will intensify its integrated pollution control licensing function, publish its first comprehensive state of the environment report and take on substantial new functions under the Waste Management Bill, 1995, when enacted.  I look forward to returning to this House tomorrow to discuss Committee Stage of that Bill.  In addition, the agency is increasingly active in the monitoring of environmental quality, advising on environmental issues and sound practices, co-ordination of environmental research and supervision of the performance by local authorities of their environmental protection functions.</P>
    <P>There are now regional environmental units of the Environmental Protection Agency in Castlebar, Cork, Dublin, Kilkenny and Monaghan.  It is time to reinforce the overall development of this important organisation by establishing the permanent headquarters in Wexford.  There is a strong association between the county and the agency, <Col N="462" /> which has operated from temporary accommodation in Ardcavan since 1994. I am satisfied that this Bill will enable the right decision to be made on the agency's permanent location.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, I am taking the opportunity presented by the Bill to propose a new provision to ease the statutory prohibition on the disposal of any part of the estate which was introduced in 1959.  The limited disposal provision which was made in the 1980 Amendment Act worked well in terms of a number of specific initiatives and requirements which were known when the legislation was being drafted. However, other than by way of lease to the estate, the existing provisions lack flexibility; there is no basis upon which Teagasc can accommodate locally desirable activities and proposals with the result that the estate is effectively isolated from the local community.  This state of affairs is known to local representatives, such as Senator D'Arcy. They are aware of the demands from local community based groups on the Johnstown Estate which would be of great benefit to the community.  Teagasc has received requests from local interests for limited access to land in Johnstown but, under existing legislation, it has had no option but to refuse.</P>
    <P>To overcome this situation, a modest, more general disposal provision has been included in this Bill so it will not be necessary to specify the details on what is socially desirable locally.  This is purely an enabling measure and it will be a matter for Teagasc to determine individual cases.  Disposals under the proposed provision will be restricted to environmental, heritage, recreational or amenity uses and will be subject to an overall threshold of 5 per cent of the area of the estate at the commencement of the legislation.  In addition to these specific conditions, Teagasc is required, under the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, to obtain the approval of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry for all disposals of land and this requirement will <Col N="463" /> apply to any disposals at Johnstown under the provision now proposed.</P>
    <P>Enactment of this Bill will be important for the Environmental Protection Agency, Johnstown Estate and its future and the people of Wexford. The existing and new uses will complement each other and enhance the standing of the estate nationally, locally and internationally.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and assure him that this side of the House welcomes this enabling legislation. It is important because it continues the successful decentralisation programme initiated some years ago.  It is appropriate that the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency should be in an area which is conducive to observing both the value of a good environment and the need to protect what is exceptionally good in the environment which has been handed down to us.</P>
      <P>We should not let the occasion pass without taking the opportunity to thank the people who left this estate to the nation, Dorothy Violet Jefferies and Maurice Victor Lakin.  I presume these people were Anglo-Irish, or maybe they had no Irish connection.  Mount Congreve in Waterford and the Bourne and Vincent estate in Killarney have been left to the State; an American left the beautiful Glenveagh Castle to the State and nearby an English artist named Hill left his estate to the nation and the Ormonde family, an Anglo-Irish family, sold Kilkenny Castle and its grounds to the State for the princely sum of £50.  In each of these instances we see the fantastic value the State is garnering from people who, in the past, may have been perceived as unfriendly to the generality of Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that many of our estates were broken up and many of the big houses were devastated.  Sometimes absentee landlords did not bother to maintain their estates and many of these places were burned down during the <Col N="464" /> Civil War.  They are an important element in the Irish environment and play a major part in the continuum in this area.  I place on record the thanks of the nation to the people who handed over Johnstown Castle estate to the nation.</P>
    <P>I have been familiar with Johnstown Castle for many years, having gone to school in St. Peter's in Wexford for a short time.  When we escaped from St. Peter's, occasionally we were sent on a crocodile walk to Johnstown Castle.  If a person was fast enough he could get ahead of the crocodile and into a local shop to buy a slab of toffee, a bottle of lemonade or a packet of biscuits before the prefect caught up with him.  If the prefect did catch up, one was not let out the next day.  Even as a child, one would have seen that the castle and its surrounding lands could be of immense value to the nation.  In the early 1950s the house was not open to the public but people could walk around the grounds which were in bad condition.  When the estate was taken over by the State people brought their children on holiday visits there and they could see the enormous value that was put into the estate by An Foras Talúntais.</P>
    <P>The expertise in soil management and other areas has been of inestimable value to farmers all over the country. The original legislation set up an agricultural college in the mid-1940s and I am glad that role will continue and the fine work that has been done by Teagasc. Everyone involved in the research and development work there over the years deserves to be complimented. That work contributed greatly to the added value farmers get from their land.</P>
    <P>No one doubts that the transfer of land to the Environmental Protection Agency under a leasing agreement is an excellent idea.  However, I am worried that accommodation in the castle will not be sufficient for the numbers of people to be employed there.  As only 50 Environmental Protection Agency staff can be accommodated in the castle the Minister will add extra buildings.  The standard of these buildings must be in <Col N="465" /> keeping with the standard of the castle and its existing outbuildings.  I presume the Minister for Finance would love to stick a few Portakabins around the place and pretend that people are being adequately accommodated.  That would be easy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is an architect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not mean he has the best interests of those who might wish to work in Johnstown Castle at heart.  He might have his architectural hat on sometimes, but when it comes to financial matters I am afraid the hat might go out the door fairly quickly. Since Johnstown Castle is in the Minister's constituency, I hope cognisance will be given to the architectural value of the area.</P>
      <P>As well as being a beautiful place to visit, it is exceptional as a headquarters for the Environmental Protection Agency.  An equally good place could probably have been obtained in Kilkenny but we will not argue about that since Wexford has not had too much joy on various fields of play over the past number of years.  We cannot say that we will give them the Environmental Protection Agency instead of the All Ireland hurling trophy; some people there might prefer to have the Liam McCarthy Cup but it will be a long time before that happens.  Some of the civil servants moving down next year will probably be retired before Wexford gets another All Ireland title.</P>
      <P>It has been stated that up to 5 per cent of the land at Johnstown Castle can be acquired by local people or others involved in recreational or environmental activities.  The Minister should, therefore, take control of selling off parts of the land.  If the Minister for Finance sees that 5 per cent can be sold for a huge amount, he may decide the money is more important than the objectives stated in this Bill.  As I said, this is place for recreation as well as business.</P>

Unless we make an environmentally friendly decision, that 5 per cent could be chopped off one end of the castle property and it could distort the entire area.  The Minister should look carefully at how we build the headquarters.  I welcome this Bill which I am sure will pass speedily through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I am spokesperson for Agriculture, it is appropriate that I am here to deal with this Bill which relates to County Wexford.  I join with Senator Lanigan in thanking the Fitzgerald family for this great gift to the State.  The Minister said that there are 1,000 acres in Johnstown Castle, but there are approximately 2,000.  At the time, the castle was a very appropriate gift to the State because in the 1940s there was a need for agricultural education. The Minister and I will recall all the demonstrations given in Johnstown Castle through the years.  Improvements in agriculture are due to the practical and theoretical knowledge imparted in that castle.  I attended numerous classes in the castle.  At a time when there was a food shortage not only in Ireland but throughout Europe the contribution of Johnstown Castle to farmers in terms of expertise can never be assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have reached a stage where things are different.  I recall the important research into the milk sector.  We had 600 gallon cows which were built up to 1,000 gallon cows.  The same improvements were brought about in the case of cereals and, to a lesser degree, beef production.  Johnstown Castle had three beef units and the amount of knowledge imparted and research done were considerable. Farmers now have different systems and we must keep up with European standards.  We are now being <Col N="467" /> asked to produced the 2,000 gallon cows.  Some of the practical research done at Johnstown Castle would be very useful today.</P>
    <P>It is important that we protect our environment.  I understand that once this Bill is passed we can get on with the work.  I assure the Minister it will not be delayed in this House because we are eager to see the Bill passed.  Decentralisation to rural areas is very important. As Senator Lanigan said, County Wexford has never benefited in this regard. Many Members work in Dublin. Senator Lanigan and I are based in Dublin for three days per week and the Minister is here for five days.  Many people talk about decentralisation but do not practice it.  Farming and other organisations have their headquarters in Dublin.  This issue should be given more consideration.</P>
    <P>The siting of the Environmental Protection Agency in County Wexford will be very beneficial to the area.  There are further proposals to transfer 300 staff from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to Wexford.  We will accept 600 staff because we have plenty of room for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is plenty of room in Kilkenny for the rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>County Kilkenny and County Carlow cannot complain because they gained much under the regionalisation programme.  County Wexford does not have a college or regional hospital.  Were it not for the fact that Brendan Corish served as Minister for Health in the early 1970s there would be no county hospital in Wexford.  I thank him for ensuring that Wexford now has a county hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decentralisation and regionalisation are important to rural areas.  I sincerely thank the Minister for siting the Environmental Protection Agency headquarters in County Wexford.  I have no doubt that the Environmental Protection Agency will grow in the future.  Many of us are members of <Col N="468" /> county councils and see the damage which can be done to the environment. We know the people responsible for that damage, some of them in high places, but we will not name them.  In certain instances, they do not seem to care about the environment.  I am pleased that the local economy will gain dramatically from the decentralisation of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to Johnstown Castle.</P>
    <P>This is an enabling Bill and I assume it will not be necessary to return with it to either House.  Can the construction of headquarters for 350 staff members of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry at Johnstown Castle proceed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it.  The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>I confirm to this House that the rights reserved to the donors in perpetuity in the original agreement, that is, the sporting rights and rights of way, have been recognised from the outset in preparing my proposals.</P>
      <P>The donors of the castle were very generous. The State and the people of County Wexford owe them a great debt. I hope there will be no attempt to interfere with any of their rights.  I would like the Minister to guarantee that those rights will be preserved at all costs.</P>
      <P>I am very familiar with Johnstown Castle and have visited it on numerous occasions.  At the conclusion of his speech the Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, other than by way of lease to the State, the existing provisions lack flexibility; there is no basis upon which Teagasc can accommodate locally desirable activities and proposals, with the result that the estate is effectively isolated from the local community.  I know that Teagasc has received requests from local interests for limited access to land in Johnstown but, under existing legislation, <Col N="469" /> it has had no option but to refuse.</P>
    <P>In 1980 I was a Member of the Lower House and also a Minister of State. Wexford County Council was attempting to, but could not, acquire land for housing in the area.  A Bill had to be put through the Oireachtas as a result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Something should have been done at that time to ensure that we need not go backward and forward to both Houses to obtain enabling legislation and make provisions.  A lengthy debate took place at the time and the Government had to approach the donors in France to obtain their permission for what was proposed.  St. Martin's GAA Club recently requested that the county council provide it with accommodation on the estate.  However, the county council was unable to do so. St. Martin's requested the use of two to three acres, as did the local parish priest.  The estate is made up of approximately 2,000 acres and there is great local demand for some type of accommodation in respect of buildings and playing fields.  I am not sure for what purpose the parish priest is seeking land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>A car park or something of that nature.  They have asked the county council to help on numerous occasions.  I ask the Minister if he can assist in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who live in rural areas know they are easily isolated.  One of the most important things in such areas is activity of some kind.  The activities of the GAA and soccer clubs and the parish, school, barracks, etc., maintain the life of local areas.  The day these institutions are closed is the day the local area will die. Will accommodation be given to St. Martin's GAA Club under the Bill?  The amount of land they need is very small <Col N="470" /> compared to the overall amount available. There are over 2,000 acres at Johnstown Castle and St. Martin's only needs the use of three to five acres.  The county council is also seeking further land&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I welcome the Minister to the House for the second consecutive week.</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated, this Bill is a straightforward piece of legislation.  Its purpose is to enable Teagasc to lease a site at Johnstown Castle to the Environmental Protection Agency.  I doubt if any Member will have any objection to, or difficulty with, the passing of the Bill. This is the second week this House is dealing with environmental protection. It is good that this is the case.</P>
      <P>If we are to improve our care and custody of the environment, the Environmental Protection Agency will have a major role to play.  The Minister indicated that since part of the agency's role was discussed last week in the context of the Waste Management Bill, there is no need to dwell on it further today.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill to give the agency a new home.  I also the welcome the continued policy of situating such offices outside Dublin.  With regard to the social fabric of rural communities and towns, it is important that such jobs be available so that the people can contribute to the locality in which they live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago, Cork County Council, of which I am a member, donated part of its buildings near the dam on the River Lee to the Environmental Protection Agency for use as an office.  I <Col N="471" /> accept the Minister's comments on the suitability of the castle.  However, I hope that any new development will be consistent with the pattern of existing developments.  The Minister also stated that the provisions of this Bill were shown to the legal representatives of those who donated the estate to the State.  By their original bequest, Dorothy Jeffries and Maurice Lakin indicated their concern for the environment of the castle grounds and the nation as a whole.  In many ways they were ahead of their time.  If they were alive today, care of the environment would be high on their list of concerns as is the case with all civic-minded people.  Consequently, I am sure they would have no difficulty with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with other issues not directly related to the Environmental Protection Agency.  The terms of the 1980 Amendment Act appear to be rather limited.  They refuse Teagasc the flexibility to deal effectively with the land in question.  Subsection (2)(a) of the Bill seeks to correct this difficulty.  It also imposes a limit on the amount of land within the castle grounds whose use can be turned over to purposes other than those consistent with the initial testament.  The Minister indicated that the legal representatives of the estate will be consulted on all proposals. To do otherwise would be unacceptable. I am glad the original agricultural purpose of the disposition will be safeguarded by the existing provision which necessitates that Teagasc obtain the approval of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry before any disposal of land.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for this Bill and I look forward to its securing a speedy passage through both Houses. He has acted appropriately in giving the thanks owed by the State to the generous donors of Johnstown Castle.  The work of the Environmental Protection Agency is important and I hope this Bill will enable that body to continue its tasks.  It faces a tough future.  Many miles of coastline and many rivers must <Col N="472" /> be protected while the problems of waste disposal and other thorny topics must be dealt with.  The Environmental Protection Agency requires the full support of this House in its work.  It also requires help from local authorities as they are the bodies which are at present handling day-to-day environmental issues.  The Environmental Protection Agency must work with local authorities and through the goodwill of local authorities the Environmental Protection Agency's work can come to fruition.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill and I wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. As expected, there is a strong welcome in the House for the measures proposed in this legislation.  It is a straightforward, enabling Bill which I am anxious to have enacted as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Senators will forgive me my anxiety in this regard but I have proposals ready from the Office of Public Works to commence the tendering process.  They are constrained by legalities and are awaiting the enactment of this legislation before they can get to work.  All sides of the House are anxious to allow the Office of Public Works to commence construction as soon as possible so that this new facility can be available to the Environmental Protection Agency.  It will, I believe, be one of the State's most important agencies before long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment on some of the points made.  I can assure Senator Lanigan that it is not envisaged that the existing castle be used for offices.  The castle was surveyed by the Office of Public Works and was deemed unsuitable. We did not wish to interfere architecturally with the building and that would have been required to make it usable as the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is intended to build a new building on the estate lands.  It will be a state of the art environmental protection building which will be built in sympathy with <Col N="473" /> existing buildings on the estate. However, it will not be part of the ornamental lands and will not impact on them, although that magnificent vista and those lands will be open to the agency, its international visitors and the staff of the agency.  Equally when the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry decentralises to the same estate, it will not build on the ornamental gardens.  Those lands and the woodlands will be preserved but the Department will have access to them.</P>
    <P>It will be a tremendously important environmental and agricultural campus. On the one site will be located the national headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency and, we hope, a future European topic centre from the European agency which is currently located in Copenhagen, a significant division of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the soils research division of Teagasc.  That level of synergy will be of tremendous benefit both to agriculture and the environment. I suppose it is no coincidence that these two ministries are currently occupied by Wexford Deputies.  I am delighted to see the dream of this campus becoming a centre of environmental excellence coming to pass.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision I have incorporated in the Bill, it does not simply deal with the accommodation needs of the Environmental Protection Agency.  I am using the Bill as a vehicle to respond in a positive way to local concerns.  There are small requests from the local GAA club and from the local parish to facilitate local needs.  Teagasc is willing to do that but it is currently legally disabled from responding positively to such requests.  This is an enabling provision which will put that situation right.  It will be possible for Teagasc to respond to such requests without having to enact Acts of the Oireachtas in each case, which would make it impossible to respond to such requests.  The final decision will be made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry who must approve any transfer of land from the estate.  It <Col N="474" /> is envisaged under the Bill that no more than 5 per cent of the existing land &mdash; my briefing notes inform me that the current estate and demesne comprise 1,000 acres &mdash; would be used.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that we should be able to respond positively to local requests while at the same time maintain our faith with the original donors who I congratulate and thank again.  The original donors have passed on to their eternal rewards but my Department has communicated with their heirs and legal representatives to keep them informed of what is happening.  Our most recent correspondence from Mr. Lakin before he passed on indicated that he was very positive about the developments and about the State's stewardship of this fine estate over the years.  He was pleased with all that was done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the support of Senators for this provision, I look forward to its speedy enactment and to Members of the House visiting the magnificent Johnstown estate when the Environmental Protection Agency is up and running.</P>

      <P>That is an excellent suggestion and we will bear it in mind.  The Senator is quite right.  Magnificent gifts have been given to the State by distinguished families in our history and we should not take these gifts for granted.</P>
      <P>We have a double responsibility in this regard.  First, we must cherish the inheritance.  A good job has been done in relation to this estate because the lands have been magnificently maintained over the years by the employees of Teagasc, and An Foras Talúntais before that.  Some damage was done to the interior of the castle in the 1940s or early 1950s when the State first took over the estate.  There was a magnificent staircase which now only exists in paintings and pictures.  However, the Office of Public Works has acquired some very good quality old timbers and has stored them there with a view to restoring that staircase.  Second, there is a new age of enlightenment and it should incorporate keeping a link to the descendants of the good people who donated such properties to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first occasion on which the Minister has come to the House and I formally extend a warm welcome to him.  He will find a high level of debate and reasonable people here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann urges the Government to inquire into the feasibility of providing an underground railway system before committing itself finally to the development of an urban light rail network for Dublin.</P>
      <P>I join in the welcome to the Minister, who is a reasonable man.  I welcome that, after protracted negotiation, the Government has agreed to withdraw its amendment and accept my motion.  I would like to express my appreciation for the good offices of my friend and colleague, Senator Manning, and the goodwill displayed by the Minister in achieving this satisfactory resolution.</P>
      <P>I am proposing an examination of a detailed proposal for a unified transport system for Dublin, including an underground metro element.  I find it a little worrying that this proposal has existed for a considerable time but has not been examined in any detail.  I reassure the Minister that we are not talking about abandoning or aborting all the proposals of the Dublin Transport Initiative but about expanding and evaluating them and making them more sophisticated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal has been developed by Cormac, Rabbit, Rudi, Monaghan and Associates.  It is a blueprint for Dublin's <Col N="477" /> renaissance and should help to make it a city second to none.  Public transport to and within the inner city is proposed by three radial DART-LRT rail lines &mdash; the first from Sandyford to Liffey Junction, the second from Tallaght to Connolly Station and the third from Dublin Airport to Liffey Junction.</P>
    <P>When the DTI issued its proposals, people on all sides of the House were astonished that no connection to the airport was proposed.  To the minds of many Members and I, this made a nonsense of the entire matter.  The three proposed DART-LRT routes dovetail to the existing Blanchardstown, Clondalkin and DART suburban rail networks. Existing reservations of the former Harcourt Street &mdash; from Sandyford to the Grand Canal &mdash; and Broadstone &mdash; from Broadstone to Liffey Junction &mdash; railway lines are utilised.  These reservations are still largely intact after decades of disuse.</P>
    <P>The Tallaght line makes use of an existing bus way reservation, that is, from Tallaght to Sundrive Road, and proceeds to the DART Howth line at Connolly Station via stations at Temple Bar and O'Connell Street.  The Blanchardstown line utilises the Sligo-Mullingar railway line and the reservation from it to the Blanchardstown Newtown Centre.  The Minister will see that we are taking in large population pools and there is no question that there is a high degree of passenger usage potential in these areas.  It is important to bear in mind that many of these areas are not served by the proposals on the table at the moment.</P>
    <P>All DART-LRT routes proposed are for twin track electric trains on standard national gauge.  Both the Tallaght and Sandyford lines will cross under the River Liffey, intersecting at a metro station in Temple Bar.  Also connecting to Temple Bar are the airport, Ballymun and existing Blanchardstown lines. Other city centre stations proposed are Grafton Street, Henry Street and O'Connell Street.  I live in North Great George's Street.  I have a real difficulty getting to the airport unless I take my <Col N="478" /> car and leave it in the long-term car park.  Under this system, all I need do is trundle my case to O'Connell Street, hop on the underground, change at Temple Bar and I am at the airport. This is practically the case in every capital city in Europe except Dublin.  We are not even considering the airport in these current proposals.</P>
    <P>Optimum use can be seen to be made of existing rail transport infrastructure and could maximise the use of the £198 million proposed European Union and Government funding for the Dublin LRT.  The timescale for implementation of this proposal is estimated to be better than the current Luas on-street proposal due to a number of factors, such as a less complicated environmental impact study requirement, simpler right of way acquisition, faster construction time and widespread support declared by the environmental and business communities. This afternoon I was speaking to people in the environmental lobby and the business world.  They all share the reservations about Luas and support the kind of ideas contained in these proposals. For this reason, I feel it is necessary to re-examine them.</P>
    <P>I have exhaustively checked and can confidently state that the price of tunnelling, far from the inflated estimates produced by some antagonists to this proposal, is between £7 million to £10 million per kilometre.  If I am challenged on this, I can produce the authorities. Let us not waste time by trying to challenge these figures; they are quite clear.  Moreover, the rolling stock necessary is also cheaper to acquire because it is already manufactured in production lines for systems all over the world, unlike the special design required for the Dublin Luas system.  There would also be a significant improvement in safety levels and in the levels of atmospheric pollution.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I find it difficult to comprehend that any person with an understanding of Dublin's position as a tourist destination could possibly welcome a system which would mean the visual intrusion of a spaghetti-like network of <Col N="479" /> street furniture, electric paving, tramlines and passing vehicles.  Indeed, one cardinal question must be asked: why was this possibility of an alternative, i.e, a combined overland and underground system, never considered before we reached this late stage?  However, I must emphasise that what we are proposing is not the total abandonment of the existing proposals with their concomitant EU funding but a revision and expansion to include a more appropriate system for the city centre.</P>
    <P>I will state one premise upon which I am sure we can all agree; traffic management and the general traffic situation in Dublin is a complete disaster.  As was predicted by many of us at the Dublin crisis conference some years ago, the development of modern highway systems feeding traffic into the city took no account of either parking or circulation problems.  There has been a massive increase in single occupant motor traffic entering the city.  Buses are allowed to park, and indeed double park, in totally inappropriate and narrow city centre streets while the development in recent years of many private bus companies running services from the capital to the provinces has further complicated matters with the development of hit and run, casual parking in streets off the city's main thoroughfares.</P>
    <P>The response to this by the Dublin Transport Initiative is to add to the chaos by turning the clock back nearly half a century and reintroducing a surface tram system to Dublin.  I was five years old in 1949.  I loved the trams.  I bitterly regretted and resented the actions of the then civic authorities in removing them from the streets of Dublin. However, the argument made then, which convinced the city authorities nearly 50 years ago, was that the existence of such structures and such a transport system was already beginning to lead to traffic gridlocks.  Does anybody seriously believe that 50 years later with the addition of car transport, the system can be reintroduced without causing disaster?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> I raised the question of providing an underground system for Dublin as far back as 1981.  I was then met with a series of objections.  I was told there was something distinctly problematic about the soil structure of Dublin city.  I can now categorically say this is untrue. There is no geological problem whatever impeding the development of an underground railway system for Dublin.</P>
    <P>I was also told when I again raised the matter at the Dublin crisis conference eight years ago, that the demography of Dublin would not lend itself to such a network.  Only cities with high density skyscraper dwellings were suitable.  This is also nonsense.  I point to the example of the city of Newcastle in northern England, a provincial town with a population of 250,000 people less than one quarter the size of Dublin and a population that is at least as dispersed as that of the capital city of Ireland.  Ten years ago they put in an underground railway system.  Not only has that now paid for itself, it is in profit.  Are we such a race of pygmies in Dublin that we are unable to emulate the example of a British provincial city?</P>
    <P>The great mistake that has been made was to move from the perfectly reasonable proposition that Dublin needs a state of the art transport system directly to the option of a light rail transport system with no consideration of any reasonable alternative.  I urge the Minister and his advisers to open their minds and not to commit themselves irrevocably to a system that will prove disastrous for the city.  I would take no joy in five or ten years time in coming to this House, or into any other public forum, and saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister will, I am sure, accept that I have a proven track record in terms of the city of Dublin.  I have backed unpopular causes before.  When I spoke about bringing life back into the north inner city I was told it was impractical; restoring 18th century houses and opening them to the public was impractical; cultural tourism was impractical and the development of Bloomsday as a national holiday was impractical.  Therefore <Col N="481" /> it would not come as any great surprise to me to be told that a metro system for the city of Dublin is also considered impractical.</P>
    <P>It is not possible within the confines of this debate to deal with all the technical aspects involved.  If we look at Germany in the 1960s we observe the way in which they initially investigated the possibility of light rail transport and then turned their backs on it.  The city of Vienna in 1965 was two thirds of the way through the development of an overground tram system.  Realising the consequences of this the city authorities went back to the drawing board and built a metro which is now working with considerable efficiency.</P>
    <P>If one looks at comparative figures for capacity as between an on-street tram system, a bus system and a subway system, in the on-street tram system the minimum interval is 2.5 minutes with 180 passengers per train.  The capacity if you make this calculation is 180×0.7× 60÷2.5 which is 3,000 passengers per hour.  Using a similar calculation the subway system produces a figure of 28,000 passengers per hour and the DART at peak times can transfer 7,000 passengers per hour.  I do not need to tell the House that at those peak times passengers are frequently left behind at suburban stations.  International reports demonstrate that the introduction of a light rail transport system into an existing bus system leads to a decrease in overall passenger take up.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the consequences of proceeding bullheaded with the LRT system for Dublin on the principle that my proposal, right or wrong, should be adopted.  There will be a minimum two to four year period of maximum disruption during the building and development works for the system.  In other cities this has led to a blight of inner city business.  Public transport should not be seen as a social service to be provided for the under-privileged and others who do not have their own transport, but should be regarded as a commercial stimulant, protector of the environment <Col N="482" /> and one of the necessities of civilised urban life.  The unified proposal for Sandyford, Tallaght, Dublin Airport which I am sponsoring this evening covers exactly these criteria.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the Dublin rail rapid transit study reached a conclusion that a rail based public transport system on its own right of way was the only public transport system that could provide the desired user benefits.  Again, this dovetails neatly with the proposals under examination tonight.  The transport consultative commission in 1980 re-examined these conclusions and upheld their findings.  In terms of a timescale, there are less protracted procedures for environmental impact studies, simpler legislation, the timescale for implementation would be far less and the impact upon business would be considerably curtailed.  I am grateful to be provided with this opportunity.  I will make my concluding remarks at the end of the debate.  Thank you.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and welcome the Minister.  He will discover that this House puts down motions with no other purpose than to achieve a very worthy end.  Senator Norris has proved that by the enthusiasm and commitment with which he has spoken.  I would not support this proposal if it meant going back to the drawing board, but it does not.  This proposal is simply to put parts of the existing light rail proposal underground rather than on the streets.  By doing so, the promised benefits of light rail will be fully delivered and its serious disadvantages minimised.  In effect, the proposal is not an alternative to light rail but rather a modification.  I am anxious the Minister understands this point because there was a fear the proposal involved bringing everything back to square one.  This is not the intention; the idea is to modify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal is fully appropriate to the consultation process the Minister announced before Christmas.  If that process is to have any real meaning and not just become a rubber stamp, it must be open to consider alternatives to the <Col N="483" /> original scheme.  If this is not the case, the consultation process will be empty and pointless.  The process has already shown that businesses operating in Dublin city centre, as Senator Norris said, are profoundly worried about the scheme in its current form.  There is major concern in business circles in Dublin that, as it stands, it will do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>There is abundant evidence from other cities which developed light rail systems that the benefits are far less than promised and the disadvantages much greater than originally feared.  The disruption during the construction phase can send many businesses to the wall and, for those which survive, the phase means increased costs.  There is also evidence that the disruption during construction could seriously affect tourism and that, after construction, the expected transfer of passengers from private cars does not take place.</P>
    <P>Most interestingly, there is evidence that the main business for light rail comes from people who use buses, in other words, people who use buses switch to light rail and it does not reduce traffic.  There is evidence that the reduction of traffic congestion promised by light rail will not be delivered.  As a result of the space the light rail system will take up on existing streets, it may even increase congestion rather than reduce it.  This would be a tragic outcome if it occurred.  Everybody wishes to reduce traffic congestion in Dublin and the question is, how do we go about it?</P>
    <P>We should learn from the experience of other cities and not repeat their mistakes. When the time comes for Brussels to approve the investment funds earmarked for light rail, it will expect us to have learned the lessons of experience and not ignored them.  I appeal to the Minister to take an open minded pragmatic approach to his responsibilities in this matter.  I urge him to examine fully the proposals put forward as part of the process which will lead him and <Col N="484" /> the Government to make the final decision.</P>
    <P>In particular, I ask the Minister to factor in the complete costs of alternative approaches, including the cost of disruption to businesses.  If the alternatives are properly costed, the comparison will be quite different from a comparison based on construction costs alone.  I investigated the positions in three cities.  I was in Lancashire today and I had the opportunity to visit Sheffield yesterday.  The position there is a horror story of business failures; it is exactly what we fear will happen in Dublin.  It did not succeed in reducing traffic; its objectives failed.</P>
    <P>A second example is Strasbourg. The system works there, but it is a different city with large boulevards. One statistic is most interesting: Strasbourg is one quarter the size of Dublin but has five times the number of car parking spaces. The number of available parking spaces per citizen is a multiple of 20 times <i>per capita.</i> There is no comparison.</P>
    <P>The city of Nantes also introduced a light rail system but, unlike Dublin, it has boulevards.  In contrasting the position, one should picture Dawson Street &mdash; which is featured in the current proposal &mdash; if a light rail system is built there and traffic is reduced to one lane. I could not confirm the figure but I understand an expert in the corporation worked out that, if an articulated truck broke down in the centre of Dublin, traffic jams in a 15 square kilometre area around it would develop within 40 minutes.  This horrific figure demonstrates what would happen if we disrupt Dublin's traffic on its narrow streets, which are not geared for the kind of development that is proposed.</P>
    <P>The new methods of tunnelling referred to by Senator Norris are much more efficient in that they make it possible to proceed in a faster time and at much less cost than hitherto.  Given this, there is every likelihood that they have not been costed correctly.</P>
    <P>There is an abundance of evidence here which must be taken into account. I am pleased that the Minister has given <Col N="485" /> us the opportunity in putting forward proposals for consultation.  It gives the city of Dublin the opportunity to tell the Minister that it welcomes them and is delighted he has provided an open hearing, which we hope is genuine.  We also hope that minds have not been fixed and that a flexible approach has been taken to the investment in transport in the city of Dublin that will give the twenty first century a system from which we will benefit, rather than discovering we have damaged our future by taking short cuts, the consequences of which we will never overcome.</P>

However, I have carefully watched this development. I am delighted the Government is proposing a light rail system for Dublin. It is badly needed and to be welcomed, although it is selective in the areas it serves, which is an important issue.</P>
      <P>I enjoyed the trams a little longer than Senator Norris.  They served a network of every village in Dublin and extended to Rathmines, Terenure, Rathgar, Donnybrook, Sandymount, Clonskea, Dún Laoghaire and Dalkey. Senator Hayes will be pleased to note that there was one line to Clontarf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an interest in the trams as my father was an employee of the Dublin United Tramway Company and I still live in one of the houses built by the company for their employees. The tram network was different to what <Col N="486" /> is now proposed.  In addition, since then there has been a tremendous increase in the car population.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn expressed concern about what would happen to Dawson Street.  It is proposed that the street will have two lanes for light rail with one lane remaining for buses and cars. While the light rail system must by its nature be selective with regard to the area it serves, people from catchment areas &mdash; for example that of Donnybrook &mdash; will continue to want to travel to the inner city by bus or car.  The proposal that they will be facilitated with one lane on Dawson Street, the main roadway into the city, is not feasible.</P>
      <P>If the system proceeds as proposed it will cause problems of this kind.  I therefore welcome the motion.  I do not fully agree that it should be a metro system, rather it should be a light rail system which should go underground on reaching the inner core of the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In this way it would not cause the destruction to the city that would arise if the present proposal is implemented.  This is my main concern and it is shared by many of my colleagues on Dublin City Council.  Dublin is a vibrant and prosperous city at present.  We do not want to set back the progress made over the last few years in developing the city.  The financial cost will be serious and we have asked for a meeting with the Minister for Finance to see what compensation can be provided for the difficulties which light rail will cause the business sector.  We can be certain there will be difficulties; for a period it will close a number of businesses in the centre of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This will be compounded by the new developments on the ring road.  People who cannot get into the city will have the choice of driving to the new shopping centres in the outer city and when the light rail system is in place, they might still want to go to these centres, having lost the habit of shopping in the inner city.  It is important that centre city <Col N="487" /> businesses are protected while the light rail system is being put down and there is no better way of doing that than through the system proposed for consideration.</P>
    <P>All the motion asks is that the Government should carry out a feasibility study on an underground system in the context of the proposed light rail system for Dublin.  I spoke today to officials in the traffic department of Dublin Corporation who say the cost of an underground system would be about £100 million &mdash; it is hard to estimate because no studies have been carried out.  The real cost would be the building of underground stations.  It is only reasonable that a feasibility study be carried out before we progress further. As Senators have said, when factors such as disruption and loss of business in the city are included in the cost, an underground system might work out more expensive but it would be in the best interest of commercial life in the city and would leave enough road space for people who still want to bring their cars into the city or come by bus.</P>
    <P>Business life in Dublin depends on people having a choice.  They may want to come by light rail, bus or car.  When my wife wants to shop in Arnotts, she likes to bring her car because if she buys any goods she can put them in the boot and bring them home.  That is not possible with a light rail system.  Shoppers must be facilitated in the carriage of goods and I am glad to see that a number of off-street car parks have been or are in the process of being built to meet that demand.  I ask the Minister to consider the reasonable motion before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues I welcome the Minister, Deputy Lowry, to the Upper House.  It is a pleasure to have him here.  This motion is timely in raising serious questions about the proposal to proceed with a light rail rapid transit system for Dublin and I compliment my friend and colleague, Senator Norris, on his initiative in placing it <Col N="488" /> before the House.  It is significant that the Government side has withdrawn an amendment to the motion.  The Senator's motion was accommodating rather than adversarial and the withdrawal of the amendment, coupled with Senator Doyle's comments, indicates that the question asked by Senator Norris has been answered to some degree.  One hopes the Minister will elaborate on his thinking as regards the provision of an efficient internal transport system for Dublin.</P>
      <P>I read with great interest recommendations which appeared under the title &ldquo;Dublin &mdash; a Unified Proposal&rdquo;, which suggests a mix of an overground and underground system for Dublin.  If implemented, the underground would run through Dublin city centre and provide a valuable rail link to Dublin Airport without adding anything to the costs already estimated for the recently announced Luas transport system.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand why the Government has not proceeded with a rail link between the airport and the city centre. The lack of this link diminishes our capital city in comparison with our European partners and leaves a glaring gap in our infrastructure which has implications for the wider economy, especially tourism related activities. Senator Doyle is right to interpret this as a Dublin issue but in the context of the provision of a rail link to Dublin Airport, it becomes a national matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the Government's decision to proceed with the provision of an LRT for Dublin originates with a recommendation of the Dublin Transport Initiative.  As far back as 1975, the Dublin rail rapid transit study concluded that busways could not provide a viable alternative to rail rapid transit. It reached the conclusion that a rail based public transport system on its own right of way was the only public transport system which could provide the desired user benefits.  However, due to budgetary constraints, the Transport Consultative Commission which reexamined and upheld the conclusions of the DRRTS recommended bus priority <Col N="489" /> measures rather than the bus-rail integrated approach which is at the heart of Senator Norris' motion.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that, as some staff members of the original DRRTS were also principal consultants for the Dublin Transport Initiative study, it could be reasonably assumed that both studies would agree on recommendations. However, surprisingly enough, this was not the case.  The Dublin Transport Initiative recommendations for an on-street LRT in the city centre are contrary to both earlier studies and seem to have emerged only recently in the thinking on the provision of an efficient rail system.</P>
    <P>I would say to Senator Enright that I do not often get the Minister's ear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is very kind of the Minister.  I know he listens and I greatly appreciate it.  The DTI phase two published work adopted by the Government did not provide detailed technical costings.  It is almost certain that modification of its light rapid train on street centre recommendations will have to be considered.  It will be a rather serious matter if, as has been suggested is the case, modifications will have to be made to the decision taken by the Government in this regard.  If these modifications are not made, the much hyped concept of an LRT system for Dublin will fail dismally to achieve its transport objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations published by the group known as Unified Proposal have reopened the debate on the optimum public transport system for Dublin and the suburbs.  I fully take on board Senator Doyle's point.  I am not old enough to remember the trams. However, I was born in Dublin and because of medical problems &mdash; which, I am glad to say were finally resolved to everybody's satisfaction &mdash; I had to <Col N="490" /> spend much time in the city during my first two or three years and I have a faint recollection of being carried on the tram to Rathgar.</P>
    <P>The main recommendations of the Unified Proposal's policy document can be summed up as follows.  Public transport to and within the inner city would be provided by three radial DART-LRT rail routes, namely, Sandyford to Liffey Junction, Tallaght to Connolly Station and Dublin Airport to Liffey Junction.  The three proposed DART-LRT routes would dovetail to the existing Blanchardstown, Clondalkin and DART suburban rail networks.  Therefore, optimum use could be made of existing rail transport infrastructure. This would maximise the use of the proposed £198 million of EU and Government funding for the Dublin light rail system.</P>
    <P>The time scale for the implementation of this proposal is estimated to be shorter than that of the current Luas on street proposal for a variety of reasons. Most importantly, as my colleagues said, widespread support has been declared for this proposal by the environmental and business communities.  Has the Minister given any consideration to the document prepared by Unified Proposal?</P>
    <P>In case I am accused of opposing a policy decision taken by my colleague, the former Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Séamus Brennan, I wish to put on the record that as far back as 7 April 1991 the then Minister invited proposals from the private sector to &ldquo;take part in the upgrading of the transport system&rdquo;.  At the same time, the then Minister invited potential contributors to show &ldquo;how they can play a part in developing a more modern transportation system for the city and county&rdquo;.  On 23 October 1991, at the national transport conference of the Chartered Institute of Transport in Ireland, the then Minister once again invited the private sector to &ldquo;take an active part in the development of the modern public transport system for the Dublin area&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> Since 1991 Unified Proposal submitted a document on the DART-LRT to the Department of the Environment and to all relevant agencies.  In October 1994 clarification of issues raised by the relevant Departments was submitted to the Department of the Environment and to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  A response is still awaited some 18 months later, although I appreciate there was a change in Government.</P>
    <P>While I am always reluctant to single out senior civil servants because they cannot defend themselves and the Minister is responsible for policy, I question the role of the Department's advisers over the past ten years.  Unless I am persuaded to the contrary, I conclude that a mindset against an underground system for Dublin developed in the early stages and advice to successive Ministers has closed their minds to an alternative to an overground light rail system. I am interested in the Minister's response and I welcome his clarification of the role of civil servants in pursuing their policies, with which the public does not always agree.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why the Government did not sanction and continues to refuse debate on the provision of an underground rail link between Dublin Airport and the city centre.  According to the Unified Proposal recommendations, cost would not be a factor and the disruption in the inner city which could be caused by an overground light rail system could be avoided and the project completed in less time.  These serious questions must be addressed; they cannot be ignored by the Civil Service, the Government or those appointed to the DTI.  The long term future of this city and its environs cannot be treated like this.  Will we repeat the same mistakes made in the 1950s when branch lines were closed and the tram system disbanded?  We should not ask future generations to clean up the mess we leave by pursuing questionable transport policies without listening to alternative arguments.</P>

      <P>A number of colleagues in North Tipperary would welcome the opportunity for me to take a seat here.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important subject.  I thank Members for their contributions, particularly Senator Norris, whose speech was informative, enlightening and constructive. I acknowledge his deep understanding of Dublin and its requirements. I will take into account the views expressed because they have been put forward in a positive and constructive manner.  I want to show how the questions raised can be further addressed in a structured and objective way.</P>
      <P>The provision of high quality, fast and dependable public transport is critical to the future prosperity of Dublin.  As a modern European capital city, Dublin requires a mass transit system which is capable of transporting large numbers of people along the main transport corridors in comfort and with the assurance of fast and reliable journey times.  The need for a mass transit system for Dublin has long been recognised.  The first and, until recently, the only detailed study of the subject, the Dublin rail rapid transit study, was commissioned by CIE as long ago as 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost 20 years later, a new study of the capital's transportation needs was undertaken in a renewed effort to find solutions to Dublin's traffic and transport problems.  That study developed into the Dublin Transportation Initiative or DTI.  The DTI final report, published in August 1995, is the product of <Col N="493" /> more than four years of detailed analysis and extensive and local consultation. It involved all the organisations responsible for transport in the city &mdash; commercial and business interests, public representatives, community and environmental groups and the public.</P>
    <P>The DTI final report recommends an integrated transport strategy involving an extensive programme of investment in roads, public transport and traffic management, complemented by improved enforcement.  There is a real commitment to the implementation of the DTI transport strategy.  The Government has decided that the transport strategy recommended in the DTI final report will provide the general policy framework for the future development of the transport system in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>DTI was carried out with the active encouragement and financial support of the European Commission.  As a result, major elements of the DTI transport strategy have been included in the Operational Programme for Transport, 1994 to 1999.  This provides for an investment of over £600 million in DTI measures over that period.  The Government has established the Dublin Transportation Office to oversee implementation of the recommended transport strategy and to ensure the continuity of the land use and transportation planning process.</P>
    <P>In the case of public transport, DTI has recommended a number of major investment projects including the development of a light rail network; the introduction of quality bus corridors; improved public transport interchange facilities in the city centre; extension and upgrading of the DART and suburban rail services; provision of secure park and ride facilities on the public transport network and an integrated ticketing system for all public transport services.  In arriving at its recommended strategy DTI examined a range of possible options including the construction of a comprehensive DART network similar to that envisaged in the Dublin rail rapid transit study.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> That study envisaged the rapid rail system being completed in stages, the first of which would be the electrification of the Howth-Bray suburban railway line.  The Howth-Bray DART service began in July 1984.  However, the remaining elements of the DART network were never implemented due to funding constraints.  The extensive DART netwrok evaluated by DTI comprised lines to Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Leopardstown and the airport, with significant underground sections in the city centre.  It would have meant a very high capital cost of almost £600 million, or almost exactly what we plan to spend on all DTI measures over the six years from 1994 to 1999.</P>
    <P>On the basis of its examination, DTI concluded that an extensive DART network was not viable in economic terms and would have a very large negative rate of return.  It also concluded that the distance between the city centre and the western new towns was too short to permit the economic operation of an underground system.  DTI also found that an underground would be less accessible than an on-street light rail system. However, it did recommend the inclusion of the existing rail lines to Greystones and Malahide in the DART system and I have already announced the Greystones extension.</P>
    <P>DTI found that a comprehensive light rail network could be put in place at a far lower cost than a similar DART system. It concluded that a light rail network represented a sound investment in cost benefit terms and would be able to cover its operating costs from fares revenue. Light rail is not a new idea.  It is the modern form of the Hill of Howth tramway and other street running trams which operated in Dublin in the earlier part of this century.  However, light rail has evolved considerably in the decades since trams disappeared from the streets of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The modern equivalent comes in the form of quiet, attractive, streamlined, single deck vehicles which fit well into the modern city centre environment. Unlike conventional heavy rail or metro <Col N="495" /> systems, light rail is flexible.  It can run through most city streets, sharing the road space with general traffic and even pedestrians.  It combines the reliability, speed and comfort of the traditional railway with the flexibility and efficiency of the bus.</P>
    <P>The evidence from around the world is that light rail is helping to reverse the decline in public transport in urban areas and this has been responsible for the rapid growth of light rail systems in the last ten to 15 years.  Since the 1975 Dublin rail rapid transit study, light rail has been successfully introduced in many countries.  Indeed, light rail is now the most common way of upgrading public transport in cities around the world.</P>
    <P>Throughout Europe there are many examples of light rail systems.  Some cities like Amsterdam have upgraded their existing tram systems, while many French cities &mdash; such as Grenoble, Nantes and Strasbourg &mdash; have built completely new systems.  In the UK, light rail systems have been implemented in Manchester and Sheffield since 1992 and plans for further light rail lines in Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and Croydon in London are at an advanced stage of development. Even the United States, hardly a mecca for public transport, has been won over. Cities like Portland and San Diego have built good LRT systems.  What was new and unproven in 1975, is now a proven and successful public transport system.</P>
    <P>The advantages of light rail over conventional rail or metro systems are numerous.  Light rail offers a system of transport which uses less power, produces less pollution than either DART or buses.  Light rail is also much more accessible, particularly in the city centre where stops on the street are more accessible for people with reduced mobility than underground DART stations.  In addition, light rail has a proven capacity to support the economic development and regeneration of urban areas by delivering passengers directly into commercial areas.  The recommended <Col N="496" /> network in Dublin has been chosen with this in mind.</P>
    <P>The core light rail network recommended by DTI provides for lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely &mdash; via the old Harcourt Street railway line &mdash; and Ballymun at an estimated cost of £300 million in 1993 prices.  The operational programme for transport 1994 to 1999 provides for a total expenditure in the region of £200 million on light rail during that period with substantial European Union support.</P>
    <P>The DTI final report endorsed this expenditure as about the limit of what could be physically implemented during that time.  An expanded network of lines to Finglas, Dublin Airport and Swords has also been recommended for future implementation.</P>
    <P>I launched CIÉ's public consultation programme on the planned light rail links to Tallaght and Dundrum on 12 December 1995.  This gives people a real opportunity to express their views and have them fully considered by the project team.  The target is to get phase I of the core light rail network in operation by the year 2000.  Phase 2 is planned to follow immediately afterwards.</P>
    <P>New legislation will be introduced shortly which, among other things, will provide for a mandatory public inquiry into all aspects of the proposed light rail network.  In particular, it will enable people who believe that light rail is not the appropriate solution to Dublin's transport problems or that other routes should be given priority, to put forward their views and challenge the DTI recommendations and detailed planning work of CIÉ's project team.</P>
    <P>As the Minister responsible, I will be obliged by the legislation to fully and objectively consider the inspector's report on the public inquiry and the submissions made by interested people before making any legally binding, final decision on this issue.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed about the likely extent of disruption in Dublin city centre during construction of the light rail system.  Clearly it would be impossible to implement a major <Col N="497" /> construction project on the scale of the light rail project without disrupting traffic.  However, I wish to assure Senators that CIÉ, as the implementing agency, is committed to ensuring that construction of the system is done on a basis which minimises inconvenience to people and businesses as far as possible. This will require careful planning, effective traffic management and enforcement, extensive public consultation and the co-operation and goodwill of the people of Dublin.  I must also say that an underground system could not be built without significant disruption.</P>
    <P>A great deal of valuable time and effort, and not inconsiderable expertise, has been invested in the DTI process. As I mentioned earlier, we are fortunate to have access to significant funding for DTI-related developments in the greater Dublin area through the operational programme for transport.  Our priority now must be to ensure that the opportunity to make a substantial and lasting improvement to the capital's transport system is fully availed of during the current Structural Funds round. We cannot afford the luxury of more studies to re-examine the fundamental basis of the DTI strategy, which we recently adopted.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate that we can afford to improve our public transport services. However, the current favourable financial circumstances carry with them a great onus to get things done.  We cannot afford to spend all of the available £600 million on just one element of the DTI strategy, whether that is on major roads or on an underground system.  If the strategy is to work properly, we must achieve a balance between investments in roads, light rail, quality bus corridors, traffic management and so on.</P>
    <P>Most people think Dublin's traffic and transport problems have been a source of discussion, debate and argument for too long and that there has been precious little to show in terms of progress and concrete results.  That is about to change.  We have reached the point of no return.  The time for talking <Col N="498" /> is coming to a close &mdash; it is time for action.</P>
    <P>I would like the final agreement on the project to reflect the legitimate concerns raised in the House and through the consultation process.  I invite Members who have raised concerns to convey them to the project team through the consultative process which I established.  I know the views raised here are firmly held and legitimate.  I hope the project team, when it reaches a final conclusion, will reflect the views of Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment those who tabled this motion and I thank the Minister for listening to Members.  I have travelled to many countries over the years, yet Dublin must be one of the last cities in the western world which does not have an underground or a light rail system.  Sydney has the successful monorail, but there was public outcry about the disadvantages to that beautiful city which would result from that rail system. However, it has become almost a tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>An easy flow of traffic and the ability to get from place to place quickly is a priority for those living in or visiting a city to do business.  I welcome anything which will free up traffic in Dublin. Dublin Airport is the only airport in a European capital which does not have an underground or a light rail service. Dublin urgently needs a light rail system to the airport given its population and its rapid expansion.  There are considerable traffic jams on Drumcondra Road each morning and evening; people sit in traffic for 30 to 45 minutes.  This makes a nonsense of existing traffic plans and regulations.</P>
      <P>I congratulate those associated with this proposal.  The opportunity has been given to those who oppose it to express their views.  I hope it reaches a speedy conclusion and that the Minister and his officials will be enlightened by the views of the people of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear the contribution made by Senator Doyle who represents a Dublin constituency.  Most <Col N="499" /> Members live outside the Dublin area. Senator Ross, Senator Quinn, Senator Norris and Senator Hayes have first hand knowledge of Dublin's traffic problems.</P>
    <P>I have made a reasonable contribution to providing employment to people in the north inner city of Dublin. However, I am disappointed that Parnell Square, which is easily recognisable for people from rural areas who visit the city, is not being fully utilised.  It provides a natural U-turn for transport travelling from one part of the city to another.  I understand it is proposed to halt the light rail system midway through O'Connell Street.  Dublin does not end with O'Connell Street.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his distinguished career, has shown great commitment to rural communities and has achieved a great deal for a man so young.  His contribution to the Gaelic Athletic Association and Semple Stadium is unequalled.  However, I must impress upon him the importance of addressing the issues of the north inner city, the expansion of Croke Park and the proposed development from O'Connell Street to the airport.  This is a magnificent opportunity which must be grasped before land and property values on the north side of the city reach levels similar to those south of the River Liffey.  This matter must also be addressed following careful consideration.</P>
    <P>The citizens of Dublin's northside have a greater need for this type of transport than those who live south of the River Liffey.  Employers, car owners and those in need of such transport are being victimised.  The opportunities afforded to people living south of the River Liffey should be afforded to those who were born and bred in the city of Dublin.  This opportunity should be availed of.</P>
    <P>Having listened to all sides of the argument, I am sure that the Minister will not waste time bringing this matter to a conclusion.  The possibility exists to create much employment and everyone can benefit from the work opportunities <Col N="500" /> on offer.  At a time when people are availing of all opportunities, I look forward to the day when the light rail system comes into operation.  I hope this will be in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister, Deputy Lowry, is responsible for this project because he has a track record of cutting through reports and bureaucracy and achieving results.  I am confident that he will obtain the best results for the people of Dublin as a result of this initiative.  I congratulate Senator Norris and the Independent Members for tabling this timely motion.</P>
      <P>This is, I believe, the first opportunity the Oireachtas has had to look at this issue since the DTI released its report in August.  It is an important issue for Dubliners and, indeed, for those who are looking at an integrated transport system for the entire country. Senator Norris is to be congratulated on bringing this motion before the House, as is the Government side for ensuring that the motion will be passed.</P>
      <P>As Senator Norris said, we are not looking to throw out the DTI report. Members who represent constituencies in this city and county realise that, unfortunately, there are defects in the proposals of the DTI, particularly as they relate to light rail.  There were many expectations for light rail and many of them were connected with the grandiose exaggerations of EU funds which were voiced in 1992.  The £8.6 billion suddenly became £6.2 billion and, as a result, we have had to reduce the number of rail lines from three to two.  Fintan O'Toole wrote a column for <i>The Irish Times</i> last year under a headline which put this issue in context.  The headline read: &ldquo;Transport initiative offers most to those who have&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a representative on a local authority in south County Dublin.  While my colleague, Senator Doyle, has aptly described the situation in Dublin city, I wish to talk briefly about the south and south-west of our city.  Despite the comments of the last speaker, it is not a <Col N="501" /> question of a conflict between northside and southside.  The issue is far too serious to look at it from that point of view.  The DART, unfortunately, was caught up in that argument.</P>
    <P>The south-west of this city has the largest number of young people in the country and one of the lowest rates of car ownership.  It is an area with new facilities but those facilities are not connected to the services which should be available in any community.  That is the problem in the south-west.  While we welcomed the extension of the light rail to Tallaght there are huge tracts of that community which have been pushed aside as a result of the findings of the DTI.  They have been forgotten.  I am referring in particular to west Tallaght, a community with up to 70 per cent unemployment, huge numbers of young people and a poor provision of services, including leisure services.  We have forgotten them which is why I am reminded of Fintan O'Toole's article which stated that those who have, have gained most as a result of the decision of the DTI.</P>
    <P>There is great disappointment in the community I represent because areas which were headlined through LRT because of their social disadvantage have been forgotten.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to make that point in this debate.  I am also delighted the Minister has welcomed the consultation stage and to hear that small changes can be made during that stage before the proposal goes through the Houses to become law.  This debate is the first part of that consultation process and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>I have a number of questions with regard to LRT.  Why is it that where the report refers to a park and ride facility, there is no such facility for the community of Tallaght beside the new town centre?  Second, why did the DTI exclude the possibility of using underground? Following consultations I had today, I have been made aware that the DTI excluded that possibility.  Third, why are there such discrepancies between official figures for the cost of <Col N="502" /> creating a mile of underground tunnel and those quoted in other countries and by other people in this country?</P>
    <P>There are many unanswered questions following the DTI report.  I hope they will be answered as we go through this consultation stage.  We have a chance to get this matter right.  The Minister is known to be a man who cuts through bureaucracy and achieves results and I am sure he will achieve a good result for the people of Dublin when the consultation stage is over.  I am grateful that he has taken this opportunity to hear our points of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listeners to this debate might wonder what a Donegal man might have to say about a light rail system in Dublin.  However, I am very interested in this matter.  I join other Senators in welcoming the Minister.  I hope my contribution will be of some value.</P>
      <P>I am not concerned with whether the rail system goes underground or above ground or where it goes.  However, I am concerned about the cost of the system and, according to the Minister, the estimated cost is £600 million.  I am a public representative for the north-west. Whether I am classified as a Border county representative or as a representative of the west, I like to think I come from an area which has been deprived of funding from every national development plan and from EU contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be crystal clear about spending under the national development plan and from the £7 billion that has come to Ireland from the EU.  We have a straightforward option &mdash; we can call in the monitoring committee.  We will do that; we will ask the EU monitoring committee to check that funding provided by the EU is fairly spent on this island taking into consideration the major disadvantages in the west.  There is no point crying with crocodile tears at the bishops' conference, appointing a Minister of State for the West and wearing all the outward trappings of concern to indicate that the west will receive funding when, having started to build a <Col N="503" /> prison in Castlerea, it is discovered that there are not enough funds to continue it.  I am not criticising that decision as it will probably rectify itself.  Nevertheless, it is an indication to those who are concerned and who have been watching the situation unfold that the west has received the worst of all deals.  The only fallback available to us is to ask the monitoring committee to ensure that the Border counties and the west will not be excluded once again.</P>
    <P>Taking funding that is provided by the EU to provide a light rail system for Dublin will be very expensive.  Anybody of average intelligence knows it will cost a huge amount of money.  There will be a new rail line from Belfast to Dublin and the roads between the two cities will be upgraded to a dual carriageway. In addition there is air transport between the two cities.  Although all the facilities are already there, the Government continues to build more.  That will leave the west and the Border counties even more isolated.</P>
    <P>I can offer another example.  I have spoken about the natural gas industry and its development.  I wish to deal with it again in the context of the expenditure involved because that is my main interest.  That development cost £1,200 million.  Some time ago Shannon Airport was complaining about losing traffic because of the decision to allow transatlantic flights to overfly Shannon and fly direct to Dublin.  A Government of which I was a supporter gave £5 million to Shannon to secure a link to the natural gas pipeline.  That shows the benefit of natural gas.</P>
    <P>Although we are not discussing natural gas, it is related to funding and expenditure.  The west and the Border counties did not receive a single penny of European funding; they were conned. Representatives of Bord Gáis came to Cavan and Monaghan and informed people of the company's plans to bring natural gas to Belfast, Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo and Letterkenny.  The company received EU funding for this plan which was a con and from which the <Col N="504" /> west and the Border counties were excluded.</P>
    <P>A light rail system for Dublin is necessary.  All people on this island know that Dublin must deal with its serious traffic and transport problems.  I attended a conference in Brussels at which a solution to serious transport congestion was highlighted.  All heavy freight lorries were not permitted to enter the centre of the city.  I support measures to tackle transport problems in Dublin but I ask the Minister to recognise that there are people on this island who feel they are excluded from every expenditure proposal.  The fact that a Minister from Clare will be responsible for the Border counties clearly indicates that there is no focus on and recognition of the needs of people in the west and the Border counties; crocodile tears are shed for them.  I hope the EU monitoring committee will not find that the Minister has done another injustice to the people of the west who expect a fair share of funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn is a man for whom I have great respect because he has made money.  It is a great mark of a man to be able to do this honestly, as he seems to have done.  He recommends the proposal for a unified transport system for Dublin, including an underground railway element.  I am not sure from where the funding for this will come.  If the Minister could announce in the morning that there will be an underground railway system in Dublin he would love to do so, as would have the previous Minister and as would the next Minister.  However, this project would be expensive.  We should aim for such a system eventually and I have no problem supporting the motion, which the Government has agreed to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to toll capping on roads, there is a toll on the West Link bridge but I would hate to see it extended further along that road.  It has been stated that 45,000 cars a day use this road but I think this will increase to about 70,000 cars a day.  I would be worried about too much tolling on roads <Col N="505" /> because this would probably have the effect of traffic spilling back into estates from which we are trying to divert it.</P>
    <P>If Senator Quinn thinks this project can be completed economically I am prepared to go along with him.  I would like the Minister, in looking at the light rail system, to consider two proposals. The Harcourt Street line is being developed as far as Crazy Prices in Dundrum. I suggest that it be extended further to the Sandyford industrial estate, where there are about 7,000 workers; I do not know how much this would cost.  Dún Laoghaoire-Rathdown County Council passed a motion asking the Minister to consider this proposal. The old line is still there and another station would not cost much and would have a large catchment area.  The terminus at the Harcourt Street end of the line should be brought closer to the DART terminus.  I do not know if there is already a plan to do this.</P>
    <P>The proposal for an underground system is good and Dublin could benefit from it.  We could have a part underground and part overground system as many cities have.  I do not know from where the money for this will come.  A sum of £600 million was mentioned; Senator Norris may have the exact figures. If the Minister could provide such a system, he would do so.  I hope that some day not too far down the line this will be possible.  European funds will dry up shortly and I am not sure where we can go from there.  Perhaps private enterprise could help fund this project.</P>

      <P>The Minister is a good man to make a deal and he may be able to consider some of these options.  I would like him to extend the light rail system to the Sandyford industrial estate.  This would make a great deal of sense and would not cost that much extra because the old line still exists and has not been built on and no compulsory purchase orders would be required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those who spoke in the debate, particularly Senator Quinn.  It takes a good deal for Senator Quinn, who is in business in a big way and does not take these issues lightly, to make the profoundly certain and deeply researched speech he made tonight.  In point after point, in a concise way, he nailed our colours to the mast and I ask the Minister to look again at this speech.</P>
      <P>This Government and the previous one supported the DTI so we cannot make a political football out of this.  If anybody was wrong, everybody was.  I would say that everybody was only partially wrong.  The brief given to the DTI was too narrow and restrictive.  It specifically restricted the notion of an underground system and this is why it is not part of the DTI's proposal.</P>
      <P>There are many inconsistencies, even in the Minister's speech.  However, I was profoundly relieved that he modified it while he delivered it.  This shows that he is a Minister who can think on his feet. He said that he would be open during the planning consultative process.  His script stated that the time for talking was over and that now is the time for action.  I am glad he modified that by saying that the time for talking is coming to a close.  This leaves a window of opportunity and it is through that window that we propose to look at the vexed problem of the DTI.</P>
      <P>The DTI found that an underground system would be less accessible than an on street light rail system.  This is not true and the DTI must rethink this. Every study done has shown that the underground system is the most accessible according to the scientific criteria applied.  The Minister said that, unlike conventional heavy rail or metro systems, light rail is flexible and can run through most city streets sharing road space with general traffic.  It could not be less flexible.  The point was made brilliantly by Senator Doyle.  It will dislodge traffic and confine cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that evidence from around the world shows that light rail is helping to reverse the decline of public transport <Col N="507" /> in urban areas.  This is simply not the case.  The Simpson local public transport systems traffic engineering control survey of May 1988, quoted in this document, directly contradicts that assertion.  I can give fact after fact to challenge the conclusions and methodology of the DTI.  The Minister said an underground system could not be built without significant disruption.  That is true but it would be much less significant than the disruption that would be caused by the proposals of the DTI.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn and others mentioned Strasbourg.  A report from the Strasbourg Chamber of Commerce said:</P>
    <P>The composition of shops along the route of the trams changed.  Many of the traditional shops dealing in durable or bulky goods, such as furniture etc., moved away.  They were replaced by boutiques, sweetshops etc.  This development seemed to fly in the face of EU and Government national policy for protecting the diversity of inner city areas.</P>
    <P>I am quoting a chamber of commerce report from a city mentioned by the Minister which clearly challenges what he has been advised.</P>
    <P>Another point made against having an underground system was the expense involved.  Modern technology has advanced along lines which make tunnelling much more efficient, rapid and much less costly than the Minister assumes.  Developing the light rail transport system will, for example, dislodge services like gas, light, electricity and sewage, along the street.  Will that not be expensive and a disruption?  It will be a huge and major disruption.</P>
    <P>Of course people do not like to toll roads; who does?  Who likes to pay for anything these days?  However, there is no doubt this is the direction in which we will move.  We are talking about tolling the ring system.  If that was done, a proportion, say 10 per cent, of the estimated tolls ploughed back into the system would underpin the European Investment Bank funding built into this <Col N="508" /> proposal and fund £170 million worth of it.  If one looks at the arguments, one can see that our arguments are strong on an economic basis.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn passed me a note to tell me he forgot to mention one point; I am glad he did because it allows me to say it.  Strasbourg also had to pay massive compensation to those businesses that were disrupted.  They were able to take Strasbourg to European legal institutions and secure compensation.  Dublin city will have to pay compensation for this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, but we should ensure it does not happen.  We can go forward together.</P>
      <P>This is an open minded Minister and I hope he will be kind enough to invite us to make our submission to him.  I will be writing to the Minister to see if I and my advisers, who are really responsible for this plan, can meet him and his officials.  In a totally uninformed and amateur way many years ago, I felt there should be an underground system for Dublin.  I was contradicted many times and was given technical arguments; they all proved to be specious.</P>
      <P>I agree with speakers on this and the other side of the House who wistfully said that if this Minister could produce an underground system for Dublin, would he, his predecessor or his successor not have done it?  That is precisely my point.  The Minister now has the opportunity not to abandon DTI but to incorporate this element as part of it. All we want is to send the network underground roughly at the point of the two canals.  We are still using the Harcourt Street line and the various infrastructural reserved busways that already exist but are obviating the clear difficulties that exist when one gets into the inner city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn has just come back for this debate from Sheffield.  He described its transport system as a horror story <Col N="509" /> and the same is true of Manchester. However, their city layouts are different. They have infinitely fewer points of conflict available, between road traffic on the one hand and light rail on the other, as does Dublin, which is an 18th century city with little, narrow and riddling streets.</P>
    <P>I had a busy day yesterday.  I had to cross and recross the Sandymount Avenue level crossing.  I was stuck half a dozen times waiting for the DART to pass.  On one occasion one train came from the Dún Laoghaire direction but I also had to wait for another train to pass from the other direction before the barriers came up.  My frustration mounted. I could understand the people in Los Angeles who take out a rifle and shoot people who hold them up on the roads. I would not do this but there will be bloodshed on the streets of Dublin if we have this type of light rail system and the dislodging of traffic in the Dawson Street area.  I hope the Minister will maintain an open posture, welcome us in and listen and not say the time for talking is over.  We must have a parallel investigation into this modification of what is otherwise an excellent plan.</P>
    <P>The average passenger distance to stations under this new system will be approximately half of what it is between the two DART routes.  Travel times will be half what will be expected on the LRT.  The average distance for a commuter to walk to or from a station from anywhere in the city centre will be 350 metres.  The estimated operational revenues for each new radial route will be four times that of the two existing DART routes, Bray and Howth.  There is an absolutely unbeatable case for at least a re-examination of the situation to allow the possibility of the incorporation of this element in the Dublin inner city area.</P>

Does anyone seriously think that Japanese, Australian, American or British tourists will stand in College Green and take a photograph of the light rail infrastructure while the train goes past?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>My proposal asks the Minister for Health to provide more finance for Letterkenny General Hospital. The hospital embarked on a number of renovations of its casualty department in early December.  It may have been the wrong time of the year to start it because it created a great degree of chaos in the hospital.  Around the same time every year there is a rush of admissions to every general hospital throughout the country and Letterkenny is no <Col N="511" /> different.  There is an upsurge in asthma and bronchitis problems at this time of year resulting in an undue demand on beds.</P>
      <P>An enormous number of beds were placed in the corridors of Letterkenny General Hospital.  Most of these were surgical and medical cases.  On a number of visits to the hospital &mdash; which I visit quite regularly &mdash; I was set upon by staff and patients who said it was not good enough that so many beds should be in the corridors.  It creates embarrassing problems for patients.  Staff are overworked because no extra staff were brought in to deal with this problem.  I was concerned about what would have happened if there had been a fire.  Do the health and safety regulations applying to the hospital allow for the placing of beds in corridors?  Beds in the corridors make it nearly impossible for people to get out in the event of a fire. I do not want to think about what might have happened if something had gone wrong.</P>
      <P>Patients do not like to be accommodated in corridors.  One old lady of 75 told me it is not very nice if one wants to go to the toilet.  I raised the matter with hospital management and I was assured that beds would be provided. Two days later I was called back to the hospital by a lady whose husband was admitted to hospital suffering from meningitis.  He was on a bed in a corridor and we had to make a strong case to have him put into a ward.  Two wards with eight beds were opened to try to relieve the situation.  I was saddened to learn that no action had been taken on assurances given to me at my previous meeting with hospital management.</P>
      <P>When I asked why no extra staff had been employed I was told the hospital did not have any extra staff and could not get any.  However I had letters from six nurses who had applied for work in the hospital and were refused.  This is not good enough.  I wrote to the North-Western Health Board and am still awaiting an acknowledgement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> I looked at the budget for Letterkenny General Hospital; net expenditure was almost £17 million in 1994 and £8.1 million in 1988.  Staff are asking how this budget is spent.  This question must be answered.  The staffing levels in Letterkenny General Hospital compared to other hospitals are not good and more staff must be provided.  An explanation must be given as to where that £17 million is being spent.</P>
    <P>Nurses are threatening action at the moment and the £20 million package for nurses in general promised by the Minister is not enough.  Teachers were offered a package of the order of £65 million.  I have nothing against teachers but nurses work much longer and tougher hours.  The nurses are angry. The situation in Letterkenny is probably similar to other hospitals but it is particularly bad there.  The staff deserve to know what is going on and how the money is spent.  I ask that more funding be provided.</P>

      <P>I join with Senator Maloney in welcoming the Minister for Health.  This kind of contact is useful.  I also support Senator Maloney's request for more money for Letterkenny General Hospital if that is possible.  I have been a public representative and a Member of this House for 28 years.  I have been a member of Donegal County Council for 38 years.  I know there is no magic wand to provide money and that the Minister is constantly under pressure but I have an obligation to answer one of the issues raised.  Senator Maloney says he wrote to the North-Western Health Board and did not get a reply.  He did not say that he first made a public statement, after the North-Western Health Board&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  Withdraw the remark.  I wrote to the chief executive officer first and I am still awaiting a reply.  That was before I was asked to make a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was present when this matter was discussed at the North-Western <Col N="513" /> Health Board.  The North-Western Health Board found it necessary to make a public statement.  The Minister will recognise that our health board has one of the best chief executive officers in the country.  He has developed the health services at a low cost.  He has been an excellent chief executive officer and has been put in charge of another district as well as his own.  The management of the health services in the north-west has been excellent. I say that while supporting the proposal to provide extra funding for Letterkenny General Hospital.</P>
      <P>Part of what Senator Maloney said is right.  We have overcrowding for a period of the year but I have long experience in this area; I have been a hospital patient.  I slept in the corridor of the hospital but I also got first class treatment there.  If a patient is taken into hospital at 11 p.m. or midnight and all the beds are full, he or she will get very satisfactory medical care.  I dispute that patients are left more than one night in a corridor.  A great effort is made by the nursing staff to accommodate them in wards.</P>
      <P>The Minister has access to this information and can establish the facts.  I am describing the situation as accurately as I can.  I want to put on the record that before work started on extending the casualty department in the Letterkenny General Hospital, the chief executive officer had consultation with hospital management.  There was not a single objection; there was total agreement that it was necessary to extend the casualty department.  That work was undertaken with the agreement of all the staff. There were no disruptions, not a single bed was displaced.  I will accept the Minister's word on this and will apologise to the House if he can tell me otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): It is easy for me to reply because Senator McGowan has already covered points raised by Senator Maloney.  My comments will be relatively superfluous.  I was asked to address the need to provide funding to Letterkenny General Hospital for an increased nursing staff.  My reply relates to that matter rather than the other issues raised, although I will comment on those also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deployment of staff within ceiling and budget is a matter for health board management.  Individual health boards are in the best position to determine how to deploy their own personnel, with due regard to the different priorities and <Col N="515" /> service requirements throughout each board's area of responsibility.  As part of its decision in 1995 on the recruitment of public service staff, the Government agreed that recruitment could proceed in the health services in line with the parameters on overall spending, with particular emphasis on service areas due for development.  As a result, 1,200 additional posts were created in the health services in 1995 and a further 600 posts will be created in 1996.</P>
    <P>In the context of this agreement the North-Western Health Board received approval for the recruitment of 74 additional staff in 1995.  Seventeen of these posts were nursing posts, of which seven were allocated to Letterkenny General Hospital.  With regard to 1996, discussions are ongoing between the board and the Department concerning service developments and associated staffing.  The strengthening of staffing levels must be considered by the board in the general context of balancing all service development priorities with the total amount of funding available and its total employment ceiling.  In the normal course, staffing levels for individual units within each hospital are adjusted regularly to take account of service pressures.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McGowan that the North-Western Health Board provides a very good service.  Services in the north-west have improved enormously over the years and the chief executive officer, his staff, the management staff and the nursing, medical, attendant and paramedical staff should be congratulated. Regarding overall staff levels, between 1990 and 1994 the number of staff at Letterkenny General Hospital increased by 67 from 609 to 676.  There was also an increase in 1995, so the North-Western Health Board or Letterkenny General Hospital have not been short-changed in any way.</P>
    <P>We all agree that once builders come into a hospital, which must be run as an <Col N="516" /> ongoing concern while structural modifications are made, it leads to a situation where, even with the best will in the world, it is most difficult for staff to continue to provide a service as heretofore and cope with the disruption caused by the building work.  Any woman at home will say that if a new kitchen is being built, it is not as easy to carry on with the normal work of the house while it is happening.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of choosing December to make the modifications, it is normal that all elective surgery is cancelled in hospitals after 8 December. There is a winding down and this also happens during the summer when consultants are on holidays.  There is more scope for building work for approximately three weeks at Christmas and also in the summer during the high holiday period when elective work is cancelled.  While the hospital is extremely busy &mdash; and particularly so this year as a result of the 'flu epidemic &mdash; it was possible to concentrate on emergency activity because the elective work was out of the way, as it was in other hospitals.</P>
    <P>There was no reference in the matter raised on the Adjournment to the development of the new accident and emergency department.  I cannot comment, therefore, on the level of disruption caused.  However, I accept the Senator's point, because once builders come on site to extend an existing facility rather than build a new hospital, there will be disruption.</P>
    <P>Regarding the nurses pay dispute, as Minister for Health, I would like it to be resolved on the basis of a negotiated settlement in accordance with the provisions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the need <Col N="517" /> for the Minister for Finance to include the Army and Garda representative associations in negotiations leading up to national wage agreements.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the exclusion of these representative associations from the negotiations.</P>
      <P>With the exception of the IBOA and Dublin Institute of Technology ASA, the other affiliates of the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations are neither individually nor collectively represented in the national determination forum.  This places these bodies, which include all the members of the Garda and Army, at a most severe disadvantage relative to other groups in society which have a voice at the national pay table. Although the affiliates of ICPSA do not play any role whatsoever in the determining of the agreements, they are, in effect, bound by the terms of the pay negotiated by other parties.  This is completely unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that members of the Garda Síochána and Defence Forces, who protect the Constitution and democratic structures of the country, are treated in such an undemocratic fashion in relation to their pay and conditions of employment.  I understand meetings of the associations with representatives from the official side have received a standard response: that they are represented at pay talks by their employers who are well aware of their position and that the affiliates can be consulted and appraised through the conciliation council schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These agreements have been put to the Army and Garda on a take it or leave it basis.  However, they were hammered out to cater for the interests of the participants who drew up the agreements. The talks and agreements have not addressed or considered the legitimate concerns of the Army and Garda. As a result, a great deal of frustration has built up within the representative bodies.  This view is totally understandable, <Col N="518" /> given that the legitimate aspirations of the associations are not being addressed.  The position is becoming more acute as national wage agreements are tending to become more restrictive and allow little latitude to resolve issues not addressed in the agreements.</P>
    <P>Continual exclusion of the associations from centralised negotiations, coupled with subsequent restrictive agreements, will give rise to further disenchantment within the bodies.  It could ultimately give rise to further difficulties and this is not in anybody's interest.  We cannot expect the Garda and Army to have confidence in a system whereby the employer negotiates pay increases for and on behalf of the employee.  It is a ludicrous situation and it is time immediate steps are taken to change it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of possible solutions to this problem and I will put forward three suggestions.  First, the Garda and Defence Forces associations are given direct access to national pay agreements.  Second, the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations is given access to the talks to represent its constituent bodies, 80 per cent of which are made up by the Garda and Defence Forces associations. Third, the current legislation preventing the Army and Garda associations access to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is repealed.</P>
    <P>A motion was passed at the last annual conference of the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations to this effect.  Deep dissatisfaction and concern was expressed and the motion was fully supported by all the affiliates at the meeting.  I was proud to attend it and listen to the conclusive argument made on behalf of the ICPSA. I thank the Minister for taking this important issue and I look forward to his reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank <Col N="519" /> Senator Neville for raising this important Adjournment Matter.  In recent times the pay agreements which have governed the public service have formed part of the national programmes. This applied in relation to the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> which covered the period 1988 to 1990, and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> which covered the period 1991 to 1993.  It also applies in the case of the current programme, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> which, in respect of the public service, covers the period 1994 to the middle of 1997.</P>
      <P>The pay policy to apply over the period to be covered has been an integral part of each of these programmes.  It has been a vital part of them in that it has a bearing on such fundamental issues as competitiveness, employment and the scale of public expenditure.  The negotiating arrangements for these programmes are now very well established. They have been well tested over the time span of the various programmes. As is well known, the arrangements involve negotiations between the social partners.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, in the programme negotiations the discussion on pay centres on the overall regime to apply nationally and, side by side with that, and indeed as an integral part of it, the arrangements to apply to the public service.  Members will be aware of the significance of the public service in terms of numbers and cost &mdash; it comprises some 185,000 people and in 1996 the public service pay and pensions bill is estimated to be £4.8 billion.  The public service pay regime to emerge from the negotiations is, therefore, vitally important.  In many respects it is the most important element of these agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where pay generally is concerned, the main players in the negotiations are IBEC, the ICTU and the Government <Col N="520" /> representatives.  These same players would also be involved where public service pay is concerned but in relation to the ICTU an important role would be played by its public services committee, which is representative of public service unions which are members of the ICTU.</P>
    <P>The situation I have outlined gives rise to the issue which is the subject of the Adjournment Matter.  The associations representing members of the Defence Forces and the Garda are not members of the ICTU and as such are not associated with the negotiation of national programmes and the related pay agreements.  I would like to say something about the nature of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána associations.  The establishment of associations for the purpose of representing members of those forces, in relation to their remuneration and other matters, is governed by special legislation in each case.  For obvious reasons, related to the special nature of these forces, this legislation contains certain prohibitions and restrictions.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána Act, 1924, as amended by the Act of 1977, provides that it shall not be lawful for a member of the Garda Síochána to be, or become, a member of a trade union or of any association which seeks to control or influence pay, pensions or conditions of service of the Garda Síochána, other than an association established under the Act.  The Act also makes it an offence for a person to cause disaffection or to induce any member of the Garda Síochána to withhold his or her services.  I need hardly say that this prohibition is essential to the operation of the Garda.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, similarly prohibits members of the Defence Forces from becoming members of a trade union or any other body seeking to influence or otherwise be concerned with the remuneration or other conditions <Col N="521" /> of service, other than an association established under the Act.</P>
    <P>In the case of both the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, the legislation would enable the Minister concerned to agree that a representative association might be associated with an outside body.  Having regard to the legal restrictions which apply in relation to trade union membership and the withdrawal of services, which necessarily apply in the case of the security forces, these provisions have not been utilised to permit association with the ICTU.</P>
    <P>There are valid reasons why the restrictions I have referred to should be in place in these cases.  For example, members of the Defence Forces may be required to come to the aid of the civil power, or to render aid to civil communities during trade disputes.  Great care must be taken to ensure that the arrangements applying to the associations representing security forces personnel, including the affiliations they might enter into, maintain the integrity of their representative structures and do not put in jeopardy the unique nature of these forces in the community.</P>
    <P>However, the overall situation does give rise to an obvious difficulty for the associations in so far as discussions on national pay agreements are concerned. The members are part of the public service but the associations are not members of the ICTU.  Consequently, they are not associated with the negotiation of the pay provisions of the national programmes, even though, inevitably, the terms of those provisions apply to their members.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Garda and Defence associations are able to participate in conciliation and arbitration schemes. The schemes, which are similar to those operating elsewhere in the public service, provide arrangements for dealing exclusively with pay and other specified conditions of service of most members of the Garda and Defence Forces.  It is open to the representative associations <Col N="522" /> to raise issues of concern to them at the conciliation councils under those schemes and this can then become part of the process of public service pay discussions. It has to be and is accepted, however, that the experience has been that these possible arrangements have not operated on any regular or structured basis.</P>
    <P>Looking at the situation from all sides, it is acknowledged that there is an issue to be addressed in relation to the remoteness of the associations from the determination of public service pay policy in the context of the national programmes. It is accepted also that it is appropriate at this stage to consider whether some mechanism could be put in place to deal with this matter.  What such a mechanism might be would, in the first place, be a matter for discussion between the associations and the two Departments directly concerned &mdash; the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice.  Obviously, any mechanism would have to have regard to the unique nature of the security forces, which has necessitated legislation to deal with their representational position separately from the general trade union and industrial relations legislation.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that this issue has been raised on a number of occasions.  The response has been that the best way to proceed would be to have the matter discussed between the representative associations and the Departments concerned.  This remains the best approach.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the issue is not a simple one and that it has to be treated with great care.  I would not like to speculate at this stage as to where a solution might lie.  That is best left to the two Departments concerned in the first place.  I would, however, agree that it is important that consideration be pressed forward in the hope that an acceptable solution be found in good time for the negotiations which it is expected will take place later in the year on the pay <Col N="523" /> arrangements to follow the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> public service pay agreement.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his response, which contains some positive elements.  It is important that a mechanism be put in place for the next <Col N="524" /> negotiations at the end of the year.  The Minister should look seriously at the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations, which include the Defence Forces and the Garda, as the body which would sit at the table.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 15 February 1996.</P>
