      <P>The shocking news of the tragic death of the Cathaoirleach, Senator Liam Naughten, last Saturday evening stunned and saddened the entire country.  For those of us who were Liam's colleagues in political life, his death is a very deep and personal loss.</P>
      <P>I knew Liam Naughten since we were both elected to Roscommon County Council in 1974. Over all those years I regarded him as a loyal colleague and trusted friend.  Liam was a sincere, genuine and caring individual.  He harboured no malice towards anyone.  During all the years I knew him, I never once heard him make an offensive or disparaging remark to anyone or about anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" /> Liam Naughten had all the qualities which politicians are not supposed to have.  He was a man of great personal charm, but he was also a man of great integrity.  He was an able, dedicated and conscientious public representative.  He was immensely loyal to his country and to his party.</P>
    <P>As a local public representative, Liam Naughten was an outstanding member of Roscommon County Council, its various subsidiary bodies and the Western Health Board. He served with great distinction both as chairman of the county council and as chairman of the health board.</P>
    <P>In 1981 Liam Naughten and I were both elected to Seanad Éireann.  Since then, Liam served continuously at national level either as a Member of the Dáil or as a Member of this House.  In 1989 Liam became Leas-Chathaoirleach and last year, following the very sad and untimely death of his close friend and fellow south Roscommon native, the late Seán Fallon, Liam was unanimously elected Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  As Cathaoirleach, he carried out his duties in this House with absolute impartiality and in a most efficient and dignified manner.</P>
    <P>In his role as Cathaoirleach Liam was also a great ambassador for Seanad Éireann and for his country.  He was very highly regarded at international level and, in my capacity as Leas-Chathaoirleach, I have received a great number of messages of condolence from Speaker colleagues of his in other Parliaments.</P>
    <P>The death of Liam Naughten will be felt very deeply and personally by his very many political friends and colleagues.  It will be felt by his own people of south Roscommon whom he represented so well over so many years and by his colleagues in the Fine Gael Party, which he served so loyally and with such great dedication. To all those, I offer my very sincere sympathy.</P>
    <P>Most of all, Liam's loss will be felt by his wife, Mary, and his young family who are such a credit to him.  Liam was a great family man and our hearts go out today in a very special way to Mary, his six sons and two daughters and to his brother and sister.  I sincerely hope that the pride which they can justly feel in Liam's many achievements over his short lifetime will be some consolation to them at this very sad time.</P>
    <P>Fíor Éireannach be ea Liam Ó Neachtáin.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam uasal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank colleagues from both sides of the House for their sympathy and support over the past few difficult days.  That support and sympathy meant a great deal to the Naughten family and to his colleagues in Fine Gael.  I particularly thank the staff of the House who were extremely helpful in many practical ways. That help was always given with the greatest of sensitivity and the family are extremely grateful for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his too short life, Liam Naughten filled many roles.  We knew him here as a politician and <Col N="611" /> colleague.  As a politician, he was practical and effective.  His interests were not in the high profile media issues of Dublin 4, but rather in the issues which concerned ordinary people.  His grasp and expertise over a wide range of issues was solid and impressive.  In agriculture, his own practical experience and his involvement in the IFA were brought to bear in debates.  He had experience in health, as a member and chairman of the Western Health Board.  His intimate knowledge of local authorities, local government and the environment also found an outlet in debates in this House.  He was active in helping the economic and community development of his own area.  He also had experience of dealing with people involved with problems in welfare and education.  All this gave him a solid practical and detailed knowledge over a wide range of areas.</P>
    <P>He was always conscious that all legislation ultimately affected real people, for better or worse.  He saw Government proposals not from the point of view of the expert or the bureaucrat but from the perspective of the person who would be affected &mdash; the end user.  As a result, his contributions were infinitely more valuable.</P>
    <P>His political judgment was shrewd and his instincts always sound.  His advice, which was much sought, was always honest, disinterested but concerned, and invariably good.  I like many Members, had many personal experiences of this good advice which he gave so freely and honestly.</P>
    <P>We bestowed the highest honour we can give a politician when we elected him Cathaoirleach in July 1995.  He was elected in the aftermath of the infinitely sad death of another well loved and much respected Cathaoirleach, the late Seán Fallon.  We knew it was a hard act to follow but in his quite way Liam established his own sense of personal authority based on the respect we had for him and our knowledge of his innate sense of fair play.</P>
    <P>He was never pompous but he upheld the dignity of the office at all times.  He had a great capacity to deflect or reroute trouble before it really started.  As the Leas-Chathaoirleach said, on many ceremonial occasions or when he led delegations on behalf of this House he carried out such tasks with style &mdash; his own understated but effective style.  Every Member of the House who was in Drum in the past few days saw the respect and love of his people, for whom he had done so much.  The enormous crowds, spontaneous outpourings of grief, the unsolicited tributes and the genuine sense of loss told their own story.  The grief was as genuine as it was raw.  It told us what Liam's people, the people who knew him best, thought of him.</P>
    <P>We will miss Liam Naughten most as a person. I have lost one of my closest friends, one whose friendship and company I valued more than I can say.  For me the enduring picture of Liam Naughten will be the sense of humour, the infectious smile and the twinkle in the eye.  He was always a little late, &ldquo;Roscommon time&rdquo; we <Col N="612" /> called it and Roscommon time was usually out of synch with British Mean Time but we were none the worse for it.  We remember his great capacity for conviviality, often into hours when wiser people might have been at home in bed.  In all of this and especially in adversity, and Liam had more than his share of adversity both political and personal, there was Liam's unquenchable optimism.</P>
    <P>At a more serious level, Liam was a man of total integrity.  He was straight, truthful and honourable.  His word was his bond.  His goodness was transparent.  I have never heard a bad word said about Liam Naughten.  People have spoken of Liam as self-effacing.  He was self-effacing but there was a strength behind that modesty, a sense of a man secure in himself, his beliefs and his sense of identity.  There was a great natural sense of courtesy about Liam.  It was an all-embracing courtesy which extended to everything he did and everybody he met.  That courtesy was a simple reflection of his respect for other people, his interest in them and his concern for them.</P>
    <P>The most important part of Liam's life was his family.  He was proud of them and he had every reason to be.  His wife, Mary, and his eight fine children have been stoic in the face of this tragedy.  To them we extend our heartfelt sympathy.  Yesterday, in the icy wind at Drum we laid to rest a great friend, a great colleague, a fine Cathaoirleach and a good man.  May he rest in peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil group and on my own behalf I express my heartfelt sympathy to Liam's wife, Mary, and his family. As the Leader of the House correctly said, they showed tremendous courage and pride over the last few days in the face of tragedy.  I do not believe a person could visit any part of the country where somebody did not have a comment to make about the tragedy.  I also offer our sympathy to the Leader of the House and the Fine Gael Party, which Liam so loved.</P>
      <P>On hearing about the accident on Saturday night one felt a sense of great loss.  I can pay no better political tribute to the late Liam Naughten than to say that, despite the cut and thrust of politics, after the untimely death of Seán Fallon, my party colleagues here unanimously agreed that we would not oppose Liam when he was proposed by the Fine Gael Party to fill the fourth most important position in Irish politics.  In the short time that Liam sat in the Chair, that decision was proved right by his dignity, fairmindedness and great sense of humour.  He was a great standardbearer for the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He and I may have had political differences but we shared a lot.  We had occasions to celebrate with a famous Irish product while discussing matters of the House and State, and today I feel a great sense of loss.  I repeat what my two colleagues have said.  On no occasion in the company of Liam Naughten did I ever hear him <Col N="613" /> make one derogatory comment about anybody. In politics, that is some sentiment.</P>
    <P>We have lost a great standardbearer for the Seanad and I have lost a great friend.  May he rest in peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Is fíor a rá nach raibh drochfhocal le rá ag aon duine againn.  Great tributes have been paid to Liam over the past week and they have been well deserved.  I offer my condolences, as my colleagues will, to his family, the Fine Gael Party and his wide circle of friends.</P>
      <P>It would be impossible to try and match the magnificent eulogies that have been delivered about him over the past number of days.  It was a great tribute to him that both the Taoiseach and President were at the funeral yesterday in the icy winds of Drum.  That was very important to his people, as Senator Manning said.</P>
      <P>In this House we did not see him as a person who belonged to one side but as the person who guided the work of the House.  I would like to remember his quite restrained dignity and the way he gave respect to all.  As Newman said, &ldquo;Tolerance&rdquo; is the greatest quality of an educated man.  He was devoid of arrogance and valued the opinions of all.  He would say: &ldquo;Are you with me now?&rdquo; to make sure he was bringing people with him in discussion.  He had the quality that marks great public servants and representatives: he took his job seriously but he did not take himself too seriously.</P>
      <P>There was no better person to tell a joke against himself.  He took pride in his job and his role while retaining a humility that was very clear. He cared about the Seanad and always sought to make sure the business was carried through, established its importance in the legislative process and was done.  That was never more obvious than every week at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges where he would invite the views of all present.  He would facilitate or defer decisions as appropriate, always seeking that elusive consensus and generally finding it or containing the debate until it was found.  I represented one of the smaller groups in the House on a number of occasions and the respect and recognition he gave to those smaller groups at all times was tremendous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He had the quality of a great teacher.  He had the extraordinary talent of being able to control and discipline without being shrill or loud.  He could impose discipline in a conversational but most authoritative tone of voice which was highly effective.  He was an ordinary man with very personable ways.  As Senator Wright said, he was an inveterate member of the bar lobby.  Nothing gave him more pleasure than to discuss the last race and ask for a ball of malt.  I remember the way he would tighten his facial muscles just as he was about to pull into his next cigarette &mdash; and there was always a next cigarette.  He was probably the only politician in the west of Ireland to have a problem with the Athlone by-pass because once he left home in the morning he had <Col N="614" /> to wait until he reached Moate before he could buy a packet of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>On a final poignant note, in the last three weeks Senator Naughten was instrumental in having the portraits of former Cathaoirligh placed in the Seanad corridor.  When they were being put up people were joking with Liam because under his picture was written from 12 July 1995 until blank.  Little did we know we would be able to fill in that blank decisively and permanently so soon.  We can fill in the blank date but it will not be so easy to fill the gap he has left.  He made a great contribution which we respect and salute today.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>I join with other Senators in paying tribute to the late Cathaoirleach, Senator Liam Naughten and in sending the sympathy of the Labour Party to his wife and family and to the Fine Gael Party.  It was with great shock that I heard the news of his untimely death.  He was held in great affection by politicians on all sides of the political divide and by the people of Roscommon and of Ireland.  He was held in particular affection by the staff of the Seanad, and Senator Manning referred to the work done by them over the past few days.  They have worked most closely with him and they have spoken positively about him.</P>
      <P>Senator Naughten's role in political life spanned 22 years as a county council representative, in the Seanad and the Dáil and, most recently, as the Cathaoirleach of this House. I understand he was about his political work, coming from a funeral, when he died.  He was constantly working for the people he represented.</P>
      <P>Senator Naughten's role in this House has been well summed up by other Senators.  In his role as Cathaoirleach, he combined dignity with warmth. That was his true gift.  He upheld the dignity of the Office, yet he was human in all his dealings. He represented this House extremely well in various parts of the world as well as in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Senator Naughten had the gift of controlling people by the respect in which he was held.  It was the force of his personality which made him run this House as he did.  In many ways he and his predecessor, Senator Seán Fallon had these gifts. They both led this House extremely well in their role as Cathaoirligh.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the photographs of former Cathaoirligh which now hang in the Seanad corridor.  Senator Manning referred to Senator Naughten's sense of humour and his smile.  The photograph of him captures his personality very well and that combination of dignity and human warmth.  On behalf of the Labour Party I extend my sympathy to Senator Naughten's wife, Mary, his six sons and two daughters and the Fine Gael Party which he represented so well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still very difficult to come to terms with the fact that Senator Naughten is not with us today, that he was taken so suddenly and <Col N="615" /> tragically from our midst.  When we left the House last Thursday, none of us would have expected that we would not have his calm, courteous and cheerful presence here to guide the House this week.  He is a huge loss.  We have lost a colleague and a good friend.  Unfortunately in recent years we have lost three of our very best &mdash; Senators Gordon Wilson, Seán Fallon and Liam Naughten.  They were not just three of our best, but three of the best people in public life.</P>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach came to the Chair in difficult circumstances and it is fair to say that he established his authority very quickly, that he was always calm, even handed and courteous to all and nobody could have any complaints about how he conducted the affairs of the House.  The biggest compliment my late father could pay to anyone was to say that he was a decent man, and Liam Naughten was certainly a decent man.  He was a very unassuming man, a good and honest man, and very good company.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to improve on the words that were spoken yesterday in Drum church.  Senator Naughten was very deeply committed to farming and, in our frequent conversations, he spoke about it more often than politics.  He was a person of the land.  He loved the land and spoke about it frequently.  He was a model of service and patriotism in a time when those qualities are not appreciated.  I never heard him speak ill of anybody; and that is a remarkable quality in someone coming from the very tough constituency he represented.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I extend our sympathy to his wife, Mary, and his children, and wish his son Dermot a speedy recovery.  It was a privilege to have known him. May he rest in peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I will always remember where I was when I heard of the car accident which took Liam Naughten's life.  He died before his time and his death is a tragedy not alone for his family but for his community, Seanad Éireann and Irish political life.  We have lost not only a Cathaoirleach but also a great friend.  On my own behalf and on behalf of Democratic Left, I extend my sincere sympathy to Liam Naughten's wife, Mary, to his family and to the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>As Cathaoirleach, Liam Naughten presided over the business of this Chamber with dignity and patience.  His dignity came naturally and his patience was often needed.  Liam Naughten's popularity and the esteem in which he was held were manifest in the very large attendance at the removal of his remains and his burial in the churchyard in Drum, County Roscommon, yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with the Leader of the House in paying a tribute to the staff of the Seanad, including the Clerk Assistant of the Seanad, Ms Jody Blake, Ms Cáit Hayes of the interparliamentary group, and the many other staff members.  One felt proud of the staff presence.  As I said, the esteem <Col N="616" /> in which Liam was held was manifest in the attendance at his burial; a large number of people turned away with tears in their eyes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On 4 July last year I paid tribute to a political colleague and friend, the highly regarded late Cathaoirleach, Senator Seán Fallon. Today I rise to pay tribute to his successor, Liam Naughten, whose nomination I had the privilege of seconding in July 1995.  I rise today to pay tribute not just to a political colleague but to one of my closest personal friends.  Yesterday my colleagues and I partook of the hospitality of Mary Naughten and her family in a hotel in Athlone town next door to Seán Fallon's home where, last year, we partook of the hospitality of Ann Fallon.  I could not but reflect on the twist of fate that we were again among the people of the west and midlands who came in their thousands to show their respect for two truly great men who made politics and service to their communities and country one of the most important parts of their lives, and who had been taken from us.</P>
      <P>I shared an office with Liam for almost five years, between 1983 and 1987.  For the last 16 years we often lunched together and had the odd drink.  He was the same with me, his friend, as he was with every Member of this and the other House and with all the staff of Leinster House where he was held in the highest regard.  Liam always had a smile on his face and time for a chat, and this did not make him the greatest of time keepers, as the Leader said.</P>
      <P>Liam Naughten was addicted to national and local politics, although to him all politics were local.  He never forgot what really mattered.  He put himself forward to serve his people and country to the best of his ability.  He never forgot the needs of the people of Roscommon, particularly those of south Roscommon and the Drum area, or what was best for his county.</P>
      <P>Liam loved this House and his election as Cathaoirleach was one of his proudest moments. He did not have a very troublesome time as Cathaoirleach but the fact that we all liked and, more importantly, trusted and respected him, made it easier.  The principle of impartiality, which is, without question, the most important facet of the Cathaoirleach's role, came easily to Liam because the rights of Members to raise local and national issues were a mirror of the rights of his constituents in Roscommon to have their voices heard and their needs addressed.  He was also generous in giving injury time to a few notable offenders from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday that Liam loved the land.  He was an unsung expert on agriculture, <Col N="617" /> which was testified to yesterday when one of the gifts offered was a copy of the <i>Farmers' Journal.</i> His judgments and opinions were sought by people from the Taoiseach down because he gave them frankly and coherently.  Liam gave sound judgments on all matters.</P>
    <P>Yesterday when we laid Liam to rest in the cemetery beside the church where he was baptised and the school where he was educated, we were surrounded by thousands of people from south Roscommon and all parts of Ireland who knew Liam was a genuine man.  Canon Murray described him on Tuesday night as &ldquo;that man on the tractor, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad&rdquo;. Comments are always made about how politicians are removed from the people. However, the many thousands who stood in the bitterly cold weather on Tuesday night and yesterday did not feel removed from their public representative.</P>
    <P>While our loss in this House and the Fine Gael Party is great, it does not compare with the loss to his wife, Mary, his sons, Denis, John, Liam Óg, Joseph, Séamus and Dermot, who will hopefully make a full recovery, the two little apples of his eye, his daughters Marion and Áine, and his brother and sister.  It is said that &ldquo;his like will never come again&rdquo;, and this is certainly appropriate in the case of Liam Naughten.  May he rest in peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Liam Naughten hailed from County Roscommon, as do the Leas-Chathaoirleach and I.  Liam gave most of his adult life to serving people at local, regional and national levels where he had a distinguished career.  Both Roscommon County Council and the Western Health Board honoured him by making him chairman while Seanad Éireann elevated him to the position of Cathaoirleach. That was his finest hour.</P>
      <P>I knew Liam politically and served with him for 17 years locally and regionally and in this House. While he and I come from different political parties, we had an excellent working relationship at Roscommon County Council level, especially when it came to south Roscommon.  Apart from that, we had a deep personal friendship.  I cannot remember any occasion during our 17 years in politics when Liam Naughten and I were not in a position to socialise, whether it was before, during or after an event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Liam Naughten had all the qualities that politicians should have, but are not supposed to have.  The people of County Roscommon and all those who met him recognised his great qualities. He was a very unassuming man.  He did not believe in airs and graces but rather in a straightforward and practical approach, especially to political matters.  He did not look behind doors or under covers.  He saw and spoke as he saw it. He had a great political brain.  This was apparent to anybody who attended meetings with him.  He had an ability to cut through to the issue and identify it.  He did not speak in circles or <Col N="618" /> elaborate more than was necessary; what he said was always on the ball.</P>
    <P>Liam Naughten will be a big loss to the Fine Gael Party, whose members loved and respected him, not only in County Roscommon but nationally.  This was apparent in the results he obtained in Seanad elections.  It was also apparent in the House where people always spoke of him in glowing terms.  He will be missed by everybody in the House, to whom he was a friend, including the staff.</P>
    <P>We will miss him at local level in the county.  It will be strange to attend meetings from which he will be absent.  The natural sequence of events was that either he or I would arrive first or second; indeed, on that fateful night last Saturday I was seven or eight minutes ahead of him.  We were on our way to a funeral when the tragic event occurred.</P>
    <P>On a personal basis I will miss Liam Naughten. However, nobody will miss him more than Mary, his six sons and two daughters.  Our hearts go out to them today, as have the hearts of the nation over the last few days.  They need our prayers and support, which doubtless will be available from all their friends.  Liam is a great loss to everybody. May his gentle soul rest in peace.</P>

      <P>The tributes paid by all the parties sum up the general view of Liam Naughten.  I join with the other speakers in offering sympathy to his family, and to the family of the other fatality whose body is leaving this country today.</P>
      <P>The number of Members who have died in this session is frightening &mdash; Senator Gordon Wilson, Senator Seán Fallon, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Deputy Johnny Fox and Deputy Neil Blaney.</P>
      <P>As the Leas-Chathaoirleach said, Liam Naughten possessed qualities not normally associated with politicians.  The killing schedules of Deputies and Senators in multi-seat constituencies imposes an enormous strain on us. It is a crazy life.  Senator Liam Naughten died on his way to one funeral having attended another. The type of pressures to which people are subjected must be examined.  It is a criminal waste of life that somebody aged 52 years is in his grave through overwork.  We should call it as we see it; the cause is overwork.  There are times when people should be at home with their families.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to Liam Naughten who served people as well as he could in this crazy political life.  It behovers us all to treat each other more gently because this type of thing is happening too often.  The pressures are too great and wives and children suffer most.  I extend my deepest condolences to Liam Naughten's family.</P>

      <P>The House has assembled today to perform a sad, painful duty but it is highly appropriate.  Liam Naughten was a decent unassuming man, a gentle man and a gentleman. I am grateful to the Clerk of the Seanad, Deirdre Lane, who telephoned me last weekend to let me <Col N="619" /> know that this tragic event had taken place.  It was only this day last week that Liam Naughten and other friends were in my house.  We were reuniting as a group who were in Tehran where I had bought a carpet.  We always joked that we would baptise the carpet when we got it back to Dublin.</P>
      <P>It was a historic journey, because for the first time, Liam had led a delegation to Tehran which was composed entirely of Members of the Seanad.  He demonstrated brilliantly his capacity at a superb level of international diplomacy.  He met the leaders of Tehran, powerful and difficult people, but, with extraordinary courtesy, he dealt with them as equals and he did this country proud.  I had some difficulties with them and the newspapers rang me.  Although I am not usually a modest and unassuming person, I am glad I took the trouble to say that the story on that occasion was the way in which Liam Naughten represented Ireland and dealt so firmly and expertly with those people.  He knew the cattle trade and when some of the self-appointed authorities in Iran raised problems, Liam knew it and was able to counter every argument. Colleagues with us on that trip know the truth of what I say.</P>
      <P>I was not feeling great last week and I intended to postpone the gathering until this week.  Thank God I did not do that because I now have a very happy memory of Liam sitting in a corner, looking at the carpet &mdash; I do not think he was that interested in it &mdash; with a glass of Paddy and a fag in his mouth.  I remember him leaning forward, with his eyebrow up, and talking about the politics of Roscommon, the west and the Seanad.  It was an education.</P>
      <P>Iran is dry and we occasionally made our way down the corridors to what we told the guards outside our rooms was a prayer meeting which we could not possibly avoid.  We sat there with our little jorum and talked about politics. Colleagues who were there will know that also was an education.</P>
      <P>I took it very kindly that, in the shock of that moment, the Clerk of the Seanad, Deirdre Lane, and her colleague, Jody Blake, were able to get on as efficiently as always and let us know what happened.  I tried to ring the Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral to suggest that he say a prayer for him. I did not get through for various technical reasons but I went to communion the next morning and during the litany, the dean spontaneously prayed for the Cathaoirleach and his bereaved family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politicians are frequently attacked and even today I heard someone say: &ldquo;They all make money out of it.&rdquo;  It is not offensive for me to say Liam Naughten was not a wealthy man.  He was a small farmer and I often spoke to him about the expenses of political life, including borrowing money from the bank which I have also had to do to fight elections and by-elections.  Raising a large family and living this kind of politics meant Liam Naughten made nothing from political life, <Col N="620" /> but he gave to it and we should honour that.  I hope the sections of the press which have attacked politicians in the past will recognise the passing of this decent man.  How many people give so generously with such little financial reward and with a sense of duty?</P>
    <P>I wish a speedy recovery to Liam's young son who was injured in the accident and to his driver who is still in hospital.  The family, however, will find it difficult to recover.  Liam Naughten was not only liked in this House, he was loved.  When you love somebody, you carry them with you always in your heart.  It was truly said that he never said anything nasty or disparaging about other people.  That is unlikely to be said of me when I go, but I hope I always laughed at people without malice.  There will always be a vacant chair in this House and a vacancy in our hearts and that of the country, as was evident at Drum and Portiuncula over the weekend.  We will all miss Liam Naughten - there are few people like him in public or in private life.</P>

      <P>I rise to pay tribute to the late Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Liam Naughten.  Shortly after 6 p.m. last Saturday I received a telephone call from his brother Seamus whom I have known for many years.  He informed me that he had bad news and that Liam had been killed in a car accident.  At first I found it difficult to comprehend what he was saying but it slowly dawned on me that I would never again enjoy the warmth of Liam's company, engage his smiling countenance and, like other Members, witness the patience and courtesy he showed to us during his term as Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>So sudden was his death that I was mindful of the words of a psalmist who wrote: &ldquo;He flowered like a flower in the field, the wind blew and he was gone and his place will never see him again.&rdquo;. Although we are deeply saddened by the changeless law of death, we have hope in the promise of immortality because we know only too well that for good people like Liam Naughten who place their trust in God, life has not ended but has changed anew.  After they have departed from this world, a place in Heaven is theirs forever.  It is with thoughts like these that we should try to console ourselves on the death of our dear friend and colleague and, more importantly, to comfort his devoted wife and loving family on their tragic loss.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>

      <P>Ba maith lio comhbhrón a ghabháil le Máire, bean chéile Liam, a chlann, a dheartháir agus a dheirfiúr.  Nuair a d'fhág Liam an saol seo ar an Satharn seo caite go tobann, ní raibh am aige slán a rá lena bhean chéile nó a chlann nó leis an Seanad.  Fear ciúin ab ea Liam, mar Cathaoirleach duine oscailite ab ea é a thug cothrom na Féinne do gach éinne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in total disbelief that I heard news of Liam Naughten's death last Saturday evening. The person who rang me said that two people had <Col N="621" /> died in the accident and two had been injured.  I rang back on several occasions to see if, perhaps, the story was untrue and that Liam Naughten was not among those killed.</P>
    <P>Liam Naughten came into the Seanad in 1981, the same year as myself.  I had a great personal relationship with him over the years and, listening to Senator Doyle's contribution, I recalled that at about this time last year we had a session, prior to Christmas, with the Leader of the House, Senator Manning, in the bar when we told stories until a late hour.</P>
    <P>Liam was a lovely, quite man and the tributes paid at his funeral showed the esteem and respect that people had for him.  As far away as my own town of Dingle people expressed their grief to me on the sudden death of Senator Naughten.  He will be sadly missed, especially by his wife and family.</P>
    <P>He was fair minded in the Seanad and we have many great memories of him.  Despite the sadness of his passing we should dwell on memories of the good times.</P>
    <P>I extend my deepest sympathy to his wife, Mary, his children, his sister and brother, and to members of the Fine Gael Party.  Guím sonas na flathais ar anam Liam.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>I also want to offer my sympathy to Mrs. Mary Naughten, her six sons and two daughters, as well as to Senator Naughten's colleagues in the Fine Gael Party and to the staff of the Seanad who have lost another chief.</P>
      <P>Liam Naughten was a warm and loyal persons. Like the former Cathaoirleach, Seán Fallon, he was forthcoming with advice.  On one occasion when I asked him if I could raise a matter in the House he said it was out of context.  I kept at him, however, and eventually he said I could raise the matter if I did so briefly.  That epitomised what Liam Naughten was like.</P>
      <P>His family will grieve for a long time over the loss of such a fine person.  I wish his son and the driver of the car a speedy recovery.</P>

      <P>Bhí me ag taisteal thar lear nuair a tharla an timpiste agus níor chuala mé i gceart faoi go dtí tús na seachtaine.  I did not know Liam Naughten as well as those who served and soldiered with him far longer.  However, I gained an insight into his character on a visit to Budapest two years ago.  The delegation was led by the then Cathaoirleach, Seán Fallon, and Senator Naughten was second in command.  My abiding recollection of that occasion was a visit to a centre for handicapped children.  It was an extraordinary experience and we were all moved by it.  Liam, however, was so moved that he had to leave in order to collect himself.  It was then Seán Fallon told me that Liam had a handicapped child in his own family.  He could barely bring himself to contemplate the sights around us.  I remember him with tears in his eyes on the steps of that building.  I am afraid the tears will now be <Col N="622" /> in his wife's eyes and in those of his children.  We can say what we will but only time will make any difference.</P>
      <P>Senator Magner made a point, which should not be forgotten.  He spoke about the appalling pressures politicians put themselves under in trying to discharge the service expected of them. However, they are regularly criticised and pilloried by the media and the public whom they are trying to serve.  I do not know of any other profession which spends so much of its time criticising itself in the ritualistic adversariality of these Houses, but particularly of the Dáil.  It is only on such occasions that the sense of fellowship and comradeship which people really feel is expressed.  The best tribute one can pay to the dead is to speak about the living from time to time in the tones that we speak about the dead, such as Liam Naughten.</P>

      <P>I want to be associated with my colleagues in expressing sympathy to Mary and the rest of the Naughten family.  I was in London last Saturday night at a Meath association function.  When I was leaving that function at 2.30 a.m., I met Mr. Joe McCartan who had tears in his eyes.  He told me that Liam had been tragically killed.  It is bad enough to hear bad news at home, but it is worse to hear it when one is away.  The news of Liam's death was an enormous shock.</P>
      <P>Liam and I came to the Houses of the Oireachtas 16 years ago.  We became friends a few years earlier when we met at a councillors meeting and we talked about our respective chances in the 1981 general election.  He told me the history of Fine Gael in Roscommon.  The one thing we had in common was that my late father and the late Mr. Jimmy Burke were great friends and Liam was a great friend of Joan Burke.  We were in the Dáil together and when I lost my seat four years ago one of the first calls I got was from Liam Naughten.  He said he presumed I would be on his panel for the Seanad elections.  I will never forget that he spoke highly of me when canvassing for those elections.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago there was a function in my honour to celebrate 21 years in politics.  Liam said he would not be there early.  I told him not to come; the fact that he had mentioned it was enough.  Liam arrived after attending eight functions that day with a Minister in his constituency.  He spent an hour and a half with us.  Last Sunday our county final was played and many people met him for the first time.  When they heard of his death they said he must have been a fine man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was said so many times yesterday, Liam was a giver.  I am probably not unique in saying this but, any time he met our two eldest daughters he never let them pass without giving them something.  When I showed my nine year old the missalette with a photograph of Liam which we all received yesterday, she asked if he was the <Col N="623" /> man who was killed and I said it was.  She said he was a nice man.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with the tributes said this afternoon.  I did not get to know the late Cathaoirleach, Liam Naughten, until I entered this House in 1992.  My first impression was that he was a very nice man.  He had a quality for which I normally look when I am unsure of my situation.  He had the gift of relating on a one to one basis and he listened.  As politicians we are inclined to look over our shoulders when people talk to us to see who is coming but he actually listened.  He was one of the first Members to make me welcome.  He was interested in knowing my approach and how best we could work together and we had a drink in the bar.  From there, Liam and I always had time for each other.</P>
      <P>He had dignity; I even liked his bearing.  He had what I would call good manners.  When we enter politics good manners often disappear because of the way we express ourselves but that did not apply to him.  That was a quality I tried to emulate when I came in here.</P>
      <P>I observed him at the Order of Business last Thursday when one of my colleagues would not resume his seat.  He was very authoritative in telling that person to resume his seat.  The twinkle came into his eye but he never lost that firmness to tell Members to resume their seats.  He did not have to raise his voice.  That, to me, is a rare quality because we sometimes think that the only way to get our message across is to shout and roar.  Liam did not have to do that.  I hope others emulate his example and will see that we can be gentle, courteous and dignified and still be politicians.  Maybe the press would than say we do a superb job.</P>
      <P>Liam was killed going from one funeral to another.  There but for the grace of God go any of us.  A number of Members have died in the last two years.  Will any of us be around next week? In our work, we find ourselves under pressure and our blood pressure rising when we are tackled at a residents' meeting, etc.  Liam should be an example of a dedicated persons doing it with style.  I have lovely memories of him.</P>
      <P>I extend my sympathy to his wife, Mary, and family, brother and sister and to the Fine Gael Party.  It has lost a fine colleague and I have lost a friend as well.</P>

      <P>I join with the House in expressing my sincere sympathy to Mary and her young family.  I got to know Liam in the four short years I am in this House.  He was a decent and honourable gentleman.  He attained the highest honour of the House, that of Cathaoirleach, and carried it with great dignity.  I also had the privilege of being in Liam's company outside the House.  Last Wednesday night, I was one of those who christened the carpet in Senator Norris's house.  Little did we think we would be expressing <Col N="624" /> sympathy to Liam's family here today.  I was also in his company at those prayer sessions in Iran and Moscow.  Like myself, he was a good judge of Paddy whiskey.  We had many happy and enjoyable moments which I will cherish for the rest of my life.  He was one of nature's gentlemen. May the Lord have mercy on his soul.</P>

      <P>It was this week 33 years ago when John F. Kennedy was shot.  I think everyone here remembers where they were when they heard that news.  Everyone in this House and in Ireland will remember where they were last Saturday night when they heard the news of Liam Naughten's death.  It is a reminder of the huge impact this man at the age of 52 made on all with whom he came in contact.  Virgil spoke about <i>amicus est tanquam alter idem,</i> a friend is a second self.  Each of us felt he was a friend because we felt like him.  The 5,000 or more people who turned up yesterday and the night before showed they felt close to Liam Naughten.</P>
      <P>If I were to pinpoint what it was about Liam which appealed to me, having heard so many tributes to him today, it would be his approachability and availability.  Everyone felt easy in his presence and it was easy to approach him.  &ldquo;Everyone&rdquo; means everyone not only in his constituency but in this House felt he would find time for them.  That is why he was so highly regarded by all those who attended the ceremonies yesterday and the night before.</P>
      <P>The aspects which impressed me in the three and a half years since I got to know him was his ability and efficiency in doing his job and the fairness and impartiality with which he ran this House.  I never heard criticism of him or anyone say there was unfairness.  He did his job very well and he did it with humour.  I have learned today how much that word has come to people's minds. He did his job with humour and dignity.</P>
      <P>Our sympathies go to Mary, to Séamus his brother, his sister and to his six sons and two daughters.  They will miss him.  The onus is on us to see if we can find a fitting memorial for him. That is in our hands.  Our memorial should be for us to strive to continue the standards he set in his life, in this House and with everyone with whom he came in touch.  We will honour and remember him best by doing this.</P>

      <P>Unlike other Members, I had the distinction of standing on the same ticket in the last general election as Liam Naughten.  He was a constituency colleague and a very close friend. Having listened to tributes here for the last hour, one can distinguish certain themes.  Often when somebody passes on, we, as politicians, pay tributes some of which may not always be accurate but everything that was said in this case was true.  In fact, if we were here until this time tomorrow, we could be still saying things about Liam Naughten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> The general trend at present is to say that all politicians are alike.  If all politicians were like him, politics would have a great name.  That is not so but Liam Naughten had qualities which every politician strives to attain.  He always had a good word to say about everybody.  I do not remember him for that as much as for how he conducted himself in the Chair, when President Clinton addressed both Houses of the Oireachtas and, as Senator Norris said, when he went abroad to represent this country and its people.  His political record will be an example for future generations and is a great legacy.</P>
    <P>He will be missed by the people of Roscommon, the constituency and the councillors from around the country who knew him so well. Many of them attended his removal and funeral.</P>
    <P>His family will miss him most but I have no doubt that they will be all right.  My family suffered a similar experience some years ago and there is always grace to help those who lose a parent at a very young age.  Liam's qualities will be passed down to his family and they will help them in their quest along the road of life.</P>
    <P>As his remains were being lowered yesterday in Drum, County Roscommon, a lone curlew cried in the mist and those of us who come from rural Ireland know how sorrowful is the cry of a curlew.  That summed up how everybody felt in the cemetery, in County Roscommon and, indeed, all over the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be associated with all the tributes which have been made today.  As a neighbour in County Westmeath, I had a long and friendly association with Liam, the county councillors and Oireachtas Members from County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>Radio 3 rang my home at 5.55 p.m. last Saturday evening to get confirmation of the sudden death of a senior political figure in Athlone.  When I made inquiries, I returned their call to confirm the untimely death of the Cathaoirleach, Senator Liam Naughten.</P>
      <P>Like his predecessor, the late Senator Seán Fallon, Liam has left us at a very young age.  He made an immense mark as a member of Roscommon County Council and was honoured by the membership of that distinguished body when it elected him chairman.  He went on to become a member of the Western Health Board and was honoured again by being elected chairman.  He came into this House and was honoured by Members when he became Leas-Chathaoirleach and, with the untimely death of Seán, he became Cathaoirleach, as Senator Wright said, with the full agreement of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has been a great friend and adviser.  I was honoured to be a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges where Liam Naughten was Leas-Chathaoirleach and then Cathaoirleach since last July.  He was a very fair person and, as Senators said, he conducted his business with <Col N="626" /> great distinction and honour.  We remember how proud he was when it was decided to hang the portraits and photographs of former Cathaoirligh. My memory of Liam Naughten is how proud he was to contribute on behalf of the Seanad on the visit of President Clinton to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I admired Liam Naughten for many years.  It has been said that he did not have an easy political seat.  Like Senator Belton, I recall being at Dáil election counts when Liam was unsuccessful.  I recall that he and I discussed the three elections in 1981-82 only two months ago. Senator Magner spoke of multi-seat constituencies.  It is at a time like this that common sense should prevail.  I have been a Member of Seanad Éireann for almost 15 years. Seven Members have died in the last four years and 12 died in the previous 11 years.  The pressure brought to bear on public representatives in the course of their duty is enormous.  Our European partners advocate a 40 hour week but double that figure would better reflect the working life of a politician, particularly a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I also admired Liam Naughten for being a loyal Fine Gael man of the old guard.  The Taoiseach waited with us for the remains to arrive at Drum, County Roscommon.  He and Liam had an enormous amount in common.  They had a rural background and were from that particular strand of Fine Gael which demanded and received loyalty.  I admired Liam for the great strength he was to his political party.</P>
    <P>Liam's sudden death at the age of 52 is a huge loss to his wife, Mary, and young family.  He was admired and respected by so many members of the community.  We all know the good Liam Naughten did for local authorities, local communities, Fine Gael and these Houses, and, if the opportunity arises, I hope we would be only too willing to follow his example.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, want to be associated with this House's message of sympathy to his wife, Mary, and the Naughten family on their terrible loss. Liam was a person to whom all newcomers to the House could turn for assistance and kindness at any time.  His help in that regard cannot be measured.</P>
      <P>I offer my deepest sympathy to his wife, Mary and his family and to Senator Manning, Senator Cosgrave, his Fine Gael colleagues and his friends across the political spectrum.  It is difficult to bear the loss of such a treasured one so young in life. I hope God will give her strength to continue the work Liam set out to do and that we will see the Naughten name continue in the political sphere, not only in Roscommon, but in Ireland.  I offer my deepest sympathies to the Naughten family and Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>I will not repeat the well deserved tributes paid to Liam.  To say he was a decent man, as Senator Dardis said, and an honourable <Col N="627" /> one, would be an understatement.  As the Taoiseach said at yesterday's mass, he was a courteous man.  If courtesy means anything, Liam Naughten personnified it.</P>
      <P>I received a telephone call last Saturday evening from a mutual friend of mine and Liam's, to tell me Liam had been involved in a fatal accident outside Ballinasloe.  It is no exaggeration to say I was rooted to the spot.  I did not move from the telephone for nearly 15 minutes.  I could not comprehend that this had happened.  I had been with him on the previous Thursday, when, as on many occasions, we enjoyed drinks in the Member's Bar after business in the Seanad was finished.</P>
      <P>I knew him for over 20 years and I have never met a nicer person.  I feel I have lost a member of my own family.  Had my brother or someone close to me passed away, I could not have felt a bigger sense of loss.  One could talk about Liam for a long time but unfortunately that will not bring him back.  I am sure that wherever Heaven is Liam is there.  If anybody deserves to be there, he certainly does.  I express my deepest sympathy to his wife, Mary, his children and his brother and sister.  I know he will not be forgotten in this House for a long time.</P>

      <P>I join in the many tributes paid to Liam Naughten and in the messages of sympathy to Mary, his children and his wider family.  Many of the tributes have been very moving and they truly reflect the standing in which Liam was held by his colleagues in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>On my way to the House this morning, I passed Millar's pub between Ballinasloe and Athlone, and on the right side of the road, a spot is marked with a few wreaths and some flowers.  It is the beginning of a memorial I believe the people of South Roscommon are putting there as an indication of the regard in which Liam Naughten was held.  Whatever is or will be there, that spot will always be where a good and generous man lost his life in the service of the people he represented.</P>
      <P>I join in many of the comments made regarding the pressure brought to bear on the lives of public representatives.  Liam Naughten was a dedicated family man.  He had a large family.  He was a hardworking farmer and a public representative who did not spare himself in serving the interests of his constituents at local or national level.  When those who criticise the performance of politicians can match the manner in which Liam served his people and his vocation, we will accept it.</P>
      <P>I offer my deepest sympathy to his wife and young children.  In the fullness of time, we will all get on with our lives, but within his family his loss will always remain.  I hope we are all conscious of the need to support his widow and family in whatever manner is open to us.  May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>Whenever a tragedy like this occurs, it shakes us.  When someone dies following a lingering illness, it is expected.  When it is unexpected, it is shocking.  I was abroad when I received the message and like Senator Bohan, I was stunned.  It makes one think about one's own frailty, life and death, mortality and immortality and good and evil.  We think about the legacy Liam has left behind.</P>
      <P>One Senator said he was a gentle man and a gentleman.  He was a Christian gentleman. Christianity is characterised by love of God and one's neighbour.  The highest manifestation of loving one's neighbour is an unselfish act of love. Many philosphers say there is no such thing as an unselfish act.  I do not believe that, as I was a recipient of such an act from Liam Naughten, which I mentioned at the time of his election as Cathaoirleach.  I do not want to go into detail but it required great courage on his part to help me in the way he did and it also required a wonderful spirit of generosity.  It may have not meant much to him but it meant so much to me.  What really impressed me was that it was totally unsolicited and unrequested.  He did it because he was a nice person.</P>
      <P>The church at Drum was packed and supporters, friends, neighbours and some of Liam's Oireachtas colleagues were outside.  I was there with Senator Cassidy and Deputy Aylward and we waited for three hours as so many wanted to pay their respects at the hospital.  When the hearse drew up, it was bitterly cold.  I will never forget the sight of one of his daughters.  She was shivering, in tears, bewildered, lonely and frightened.  She had not really realised, and probably still has not, the great loss that had occurred.  My heart went out to her because the last time I saw that little girl was the night Liam was elected as Cathaoirleach and he invited some of us to his office for a celebratory drink.  She was running around, touching the desk and looking at the books and all the trappings that go with one of the great offices of this country.  I thought of how much she lost.  That little girl will never forget her Daddy but neither will we.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to believe that Liam Naughten is not with us today.  As he left the Chamber last Thursday evening, he told me the reason I was second on the Adjournment was that the Minister's reply was not available.  It was unbelievable to hear on Saturday evening that Liam had been killed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met Liam Naughten over 20 years ago in the presence of Deputy Joan Burke, a Fine Gael Deputy for Roscommon.  He and the Deputy were good friends.  Their friendship was an interesting one in the context of Roscommon politics, particularly with regard to the Fine Gael Party.  In all circumstances and at all times Liam Naughten behaved as a decent, honourable man; he was a man of high integrity.  He was very much a Roscommon and west of Ireland man.  He <Col N="629" /> epitomised all that is good and decent in country people.  He came from the decent right wing of Fine Gael and was true and loyal to the party.  He was not a self serving person.  He used the party and the political process to serve others.  He had a genuine commitment to the people of Roscommon and to people in general.  He was sympathetic and committed to people with serious disadvantages and difficulties and he would do anything to help them.</P>
    <P>As Cathaoirleach of the Seanad he was dignified, impartial and fair.  He led the Seanad with pride and dignity.  On trips abroad he responded to situations in a dignified manner and we could always be sure that the Irish side would not be let down.</P>
    <P>Political families must make sacrifices so that politicians can carry out their political duties. Every political family makes sacrifices regardless of whether the politician is the father, mother, husband, wife, son or daughter.  Mary Naughten and her six sons and two daughters made huge sacrifices so Liam could serve the interests of the people of Roscommon and Ireland and the interests of the Fine Gael Party.  They have now made the ultimate sacrifice.  Mary has lost her husband and her children have lost their father. It is extremely sad for them.  Liam would have been proud to see how Mary and their children comported themselves with such dignity and stoicism over the past few days.  They were a credit to him.</P>
    <P>I join Members in extending my sincere sympathy to Mary, her sons and daughters.  When the talk is over and the shock has receded they will have to live with the reality that Liam is no longer with them.  We must remember that and not forget Mary and the children in the years that lie ahead.  It will be a difficult time for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">

      <P>I extend my sympathy to the Naughten family and to the Fine Gael Party on the loss of a sincere, honest and dedicated man.  I had a great deal in common with Liam and we had many long discussions.  When I had grave financial problems Liam gave me helpful advice. I had the honour of having lunch with him last Friday in Cork.  It is said that a week is a long time in politics and the past week has proven that.</P>
      <P>I cannot add to what has been said about Liam's character and integrity.  I found him an honest and fair individual who treated the House with the respect it deserves.  He gave every Member as much leverage as he could.  He will be sadly missed by his wife, his family and his party. There are no words I can use to express my sympathy on the passing of Liam.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to join my colleagues in paying tribute to the late Liam Naughten.  Liam and I shared a domicile in Dublin for the past few years so on many occasions I sampled his good humour, ever present smile and all types of stories.  On hearing the tributes today it is impressive to realise that <Col N="630" /> not only was he at the heart of the Fine Gael political family but, uniquely perhaps, at the heart of the wider political family.  He had dignity and charm, he could relate to people and had great diplomacy when required.  I associate myself with the comments of Senator Norris.  I was also in Iran on that mission and I saw the power with which Liam could handle a difficult negotiation on behalf of this country.  I was also in Senator Norris' house last Wednesday night when we had a wonderful evening.  Many stories were told and it was a happy occasion.</P>
      <P>When my son, Gary, told me at 10 p.m. on Saturday that my friend had been killed, my weekend was shattered.  Liam was a unique individual.  He was a warm person and had a relaxed and easy going attitude.  He made our lives more organised and easier in so far as he could.  I join Senators in offering sincere sympathy to Mary and his family and in hoping that Dermot will be fit and well shortly.</P>

      <P>I join other Members in expressing my sympathy to the wife and family of the Cathaoirleach, Liam Naughten.  I was in Drum last Wednesday evening.  I have relations there and Liam and I often talked about Ballinasloe and the western area.  His death brought home the fact that life can be so short.</P>
      <P>I have great memories of Liam during the last Seanad election.  One wet night I was in the midlands in search of a Fianna Fáil councillor's house.  Liam's car pulled up beside mine.  He was going in the other direction having finished his calls.  The route to the councillor's house was complicated and I asked Liam to come there with me saying he might get a preference vote.  Liam Naughten got as good a reception from the Fianna Fáil councillor as I did.  The councillor said to him: &ldquo;I know you better than the other fellow&rdquo;.  It was true.  That was the type of respect Liam commanded.  He was known everywhere.</P>
      <P>I heard another story at our county council meeting on Sunday.  Liam was canvassing in Carrick-on-Suir and he called to see a colleague, a fellow farmer and a Fianna Fáil councillor.  He was looking for the present chairman of the county council, Councillor Jimmy Hogan, who was there on business.  His colleague offered to drive Liam to find Councillor Hogan.  That was the type of man Liam Naughten was; people had great respect for him.</P>
      <P>He had a humble, respectful attitude towards everybody.  When he succeeded the late Seán Fallon as Cathaoirleach he retained his humility and courtesy.  He did us proud in the manner in which he performed his duties in this House, during joint sessions of the Houses and when he was abroad.  Ten or 12 years ago I was abroad with him and he often mentioned it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being a farmer, we often spoke on farming matters.  He sold cattle at fairs and we did a lot of bargaining.  When we were in Taipei a group of us wanted to buy presents and we were told to go to a department store.  Liam said to us: &ldquo;Leave <Col N="631" /> this to me.  Pick out what you want&rdquo;.  He struck a bargain for us all and we said you could not beat a man who went to the fair.  He took great pride in that as we were buying gifts for our families. That was the kind of man he was.</P>
    <P>During that trip we were in Hong Kong.  I was a member of the Dáil at the time.  I was unwell after eating some of the native food.  I was weak while crossing the road and if Liam had not caught my coat I would have been as dead as a doornail.  He often said so to me with great humour, may God rest his soul.  He was such a great man and was involved in so much over 25 years: the health board, the county council and the General Council of County Councils.</P>
    <P>Some years ago there was a conference in Athlone of the General Council of County Councils and we had a great evening.  Liam invited us up to what he called his pub.  What a night we had.  That was the type of man he was. The evening of Seán Fallon's funeral, he looked after us and the officials of the Seanad.  He made sure we did not drive home if we had drink taken and that we had something to eat.  He was a man in a million.  What else can one say?</P>
    <P>I will remember his humility, honesty and smile.  As was said earlier, when someone was breaking the rules and speaking too long on the Order of Business, it was not what he said but the twinkle in his eye that said: &ldquo;Cut it out now and do not hold up the business.&rdquo;  One would respect that.  God comfort his wife and family.  They are lucky and can hold their heads high.  They had a wonderful father.  May God rest his soul.</P>

      <P>I knew Liam after he became a Deputy in 1982 and for years before that, particularly from my association with agriculture and his interest in it.  I always found him a very good and dedicated man.  So many tributes have been paid to him that it is impossible to add any more.</P>
      <P>Last Friday my wife and I had a meal with him in the Imperial Hotel in Cork.  We spoke about the difficulties and problems in politics but, when we finished our soup, Liam got back to his favourite subject of agriculture.  We spoke at length on its prospects for the next seven or eight years.  He told me he was making certain changes on his farm.  He asked my opinion on four-wheel drive tractors and other machinery.  He had an unbelievable interest in agriculture.  He was a practising farmer and was dedicated to it.  He was also dedicated to the wider community, whom he represented at local and national level.</P>
      <P>Our heartfelt grief goes out to his wife.  Mary and his six sons and two daughters.  Whatever loss we felt, as we stood dumbfounded in the cemetery in Drum yesterday, she will feel the greatest single loss.  I will never forget his warmth, dedication, honesty and integrity.  The tributes being paid to him, not just from the Fine Gael Party but from all other parties, are something to listen to and as much as Liam deserved.  May the Lord have mercy on his noble soul.</P>

      <P>All of our lives are full of landmarks and this is one of those occasions.  I want to pay a simple tribute to a very fine man and a very fine public representative.  Liam Naughten had a unique grace.  He had character, style, personality, humour and a charm that one does not often find in life or public life.  He had, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach said in a very fine tribute, talents and attributes that cynics do not often want to attribute to politicians.</P>
      <P>Liam exemplified all that is good in Irish public life.  He had a dedication to his people and his place, and to this House.  Yesterday, the people of his place showed their feelings and their warm regard for him in their thousands.  They showed their dedication to his memory and sense of shared loss with his wife and children.</P>
      <P>As has already been said by several speakers, Irish public life is more punishing than it should be.  In this case, a very fine family are paying the price for public service and public life.  I send all my sympathy to his wife and cherished children, to his party and his colleagues and above all, to the people that he served so well.  We will not see his like again.</P>

      <P>It is with extreme regret, sadness, shock and almost disbelief that I rise to pay tribute to the work and life of our late Cathaoirleach, Liam Naughten.  It is difficult to accept he no longer graces the Chamber or Leinster House with his presence.  In many cases, death concentrates our minds on the goodness and effectiveness of our colleagues in politics but this is not so.  Liam Naughten: his friendship, sociability, integrity and, above all, effectiveness in his work as Cathaoirleach was recognised in his lifetime.  I could not recall the times I passed the comment, or it was passed to me, that Liam does a good job.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that Liam Naughten raised the standing of the Seanad and made a great contribution to its effectiveness as the second chamber of Oireachtas Éireann.  Both he and former Cathaoirleach Seán Fallon changed the approach and effectiveness of our operation as Senators.  Consequently the image of the Seanad has been improved and transformed for the Irish people.  Liam Naughten not only took this torch from Seán Fallon but built on the foundations laid and we as Senators, Oireachtas Éireann and the people owe a deep debt of gratitude to him.</P>
      <P>It is important that the State's democratic institutions work effectively and that our people have confidence and respect for them.  The future of our democracy, so dearly paid for by those who went before us, depends on this.  Liam Naughten made a great contribution to presenting the Seanad as a credible, effective, efficient and important institution.  There is much more to be done.  Seán Fallon and Liam Naughten have set a challenging example and clear agenda for their successors in the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Liam was an excellent politician who knew how the system operates.  His natural friendliness, easy <Col N="633" /> manner and empathy with people was evident at all times, especially when campaigning.  Being a certainty in election campaigns for Seanad Éireann is not a good position to be in and Liam was always a certainty with the agricultural panel during campaigns.  Those of us who have campaigned know what that can do to one.  Liam Naughten was regarded highly by his fellow councillors and this was always proved when votes were counted.  He experienced disappointments, as most politicians do but never allowed them to limit his vision of what he wanted to contribute.  He just moved on to the next item on his agenda.  It is important to recognise his work as a local politician.</P>
    <P>Before being elected Cathaoirleach, Liam Naughten made many significant contributions to the House in the agricultural area.  As one who comes from an agricultural background I was very impressed by his depth and breadth of knowledge of this area.  As a farmer he had a great feel for the difficulties and opportunities which presented themselves to the farming community.  Liam was a humble, unpretentious man who regarded everyone as equal.  It did not matter whether one was rich or poor, powerful or meek.  I am proud to call myself a colleague.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten was a good ambassador.  He was an excellent representative for the Seanad and the State.  With others, I had the pleasure of being a member of the delegation to Iran last summer of which Liam was leader.  We had lengthy meetings with the Prime Minister, Mr. Rafsanjani, the Foreign Minister, the Minister with responsibility for agriculture as well as our host, the Speaker of the Parliament.  One was extremely impressed and proud of how Liam handled his role.  His natural friendliness and diplomacy as well as his extensive knowledge of his brief stood to him, to the delegation and to the country.</P>
    <P>The last time I was with Liam was for a special lunch he hosted for the visiting Iranian delegation to Ireland last Thursday to which he kindly invited me.  He was a gracious and attentive host. Liam was a very social person.  He loved being with people and enjoyed the company, the drink, the chat and banter, the sharing of joys and woes. This night last week we attended a drinks party in Senator Norris's house recalling our visit to Iran.  It was a most hospitable gathering and Liam was relaxed and enjoyed the occasion.  It was the typical Liam.</P>
    <P>Above all, Liam was a family man.  I want to convey my condolences to Mary, his eight children, his brother and sister and I hope that the strength which his wife showed during the past four days will sustain her over the years.</P>
    <P>Liam had a special interest in a subject in which I am also very interested &mdash; the problem of suicide.  We often discussed the matter and when we were arranging a recent conference he proposed that a large delegation attend from the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> I was at a meeting earlier today at which Monaghan Fianna Fáil Councillor Brendan Hughes described Liam as &ldquo;a hell of a nice fellow,&rdquo;; he was a hell of a nice fellow.  Ar dheas Dé go raibh a anam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We were all shocked at the tragic passing of Liam.  I first got to know him in 1977 when he stood as a candidate in the general election with Joan Burke and my father.  My father and I commented over the weekend on what a fine, handsome man Liam was at that stage.  He was only 32 years of age and he entered national politics quite quickly for someone with only local experience.  I also know Liam's brother, Seamus, very well.  He is married to Brid Duignan, a neighbour of mine and, through my father, we have built up a relationship with the Naughten family over the last 25 years.</P>
      <P>I will always remember Liam's ability to remember names, regardless of where he was.  As colleagues we would wish to have the same ability because it is a very good asset to have in politics. Wherever he met people Liam would always know them.  I was speaking to his son, Liam Óg, yesterday who said that of the thousands who attended his removal and funeral, Liam would have known the vast majority of them by their first name.</P>
      <P>Mark Fitzgerald said to me yesterday that when he was a young fellow coming into Leinster House, Liam always had the time to stop and say hello where other members of the parliamentary party would be too busy to recognise him.</P>
      <P>I have a final story which sums up Liam Naughten.  In 1986 my local club Ballinamore were playing Clan na Gael in a Connaught club final and I was playing centre half forward.  I had been elected to the county council in 1985 with a view to a successful career in politics.  I had a nightmare of a game and missed many scores. Clan na Gael won the Connaught final for the fourth or fifth successive time.  The match was played in Leitrim and was attended by about 4,000 people.  Liam put his arm around me after the game and offered me one piece of advice.  He said &ldquo;if you have an interest in politics you better give up this game because no one will vote for you the way you play.&rdquo;  I gave up football but I am not too sure about politics.</P>
      <P>I know Liam's wife, Mary, and his children well.  The humility of the Naughten family was shown when, in the midst of their tragic loss, one of their main concerns was that Liam's driver, Tom Duignan, would survive.  This was extremely decent and humble of them.  Whatever support they need they should receive from all Members of the Oireachtas because they are not going to have it easy over the next number of years. Hopefully they will achieve whatever they wish for.  May the Lord have mercy on his soul.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with Senators in expressing my sympathy to Mary Naughten and her children on the sad death of Liam.  I first <Col N="635" /> met him in 1965 in the middle of the general election after mass in Shannonbridge.  I was introduced to him by the late John Molloy of Clonmacnoise.  We spoke for a while and retired to Killeen's where we discussed the political scene.  We discussed Roscommon, Galway and Laois-Offaly.  E.B. Murphy was writing in the <i>Sunday Independent </i> and we analysed what he had to say.</P>
      <P>I kept in touch with Liam and met him many times in Shannonbridge and the areas around Athlone.  At that time he was a fine, strong young man with a good head of black hair.  He had great strength yet he was very gentle.  His gentleness and generosity always shone through.  He was very generous with himself and his time.  He was generous in his approach to everyone irrespective of who they were.</P>
      <P>Liam Naughten had a love of politics, farming, football and athletics.  He was a wonderful family man.  All these characteristics have been passed on to his wife and family, they are his greatest legacy.</P>
      <P>During the last election I finished canvassing in Cork.  I met Liam in the house of Councillor John Cal McCarthy in Rossmore.  We had both received generous hospitality in Cork throughout the weekend and we were in good humour when we got to John Cal's house.  We went down to Rossmore where we improved our humour further; we returned to John Cal's house and improved it still further.  We then headed into O'Donovans hotel in Clonakilty where we finished the night canvassing one another.  Liam drove us to a meeting of Cork County Council the following morning.  It was a beautiful cold morning.</P>
      <P>I knew Liam well and learned a lot from him. Today I learned more from listening to the tributes paid by other speakers.  To his wife, Mary, his family and his brother and sister I extend my deepest sympathy.</P>

      <P>I wish to pay tribute to you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for the great dignity and honour you brought to the proceedings on this very difficult day for Seanad Éireann.  I found your contribution moving and beautiful, describing the life of Senator Liam Naughten.  It is important to record on this very difficult day for all of us the great dignity you have brought to the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one of the newest Members to this House. Roughly 12 months ago on the greatest day in my life I was welcomed to the Seanad by the Cathaoirleach, Liam Naughten.  Throughout the <Col N="636" /> 12 months I have been a member here I learned much from the quiet word of advice and comforting thought he would freqently give me as I passed the Chair.  As I passed by the Chair to vote he would sometimes ask me about various matters in other parliamentary parties.  He could not get involved in such matters but he was always interested and keenly aware and I benefitted much from his experience and advice.</P>
    <P>I have known Denis Naughten in particular for the last five or six years through his involvement in young Fine Gael politics and college politics and it is worth putting on the record the great responsibility that he, his brothers and sisters, shouldered yesterday and the day before in their very difficult time.  I extend my sympathy to them at this difficult time.  Liam Naughten was a great Senator, he was a great politician for south Roscommon and he was a great father to his eight children.  All of us on this side of the House will remember him, perhaps none more so than Senator Manning and Senator Cosgrave whom, with Senator Naughten, I describe as one of the great political triumvirates on this side of the House.  He is a great loss to the House and to his party.  He is also a great loss to the Taoiseach for the loyalty and support he has given down the years.  He will be sorely missed.  May he rest in peace.</P>
