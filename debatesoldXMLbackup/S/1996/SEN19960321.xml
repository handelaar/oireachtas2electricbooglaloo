    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Business is item 1, without debate, and item 2.  I hope that we will be able to finish item 2 today, but if by 5 p.m. it has not been completed we will adjourn.  There will be a sos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that item 1 is on the agenda.  When I was Leader of the House the current Leader was a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which passed the regulations that allow us to invite people of the stature of Professor Dooge to the House.  I hope it is the first of many invitations.  I agree with the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the call by the president of the IFA this morning for a co-ordinated effort to protect the good name of the beef industry.  If the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry wishes to use this House today to convey the message he has been trying to convey since the announcements in the past 24 hours in the United Kingdom, he will be welcome here.  Fianna Fáil wishes to be part of whatever efforts are made to ensure the protection of the beef industry and to uphold the good name worldwide of Irish beef.  If the Minister agrees, we can change the Order of <Col N="1622" /> Business to allow him to speak to the House today, so we can all support his efforts to protect the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Order of Business today.  I also support Senator Wright's call to offer the Minister the opportunity to use this House to protect the good name of Irish beef.  I am very concerned about this.  Many people are concerned at the huge damage that could be done.  The Minister has made strenuous efforts in the past few hours to protect the name of Irish beef.  I caution him, however, on the assumption that throwing money at advertising will automatically solve the problem.  We must ensure that our house is in order, that those who hear the message know the Minister is able to stand over it.</P>
      <P>There are deep concerns which will not be allayed by advertising or talking. It would be far better to spend some days ensuring there is no question mark over Irish beef so that when the Minister proclaims that, we can stand over it. I will welcome the Minister if he decides to use this House to argue the case for Irish beef.  It is very important that we do not let this scare continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Leader of the Opposition in welcoming Professor Dooge.  I hope this is the first of many such invitations.  It has taken a long time to reach agreement that distinguished visitors should be invited to address the House and I welcome this positive development.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's and Senator Quinn's comments regarding the unfortunate BSE scare in England. It is most regrettable that a group which found no scientific evidence of a connection between BSE and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease went on to state that it thought there was a connection. However, we must accept what has been said and that it is most damaging.  I agree that the Minister should produce specific proposals regarding the meat trade to England, which is worth £200 million to the Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1623" /> What specific proposals does the Minister have in mind to protect that trade and to emphasise that Ireland has dealt with this matter effectively over the years?  Our procedures are very good and the quality of our beef is excellent in terms of health and in every other respect.  I agree with Senator Quinn that advertising is not necessarily the way to deal with this matter and that other approaches might be made through the trade.  However, it is a matter of serious gravity and, given its magnitude, it would be appropriate for the Minister to attend the House to outline his specific response to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel as strongly as Senator Quinn about this matter, and perhaps closer to it because I was the Minister who introduced the slaughter policy in Ireland at considerable cost when these incidents first emerged in Britain.  The British Government failed to introduce that policy.  I was also the Minister who received recognition from the Council of Ministers and our markets in Europe that Irish beef was beyond question due to the policy we pursued from the start.  It is important to point out that there were 120 cases of BSE in Ireland over approximately eight years, most of which can be traced to pedigree cattle which were imported for specific reasons; on a couple of occasions it was possible to identify the food chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much must be done to highlight these facts and I support my colleagues' suggestion that the Minister should avail of this forum today to get across the point of the unquestionable status of Irish beef.  There is also a case for the Commission to relax the rules which prevent countries marketing produce under their national brand names. Under Commission rules it is not permissible to market our beef as Irish beef.  However, in view of the problem which has emerged, a major effort should be made in negotiations with Europe to allow our beef to be marketed, even for a limited period, as Irish <Col N="1624" /> beef.  The Scots do this with Angus beef, but it is not called Scottish beef.  I agree with and support all the efforts being made with regard to this matter.  The foundation on which we are building is strong and I hope action can be taken.</P>
    <P>Regarding an issue raised on yesterday's Order of Business, it has emerged overnight that the British Government may announce in the House of Commons today the provisions it will make regarding electoral arrangements which may be suggested as part of the peace process.  I asked yesterday that the Tánaiste should be invited to attend the Seanad, as it is the only House in session this week, to formally give Members the benefit of the Government's view on this matter.  I understand the Tánaiste was made aware of this proposal last evening and perhaps he wishes to use this forum to give Members a flavour of the Government's response so that we can be as supportive as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Members' comments about the protection of the Irish beef industry.  The House should do anything it can to assist the Minister. Senator O'Kennedy is correct when he says that the nub of the problem is that there will be a drop in the consumption of beef generally and not just Irish beef by the British public.  We must distinguish Irish beef from British beef because the incidence of BSE in Ireland is minuscule in comparison to Britain. The key to marketing is to specifically identify the meat as Irish beef rather than beef in general.  This is the challenge and I hope the House can assist in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the suggestion that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should be invited to the House as huge dangers are involved in the recent BSE scare in Britain.  This is not based on full scientific evidence, but rather in the belief that a connection exists.  However, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease has been identified for over 100 years while mad cow disease has been around for less than ten years.  It is, <Col N="1625" /> therefore, difficult to understand how a disease in cattle could cause a disease which has been endemic in humans for over 100 years.</P>
      <P>Specific dangers are posed to the Irish beef industry because once word gets out that there are problems in Britain and Ireland in terms of BSE, Australia, Argentina and other beef exporting countries which are entering the Middle East market will use it as a marketing ploy.  We have not heard that these cattle exporting countries have problems with BSE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They tried it before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can be sure that the wires in those beef exporting nations are hot regarding this matter.</P>
      <P>I am glad Ireland is opening an embassy in Israel.  I opposed this move many years ago, but it is now opportune. However, according to today's <i>The Irish Times</i> it is not definite that the embassy will be based in Tel Aviv.  The wrong message could go out if it is not based there.  The only other place the Israeli's might wish it to be based is Jerusalem, and there is a move to base embassies there.  However, this would send the wrong signal and we should ensure that the Irish embassy is based in Tel Aviv.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted Ireland is opening diplomatic relations with Mozambique. This came about because Ireland is targeting aid to that country.  Given that this line of communication will be opened, it is timely to hold a debate on aid.  Major problems are associated with world aid at present because many donor countries are using it as a political tool.  There are major problems in every area to which aid is being channelled and a debate on aid from Ireland, multilateral, bilateral or through NGOs, would be appropriate.  It is time to find out what exactly is being done with the money given to these countries.  The NGOs are doing a good job and the bilateral aid programme is also good. However, the multilateral aid programmes through international bodies <Col N="1626" /> are a disgrace and the House should debate this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the suggestion that the Leader should invite the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to the House today to debate the BSE problem.  It is important to emphasise the steps taken by Senator O'Kennedy when he was the Minister to deal with this problem.  The point was made on a number of programmes yesterday that Ireland dealt with this problem head on as it arose.  It is also regrettable that Ireland is in a bind in that it cannot use the national brand name to sell its produce in England and elsewhere.  I am aware of one firm which sells 1,200 to 1,400 animals a week in that market and it cannot brand name it as Irish beef. This should be possible.  It is important to signal that this country is not in the same position as the UK in regard to this issue.  Will the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry give us an hour or two of his time so that we can redress any damage which has been done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Social Welfare to give some indication of the operation of the differential rent scheme, in view of the increasing problems in this area?  There is widespread concern and dissatisfaction with the operation of the scheme.  The Leader will be aware of the public anger aroused this morning when the corporation attempted to evict a woman in Mulhuddart for non-payment of rent.  Some tenants are not in a position to pay the rents levied on them, resulting in cases such as the one this morning when, without the intervention of Gay Byrne, a woman and her five children would have been left on the side of the street.  What does the Minister for Social Welfare or the Minister for the Environment propose to do about this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an urgent need to follow-up the impressive statement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry last evening.  The Minister was convincing in his use of comparable figures.  Great damage could be done to the beef industry.  It behoves everyone &mdash; the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, producers and factory management &mdash; to ensure the use of angel dust to promote growth is stopped, once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely, that was part of the joint strategy I launched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for the Minister to address this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a full explanation of the position of Irish beef so that its good name will be maintained around the world.  I also ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Minister for Health and other Ministers to ensure the health of the people, having regard to products imported from England from possibly infected beef.  I refer to meat pies, sausages and other products.  It is a matter of grave concern that the public can be exposed to this disease through the importation of such products.  We have a responsibility to protect people's health.  While the cattle industry is very important, our people come first.  The importation of products made from offal should be thoroughly investigated and the public must be assured there are not infected products on the shelves of shops and supermarkets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I previously raised the issue of insurable care for psychiatric patients under the new regulations to be agreed between insurers and the Department of Health.  Unofficial information has come to hand which indicates that psychiatric patients will receive only 100 days of insurable cover, while patients <Col N="1628" /> in other health care areas will receive 180 days.  This is terrible discrimination against psychiatric patients.  I hope the information brought to my attention is incorrect, but if it is not we have a duty to ensure psychiatric patients are not discriminated against.  Will the Minister for Health make a statement on this matter?  I am amazed a distinction is made between psychiatric and general patients.  Similar guidelines and regulations should apply to all patients buying private health insurance cover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Senators who expressed concern in regard to the beef industry and I support the Minister.  The point has been well made so I will not labour it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Dardis in welcoming the motion in the name of the Leader inviting Mr. Jim Dooge to address the House.  This is a worthwhile step forward.  I know Jim Dooge well as I served with him for many years on the Irish Council of the European Movement and he will give a very good address.  We should not be afraid to invite distinguished people to address the House and, once we get used to the idea, the next time there is a suggestion to invite Mother Teresa of Calcutta to the House we will not be afraid to hear what the little lady might have to say to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support other Senators in relation to the beef industry which is at a very critical stage.  Will the Leader provide time for a debate on level crossings? The Department of the Environment, local authorities or Iarnród Éireann do not want to take responsibility for widening level crossings.  This House is an ideal forum for a debate on this matter.  The majority of level crossings need to be altered because of changes in transport and agricultural machinery.  If the legislation needs to be changed to deal with this we should initiate such changes in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the call for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to make a statement to the House.  The beef industry is at risk since the North and South of Ireland constitute on entity at EU level.  When derogations and so on are negotiated with regard to animal health matters, the UK spokesman comes to one arrangement for Great Britain and a separate one for the North and South of Ireland.  I would like to be assured by the Minister that Northern Ireland and the 26 counties are at one in their approach to this issue.  The presentation of this matter is a problem because the tabloid newspapers have treated it as if expert opinion does not count.  The North and South must look very seriously at the presentation of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the welcome from all sides of the House for item 1, which is a very timely move on our part.  I know it will be a success and I hope it will become a regular feature of our proceedings.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senators who made contributions on the BSE scare.  The point was well made that this matter of vital national importance calls for a coordinated national effort.  Some of the points raised this morning are very relevant, particularly the point by Senator Quinn and Senator Sherlock that there is a need to ensure, as we do, that everything in our industry is beyond reproach.  There is also a need in marketing and presentation terms to counteract the huge potential damage which faces this vital industry.  I thank Senators for their contributions on that issue.  Senator O'Kennedy's contribution was particularly worthwhile as was that of Senator McAughtry on the marketing aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised the question of electoral arrangements in Northern Ireland.  This will be announced in the House of Commons today when a full document will be made available. Only then can a debate on the proposals <Col N="1630" /> begin.  We should bear in mind that the ultimate aim is to get to all party talks. It would be a great pity if the electoral arrangements were to become a matter of fundamental principle between the parties.  It would be better for us to wait and see and encourage people to move towards the final objective of all party talks rather than get too bogged down or back people into intractable positions about what is really a means to an end.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the establishment of an embassy in Israel which I welcome.  I support the Senator's views on where it should be located.  A debate on aid would also be worthwhile.  Senator Daly raised the problem in Mulhuddart.  Rather than rush to judgment, we should hear the full story.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Finneran asked about offal based imports and I will bring his remarks to the attention of the Minister.  Perhaps his question about the care of psychiatric patients should be raised on the Adjournment and if that does not succeed, we can look at another way of raising it.</P>
      <P>Senator Lydon's point is well taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State took Committee Stage on the last occasion and I am glad to take over from him. This is one of the most important environmental Bills to come before the Oireachtas; it is probably the most <Col N="1632" /> important environmental Bill I will steer through the Houses.  I will have the opportunity on Committee Stage to make a number of general comments on background information and the thinking that informed the Bill.</P>
      <P>We discussed this issue at length previously and I understand the wish of Senators to have clarity about the implementation of proposals.  I worked for a long time on the Child Care Bill during its passage through the Oireachtas and it is understandable that Members are anxious to ensure that legislation is given effect within a reasonable time frame.  It is my intention that all the provisions of this Bill will be implemented as speedily as possible. However, some of the provisions are extremely onerous and complicated.</P>
      <P>This section envisages the development of a national hazardous waste management plan to be devised and published by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The agency is a new body which has grown in responsibility.  No later than yesterday I signed a new set of orders developing further the integrated licensing system and bringing further activities under EPC control. The development of a national hazardous waste management plan will be a demanding job for the agency.  I have consulted at length with the agency and it is envisaged that it will take approximately 18 months subsequent to the enactment of this legislation to develop the plan.  I have power under the Bill to determine a time frame and I ask the Senators not to write a time frame of 12 months into the Bill.  That cannot be achieved.  Independent consultants will be required to work on the development of the plan.  The expertise available to the agency will also be involved.  We have mapped out with great care the responsibilities that will be required and my best estimate is that it will take approximately 18 months.</P>
      <P>I ask Senator Daly not to press the amendment and to accept my good faith in this matter.  It is my intention to have it done as expeditiously as possible.</P>

What if the Minister is not in office in 18 months time and there is a slackening in the policy? The Minister is following a vigorous policy.  Is there any mechanism whereby we can look at this matter later and ensure that it is being done?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(b) the need to facilitate economic and social development.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1634" /> This amendment was put down by Senator Henry who, unfortunately, cannot be here today.  The amendment appears to be in the wrong place, but Senator Henry was concerned that the management plan should take the issue of jobs into consideration.  She was concerned that if it was limited it would be relieved of the responsibility to recognise the need to ensure that economic and social development are taken into account.  If we are to create jobs we cannot wash our hands of the need to do this.  This was Senator Henry's intention in putting down this amendment and perhaps the Minister will take it into account.</P>

      <P>The amendment would require the Environmental Protection Agency to have regard to the need to facilitate economic and social development in the preparation of a national hazardous waste plan.  I presume the intention is that this criterion would underline all planning and not only the waste plan which is relevant to section 26.  This is not a stand alone Bill.  It is complicated and detailed and we did not rewrite into it provisions which are extant in existing legislation.</P>
      <P>This Bill should be seen as a dovetail into the progressive Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  The overriding requirement of the Environmental Protection Agency is set out in some detail in that Act and under section 52 (2) the agency is required to have regard in all its planning to the matters which the amendment requires it to facilitate.  Section 52 (2) (e) requires the agency to:</P>
      <P>ensure, in so far as is practicable, that a proper balance is achieved between the need to protect the environment (and the cost of such protection) and the need for infrastructural, economic and social progress and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement set out in the amendment is already met in the parent legislation which established the Environmental Protection Agency.  It must have regard in all its deliberations to economic <Col N="1635" /> and social progress and development.</P>

      <P>The Bill is designed to fit in with the existing corpus of legislation. The 1992 Act established the Environmental Protection Agency.  There is also a Water Pollution Act and an Air Pollution Act.  This Bill deals with solid waste.  All of them knit together.  There are provisions which are common to all but not repeated in each.  It would be wasteful to repeat the provisions already the law of the land.  To answer the Senator's question directly, there is a requirement on the agency to have regard to social and economic development in implementing any of the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties with regard to this amendment is that there is little by way of financial commitments or provisions in the Bill.  While the Minister indicated that assistance will be provided, there is no definite figure set down or even a suggestion as to what will be the likely assistance.  Will the Minister indicate what is envisaged by &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; in money terms and how it will be provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wanted to raise this point.  Obligations are being imposed on local authorities and there is a cost involved in meeting them.  Section 28 (1) states that:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of promoting, supporting or facilitating the prevention or minimisation of waste, any Minister of the Government or a local authority may provide such support or assistance, including the provision of moneys. . . in relation to research and development. . .</P>
      <P>While I do not oppose the amendment, there is a wider dimension which must be considered.  In the famous example of Kill in County Kildare, when planning permission was granted by An Bord Pleanála, onerous obligations were put on the local authority in respect of emissions from and management of the dump and each of these created a cost.  Dublin waste was to arrive at a dump in County Kildare but the local authority in that county had to meet the cost of managing the facility which arose from the disposal of this waste.</P>
      <P>This is a serious problem and there are other sections which deal with similar aspects.  The principle which applies in the case of the Environmental Protection Agency arises in section 28 (o) which refers to:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> conferring on public authorities (including the Minister) and other specified persons specified additional functions for the purpose of securing or facilitating the operation of provisions of regulations under this section,</P>
    <P>The best available technology dimension is also evident here.  Does this mean that if the cost of obligations imposed on local authorities are high, they can invoke the best available technology clause and avoid having to do things which otherwise they might be required to do?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be generous towards local councils. Galway County Council has a waste management plan, due to the initiative of its manager and staff.  This plan is for the period up to 2015.  Much work and endeavour went into it and it was passed by the council.  Implementing its proposals will have financial implications for the council and I appeal to the Minister to look as favourably as possible on councils which have taken the initiative to develop waste management plans.  I commend the Minister for what he has done to date but I hope the finance which is crucial for the future will be available to follow up the literature, rules and regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of important questions have been raised and I will cover them as best I can.  I will give the philosophical overview of this issue. Waste disposal entails cost.  Who carries the cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle in this legislation is the principle that underscores all environmental legislation in this country and in the European Union, that is, the polluter pays.  The person who creates waste must bear the cost of disposing of it.  It is no longer acceptable that people who create waste should leave it to someone else, including local authorities, to pay for it.  The polluter pays principle will mean that the creators of waste will bear higher costs.  Since the <Col N="1638" /> publication of this Bill I have made no secret of the fact that waste disposal in the future will be more onerous and expensive than it has been heretofore. Who will carry that cost?  The creators of the waste &mdash; individuals, companies or organisations &mdash; will bear the cost which will be onerous.</P>
    <P>We have introduced a hierarchy of principles.  The first is waste minimisation so that we can reduce in volume terms the amount of waste to be disposed of.  I have had discussions with a number of organisations, mainly IBEC, which has been proactive in addressing this issue in advance of any legislation being enacted.  It has created a commercial company called REPAK with the objective of taking out of the waste cycle 120,000 tonnes of packaging waste annually within a five year time frame. It has put its own money into that process and it will achieve a reduction of up to 27 per cent of the total packaging waste to be taken out of the waste cycle within five years.  That is a tripling of our current achievement and is a good start, but it is not the end of it.  It shows that companies, individuals and organisations which create waste are taking a fresh look at how their operations work. I have had discussions with one company which said that a fundamental root and branch analysis of its waste had enabled it to cut waste volumes by 80 per cent.  That is a staggering achievement.</P>
    <P>The introduction of cost effective charges for waste disposal means that waste minimisation and recycling becomes more economically acceptable and viable.  For all our good intentions, nothing drives change like costs.  We are putting in place a waste régime which will encourage waste minimisation and recycling.  When disposing of a volume of waste, a real cost must be met by the creators of the waste, not by the local or commercial authority which disposes of it.  Those are the principles which guide it.</P>
    <P>We have transposed the principle of BATNEEC &mdash; best available technology not exceeding excessive costs &mdash;<Col N="1639" /> into this Bill.  We cannot introduce environmental requirements which are so economically oppressive that they would put people out of business.  That is going too far.  However, we will expect the best available technology to be used and there will be no avoidance of that requirement.</P>
    <P>As regards supports for local authorities and others, I do not have a windfall to hand over to local authorities to manage their affairs better.  I have required local authorities to draw up waste management plans.  I have also encouraged smaller authorities to use the structure of the regional authorities to draw up regional waste management plans.  There are a number of types of waste which can be best disposed of and which may not be found in each county. This synergy is developing in some counties.  Some urban authorities do not have land for waste disposal.  They must engage in discussions with their neighbours about a comprehensive plan.  It is not a matter, as Senator Dardis suggested, of handing waste over to another local authority to bear the cost. The producer of the waste must bear that cost.</P>
    <P>Recycling is an extremely important component in waste minimisation. Within the next couple of weeks I will publish the details of moneys available for waste minimisation and recycling projects.  Moneys are and will be available under the operational programme between now and 1999.  The details on how public and private enterprise should apply for that will be available in the next few weeks, as will a revised overall recycling strategy to develop the national strategy, which has already been published by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the Minister adopts a uniform approach, a haphazard situation could develop where some authorities, but not others, pay grants or assistance.  This would lead to confusion and complaints.  The Minister should outline how this will be done, although he should not do so by legislation or <Col N="1640" /> ministerial order.  I would have tabled an amendment to include a money provision had I the power to do so.  A token amount of £1 million or £2 million could be set aside in this regard.  The Minister should issue guidelines so that progressive action does not take place in one local authority &mdash; Galway County Council was mentioned &mdash; but not in others.  This could lead to a lack of uniformity and confusion between local authorities who pay grants for research by community groups on how to reduce their costs and those who do not.  Guidelines must be issued otherwise nothing will be done because of competing demands on local authorities.  Since they will be statutorily obliged to offer assistance, a token amount should be set aside which can be reviewed every five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have talked to local authorities throughout the country about this Bill and I have made it clear this is what the Government requires.  I did not need to do so because every local authority is already engaged in developing its own waste management plan.  I have met all the regional authorities and they mentioned the synergy of co-operation between local authorities. There is ongoing dialogue. However, there is always a dichotomy and people argue both sides of the coin in any debate on local authorities. Sometimes people want centralised law laid down so that everybody marches to the same beat while others want devolution and subsidiarity to allow everyone to do their own thing.  We cannot have both.  I have faith that local government will do the job because it is the right thing to do.  Local authorities have embraced the proposals I gave them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some ambitious projects are already surfacing, such as integrated waste management plans for urban areas which <Col N="1641" /> deal with collection, waste segregation, composting, waste minimisation strategies, education in the schools, etc. Local authorities are devising such strategies now.  I look forward to the submissions I will receive when I publish the guidelines and application forms for research and waste management available under the operational programme. Some £18 million will be available between now and 1999 under the operational programme.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will also be able to generate moneys from charging for waste disposal.  The principle that polluter pays will apply because if we do not require the person generating the waste to pay, there is no incentive not to continue producing it.  It is not a good idea that the State or the taxpayer should fund waste disposal as opposed to those who create the waste.  There must be a financial incentive to minimise waste production in the first instance, which is the underlying strategy of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what the Minister said about the devolution of powers to local authorities and the idea of subsidiarity. In that context, I hope he will remind his Labour Party colleagues on Kildare County Council that that principle operates when we come to consider taxi and hackney licences.  I believe they would like it dealt with by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister about cost and that people do not act in a particular way until there is a financial obligation on them to do so or there is a penalty.  On the question of the polluter paying, a later section refers to the obligations of the local authority in its functional area in terms of minimising pollution. This brings us back to the difficulty in Kill where we await a High Court decision on whether the facility there will go ahead.  Kildare County Council is responsible for the functional area, while the waste comes from Dublin. From the later provisions on the obligations on a local authority for its functional area, it strikes me that emissions <Col N="1642" /> from that landfill facility will be the responsibility of Kildare County Council rather than Dublin, which is sending the waste.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the person who generates the waste is responsible for it but once it is in the ground, it will be difficult to go back to those who put it there as it will be in a different local authority functional area.  Although the Minister said the creator of the waste should pay, I am not sure it would not fall to Kildare County Council to meet some of these costs because the landfill dump is in its functional area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Minister's confidence in the local authority system. We know the expertise is there and local authorities are now committed to action.  The Minister mentioned liaisons between councils and groups.  I understand that in the western region meetings between managers of county councils are ongoing and that counties are liaising on the important matter of waste disposal and the provision of facilities.  I endorse what the Minister said and I share his confidence in the local authority system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will understand if I am not drawn into an issue which is under judicial review.  The principle that the polluter pays will apply. Obviously, the operation of a landfill facility for the disposal of waste, will be the responsibility of the operator.  If the operator is a local authority, it will be its responsibility.  This Bill takes away from local authorities the power to monitor and licence themselves because that proved unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before any local authority or private waste disposal facility is established, it must be independently vetted and licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency, which will be the monitoring agency for future performance.  If a local authority purports to offer a facility for waste disposal, it must comply with the high standards set out in the Bill.  Local authorities will need to work out plans in terms of the cost of doing <Col N="1643" /> that and charge the producer of waste an appropriate amount which will cover the environmental cost of its safe disposal. That is a clear principle which will be followed by commercial and local authority waste disposal operations after the enactment of this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the previous section the Minister and the local authority could provide support and assistance. This section relates more directly to the polluter pays principle and measures concerning the recovery of waste.  I am not clear whether the local authority as well as the Minister can take specific actions in this area.  Section 29 (4) states that regulations under this section &ldquo;may provide&rdquo;.  Is it only the Minister who can make these regulations or can local authorities take specific actions?  I support those speakers and the Minister who said that local authorities, in some cases, should be able to take specific actions which could vary from one local authority to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much scope in this section to make the polluter pay and for generating finance which would allow local authorities to operate principles of recovery and recycling.  Section 29 (4) (f) states: &ldquo;requiring a producer, distributor or retailer to operate a deposit and refund scheme&rdquo;, while section 29 (4) (i) allows a sales outlet to impose a <Col N="1644" /> charge on a customer.  May outlets charge for plastic bags?  At present people must pay to use environmentally friendly bags, while plastic bags are provided free hand over first.  Will it be possible for local authorities to charge for plastic bags and to require distributors and shops to have a deposit and refund scheme which would allow for the return of packaging waste?  This idea is well advanced in France and Germany. Does the Minister intend to introduce regulations under this section, which has the capacity to make a difference in practices?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first read section 29 (4) (j) I thought it would be extremely difficult for it to work.  It was not until I heard the Minister explain the polluter pays principle on Second Stage that I began to understand it.  If this is to work, the public must be educated and, as a nation, we have not done a very good job in this regard.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator O'Sullivan's point, it will not be easy to charge for packaging.  My company tried to do this some years ago but it did not work.  I remember a customer with £80 worth of goods being asked to pay 8p for eight plastic bags.  The customer refused to pay and asked if we wanted her business. It is unlikely that businesses will be able to enforce this.  Will the shopkeeper need to put his hand in his pocket and break the law to pay the 8p? I say this not to disagree with it &mdash; the concept is exactly right, the Minister has it right &mdash; but it will not work without more education and a deeper understanding. When I sit down with a group of customers I find a small number of deeply committed people understand it but a large number of customers who will say that they do not understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In supporting and agreeing with this empowering legislation, I must say it cannot work without a greater emphasis on the education aspect.  I would remind the Minister of the need to ensure this education process takes place not just in this area but in every area.  The question of the polluter pays is not just for the <Col N="1645" /> industrial waste creator; it is one for every person who throws litter on the street, even those who buy a wrapped sweet produce some form of litter or waste.  We must do a huge job, as a nation, to present that issue to the people so that it is understood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>During its discussion on waste management, Cork County Council held a day long seminar to deal with many aspects of waste disposal.  Of course, the concept that the polluter pays was one prominent aspect of it.  A number of experts discussed all aspects of waste disposal and recovery; it was a very useful day.</P>
      <P>During the seminar we addressed educating households in the types of waste involved because people often say they have a waste bin in which they can throw anything.  A little thought can often reduce a great amount of disposable waste.  How many items can be dumped in the fire?  How many items can be used to fertilise the garden which are dumped in the dustbin and taken away?  Local authorities must then try to find places to dispose of this waste at tremendous cost.  I believe education and the polluter pays principle are important aspects of waste management.</P>

      <P>The concept that the polluter pays is crucial and important. When this Bill becomes law, it is vital that it is followed by a strong public relations campaign to remind people of the importance of what is enshrined in it.  I agree with my colleague, Senator Calnan, that seminars and conferences on waste management and pollution will be important over the next number of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have a part to play.  I think it was G.K. Chesterton who said &ldquo;Trifles make perfection but perfection is no trifle&rdquo;. This Bill may not be perfect but if we all do a little &mdash; that is the trifle &mdash; we can make it almost perfect.  We all have an important part to play in bringing this into being so the idea of education, PR and seminars on waste management, <Col N="1646" /> pollution and environmental friendliness will be important when the Bill is passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important section of the Bill.  In answer to Senator O'Sullivan's question, it will be for the Minister to draw up the regulations.  It is not envisaged that individual local authorities would set charges for different types of activities within their areas. That would create a level of confusion and be anti-competitive.  It would work against the overall aim, which is environmental rather than fiscal, although I am sure some local authorities would look on it as a fiscal as opposed to an environmental measure.</P>
      <P>I envisage drafting regulations which have national application exactly on the lines discussed.  I intend to undertake a great deal of consultation because I am acutely aware of the practical difficulties that will arise instanced by Senator Quinn.  I do not want to go off on a tangent but we are reviewing the litter legislation separately and it will be published before the summer and I intend having an impactive anti-litter campaign. There will be meaningful legislative change, education and a media campaign and we will mobilise everyone in this society against litter.  I have discussed the matter with business and chairpersons and management at local authority level.  The point Senator Quinn raised about plastic bags arises with litter, that is, the enforceability of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A litter survey yesterday revealed that the majority of people did not know it was an offence punishable by a £25 fine to drop litter on the street, although the legislation making it an offence is 13 years old.  Many county managers and chairpersons of local authorities said bluntly that if Mrs. Murphy is stopped in the street for dropping a piece of paper by a litter warden who says &ldquo;Madam, you have committed an offence and I am fining you £25&rdquo;, there would be blue murder because we are not yet attuned psychologically to the gravity of litter as an offence whereas <Col N="1647" /> we take parking on a double yellow line as an offence and pay the penalty.  In fact, we do not park in such places because we know there will be a penalty for doing so.  We need to change public awareness in exactly the way Senators have mentioned so that it will be as psychologically unacceptable for us to drop litter on the street as it is to drop litter in our sitting rooms.</P>
    <P>The same applies to waste minimisation. We must stop the production of plastic bags which festoon every roadside, shrub and hedgerow in the country. The way is not to spend more and more in collecting and cleaning those roadsides &mdash; we spend about £20 million on litter collection at present &mdash; but to cut down on the production of plastic bags.  Although there are environmentally supportive and friendly shops, shopkeepers and supermarket operators, there are those who will wrap every item four-fold before they give them to you.  I have often gone into a shop to buy a newspaper to be asked &ldquo;Do you want it in a bag?&rdquo;.  We must change that concept.  Everything need not be wrapped twice or three times. We must get away from that thinking and part of that could involve charging for plastic bags, for example.</P>
    <P>It is my belief &mdash; and I have discussed it with some supermarket operators &mdash; that those who are proactive in this will actually gain clientéle.  There will be the one who will not pay the 8p on £80 but there will be many more who will say that people, companies and supermarket operators who take a stand on this, who are pathfinders, will actually gain support and attract business.  We cannot operate without creating an even playing field and what applies to one, must apply to all.  All my discussions so far have indicated goodwill from shopkeepers and operators to minimise the use of plastic bags for example, but there are other issues also &mdash; the production of aluminium cans, tin cans, etc.</P>
    <P>When I was a chap there was always a deposit on bottles.  One collected half a dozen bottles, brought them back and <Col N="1648" /> got a couple of pence on each bottle.  It was a way of getting a few shillings.  Now everything is disposable.  We must reverse that trend so that there is a requirement to return bottles, for example, and to minimise packaging. That is what is provided for in this section.  Regulations will be drawn up and it is my intention to do that with much consultation and advanced planning. It would be my intention not to adopt the big stick approach.  As far as possible, where we can get voluntary codes and agreements, we will not take the big stick route.  From my initial discussions with all concerned.  I feel there is a great willingness to go down this road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the Minister's remarks.  My household separates cans, bottles and newspapers from the rest of the waste because there is a facility close to us where we can dispose of those materials.  This is the key to the matter.  Unless a facility is easily accessible, one will not use it.  It is easy to put waste in a car and dump it into the Rehab bottle bank etc. and that is where local authorities can make a significant contribution.  Kildare County Council has done a good job in that respect, particularly in the larger towns.  While education is important, access to these waste disposal facilities is central.  The Minister is right about plastic bags. More often than not one has to tell a shopkeeper one does not want a plastic bag for shopping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's intention to introduce regulations quickly following consultation in this area.  This will be crucial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The option to take individual responsibility has not been grasped by the people, even when a facility is nearby.  While we say people should not use too many plastic bags and should return bottles, cans etc. for recycling, we still regard it as not being our problem. There are widespread facilities, especially for dumping bottles and cans, if one has access to transport, although <Col N="1649" /> this poses a problem for people without cars.  However, we need to bring home to people that they, as individuals, have a responsibility.  People should not use too many plastic bags when shopping and since we still have not got this message across it may be necessary to charge for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the disposal of waste from boats coming ashore.  Under the Pollution Act and the MARPOL directives, etc., the onus is on our port authority to ensure it disposes of whatever waste comes from a boat which arrives from the Continent. The means by which this waste can be disposed of are clearly laid out.  It cannot be disposed of in a refuse dump.</P>
      <P>We had a problem with a Russian ship that came to Dingle port.  We had to get a health inspector from Kerry County Council to examine it.  We also had to get a special container and a tractor and trailer to take this refuse to a farm to be buried at a cost of £200.  I could not understand why we had to do that.</P>
      <P>Many boats and yachts come to Cork port on a regular basis and hundreds of European tourists use the ferry in their cars during the summer.  That creates waste.  Why is it so difficult to get rid of rubbish from a boat when the people driving from the ferry may put their refuse into the first litter bin they see?  This Bill will not control the refuse that will come into our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kerry County Council will not take the waste the Dingle Harbour Commissioners collect from its pier.  The commissioners must dispose of it. Where is the Minister going with a measure like this?  We provided waste bins for Dingle harbour and pier.  They are being used by the public because they know we will empty them quickly. Pollution control and waste management are linked, but do not get any cooperation from Kerry County Council.  I raised the matter with its manager at a <Col N="1650" /> recent meeting and he told me it was our problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is right; the polluter pays.  The creator and receiver of the waste, if they are willing to accept it, must devise a way to dispose of it. Local authorities will have a legal obligation to dispose of waste in a way that does not damage the environment. Once this Bill is enacted, anybody on Irish soil will be required to do the same.</P>
      <P>In separating and recycling waste, the bring and collect systems are generally used.  The collect system operates largely in Dublin through Kerbside, an effective collect system.  That will be expanded greatly under the REPAK initiative launched some weeks ago.  The bring system, where people like Senator Dardis use bottle, can, fabric and paper banks to dispose of various types of recyclable material, is to be expanded as well.  We envisage a doubling of the current provision so we can provide a bring system to the vast bulk of our population.</P>
      <P>I am concerned, and it is covered in this Bill, that the operation of those systems should be environmentally friendly.  We have all seen bottle banks overflowing on weekends and people stacking bottles beside the bank on the street.  That is not, and will not be, acceptable.  Whoever operates these facilities, and some do so extremely well, will have to ensure they are properly monitored and emptied, otherwise they will work against the environmental objectives in this Bill.  The Rehabilitation Institute, under the commercial wing of Gandon Enterprises, is a large operator in this area and it plans to expand considerably.  All of these operations can be facilitated by new grant aid that will be available shortly under the operational programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I envisage that much of our domestic waste can be segregated and recycled. The objective under the existing recycling strategy is to triple the volume of domestic waste recycled.  We currently recycle around 7 per cent of our <Col N="1651" /> domestic waste and an objective of 21 per cent is modest; I hope we can go much further that that.  However, we need to change the psychological attitude of our people that this is not simply somebody else's problem.  One worrying aspect of yesterday's litter survey is that 14 per cent of people who responded said there was nothing wrong with disposing of litter for somebody else to collect. We get bizarre and silly comments to the effect that disposing of waste in an environmentally friendly way would only put sweepers out of a job.  We must fundamentally change that attitude because the vast bulk of our population want a clean environment.</P>
    <P>Waste will be one of the biggest issues local authorities will have to address in the next century.  We are now putting in a legislative framework to meet the problem.  I have no illusions about this. Enacting this provision will not cure the waste problem.  Purists would argue that no residual waste should be left at the end of the waste hierarchy because it will either all have been recycled or greatly minimised.  There will always be some irreducible volume at the end but we want to make that as small as we can and we must find a method of dealing with it.  We have the options of landfill sites or incineration but I do not perceive huge enthusiasm for either idea.  A strategy must be devised to work in a way which does not impact on the environment. Only through time can we make those options acceptable to local communities.  A great deal of work must be done to achieve this objective.  I have no illusions in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Senator's pardon. I am sure he will forgive me if I do not deal with the waste problems of every local authority.  I addressed the issue in general terms by informing the <Col N="1652" /> Senator that it is his problem and he must deal with it.  The problem can be solved commercially, by using a waste disposal company, or through negotiation with the local authority.  It strikes me as odd that the Senator cannot reach a commercial settlement with the county council for the disposal of waste. I will not involve myself with resolving the Senator's difficulties with his county council because I have other things to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty communicating with the county council. The Minister will probably receive a letter about the matter soon because of the way we have been treated.</P>
      <P>My point is that, if the pollution control Acts and the MARPOL Convention are to be implemented, special disposable containers must be used to offload the waste from pleasure boats entering Irish ports.  However, ferries entering Irish ports with 150 tourist cars on board are not required to disclose whether they are importing waste.  The importation of such waste to an island nation is classed as hazardous waste under the contol of pollution Acts and other legislation.  Nobody knows the nature of such waste which could bring disease into the country.  The legislation is implemented in relation to yachts, etc., but is not implemented where ferries are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Hazardous waste cannot be imported.  A regime is in place which sets out in clear terms how someone can do so if dealing with a recycling plant.  I am not aware of the importation of hazardous waste at present.  The disposal policy for hazardous waste was established by my predecessor.  There will not be a national hazardous waste incinerator. Hazardous waste will be disposed of on the site where it is produced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald referred to the disposal of waste at sea.  Even though legislation covering that is in place, concerns have been expressed that sizeable amounts of waste are being washed up on beaches.  Questions arise on dealing with this problem and it seems there is a division of responsibility between Departments.  The Department of the Marine has responsibility to prevent dumping of waste at sea but quite an amount of waste is washed up on our coastline even though legislation to minimise the problem has been enacted.  The legislation has had very little visible impact, a fact which is illustrated by the huge volumes of waste that wash up on our shores in a rough winter.  There may be a need to encourage a closer liaison between the Departments of the Marine and the Environment to resolve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has clarified the point.  This matter involves two separate issues.  The disposal of waste at sea does not come within the purview of this legislation, it is controlled by separate legislation which falls under the ambit of the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the introduction of legislation, sizeable amounts of refuse are still being deposited on Irish beaches.  The beaches in the Minister's county were affected by such waste last week and the beaches in west Clare were devastated by people washing out oil tanks.  This involves separate legislation <Col N="1654" /> which does not seem to be effective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated clearly the principles included in this legislation.  The Bill is very complicated and complex and is designed to deal with solid waste management.  It does not deal with water or air pollution or dumping at sea, for which there are existing legislative frameworks and separate enactments.  If the law of the land is not effective, the matter should be examined by the appropriate Minister.  This is not a catch-all Bill to deal with the various aspects of waste or pollution.  It is specifically stated that pollution at sea is not encompassed by the Bill, which is comprehensive, detailed and demanding enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to unduly delay the passage of this Bill.  I appreciate the Minister's remarks. However, to give him an example, a local community organisation in west Clare removed in the region of 20 tonnes of waste material from the coastline between Spanish Point and Quilty as part of a community effort.  The local authority or some other body should be responsible for the collection and disposal of such waste, which includes empty wine bottles, disused fishing gear, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are straying well beyond the scope of the Bill, which deals with genuine and complicated issues: if a general debate on pollution is required.  I will happily come back for one.  The question of sewage disposal into the Shannon is not covered in the <Col N="1656" /> Bill, which is comprehensive legislation dealing with solid waste.  The pump-out facilities on the Shannon are a matter for the Office of Public Works, which provides them.  I have had discussions with the Office of Public Works in my general responsibilities as I am anxious that comprehensive pump-out facilities be available.  I used the river for the first time last year and it is not acceptable that people discharge their waste into it. However, that issue is not encompassed in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned time frames on a previous section, a factor that applies to this section also.  As it can be difficult to grasp a technical Bill such as this when examining it line by line, can the Minister outline the time frame in this section?  There will be ministerial, local authority and area programmes but what co-ordination will there be between them?  Without necessarily going into detail, perhaps the Minister would indicate how it will work in practice. If he will be preparing a programme which will be reviewed, will it have to be completed within a period of, say one year or five years?  If no time frame is provided for, it will not be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 30 refers to public authority waste management and it is my intention to promulgate such a programme as soon as the Bill is enacted.  I have already begum work on its preparation and this section shows the framework I have laid out.  We are currently developing guidelines for the approach to environmental management at public authority level, through the publication of &ldquo;green housekeeping&rdquo; guidelines.  There will be need for a wide range of consultation with local <Col N="1657" /> authorities and Government Departments, which will start shortly.</P>
      <P>I expect the final set of housekeeping guidelines to be used by public authorities to be available before the end of this year.  It is my intention to direct that the guidelines should be sent to all Government Departments and that they be asked to adopt them for use by themselves and any agency under their control. The process will include formulating plans which incorporate waste minimisation, green procurement and recycling as well as energy conservation measures.  The latter have already been dealt with by colleagues from the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the Irish Energy Centre, while local authorities have already started the &ldquo;Agenda 21&rdquo; and sustainable development initiatives.  I am meeting local authorities tomorrow to discuss the strategic management initiative and I will put this factor to them.  All public authorities &mdash; from Government Departments to the Houses of the Oireachtas, local authorities and State agencies under each Department &mdash; will be expected to adopt their own &ldquo;green housekeeping&rdquo; standards and guidelines within 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he would be speaking to local authorities tomorrow.  The previous section dealt with the obligation on shops and supermarkets to provide containers for waste; this section covers guidelines for local authorities.  I live on the outskirts of Ennis where there is a recurring problem with rubbish from chip shops and fast food outlets as a result of food purchased after discos end.  The contents of the containers are consumed by the time cars reach my house, which is about a <Col N="1658" /> mile from the town, and then the rubbish is thrown out of the car windows. For years my family, my staff and I have cleaned the roadside but we are getting tired of it.  I suggested to the local authority that there are numerous employment schemes under which someone could deal with this problem.  In the context of his meeting tomorrow, could the Minister use this section to deal with such matters and get local authorities to fulfil their obligations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the provisions of this Bill and the Minister's attempts to set up a structure for the disposal and management of waste and to ensure that the responsibilities of local authorities will be exercised in a manner which will reduce rather than increase the impact of waste on our environment.  For that reason I wish to address issues which have an immediate impact in my area, although they are not confined to it.  Section 30 (4) states:</P>
      <P>the Minister shall publish guidelines and criteria in relation to the prevention, minimisation and recovery of waste, to which public authorities shall have regard in the performance of their functions, and such guidelines and criteria may include provision for all or any of the following matters&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) consideration being given by public authorities for the likely effects on the environment of particular goods or services they propose to purchase or engage[.]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other subsections contain similar provisions.  In that context, I ask the Minister to ensure those guidelines are introduced, and that the requirements referred to are adhered to, as quickly as possible.  I make this request in the light of a major issue which has arisen in the Slieve Felims, a beautiful, remote mountain region on the Tipperary-Limerick border.  This is an unspoilt area and the local people have little by way of wealth other than their natural environment.  They have worked consistently hard to attract tourists with <Col N="1659" /> special interest in monastic establishments, walks and other attractions which a remote mountain region would have for people from other countries, and we should encourage them in doing so.  Despite this, Limerick County Council proposes to locate a major landfill site in the heart of the Slieve Felims. One reason the area is considered suitable for such facility is that it is remote and will not be immediately visible to many people.  It is those very attributes that make the location special.  The community there is concerned about the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but I want to draw the matter to the Minister's attention.  These provisions must be introduced urgently to ensure waste management by local authorities in Limerick will not be allowed cause waste pollution in a beautiful and remote area.  We must ensure that people living in disadvantaged mountain regions will not be penalised because those living in urban areas do not manage and regulate properly the disposal of their waste.  The Minister should introduce these regulations as quickly as possible.  I would like an assurance that he will use his powers under this Bill to guarantee that the beautiful and remote area of the Slieve Felims will not be polluted and spoiled.</P>

The average car travelling at average speed with the average family takes a mile and a half to consume the average take away.  I live a mile and a half away from the local take away and the rubbish arrives at my doorstep.  Thus, I can verify the accuracy of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears such materials are covered in the First Schedule &mdash;&ldquo;consumption products&rdquo; is the term used.  Is such littering <Col N="1660" /> a matter for the litter Acts or this legislation?  As Senator Howard said, this has become a serious problem in the countryside.

      <P>Waste can accumulate in cemeteries.  Indeed, one may sometimes find the remains of coffins and human bones lying around.  Skips are often provided in cemeteries but the contents can spill over onto graves. Work could be carried out in cemeteries in the past under community employment schemes but the last Government ended that.  The Minister mentioned that he would be meeting local authority representatives tomorrow.  Perhaps he will impress on them the need to have skips and bins in cemeteries emptied regularly.</P>

However, I am reminded of the World Cup in Italy in 1990 when the Irish fans were compared with the English fans who did not support good behaviour. After one of the matches as the Irish fans left the stand they picked up all the litter to show how good they were.</P>
      <P>Although the big stick is a valuable way of ensuring good behaviour, education, pride and enthusiasm is more valuable.  If we can engender these qualities the problems to which Senator Howard and Senator Dardis referred will be solved.  Let us ensure the Minister has powers but I hope he will work towards solving the litter problem with education towards pride and enthusiasm.</P>

This creates trouble for the local authorities who have to get people to clean up early in the morning.  Much money is spent on education, we boast about our young educated people, but they are the ones <Col N="1661" /> dropping the litter on the streets.  Who is supposed to clean it up?</P>
      <P>There is an old song which goes, &ldquo;everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die&rdquo;.  A similar logic applies to tipheads: we cannot have them in or near urban areas, or in remote areas because they spoil the scenery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Daly referred to the time frame of the management plan. I do not envisage the plans as being once-off.  They will not provide immutable criteria for all time.  The plans will evolve as we learn more.  They will become more efficient and new practices will become available.  The plans will be organic of their nature.  It will not be a question of having plans within particular time frames.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to have the &ldquo;green housekeeping&rdquo; guidelines available by the end of this year, assuming the Bill is enacted.  Semi-State agencies and local authorities will then be invited to engage in the process &mdash; the local authorities have already started with Agenda 21 &mdash; and encouraged to work towards certification.  There is European wide certification under EMAS which is now becoming available in Ireland.  It will not involve a once-off fixed time frame.</P>
      <P>Senator Howard and others referred to litter.  I will make litter a major issue during my time as Minister.  I have established an anti-litter unit in the Department.  I have had detailed discussions with a number of organisations, voluntary groups and local authorities in relation to this initiative.  The unit is being put in place and will cover the areas Senators mentioned.  We are looking at the issue of take aways, for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tackling litter will involve education and strong enforcement of the law. However, it is easier said than done.  We will not have litter wardens outside every premises in the country early in the morning, whether they are one and a half miles or more from a take away. Stronger litter legislation will be published <Col N="1662" /> before the summer.  I am determined that it will fit into a comprehensive strategy to deal with litter, which will include education.  Before Easter a new anti-litter pack and video will be distributed to every second level school, with a new pack to every primary school.  We will commence a multi media advertising campaign, which I have approved.  It will touch on the issues to which Senator Quinn referred such as national pride, which is a very effective mechanism.  I will be interested to hear the reaction of the House because it is intended to be hard hitting. Indeed, I expect that there will be reservations because of this.</P>
    <P>There will be provision in the legislation that may impact on the question raised by Senator Dardis.  Sections 28 and 29 deal with deposit and return.  We can deal with the containers from takeaways under this provision.  It will enable us to provide at least a financial disincentive to litter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the clean up of cemeteries etc., we must in the first instance ensure that people do not litter.  Second, we must ensure that there is a comprehensive strategy to deal with litter at local authority level so that there are provisions to dispose of litter safely by those visiting cemeteries or beaches.  It is an issue I will raise with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator O'Kennedy's point, it is almost a truism that there is no great welcome for a landfill site anywhere, no more than there is for incineration. However, there is an irreducible volume of waste that must be dealt with safely and the purpose of this legislation is to deal with it environmentally safely and sensitively.  There will be a cost involved in this, but it will be done safely and there will be no question of despoiling the environment.  It will be licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency independently of any local authority and monitored by it to ensure that the high standards set in the legislation are adhered to.</P>

      <P>I advised the Minister that Kerry County Council had refused to collect refuse from the port of Dingle. There is no onus on Kerry County Council to collect the refuse.  The MARPOL Convention provides that refuse from yachts must be collected by the port authority under the supervision of the Department of Agriculture, taken to a place other than a public dump, buried at a certain depth and sprayed.</P>

      <P>The Minister advised that the response to the placing of a landfill site in a specific location would be replicated in other areas. Apart from regulating the environmental impact or reducing the pollution impact, will he indicate that he is also free to decide that there will not be any environmental impact in terms of waste disposal?  Will he confirm that it is within his remit to refuse to sanction the location of landfill sites?</P>

      <P>The authority to licence is a matter for the agency.  The idea of setting up a specialist environmental agency is that, using best environmental practise and best international standards, it would make a determination.  It will not be for the Minister to do this but the agency.  Any proposals for a siting of a landfill from a local authority or a private operator would have to meet these high criteria.  The agency would be the ultimate authority to decide to license or not.  Planning is a separate issue.</P>

      <P>I can see difficulty here in times of emergency.  Three years ago there was a fire in a meat factory in County Roscommon.  The county manager was very exposed on that occasion and Roscommon County Council has been exposed ever since.  The council is at a loss of £150,000 as a result of the negligence of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  At the time the county manager, with the backing of the majority of the council, had to take emergency action.  However, he received very little support elsewhere and was subjected to much trouble and criticism.  The council is at a loss of £150,000 on account of the action he was obliged to take in the interest of public health.  Afterwards, many tried to insinuate and to prove that the action he took was a danger to public health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> Unless there is financial provision, legislation such as this cannot operate. Roscommon County Council finds it obnoxious that, while £150,000 is due to it from a Department, the same Department must now pay a fine of between £16 million and £20 million to the EU Commission because of its negligence.</P>

      <P>The amendment states: &ldquo;. . .not hold, recover or dispose of waste in a manner which causes, or is likely to cause, environmental pollution&rdquo;. Everybody supports this principle and the Minister advises there is no need for the amendment because it is catered for in the Bill.  However, recently a county manager recently left himself open on two counts in adhering to this provision.  In the first instance, he was challenged in the courts and was found to have acted wrongly because he had to act independently.  Second, the council was left at a financial loss.  This type of situation could prohibit and stall a county manager from taking the necessary action.  I ask the Minister to address that point.  In the future, public officials, whether county managers or not, will be conscious of the possibility of litigation and how they spend public funds.  A county manager sometimes has to leave these considerations aside in times of emergency, but when they are in that situation, they should not be left to carry the can.</P>

It is <Col N="1666" /> not, and never will be, envisaged in this legislation that any circumstances would arise which would exempt people from disposing of waste in an environmentally friendly way.  I am not prepared to accept an argument that a situation can arise that will allow people to pollute.</P>
      <P>I understood from the case instanced that the best environmental solution available was used by the local authority concerned.  I am unaware of any environmental problems that have arisen subsequent to that disposal.  It is a matter of principle that the blanket requirement that everybody who is disposing of waste would do so in an environmentally safe way is immutable. That is the intention of the legislation.</P>

      <P>Can we get a commitment from the Minister that, in the event of a local authority having to take specific measures, it will not be at a loss?  Every few months this matter is raised at Roscommon County Council, where we have a major overdraft.  The Department of the Environment is not responding to our council regarding a claim for money spent.  We have to ask the Department of the Environment for money and the council ask why I do not raise the case here and today I am discussing legislation that will allow the situation to continue without a commitment. In his reply, the Minister did not give the commitment I asked for &mdash; where managers take appropriate action they will be reimbursed.  In that case the manager proved he took a proper <Col N="1667" /> decision by ensuring environmental damage was not done and the public were protected from disease or whatever. As a gesture, the Minister should look at the file of Roscommon County Council and pay the £150,000 due to it. Then when we are promoting this legislation to our councils we will say there is goodwill in the Department of Environment where managers take effective action to protect the public and the environment.</P>

      <P>It is very important to me that people understand the principles behind this Bill, because they are new to be enacted in legislation.  The polluter pays and the generator of waste or environmental damage must be the one called to book. On a general principle, the view that people can walk away from causing environmental damage and that the local authority or the Government will shell out to meet the costs involved is a bad signal to give, and it is one I am not prepared to give.</P>

      <P>I agree fully but it was another Department which was responsible. What has happened is that a county council has fallen between two Departments.  I agree the polluter should pay but unfortunately the responsibility for the pollution on this <Col N="1668" /> occasion falls back on the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I understand that because they did not have insurance, Roscommon County Council cannot claim what is owed to them.  It should get the money from somewhere; it should not be left carrying the can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister's view on the holding, collection and movement of waste as it affects local authorities.  At present, there is conflict between industry and the environment, in so far as industry creates, holds and disposes of waste.  Local authorities come under pressure to give planning permission for an industrial project but when the waste is to be disposed, they have to grant a licence or a permit.  While local authorities will give permission for a specific industrial or processing project, they are not prepared to give a licence or a permit for the waste to be put in one of their dumps.  In some cases people are getting licences from a different authority because the county manager there may adopt an easier approach.  Where a local authority gives permission for a manufacturing project, the disposal of the waste should be part and parcel of the industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An instance with which the Minister would be familiar is that of a meat processing plant &mdash; he has many in his county, as we have in Roscommon. They provide wonderful employment but we also have to deal with a certain amount of waste products.  One of these is belly grass, which is not a pollutant to any great extent, but only one or two local authorities will accept belly grass in their civic dumps.  Where do the local authorities think it is going to go?  Why are they allowing meat processing projects <Col N="1669" /> to go ahead if they are not taking the disposal of belly grass into account?</P>
    <P>Local authorities should have a clear understanding that if they are involved in planning permission, they should also be aware of the necessity of issuing a permit or licence to deal with waste from the particular project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of this Bill is that the polluter will pay.  Those who generate waste must be responsible for its safe disposal.  It is not a matter of offloading that responsibility onto a local authority or anybody else; I have no intention of requiring local authorities to take on that job.  The principle that the polluter pays is a basic one.</P>
      <P>Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, many industrial activities are now licensable under the integrated pollution and control licensing system.  I signed new orders yesterday further extending the IPC licensing regime and many of the activities mentioned are now included.  It is now up to the operators of the plant to come up with a scheme that will satisfy the Environmental Protection Agency and the licensing regime that they can dispose safely of any waste that arises in the manufacturing process &mdash; without damage to earth, soil or water.  This is covered specifically in amendments Nos. 9 and 10 which have yet to be dealt with.  The planning authority must look at the planning issues.  The Environmental Protection Agency must look at the environmental issues and the creator of waste must devise a strategy to deal with his own waste in an environmentally safe way.</P>

      <P>Section 32 (6) (b) states that it will be a good defence for a licence holder, if a holder of refuse for which he has a permit is creating pollution, to say that he has a permit.  The fact that he holds a permit means that he is not liable for conviction.  Skips and bottle holders with refuse piled up against the sides, because there is insufficient capacity or because they are not properly operated, are a familiar sight. <Col N="1670" /> This provision gives a very effective way out to such polluters.  They can go to court and say they have a permit for those containers and they will not be convicted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of this subsection is to avoid duplicating existing legislation.  The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, sets out a licensing regime for waste holding activities. A permit holder causing pollution is in violation of their waste permit under the 1992 legislation.  No circumstances could arise where somebody is causing pollution and could use the fact that they have a permit as a defence.  They must comply with the permit issued under the 1992 Act.  Rather than duplicate that provision, holders of such permits will not be liable under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The section says that it shall be a good defence for the polluter to say that he or she holds a permit, even though he or she has created pollution, so the person will not be convicted. I cannot follow that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain it again. The polluter will not be convicted under this section because, within its terms, the holding of a permit is a defence. However, if they are causing pollution they are committing an offence under the 1992 legislation.  They are in breach of the permit they already have and will be prosecuted under that provision.  In this way we avoid having two legislative provisions to cover the same issue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 45, subsection (1) (a), line 4, after &ldquo;waste&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and if practicable, <Col N="1671" /> and if it can do so at a reasonable cost, industrial waste.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I move this amendment on behalf of Senator Henry.  I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to these amendments which do not seek to add any further responsibility or requirement on a local authority but to serve solely as a reminder.  While the local authority is obliged under the legislation to ensure that it arranges for the collection of household waste, the purpose of this amendment is to remind it of its responsibilities, which are not legal responsibilities, in regard to industrial waste.</P>
    <P>I understand the principle that the polluter pays.  I understand the aim of the legislation and I understand the big stick approach, but what is proposed here would serve as a very useful reminder to local authorities that it is not sufficient to disregard businesses and jobs and the creation of employment on the basis that they may ignore something for which there is not a statutory obligation.  Since the amendment suggests merely a reminder, the Minister might be able to consider accepting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more than a reminder, it is a requirement on local authorities to accept industrial waste in certain circumstances.  It has never been the case that local authorities were under such a legal requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have refined our thinking in exactly the way that the Senator has indicated.  We must confer ownership of waste on its producer.  Producer responsibility and the polluter pays are the underlying principles of this legislation and the notion that this can be offloaded by giving a statutory responsibility to somebody else is contrary to that.  Consequently, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  It is estimated that 7.12 million tonnes of industrial waste are created every year.  That figure includes 1.9 million tonnes of mining and quarrying waste and 2.5 million <Col N="1672" /> tonnes of construction and demolition waste.</P>
    <P>It is right that the regime we have in place requires the generator of such waste to make proper provision for its safe disposal.  The waste producer requires licensing if he is engaged in activities covered under the IPC system, he requires the agreement of a commercial or a local authority to dispose of his waste at the appropriate price, but it would not be right for me to impose a responsibility on local authorities, some of which might not be able to deal with industrial waste, to take that on as a new responsibility.</P>

When we discussed the preparation of the waste management and hazardous waste plans it was my view and that of a number of <Col N="1681" /> Members that it was necessary to put a mechanism in place whereby oral hearings, similar to those the Minister has set out for licences, could be held. Sections 40 to 50 deal with licences but there is a question about how the issue of oral hearings will be dealt with.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on what he is proposing.

      <P>I seek as much information as possible from the Minister. Can he clarify subsection 2 (a) (i) which refers to &ldquo;sludge from a facility operated by a local authority for the treatment of water or waste water&rdquo;.  The section provides: &ldquo;The provisions of this section shall apply notwithstanding the provisions of any bye-law made under section section 21 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act, 1990&rdquo;.  Subsection (2) also refers to:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1683" /> (ii)  blood of animal or poultry origin,</P>
    <P>(iii)  faecal matter of animal or poultry origin in the form of manure or slurry, or</P>
    <P>(iv)  such natural agricultural waste as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>We have long awaited EU regulations governing landfill sites and the organisation and control of such sites.  We are also awaiting BATNEEC guidelines from the Environmental Protection Agency on the control of pig slurry.  I am disappointed that the Environmental Protection Agency does not have guidelines on the control of landfill sites.  However, I am seeking clarification on what the section refers to and why a waste licence is not required for the activities I have quoted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This section exempts the recovery by the agency of specified natural agricultural wastes, sewage and water treatment sludges from licensing under Part 5 of the Bill and provides for alternative regulatory controls on those activities.</P>
      <P>The disposal of agricultural waste is subject to the provisions of section 39, in the same manner as any other type of waste.  The spreading of natural agricultural waste and sludges for soil enrichment purposes is a long established and widespread practice which, when carried out under proper conditions, can be beneficial.  It would not be practicable or appropriate to require that such waste recovery activities should be subject to licence.  The section instead makes provision for alternate regulatory control of the recovery of the waste specified to be exercised by local authorities. It is up to each local authority to set its own standards for the monitoring and overview of the land spreading of agricultural wastes, which is the usual means of disposal of such wastes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought long and hard about this proposal because I would not like to exempt any potential pollution. <Col N="1684" /> However, it would be overly onerous to require every landowner who wants to spread manure or sludge to have a licence to be processed by the agency. The controls I have envisaged and outlined are more practicable and will be equally effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned sludge and other forms of waste but did not refer to slurry, the spreading of which is lethal.  I stand corrected if there is an obligation to comply with regulations.  Who issues the licence?  If the local authority does so, what power does it have to enforce any conditions in the licence?  Local authorities have major problems with regard to manpower. Having raised the matter locally, I was advised by people from other counties that they also have major problems in this regard.  What regulation exists to enforce compliance with the conditions attached to any grant of permission to ensure that slurry is spread at the right time and in the right place?</P>

      <P>To follow on from Senator Sherlock's point, is the Department involved in any investigations, research or consultations with other EU countries using technology which may be helpful in spreading slurry?  In Finland a peat component is used.  It acts as a binding agent and has a desirable effect with regard to smell.  Most objections in this country refer to these two issues, particularly in areas where there are small water courses and what people consider to be marginal land which is not suitable for spreading slurry.  If there is advanced technology in this area which other EU countries have developed, we should avail of it and use it here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of issues have arisen with regard to the disposal of agricultural wastes and sewage sludge.  I indicated that it would be overly onerous to require the detailed licensing provisions of this Bill with regard to waste to apply to each landowner.  It is better to deal with this on a county basis by requiring local authorities to monitor licences and regulate such spreading.  It would be open to local authorities to take action against those who do not comply with such licensing.</P>
      <P>Spreading is controlled because the most serious pollution could affect water courses.  Under the water pollution Acts there is a clear responsibility on any controller, owner or possessor of such waste to prohibit it from entering water courses.  A person who causes or permits any polluting matter to enter water without a licence is subject to court proceedings and may be liable not only to a fine but be required to remediate any damage caused under sections 10 and 11 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act.</P>
      <P>The 1991 EC regulations on the use of sludge in agriculture specify detailed requirements with regard to the spreading of sewage sludge on agricultural land.  We are phasing out the dumping of sludge at sea, as required by EU law. It must be phased out entirely by 1999 and we will certainly meet the criterion for this.  The biggest issue which will arise at that stage will be the treatment of Dublin sludge.</P>
      <P>We are discussing how to find best practice not only domestically but with our EU colleagues.  If good practices are used elsewhere in Europe we want to hear about them and use them.  With regard to slurry treatment, we should not be shy about our advances in research.  The agricultural institute, which preceded Teagasc, in its headquarters in Johnstown Castle, carried out extensive internationally recognised research on slurry management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of peat might have potential. We are looking at alternatives in sewage treatment and have piloted a number of reed bed tertiary treatment plants in <Col N="1686" /> order to use natural mechanisms for the absorption of toxic materials and this might have application to slurry and other potentially hazardous wastes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is waste arising from mining covered under this section?  The Minister will be aware that in a number of areas there has been public criticism of mining operations where substantial deposits were left in a haphazard way. Little could be done at local authority level to deal with this and the responsibility to do so was not clearly defined. Will the Minister clarify the situation with regard to mining deposits?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Once this measure is enacted, all mining activities will have to be licensed.

Any residual activities which are not licensable under that Act come under the scope of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator Daly's point, mining was included in the 1992 Act.  The extraction of peat is of great concern throughout the country but during the debate on the 1992 Act discussion of it was excluded.  The Minister and the House will be aware of the concerns raised about the large deposits of peat on the beds of big rivers, particularly in the catchment areas of the Shannon and its tributaries.  Peat is now considered to be a contributory factor to the serious flooding we have experienced. Some 50,000 acres of bog are being drained into these catchment areas.  To the best of our knowledge, the system of blocking silt from entering the river is not effective or foolproof.  It is contributing to the damage to rivers and it may have the long term effect of causing flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While none us wants to interfere with a large commercial State body which provides employment and development, we have a responsibility for the extraction of peat which causes pollution in our rivers, particularly the Shannon. Controls should be introduced.  Does <Col N="1687" /> this Bill include controls for the extraction of peat?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is not designed as an anti-pollution measure. A body of law exists to protect air and water.  If peat is polluting water, that is covered under the existing Water Pollution Acts and not under this Bill which deals with solid waste management.</P>
      <P>As regards mining, there are provisions in this Bill which will strengthen the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, to ensure that a developer will have sufficient bonding and financial backing to cover any source of pollution or subsequent pollution which might arise.  This means that local authorities will not be left high and dry by a company which causes pollution and then goes out of business.  This further strengthens the framework already in place.</P>

      <P>One of the core principles of the Bill is to establish an agency of environmental excellence which is competent to evaluate the <Col N="1688" /> environmental impact of any activity. An Bord Pleanála is not in a position to make such a determination but it had to consider many complicated environmental issues without that expertise. This is the next generation of proper environmental evaluation.  Environmental considerations are proper to the new expert agency which will be designed, equipped and staffed with the expertise, training and equipment to evaluate and make a determination in relation to environmental matters so that An Bord Pleanála will only consider matters of good planning which fall within its competence and expertise.

      <P>The Minister is aware of a particular case where a local authority is excluded from discussing matters under section 98 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  The case to which I refer is Syntex's application for an incinerator.  Under section 98 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, Clare County Council is excluded from any discussion on the environmental risk from incineration.  Members of the council believe they should have an opportunity to express an opinion.  I am not here to discuss incineration but the application for a licence is with the Environmental Protection Agency.  The county council has given planning permission for it.  However, because of section 98 of the 1992 Act the council is excluded from considering the environmental risks involved.  The local authority and its elected representatives are being denied the opportunity to express their views.  I am sure other Members are familiar with the issue.  Requests have been made seeking an amendment to the 1992 Act.  We are reluctant to accept something without being satisfied it is necessary.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify this point because the local authority and the public are confused.</P>

      <P>There is a degree of confusion because these provisions are new. We have now set up an expert agency to consider all matters which we considered heretofore.  That is the correct approach for the future because I do not believe An Bord Pleanála has the competence, from an environmental perspective, to deal with the variety of potential applications before it unless it and the Environmental Protection Agency merge.  It is better to segregate these things as the applications become more complicated and our understanding of pollution becomes more refined. It is not designed to weaken the planning process but to strengthen it so that there are parallel evaluations of planning and environmental aspects.  Planning permission is useless without an Environmental Protection Agency licence and an Environmental Protection Agency licence is useless without planning permission.  Both processes would need to be gone through before any activity would be set up.  If people are confused about it, it is because it is a new system.  I believe it will be seen to be a much more strengthened and effective system once it is fully operational and understood.</P>

      <P>If we want to set up an independent agency, we cannot put controls over it.  If we do not have confidence in an independent agency to carry out its statutory function to determine best environmental practice, then we will have to look at it again.  However, I would be loathe to allow my Department or local authorities to put controls over it.  The idea of setting up an independent agency, An Bord Pleanála, was to divorce planning from the control of a Minister.  The model of An Bord Pleanála was replicated in the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Difficulties might arise from time to time, but creating a control mechanism would interfere with the independence of the Environmental Protection Agency and would cause more problems than it would solve.</P>

      <P>A difficulty could arise where the Environmental Protection Agency would grant a licence to undertake a certain operation but the local authority may refuse planning permission for it.  That could create problems unless some procedure is in place to allow a local authority to make a decision on the planning aspect before the licence issue is decided.  Councillors, especially members of Clare County Council, raised publicly the fact that they have been denied involvement in the licence issue, although they are involved in planning.  They do not have the opportunity to express a view on such serious matters.</P>

      <P>This is the crunch of the issue.  I was faced with this situation in relation to the incinerator in Ringsend. Fortunately, the planning authority refused permission and An Bord Pleanála upheld the decision of Dublin Corporation. There was considerable anxiety in the community that An Bord Pleanála would not uphold the decision of Dublin Corporation, that the licence would be granted by the Environmental Protection Agency, that there could not be an appeal, except through the oral hearing, and that the Environmental <Col N="1691" /> Protection Agency would be judge and jury in its own case.  The public is concerned about this issue to which Senator Daly referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a parallel process strengthens rather than weakens the planning law.  When all these matters fell to be considered in the first instance under the normal planning Act, the local authority made a determination and whether it was appealable.  The decision of An Bord Pleanála in that case was final.  We now have two parallel processes &mdash; the planning process and a parallel environmental analysis under the Environmental Protection Agency.  For the cases cited to be built &mdash; I do not want to go into them &mdash; we need both because the planning application is no good if the Environmental Protection Agency refuses to license the activity.  Similarly, the licence for the activity is no good without planning permission.  Rather than being concerned about it, the parallel process, which is now the law, strengthens the evaluation of any project and its merits and demerits.</P>
      <P>The planning aspect is well established as planning laws date back to the early 1960s.  They are determined by local authorities and are appealable to An Bord Pleanála, while the parallel environmental analysis is applied through the Environmental Protection Agency system.  Both must be granted before a development of the type indicated by Senators could be built and put into operation.  I have no fears in that regard.</P>

Section 55 gives a local authority power in its functional area to serve a notice on any person who holds, recovers or disposes of waste to prevent or limit environmental pollution arising from that waste activity.  If people set themselves up as the holder, carrier or storer of waste, they would be subject to the determination by the local authority that they must take specific steps to ensure that no environmental pollution might arise from it.

      <P>I would avoid a situation where companies could go into liquidation to avoid their responsibilities.  It might be desirable to have a provision to deal with that &mdash; for example, the power to sue directors of companies.  A wealthy company with a small operation or a subsidiary company may go into liquidation after causing damage worth £50,000 to £100,000 and within six months set up in business under a new name, as happened in many instances. Perhaps the Minister might consider this before Report Stage.  Where there is an obvious attempt to evade financial responsibilities, there should be a provision to sue directors of companies which have perhaps deliberately been put into liquidation.</P>

Obviously, we will follow the polluter as far as possible, but there may be circumstances in which the local <Col N="1694" /> authority will have to foot the bill. However, as far as practicable, the polluter should be followed through.  As regards the responsibilities of individuals who are members of companies, section 9 states:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to an earlier query.  It brings home the situation to which Senator Daly and I referred, that where a local authority is obliged to take action to prevent pollution, this section allows them to recover the costs.</P>
      <P>It has been stated that somebody might have gone into liquidation and would not be in a position to meet the costs or that they might go into liquidation to avoid being liable for the costs.  If such a body was a Government Department which through its negligence did not have proper insurance to cover what was involved, where would that leave the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach, as a member of the same county council of which I am a member, is well aware of the circumstances <Col N="1695" /> of Roscommon County Council.  That county council carried out its duty in eliminating the possibility of pollution but found out later that the Department for which it carried out 75 per cent of the work &mdash; 75 per cent of the produce belonged to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the other 25 per cent belonged to the private company which had rented the store and gone into liquidation &mdash; had no insurance to cover Roscommon County Council.  In those circumstances, where does the local authority stand?</P>
    <P>The local authority should not have to carry the can.  At present the local authority must take the decision and must take the action to prevent the pollution but it still carries the can.  Roscommon County Council is still carrying the can for that action.  Under this Bill, which supposedly improves the provisions of the law, I do not see that a local authority will be protected.  I fail to understand why the same Department, which is now liable to pay &mdash; and will pay &mdash; approximately £16 million to the European Commission, has left Roscommon County Council with a bill between £150,000 and £200,000.</P>
    <P>There is not enough protection for local authorities in this Bill.  There is provision for responsibility, but it does not seem that there is ultimate protection. Perhaps the Minister should give some kind of a guarantee to local authorities in this situation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not adequate.  As I said in relation to an earlier section, county managers may not take action as quickly as they should because of the worries of being left with a big bill and being uptight about litigation.  Local authorities will still be left exposed to costs in certain circumstances as happened in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not, but I will deal with the point the Senator makes.  I have explained in some detail the principle of &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo;.  Whoever causes the pollution should be followed up and acted against.  Individuals, companies, Government Departments, State agencies or local authorities &mdash; and local authorities are not always as pure as the driven snow in relation to causing pollution &mdash; are all amenable to the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is not normal for Government Departments to take out insurance as they are covered, by and large, by State indemnity.  The idea of insurance is to protect the individual who is acted against.  If a person is guilty of an offence or has caused pollution, people will take action against that person.  The idea of insurance is that a person can draw down his or her insurance to cover costs but the person is liable to the costs regardless of whether he or she has insurance.  There might be individuals who do not have the wherewithal at the end of the day but they are liable personally if it can be proved that they are the cause of pollution.</P>
      <P>This is a considerable strengthening of the law.  It is clear in laying down its responsibilities.  As I said, everybody will have responsibility laid upon them, whether they are an individual, a corporation, a State agency, Government Department or local authority, where they can be proven to have been the cause of pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The law is strong on the issue of &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; but that is not my point.  My point relates to a situation where a local authority takes action which costs money to prevent pollution.  Certainly, I see that the polluter can be followed and must pay but I do not see that the Bill is strong where preventative action is taken by a local authority to prevent mass pollution.  If the county manager had not taken action in that case to bury thousands of tonnes of meat, one can imagine what would have happened in County Roscommon. The same can apply again.  In <Col N="1697" /> the event of a situation such as that which Senator Daly mentioned, where the company involved has gone into liquidation, or in the circumstances which I mentioned, where there was no insurance, local authorities will still to some extent carry the can.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point about indemnity but my understanding is that the EU has decided that the Department should have had insurance in this case where neither it nor the company had insurance.  The Bill may have an adverse effect as county managers may decide not to take action because they feel they will be left with a large bill at the end of the day.  There should be some mechanism in the Bill to protect local authorities.</P>

      <P>I want to make a final point on this matter because I have said it 15 times in response to the same question. I invite the Senator to read section 56 (2).  Local authorities should take action against the polluter &mdash; that is my advice.  There is no point in me saying this repeatedly if Senator Finneran says that local authorities will be left high and dry.  Section 56 (2) states:</P>
      <P>Where a local authority takes steps, carries out operations, recovers or disposes of, or arranges for the recovery or disposal of, waste or gives assistance under this section, the local authority may recover the costs of such steps, operations, recovery, disposal or assistance as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction from such person as the local authority satisfies the court is a person whose act or omission necessitated such steps, operations, recovery, disposal or assistance.</P>
      <P>If somebody has caused pollution, the local authority can take action against them to recover the cost of dealing with it.  Could it be plainer?  If it is not plain enough, can the Senator suggest an amendment which would make it plainer?</P>

      <P>The Minister has the power to make a number of regulations under this section.  On a number of occasions we criticised the fact that there is provision for making regulations that are more complex and involved than the legislation itself.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The section empowers the Minister to make regulations in relation to any process, development or operation and to require relevant persons to determine and provide to the agency or specified public authority or to publish details of releases of specified substances to the environment and the details of mass balance relationships within the process.  A mass balance of a specified substance is an expression of the relationship between emissions of that substance from a specified process and its use or consumption in that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1700" /> The idea behind these regulations is to require a detailed toxic release inventory so there would be public awareness of the substances released by any company, agency or corporation.  Its details have to be worked out subsequent to the enactment of this provision. However, making information on the operation of any plant open to public scrutiny is part of open transparency in operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">

      <P>When information is sought, some companies refuse to give it and claim commercial sensitivities etc. While they are entitled to protect their products, in some circumstances companies use the umbrella of commercial sensitivity to keep from the public domain information that rightfully belongs to them.  This may apply to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Can the Minister, under this section, elicit for the public what chemcial components go into our air, water or soil? We are at a loss in this area.  I took great interest in the water and air pollution legislation we introduced.  It provides vital information, as does this legislation. I might be in conflict with the Minister on some matters, but this is important and progressive legislation.</P>
      <P>However, I am not satisfied that the Irish public is getting the information it requires.  There is great concern and fear that chemical components, of which they are unaware, are getting into our air and water etc.  A recent television programme referred to problems with livestock in a certain part of the country. We had an odour problem in my area. While the smell there was not unpleasant, nobody knew the damage it was doing.  When a number of chemical and pharmaceutical companies are in the same location, emissions from different factories can also have an effect.  The Minister should ensure under this legislation that regulations are introduced that will allow the public to know what is happening, particularly in our chemical industries.</P>

      <P>I largely agree with the Senator.  It is vital that the public has access to information about what exactly is being released by any company or any other activity in their locale. It is the intention of this section to require them to keep a register of all such emissions, monitor them in a way that is specified by the regulations and pass it on to the appropriate agency where it would be open to inspection by the general public.</P>
      <P>I also intend to have a national emissions release register so we could have a national database that would ultimately link into a European counterpart.  We would know exactly what is being released into all soils, water courses and the air.  Most progressive companies have adopted EMAS, the environmental management and audit system, and have incorporated an environmental standard of production into all their activities.  Of course, part of the EMAS process is to have such a register, monitoring and public access.  It is a positive and progressive step in giving public access to information to which they are entitled.</P>

Everything produced will be a matter of record and inspection.</P>
      <P>Often public fears can be engendered without reason.  The more progressive and developed industries tell me they will comply with the most rigid standards &mdash; we have some of the most rigid in the world &mdash; and any evaluation or independent analysis of their operations. However, when their mechanisms are validated, they expect that they will not be subject to arbitrary attack by people with no relevant knowledge who are involved in scaremongering.  This issue involves a double-edged sword. Operators will be required to have the highest environmental standards in the world, there will be an agency to monitor the situation and the information will be made public.

      <P>I already referred to this important amendment.  The amendment proposes to insert a new subsection (3A) into section 83 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, to provide that section 53 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, shall apply in relation to the grant or review of a licence or revised licence under Part VI of the Environmental Protection Agency Act.  This will allow the agency to satisfy itself with regard to the ability of an applicant or licence holder to meet the financial commitments and other possible liabilities arising from compliance with the requirements of a licence.  The agency will also be permitted to require that appropriate financial provision be made for this purpose. Such financial provision may include a bonding arrangement or some other form of financial security.</P>
      <P>At present there is no provision in the Environmental Protection Agency Act similar to that contained in section 53 of this Bill.  It is considered prudent that the powers available to the agency under section 53 of the Bill should also be available to it in relation to its licensing functions under the existing Act.  In an earlier reply I indicated that it will be a considerable strengthening of environmental protections to ensure that financial provisions are available to deal with the requirements of any licence.</P>

      <P>This is a very important amendment which inserts a new section into the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act, 1990, empowering local authorities to require farmers to prepare nutrient management plans in respect of their farms.</P>
      <P>During the debate on this Bill in the Dáil, there was considerable discussion about the potential of agricultural waste and certain farming practices to cause water pollution.  This has arisen again today.  There was a recognition by Deputies in the Lower House that the Bill, in addition to the controls to be applied to waste in general, contained a number of provisions focusing principally on agricultural wastes.  Deputies welcomed these provisions but concerns remained that the threat posed to the environment by some agricultural activities should be countered more effectively.  In responding to that debate I undertook to introduce an amendment to the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act, 1990, when the Bill came before the Seanad, for the purpose of dealing with the excessive enrichment of waters caused by nutrients contained in farm wastes and chemical fertilisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The watercourses of Ireland are quite clean and pure when compared to those of other European countries.  However, farm run-off is a significant source of pollution and causes eutrofication. Unfortunately this area of the environment is deteriorating rather than improving due to the increasing amounts of nutrients from farmlands which are running into watercourses, denuding them of oxygen levels and causing pollution.  It is important to address this issue.  I am taking the opportunity, through this legislation, to <Col N="1712" /> introduce an amendment to the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act, 1990, which will place a new responsibility on farmers if local authorities prepare a nutrient management plan in respect of their farms.  I believe the amendment will be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 66, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>This section represents an addition to the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act, 1990.  The Minister stated that manure and fertilisers would be considered pollutants but there are certain agricultural wastes which are not pollutants. However, I am aware that effluent from silage is a terrible pollutant and can lead to fish kills, etc.  In dealing with this matter in the past we discussed old legislation and abatement law and local authorities dealt with it under section 12 of the 1990 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to ascertain that the Minister is not about to enter into a witch-hunt against farmers.  By their nature farm developments involve a certain amount of waste.  While some people might object to such waste, it might not necessarily be a pollutant.  For example, a farmer might spread ten tonnes of manure on a stretch of marginal land and be faced with a downpour of rain similar to the one last spring which lasted six weeks.  One farmer I know had 60 acres of land which was under water for four months and it is possible that he spread ten tonnes of chemical manure before the flood.  What is the situation in relation to such an individual? I do not believe the Minister intends that, due to an act of God, the man would be liable for fines under this section of the Bill.  I seek reassurance for the farming public in this regard but I do not condone any contribution to pollution.  We must allow farmers to operate without the threat of being brought to court.  Members know that <Col N="1713" /> large tracts of our country are subject to frequent flooding, which can disrupt the farming process and cause matter to go into watercourses.</P>

Who will be in charge of them? <Col N="1714" /> Will the local authority have to ensure they are drawn up?  Huge expense is being put on this industry even though many farmers are already spending substantial funds, accompanied by grants under different schemes, to ensure that what the Minister fears will not happen.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the outset, this is an important amendment and I will put it in context for the House.  The scale of the waste load generated by farming is immense.  When assessed on the basis of biochemical oxygen demand, the volume of farm wastes is approximately ten times the combined volumes of waste from industry and domestic sewage.  A similar ratio obtains when the phosphorous contents of these wastes is assessed, phosphorous being the nutrient primarily responsible for the excessive fertilisation or nutrification of a significant portion of Irish waterways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen once-off fish kills from farm waste in recent summers but what is probably of even greater significance is the general impact farm waste has on our water systems.  The last national review of water quality, concerning the period 1987 to 1990, found that nutrification or slight or moderate pollution affected 21.5 per cent of surveyed river channel length.  Unfortunately, there has been an upward trend in the proportion of river channels so affected since the early 1970s and I am concerned that the national overview for the four years up to 1994, which will be published shortly by the Environmental Protection Agency, may show further <Col N="1715" /> evidence of a continuation of this unwelcome and disturbing trend.</P>
    <P>We will take action because we cannot ignore this source of pollution while dealing with everything else.  We could spend millions on treatment of sewage and have all our work undone if we do not address farm waste run-off.  I am aware of the immense investment farmers in my county have put into controlling waste in recent years, which has been matched by considerable national and EU funding.  Notwithstanding that, the facts are there and the problem of run-off has been increasing rather than diminishing.</P>
    <P>The amendment will enable local authorities to serve notices requiring farm nutrient management plans to be prepared and submitted to the local authority for approval.  Farmers will be obliged to keep records of wastes generated, imported or exported from their farms, the rates and times of applications to land, as well as details of chemical fertilisers used, to verify compliance with the plan submitted and approved.  The farmers will draw up the plans and provision is also being made for them to apply to local authorities for approval for variation of the plans during their period of operation to cater for unforeseen circumstances or changes in farming practice, etc.  These powers mean that local authorities, when considering the function of a farm, would be able to take measures to prevent, eliminate or minimise pollution from nutrients.</P>
    <P>Shortly after I became Minister for the Environment I launched a Teagasc scheme to ask farmers to test their soils. A huge amount of money is wasted by farmers who over-nutrify their land when there is no need for it, so proper testing and evaluation and better use of fertilisers would be in the interest not only of the environment but of farmers, as it would save them money.  Teagasc has been trying to communicate this message for a long time and this is an additional implement to bring us along this desirable path.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his reply but it would be remiss not to raise some points.  A farmer may or may not be involved in the REPS scheme, applications for which are running at 350 per week. Regardless of that, does this section mean the Department of the Environment wants him to run his own environmental protection scheme and control the amount of chemicals and fertiliser used on his land?  When the farmer produces his plan, will the local authority inform him he can use only a certain amount of a particular product on the basis of the information supplied? Does the section mean that milk producers and other members of the agricultural community will be subject to a type of REPS scheme, with those who have applied for the scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>This section will have far reaching effects on the farming community. The farm organisations will challenge us on this matter because they will feel we have added a burden on farmers to produce a plan and keep records.  They will see it as more red tape.</P>
      <P>I do not want a witch-hunt on farmers. If farmers are to have nutrient management plans what will be the position of Coillte, a State body which engages in large scale afforestation?  Forestry development has caused and is causing a change in the pH of waterways.  Will this legislation cover Coillte and the many other forestry development companies which have been set up over the past few years to avail of generous EU grants?  In many cases their activity has been to the detriment of the farming community who cannot compete with them when leasing or buying land.  Will nutrient management and waterway plans apply to Coillte and other forestry development companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> Bord na Móna is interfering with watercourses.  I referred to the main channel of the Shannon, but before water reaches the Shannon it may have come many miles through many small streams and drains.  Bord na Móna is contributing to the change in the environment of the rivers.</P>
    <P>Farmers should not be singled out in this legislation.  It should cover all those who abuse the rivers by contributing to the change in the pH of the water.  Some farming land is suspect in that it may have a high water table and nutrients can get into the watercourse easily. However, we should have some assurance for the farming community who will lobby us in future.  We should be able to tell the farmers that we have included provisions to prevent the waterways being damaged through nutrification but that farmers will not have a further impediment put on them, the cost of which they may not be able to bear.  We do not want them to feel they have been singled out while Coillte, Bord na Móna and the many private forestry companies will not have to meet the criteria for management plans or comply with regulations under this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I disapprove of the notion of witch-hunting.  This is a modest provision in the context of the stringent powers given to local authorities to <Col N="1718" /> deal with other forms of pollution.  The local authorities will require some farmers to develop nutrient management plans.  It will be in their own interest to do so.  They will probably save money when they realise the value of waste as a nutrient in itself and when they manage their on-farm waste more effectively.</P>
      <P>I have indicated the scale of nutrification because of the run-off of fertilisers from farm land.  It is the most serious source of minor pollution of our watercourses and we are obliged to take action.  The farmer will devise his or her own plan and submit it to the local authority, which will not determine what a farmer can apply.  The farmer will monitor the plan with the help of the local authority.  It will be a co-operative venture with the objective of keeping the watercourses as clean as possible. Nobody wants that more than the farmers and those living in rural communities.</P>
      <P>Failure to comply with the terms of the plan will not be an offence.  It is the only element of the Bill where an offence is not involved.  The intention is to promote an informed approach by farmers.  Progressive farmers already realise the value of nutrients in farm waste.  Teagasc estimates the potential saving to farmers for the more effective use of fertilisers would be £25 million per year.  That is a significant factor. This provision would be a minor imposition on farmers if we can achieve an improvement in water quality.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran referred to Coillte and Bord na Móna.  This section deals with the nutrification of waterways and the over use of nutrients.  There is a separate issue of acidification which is a problem associated with forestry but it is not dealt with by this provision.  I have an open mind on the matter and I intend it would be State policy to minimise as far as possible any harmful effect on our environment from any activity.</P>

It is time we dealt with it on the basis of our State companies and other forestry companies.  I will consider the submission of an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22a:</P>
      <P>In page 86, lines 39 to 44, to delete subsection (1).</P>
      <P>Section 67 (1) provides that no action will be taken against an agency or an authority by any person for damage or loss when enforcing legislation.  On numerous occasions in the past, local authorities have been seriously negligent with regard to pollution matters. There are many instances where they have been rightly prosecuted, especially by fisheries boards, for breaches of pollution legislation.  This has led to a number of convictions.  In addition, there has been conflict between the boards and the local authorities over a number of years.  Fish on stretches of rivers have been wiped out because of serious dereliction of duty by local authorities.  In one river in west County Clare, the discharge of chemicals was allowed through a purification plant which wiped out the stock of salmon and brown trout.  It is only beginning to recover after approximately ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be loath to see damage arise through negligence, especially to trout and salmon.  If the negligence is on the part of the local authority, will it be possible to claim for compensation under this section?  Senator Finneran referred to the fear that there may be less stringent enforcement of regulations <Col N="1720" /> against, for example, the ESB if there are emissions from Moneypoint, the county councils if there are discharges from water purification plants or Bord na Móna if peat gets into the valuable salmon fisheries.  I see merit in having the section redrafted, if not deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 67 (1) provides for an essential level of protection for the agency and local authorities against unwarranted or inappropriate litigation. The proposed amendment is based on a misunderstanding of my intention.  The section does not protect the agency or any local authority from any claims made against them for any wrongdoing on their part.  It does not give immunity against normal legal action, such as suing for negligence and wrongdoing, all of which would remain open to be pursued in the courts by any individual.</P>
      <P>This section prevents all pollution from being attributable to a local authority or the agency where they could be joined in any action against any polluter. It could be alleged that, since the pollution occurred, they were negligent in not preventing it happening.  State companies, state agencies and local authorities may often be seen as softer targets than the polluters and may be subject to even more stringent financial burdens than the polluters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A broad range of functions is given to the agency under this legislation and existing statute law.  It would be unreasonable to assume that every envisaged protection we have put into the law would be carried out by the agency and that it would not slip up from time to time.  We cannot legislate to prevent all pollution and claim that nobody is ever going to break this law. It would not be right and fair that the agency, or the local authority, would be deemed responsible for an act of pollution simply by not enforcing the law through oversight.  It is a standard provision that unwarranted or inappropriate litigation should not be open, but where negligence or incompetence is <Col N="1721" /> proven, normal litigation would be possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not allayed my fears that the local authorities will not get off the hook by this provision.  If he tells me that they can be sued and that action can be taken against them for loss or damage where they create or allow pollution to occur I will withdraw the amendment.  While the Minister's intention may be as he has advised, it does not read this way in the Bill.</P>

When one explains to the parliamentary draftsman what one wishes to achieve and when one then sees this expressed in the language of the parliamentary draftsman it may not appear to meet requirements.  However, I am reliably assured that this provision will do what I say.  It will protect the agencies and local authorities from being cojoined in an action against them regarding any source of pollution but will not protect them from action where there is clear negligence on their behalf.</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;hazardous waste&rdquo; is referred to.  What is the position regarding toxic waste?  The Cork region accounts for 75 per cent of toxic waste and 20,000 tonnes of the waste which has to be exported derives from the Cork area.  This can be attributed to the pharmaceutical industry.  Much toxic waste is also being generated in other areas.  Do we know where it is being disposed of?</P>

The previous Government made a determination with regard to treatment of hazardous waste not to build a national waste incinerator.  Most hazardous waste is currently exported from Ireland.  Some of it is incinerated on site. Following the enactment of this legislation there will be a requirement to have a hazardous waste management plan.</P>

      <P>I very seldom see a provision in a Bill transferring powers from any agency or Department to local authorities.  This is a very welcome development.  I have always promoted and supported the local authority system and I welcome any move in that direction.  I presume there is a good reason for it and, like Senator Daly, I would like to know what it is.  In the 1992 Environmental Protection Agency legislation we dealt with some matters that are now being taken back following the intervention of the Minister and there are obviously good reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the areas dealt with in the Environmental Protection Agency legislation could just as well have been dealt with under local authority law which had a firmer basis than the new agency. Local authority law has served the country very well.  There have been changes and the law must be updated but the only problems we encountered with <Col N="1723" /> local authority law in recent years concerned the inability of local authorities to finance themselves.  Local authorities have been given powers in circumstances that we would welcome, but unfortunately finances have not come with those powers.  On this occasion the new powers do not constitute a great burden.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators said, this is an enabling provision to allow the transfer. I am committed to subsidiarity; I have said this on every occasion on which I have spoken in these Houses. There may be in the future a capacity within a local authority to deal with some of the waste and management functions currently being given under this legislation to the agency.  I want the Minister of the day to have the power to devolve that function should he or she be convinced that the capacity is there at local level to carry it out effectively.</P>

    <P>In answer to Senator Sherlock's question about environmental impact assessments for landfill sites, although the European directive does not require an environmental impact assessment below the threshold the Senator has mentioned, as with a number of environmental impact assessment criteria, we operate much more rigid standards in Ireland than in most other European countries.  In sewage waste management, the requirement in Ireland is for an environmental impact assessment for every plant greater than 10,000 population <Col N="1728" /> equivalent.  The requirement is for an environmental impact assessment for every plant greater than 120,000 population equivalent under the new refined European directive.  Similarly, in relation to landfill, we will require an environmental assessment of every project, regardless of volume.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This important issue is causing widespread concern in the United Kingdom and in Ireland.  Revelations in the United Kingdom that agents which cause BSE may be passed on to humans have caused widespread concern and anxiety.  Medical reports from those attending CJD victims in the United Kingdom say the most likely explanation is these cases are linked to <Col N="1731" /> exposure to BSE before the introduction of the special bovine offal ban by the British Government in 1989.</P>
    <P>While the problem is a British one, there is no doubt it will have a major impact on the beef industry here.  There have been relatively few cases of BSE in Ireland and fairly drastic action has been taken to deal with them.  The cattle were slaughtered and the carcases were destroyed.  Herds were also slaughtered. We have had a very firm and drastic policy in Ireland to deal with the incidence of BSE.  There have been 124 cases of BSE in a national herd of about seven million cattle since 1989. Although there is anxiety about it, the issue has been very seriously handled by successive Ministers and the Department. In cases where BSE was identified, drastic action was taken in that the herds were eliminated and the carcases destroyed.</P>
    <P>Ireland's exports to the United Kingdom are in excess of £200 million a year.  Our exports to Europe are worth about £360 million and those to the rest of the world are worth £360 million.  The overall Irish beef industry is worth in excess of £2 billion a year.  It is a major industry which must be protected to ensure the high standards of our beef are maintained, and that we can market it from an environment which is probably the best in Europe.  It is essential to establish the healthy state of the Irish herd, otherwise our beef exports could be seriously affected.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of concern that Irish beef exported to the UK market is not specifically labelled as being Irish.  It is important that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should ensure that Irish beef is marketed, branded and sold in a way which clearly distinguishes it from other beef products on the British market.  The good environment in which our animals are raised, our grass based system of production and our low levels of BSE indicate that our beef market can be strongly defended.  That is the challenge that now faces the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> I will also avail of this opportunity to draw the Minister's attention to the serious concern of people about public health.  Regardless of the publicity surrounding this matter, people are genuinely and seriously concerned about the consumption of beef.  It is important that the Minister for Health indicates what efforts he is making to allay public anxiety about public health.  The British Government has undertaken extensive research into this matter and has spent a large amount of money endeavouring to establish the causes for the link between BSE and CJD.</P>
    <P>It is important for the Minister for Health to clearly identify what action the Government will take to allay public fears about the dangers that might be attached to the consumption of beef.  It is equally important to outline what contact he had with his counterpart in Britain and if there is communication and co-operation between the British and Irish health authorities with regard to this latest serious scare.  The British Minister for Health has promised between £4 million and £5 million for research in this area.  Perhaps our Minister for Health would indicate whether the Irish Government intends to embark on a similar research programme.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that we establish beyond doubt on world markets and in the minds of consumers that the Irish herd is healthy and that we are producing top quality beef.  As the Minister said yesterday, it is safe to eat Irish beef. However, that message must be conveyed loudly and clearly throughout the international community.  Can the Minister indicate what programme has been undertaken by the marketing boards under the aegis of his Department and what campaign he proposes to initiate? Does he propose to visit the United Kingdom in an effort to protect our good name in the beef business and to highlight the high quality and top standard of Irish beef on international markets?</P>
    <P>I do not intend to unduly delay the House.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording Members the opportunity to raise this matter.  He will be fully aware <Col N="1733" /> of the deep and widespread anxiety, first, from the point of view of public health and, second, in view of the importance of the £2 billion Irish beef industry.  We have an excellent commodity and a £2 billion market which we must protect and develop.  The repercussions that might arise from the scare in the United Kingdom demand that the Government, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister for Health make a combined effort to protect the good name of the Irish beef industry and endeavour to open new opportunities to minimise the effects of the revelations in the United Kingdom yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. This House should give assurances that the quality of Irish beef is excellent. Since 1989 a total of 124 cases of BSE have occurred in Ireland.  That represents an annual average of incidence in 16 animals in a cattle population of seven million.  Of the 124 cases, 11 were imported from the UK.  All affected animals were aged four years or over and the age profile of cases continues to increase.  It is important to identify the problem.</P>
      <P>The then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, now a Member of this House, introduced stringent rules and regulations to deal with BSE.  The herd in which BSE occurs is depopulated and owners are paid full market value by the State.  That decision was significant.  Feeding of bonemeal has been banned since 1990 and that was also an important decision.  The importation of cattle from the UK is banned under EU regulations.  This country should now decide that no animal should be imported for consumption, in view of the fact that this problem mainly occurs in Britain which has not dealt with it in the same way as we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has performed extremely well on this issue and has been complimented by its EU partners.  Ireland was not included in the trade measures adopted by the EU in 1990, following the recommendations of the scientific veterinary committee, because Ireland <Col N="1734" /> had taken its own decisions.  That policy has been continued by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and I compliment him on his commitment to the people of Ireland and Europe yesterday about the quality of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>With regard to branding Irish beef, it is important that a decision is taken as early as possible to ask the Commission to lift its prohibition on branding beef products with the name of the country of origin.  In current circumstances and in view of the fact that this industry is worth between £0.7 billion and £1.7 billion in real terms we should be given the opportunity to sell our best product, namely, our beef, not only on the Irish market but in the European and British market.</P>
    <P>In the last 24 hours I have spoken to processors in this country who are worried about the effects of the publicity that has been given to this matter.  I ask those who are reporting on this issue to be fair.  Scaremongering and providing incorrect information is not doing a service to the many thousands working in the beef industry, both in the producing and processing sectors.  Wild allegations and statements in the media will not help the situation.  People should be selling Ireland and its beef product on the basis of the action taken on this issue by all Governments since 1989.</P>
    <P>It is not true that we have a problem comparable to that across the water.  We have even had experts disagreeing with the findings on what causes some of the diseases that have been mentioned.  In view of the serious nature of the problem, we should be forthright in defending the actions taken by successive Ministers.  Only 124 cases were reported and all affected herds were depopulated.</P>
    <P>It is vital to consider whether we should ban the importation of all animals from Europe.  A large number of milk cows have been imported over the last few years but we can survive without them.  If we want to convince the public, not alone in Ireland but abroad, that the industry is safeguarded, protected and allowed to grow, we should <Col N="1735" /> possibly ban the importation of all live animals.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for promoting Irish beef in Britain a few months ago and I have no doubt he will do so again with agencies in order to protect jobs in the industry throughout the country at farm gate and processing levels.  As a result of our discussion today, we will all learn a little more and we will try to give assurances to people that the industry is being protected by the actions which have been taken despite articles and reports which state that we have a problem.  We do not have the problem which, unfortunately, the UK has and Members should emphasise that.  The attitude of all Governments to this issue has been precise and they dealt with it properly from the beginning. I believe that if the British Government had a second chance to deal with the issue, they would have taken the same action we took.</P>

      <P>This side of the House does not lightly raise matters under Standing Order 29.  We did so today because we felt the debate had to be brought to a head and that the most relevant Chamber in which to do this was the Seanad.  I intend no disrespect to the Minister of State but we gave reasonable notice that we wished to have the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry present for the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>We raised the matter on the Order of Business.  Several Members on this side expressed concerns about it and we are disappointed that the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who has ultimate responsibility for agriculture, particularly the beef industry and beef exports, is not present.  We were informed that the Minister for Health would be present but this has not been the case either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> I welcome the opportunity to debate the issue.  It is important that we use cold hard facts to discuss it.  An industry worth £1 billion is in jeopardy because of the inactivity of an EU member state. I am concerned that our beef cannot be marketed as Irish beef.  We took unprecedented steps to ensure that BSE could not enter the food chain through Irish beef but the whole beef industry could now be jeopardised because of the inactivity to which I referred.  We can discuss all the issues and point out the statistics and scientific analysis which show there is no definite link between BSE and CJD but a time bomb landed on the industry yesterday by the announcement in the House of Commons by the British Secretary of State for Health that there could be a possible link between the two diseases.</P>
    <P>We raised this matter under Standing Order 29 to reassure Irish consumers, beef exporters and our markets that Irish beef is safe.  Ireland has taken unprecedented steps to ensure that BSE could not enter the food chain.  I compliment past Ministers, including Senator O'Kennedy, for the stringent guidelines they laid down when other countries, including Britain, did not do the same. Britain is now suffering drastically because of this sad episode and we are being tarred with the same brush.</P>
    <P>To safeguard our beef exports and markets the Minister should seek a derogation from the EU to ensure we can market our beef internationally as beef which has not been contaminated through the food chain by negligence, as happened across the water.  Farmers and exporters, particularly live exporters, are affected by this matter.  From speaking to people directly involved, I know that in some marts today there were no bids for animals which were ready for slaughter because of the situation in Britain.  The British Government suggested that there could possibly be a slaughter of its 11 million national herd to ensure its industry could start again and guarantee BSE free beef.</P>
    <P>I am confident that because of the actions of Governments in the past and the responsibility of farming associations and those involved in the beef <Col N="1737" /> sector, Irish beef is of the highest quality and free of the type of incidents which have occurred in the British beef herd. For these reasons we must send a strong signal to consumers in Ireland and our international markets that Irish beef is safe.  As well as this we must point out that we took every step in the past to ensure this.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, when we try to develop our markets we are seen, because of our proximity to Britain, to be British based.  We must forcefully convey the message that Irish beef should be marketed under its own brand name of Irish beef.  The Scottish Ministry of Agriculture and Scottish beef exporters have ceased to be associated with British beef and have marketed their beef as being of independent origin. They have a low level of BSE in their herd and they have ensured they would not be tarnished in the way the beef industry in the rest of Britain and Ireland has been.  Irish beef is safe, can be eaten and is free of the disease which is prevalent in the British herd.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to people involved in the export of beef.  I am not here to score political points on an issue which is detrimental to the Irish beef industry. The Minister has been criticised recently and there have been protests in Molesworth Street because of inaction on the issue of export credit refunds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That decision was made by the former EU Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry.  The Senator has a poor memory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I will use every forum available to me to highlight the fact that not enough pressure has been applied at EU level to ensure full restoration of these refunds.  We have prime quality cattle in this country.  This has been outlined by previous speakers and I am sure subsequent speakers will also do so.  This issue will have to be resolved immediately.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, who should have been in the House to debate the issue, has claimed that he has done everything in his power to have export <Col N="1738" /> credit refunds restored in full but this has not happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That was Commissioner MacSharry's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's inactivity has caused major problems in the beef industry.  We are facing a crisis in the beef industry, therefore the Minister should go to his European counterparts and argue the case for the restoration of export credit refunds and for allowing Irish beef to be marketed under its own brand name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Agriculture is our most important industry. It is of vital importance to the economy and it must be protected at all costs. Such a threat from sources outside Ireland is difficult to deal with but we must ensure it has a minimum effect. The statement in the British House of Commons linking BSE or mad cow disease and CJD will cost Irish farmers and the economy millions of pounds.  There has just been a tenuous link to date but if a direct link were identified, the beef industry would be decimated and our economy would be seriously damaged.</P>
      <P>We must convince our customers that Irish beef is free from BSE.  A report in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> stated that one major UK supermarket chain has already requested some Irish meat factories to stop deboning beef for it.  I hope that is only a temporary measure, but it shows how immediate the response can be.  I welcome the quick initiative taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, who correctly pointed out that the UK has more problems in one day than Ireland has had since this became an issue in 1989.  Negative publicity about red meat anywhere in Europe leads, and has led in the past, to a dramatic drop in beef consumption.  This means that people eat other types of meat and it is extremely difficult to recover market share once that happens. The Irish agencies now face a difficult marketing job which must be done immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1739" /> Only 124 cases have been found in a national herd of seven million animals in the past seven years, while there were 154,592 cases in Britain up to last November. Approximately 160,000 cases have been identified to date in a British herd of just 12 million animals, which is less than twice the size of our herd. There is no comparison between the level of outbreaks.  Of the 124 Irish cases, 15 were imported and a majority of 83 came from dairy herds.  While we do not have a similar problem to that in Britain, we suffer from the fallout due to the reduction in beef consumption.</P>
    <P>We must continue to point out the positive aspects of Irish beef and Irish beef production to all our international customers, not only in Britain but in Europe and the Middle East.  We must highlight the fact that most of our animals, from calves to those which are slaughtered, are fed on grass.  We must also show that we have low levels of BSE and that we have special policies to deal with BSE when it breaks out which are far beyond what is required by good scientific standards.  We have taken special precautions, such as stopping the practice of feeding bone meal to animals.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty identifying Irish beef but we must find a way around this to ensure that Irish customers can identify it on the shelves.  Senator Quinn said this morning that throwing money at the problem may not be the solution.  Some investment must be made but money is not the only solution.  There should be special arrangements with supermarkets in Britain to identify Irish beef.  This problem will not be easily solved.  Today Mr. Raymond O'Malley of the IFA national livestock committee said that Irish beef &ldquo;needed a clear and distinctive branding campaign to protect and promote the integrity of Irish beef on the UK and other export markets as a top quality product&rdquo;.  He also said that our customers must be fully informed of the rigorous policy of controls and guarantees operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the livestock industry which provide <Col N="1740" /> unparalleled assurance of the product's safety.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly said we must ensure there is responsible reporting of this situation. Some of the British tabloids printed frightening stories today which will help to reduce the consumption of Irish beef.  The media must be responsible in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Durkan, is present because he has a background knowledge of agriculture and he contributed to many debates on this subject before he became a member of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on this national issue.  I welcome the response from you, a Chathaoirligh, to our request for a debate on this matter of special urgency and importance.  I regret that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry cannot be here, but I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Durkan.  I thought the Minister might have cancelled whatever engagements he had at home so that he could come here this evening not just to speak to the Seanad but to reassure the public about Irish beef.</P>
      <P>Ireland enjoys and has always enjoyed white country status.  This means that we are regarded, not only in Europe but throughout the world, as having the highest disease free status in our herds.  I saw the importance of this when BSE first broke out in 1989.  After consulting with officials in the Department, some of whom are still playing a major role, and with our veterinary services, I decided to recommend to the Government that although we had only isolated incidents at that point, we should immediately adopt a slaughter policy on all herds if BSE was suspected because it was vitally important to maintain our status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The BSE outbreak in 1989 occurred in the United Kingdom.  We were able to trace the limited number of cases in Ireland to pedigree animals imported for breeding purposes or to animals which had been contaminated by a food <Col N="1741" /> chain from England.  Immediately, we restricted feed to bovine animals to natural feed in which ruminants should be engaged.  There has been no trace in the food chain for animals of any meat or bone meal, which has been a major problem in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Having taken those steps, which are still being adhered to, I went to the European Community in which we enjoyed disease free status.  I insisted that we call a specially convened meeting of the Council of Ministers where the European Community and the veterinary services of the Commission could lay down the most stringent regulations in respect of the supply through the food chain of any animals which risked being contaminated by BSE.  I invited my colleagues on the Council of Ministers to apply these standards as stringently as possible to us and others. Because of what we were able to prove, my colleagues and the Commission acknowledged that there was no case for a limitation on Irish beef exports as our standards were seen to be so high.</P>
    <P>I recall that some of our competitors spread rumours.  I visited Iran, where there was a blockage because it saw problems with BSE, and other countries. I brought our top class veterinary consultants with me to satisfy them in the most painstaking and lengthy negotiations that whatever problems there might be in relation to BSE, we did not have it.  Each country accepted our status, not only because of our political negotiations and my efforts, but because of the certified veterinary status of our animals.</P>
    <P>The record shows that the Government's policy of slaughter, which I introduced, was very costly.  I had no trouble convincing my colleagues in Government when they saw the significance of this.  Because of the 126 animals with traces of BSE, we slaughtered approximately 15,000 animals at a cost of almost £11 million.  We are entitled, after those clear actions which I introduced to make the strongest case with the support of our colleagues in the European Community, who will verify what I said, to make it clear that Irish beef poses no risk to the consumer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1742" /> Given the veterinary controls in factories which are still in operation, there is no possibility of anything in a food chain which would be remotely affected by BSE.  I do not believe BSE is transmittable to humans.  The problem which has arisen in England has been caused not by flesh, but by offal getting into the food chain through hamburger joints and so on.  I became aware of this problem when I was Minister and I managed to get support from my colleagues in Europe and elsewhere to recognise our disease free status.  That is the foundation on which we must build our marketing policy.  We must convince people that, regardless of wherever else there is a problem, there is none in Ireland.  I do not wish ill to any other producer, but if there are problems in other countries with which Ministers must belatedly deal when they should have done what we did, we are entitled to fill those market opportunities.  Far from reducing the consumption of Irish beef, it should be increased as a consequence of our efforts over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everyone else, I am concerned about this issue.  I would like to make a number of points as somebody who is actively involved in selling meat and who listens to customers' views and concerns.  It is vital to safeguard the international image of Irish beef.  There is a need to distinguish between Irish and British beef.  Senator O'Kennedy was responsible for protecting Irish beef in the past.  However, the public does not clearly understand that part of the reason we have a safer product is that Irish beef is grass fed rather than with concentrated feed.  That must be sold to the public in a manner which it will understand.  It is not just by chance that BSE has occurred only 124 times in the past ten years as opposed to 169,000 times in Britain.  If we are to distinguish between Irish and British beef, that idea must be sold to the public in a positive rather than a negative way by knocking another product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everything we say must be true and rather than jump in immediately to proclaim the quality of Irish beef, we must make sure that there is no doubt in this <Col N="1743" /> regard.  I read an outrageous suggestion in a newspaper today that there is a possibility of British beef being included in products marked as Irish.  We must get to the bottom of this before we proclaim something which may not be correct because we will lose face.  We must ensure that when we proclaim the quality of Irish beef from the rooftops that no other product which has been imported is labelled as Irish.  While we may not be able to identify this problem within hours, we should be able to do so within days.</P>
    <P>There is a belief that advertising will work if we throw money at it.  Anybody involved in marketing will say that it is dangerous to put money into advertising and to promote something if it turns out that what one proclaims is not correct. Not only do you lose the value of that advertising, you do irreparable damage for the future because your credibility is lost.  I ask the Minister, the Department and An Bord Bia to make sure that we can stand over what we say.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a misunderstanding that we are not allowed to advertise beef as being Irish, that the EU does not permit us to do so.  Let me explain how that misunderstanding came about.  It arose because EU policy does not allow individual state money to be used to promote its product as against another state's product.  I can understand that. One of the reasons the Buy Irish Campaign had to be slowed down some years ago was that it was no longer allowed to use Irish taxpayers' money. However, the Guaranteed Irish symbol was created as a result of voluntary subscriptions from the business sector. There is nothing to stop us proclaiming that this is an Irish product, that it is Irish beef, and proclaiming the benefits of it.  When we stand up to speak we should be clear about that.</P>
    <P>If we are to satisfy the Irish public we must put people's minds at rest immediately in regard not just to the products which are identified as Irish but also in regard to other goods which are being produced in Ireland and which, in the <Col N="1744" /> past, may have contained some products which were imported from Britain.  Let us ensure that the Department is able to stand behind everything it says.  Then we can be proud to proclaim it from the rooftops with confidence and reliability in the knowledge that everything we say is verifiably true and can be stood over. This is a challenge to our industry and the nation and I want to ensure everything is done in a manner which takes the long-term rather than the short-term view.</P>
    <P>The changes which are taking place in the marketplace independent of this scare are such that beef is unlikely to be sold in anything like the same quantities as in the past, that is, in the form of pure uncooked beef.  A large number of customers want to buy products which are more readily usable, such as pre-cooked foods or foods which are ready for the microwave.  Prepared processed foods are taking a much larger share of the market than they did before.  Do not let us focus all our attention on the fact that it is Irish beef.  We are talking about added value products made in Ireland which the public abroad will be able to buy as processed finished products which are made from Irish beef.  We have a strong product to sell; let us ensure that we sell that concept internationally. If we can do that by not jumping immediately into it, we will end up having done a world of good for the Irish beef industry because we will have created confidence even at this early stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased you accepted this motion under Standing Order 29 and allowed this debate.  It is an important debate and your decision is one which we all welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crisis which has developed in England regarding BSE, or mad cow disease, in cattle and the alleged connection between BSE and its contraction by humans has posed a crisis for the Irish beef industry.  We should consider this whole area under two headings: first, the potential national disaster which could occur in the event that this country cannot prove its clean sheet with regard to Irish beef produce and, <Col N="1745" /> second, the health of the Irish public and the need to ensure it is not exposed to the consumption or use of products imported from Britain which might be tainted with BSE infected meat.</P>
    <P>On the first issue, the condition of Irish beef and the total absence of any diseased meat being used either on the Irish market or for export is the message which must be got across to Governments, agencies and food chain outlets around the world.  It is the duty of all parties in this House to come together to fight in the national interest to protect the good name of Irish beef destined for the home or foreign markets. This is not a time to play politics with a matter of such national importance. Having called for this debate, the Fianna Fáil Party believes it has put the national interest first.  We will join the Minister and the Government in helping to promote the proper and truthful case abroad that Irish beef is of the highest quality and there is no question that Irish beef or meat products are in any way tainted with BSE.  In fact, this country's beef has an excellent record for quality.  It is now of vital importance that we, as a nation, put forward a united front to explain the facts with regard to Irish beef.</P>
    <P>The economy is still dependent on beef and lamb exports.  Any change in that would spell national disaster.  This agricultural producing country cannot afford the luxury of speculation on the quality or standard of Irish meat on foreign markets.  We must resolve that we will march forward together to explain through our embassies, trade shows and world press that Irish beef is of prize standard and that there is no question of any meat product exports being tainted with the BSE disease.</P>
    <P>Another area on which I wish to concentrate tonight is the need for the protection of the Irish public from the use or consumption of meat products imported from the UK which might have been tainted with BSE diseased meat.  The Minister for Health and the Government have a duty to protect the good health of the Irish public.  We must not allow products &mdash; such as pies, sausage rolls, tin meats, etc., &mdash; which have <Col N="1746" /> been made or part made from beef which may have been contaminated with BSE disease remain or to be placed on the shelves of our shops and supermarkets, thereby endangering people's health.  The Minister, the Government and, indeed, the Houses of the Oireachtas have a duty and a responsibility to protect the health of the public. Whatever measures are needed must be taken towards that end.  I call on the Minister to implement immediately the strictest regulations and to exclude from this country products made from contaminated beef or beef offal which will endanger public health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the motion before the House this evening. However, I find it disappointing that neither the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, nor his junior colleague is here to take this debate.  I would have thought it infinitely more serious than any by-election campaign in Donegal or elsewhere. Since it is possible to drive from anywhere in Ireland to the Houses of the Oireachtas within four or five hours they should have been here because we asked for this debate this morning on the Order of Business.  I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Durkan, for attending and addressing this issue.  It is a serious and grave matter which is why the Minister, preferably, or his Minister of State should have been here.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a trade which is worth about £200 million to this economy and the livelihood of 100,000 farmers, so it is of huge consequence.  We must state explicitly that the quality of the beef we are selling to the British and all other markets is very high, safe to eat; it is probably far more deleterious to the health of any Member of this House to smoke a few cigarettes than it would be to eat half a tonne of beef over a lifetime.  That is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have in this case is a degree of tabloidism which has been damaging to this country and to beef producers in general.  The headlines which scream at us &mdash; and Sky News would be one of the culprits in this respect &mdash; do not emphasise <Col N="1747" /> that it was stated there was no scientific evidence of a connection between BSE in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; they state that it was likely that there was &mdash; a most unscientific word to use &mdash; a connection.  While the reaction has been over the top, we must realise the tabloids have generated a fear among the public and there is a responsibility on us, as a major beef exporting country, to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government must, at the highest level, take direct and effective action to reassure consumers, those to whom we sell our beef in Britain and everybody in the marketing chain that the beef we are selling is of the highest quality.  It is wrong to make any connection between the quality of Irish beef and the alleged contamination of British beef by mad cow disease.</P>
    <P>The policy pursued by successive Governments on this matter, taking out and slaughtering affected animals, has been a good one.  Although there were reservations about the desirability of pursuing that policy, it has shown to have been effective to the extent that we can stand over our beef in any European market.  There is an opportunity to be gained here on the marketing side.  It is possible, with credibility, for the Minister and An Bord Bia to tell British beef wholesalers and supermarkets that our beef is of the highest quality and that it does not have the negative characteristics associated with its British counterpart. However, this opportunity must be exploited and resourced.</P>
    <P>I accept Senator Quinn's point.  There is nothing wrong with branding Irish beef; it is not disallowed by the European Union.  What is disallowed is State funding for a meat board; it must be a co-operative.  It has been proven that branding a product like beef is extremely costly.  While we might aspire to that, the most effective thing we can do is reassure British wholesale beef buyers that what we are selling is good.</P>
    <P>There was a 20 per cent drop in beef consumption in Britain over the past 12 months and this announcement will unquestionably have a further negative <Col N="1748" /> effect.  The Minister, An Bord Bia and everybody involved must do all they can to promote Irish beef as being a healthy and safe food which is, as Senator Quinn said, produced from the best of Irish grassland.</P>
    <P>When BSE first broke out, it was caused by the ingestion of offal or meat in contaminated bonemeal.  We have again taken the appropriate action in policy terms to ensure that this cannot happen again.  From reading the scientific literature, the only cases of proven evidence of a connection between CJD and BSE was when infected animal brain tissue was injected directly into rats or mice.  While the evidence of a connection is extremely tenuous, we must accept it has taken hold in the public mind.  Irrespective of the evidence, the consumer will decide and we will have to respond.</P>
    <P>The European Commission also has a role to play.  It must confirm the quality of Irish beef throughout Europe and state that it does not have the problems associated with its British counterpart. Moves must also be made to restore full live export refunds.  If there was no argument for them beforehand, there is certainly one now.  The farmers who expensively wintered their cattle in sheds are highly vulnerable and will lose a lot of money.  There is a good argument to be made to the Commission for restoring export refunds.</P>
    <P>We must emphasise the quality of what we have to sell.  If anybody believes that putting angel dust or illegal growth promoters into cattle is of value to this industry they should think again. This is another aspect that damages the image we are trying to present to discerning consumers abroad; that these people will not get away with it.  It is wrong to say that these materials do not cause damage.  They are damaging our market.  If consumers want beef without these additives, they must get it.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for raising this important issue which gives me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to reply to the <Col N="1749" /> debate.  I apologise for the absence of the Minister and his Minister of State. Unfortunately, they could not be here within the given time because it would have caused many problems of another nature.</P>
      <P>BSE was first identified in 1986.  The first case was identified in Ireland in 1989.  As a result, a comprehensive range of control measures were put in place.  It is important to stress that the incidence of BSE in Ireland is at a totally different level to that in Britain. Since 1989 there has been a total of 124 cases in Ireland, representing an annual average incidence of 16 animals in a cattle population of over seven million. All cases were aged four years and over and this age profile of cases continues to increase.  By comparison there have been almost 160,000 cases in Britain, which has a cattle population of about 12 million; that puts the number of incidents in perspective.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless we have adopted the most stringent control measures both to protect consumers and to maintain and safeguard our trade.  Among the most important control measures in place are the following: BSE is compulsorily notifiable; a comprehensive surveillance system is in place; in abattoirs all animals are examined <i>ante-mortem</i> for signs of diseases, including BSE, by an official veterinarian; all obvious nervous lymphatic tissue is removed from the carcases; BSE confirmed animals are destroyed and buried <i>in situ</i> or incinerated and market value is paid by the State in compensation &mdash; there has often been criticism of disease eradication and animal health protection measures, but this clearly indicates where it is absolutely necessary to safeguard the national interest and that of our major industries and it is illustrated in this instance &mdash; the entire herds in which BSE occurs are depopulated at full market value and paid by the State; feeding of meat and bonemeal to ruminant animals has been banned since 1990 and importation of cattle from the UK is banned under EU legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has an extremely low incidence of sheep scrapie and the balance between its cattle and sheep population <Col N="1750" /> significantly reduces the risk factor.  It is also important to bear in mind the following. Ireland has an extremely high animal health status and has access to the most discerning international markets; for many years Ireland had a largely self-contained national herd; Ireland has a low level of the disease and is classified by the OIE as having a low sporadic incidence for the purpose of the international trade code adopted by that organisation thereby facilitating continued trade in cattle and meat; the World Health Organisation has endorsed the recommendation of the OIE; Ireland has not been included in the trade measures adopted by the EU in 1990 following recommendations of the scientific veterinary committee; the continued low sporadic level of the disease in older animals validates the efficacy of the control measures already in place and Ireland has adopted extensive control measures, far beyond what are called for on scientific grounds.  Therefore cattle and sheep can safely be imported from Ireland and this is recognised internationally.  The point raised by various Members in ensuring the protection of our international image is recognised here.</P>
    <P>The announcement in the House of Commons yesterday has generated a great deal of interest and a certain level of concern.  However this information needs to be seen in the proper context. First, it needs to be seen as part of an ongoing review of BSE by various scientific groups.  That review has expanded into possible connections with CJD, a rare neurological disease.  Over the past decade, new information has emerged and a good deal more is known about BSE now than when it first emerged in 1989.  It is important that this information is properly assessed and that we do not arrive at incorrect or hasty conclusions.</P>
    <P>High level discussions took place today between officials of the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Health with a view to co-ordinating any necessary action to safeguard public health and preserve the food chain.  This latest information will be examined by the control authorities in <Col N="1751" /> this country, particularly the Food Safety Advisory Board which involves veterinary and medical expertise.  I have no doubt that the advisory board will perform its task in a professional and responsible fashion.  Equally I can assure the House that their recommendations will be acted upon.</P>
    <P>It is also important to understand that this issue has been examined by scientific experts at international level and various recommendations have been adopted by these groups.  These include the EU Scientific Veterinary Committee which has conducted a very detailed and in-depth analysis.  This group will be meeting in coming days to assess the latest situation.  OIE &mdash; the International Veterinary Organisation &mdash; has also conducted a scientific review and has made recommendations.  I must emphasise that the controls in Ireland go well beyond the recommendations made by these examinations.</P>
    <P>This latest controversy is expected to cause difficulties for beef consumption in Britain.  The Irish beef industry is high export oriented.  Four out of every five animals are destined for the export market; therefore, the sector is vulnerable to shifts and changes in consumption patterns.  I think it is widely accepted that the measures in place have protected the reputation of, and market access for, Irish beef, which is <Col N="1752" /> accepted in 80 countries internationally. The likely drop in consumption in Britain is a matter for concern.  It happened before but recovered after a period. Great Britain is an important and value added market for our beef taking some 100,000 tonnes per annum.  A considerable amount of time and effort has been devoted to gaining a foothold in the British multiples.  This has not been an easy task.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry spearheaded a campaign earlier this year to explain to British retail multiples the nature and extent of our controls.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia is assessing and monitoring the latest situation and is in the process of formulating a strategy to counteract any negative impact on Irish beef.  The intention is to take advantage of the controls in place and to exploit the distinctive aspects of the Irish product. An exercise such as this requires careful planning and obviously the timing of any special promotion campaigns will be a critical factor.  I can assure the House that An Bord Bia will not be found wanting in this regard.  It should be noted that this issue is being pursued at EU level.  Every possible measure is being put in place to safeguard the internationally recognised high standards of Irish products.  The House can have no fears in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 27 March 1996.</P>
