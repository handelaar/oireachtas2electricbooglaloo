      <P>I have notice from Senator Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make finance available for the upgrading of Castlebar swimming pool.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Calnan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to ensure that the remedial works, for which he has already provided money, will get under way in order to prevent flooding of houses, business premises, private property and roads in the Long Bridge, Dunmanway area, County Cork.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give an update on the resolution passed at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which called on the Government to call upon the European Union and the United Nations to obtain guarantees for the safe return of Belen Toras and Raul Ramos to Colombia.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide the necessary funding to the Irish <Col N="1186" /> Wheelchair Association for its proposed national respite and holiday centre at Donamon, County Roscommon.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Burke's and Senator Calnan's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Hayes and Senator Finneran may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I announce the Order of Business, the new Government Chief Whip is Senator Burke and his assistant will be Senator Hayes.  I wish him well in that role.  He has a hard act to follow but he will do it very well.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Item 1 will be taken immediately after the Order of Business.  Item 2 will conclude not later than 5 p.m.  Item 3 will be taken from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. and item 4 will be taken from 6 p.m. to the conclusion of business.</P>
      <P>I had intended having statements on tourism but Fianna Fáil asked if we could take item 4, which is a Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill.  I am happy to facilitate it in doing so.  With the agreement of the House, all stages of item 4 will be taken after 6 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Leader for taking item No. 4, which is very progressive legislation in the interests of the disabled.  In the new year we will deal with tourism.  The Leader mentioned that the Credit Union Bill may be initiated before Christmas and he might comment on that before the Seanad goes into recess on Friday.  I welcome the announcement that Senator Burke is to be the Government Chief Whip and that Senator Hayes is to be his assistant.  Senator Burke may not know some of my colleagues that well but between now and the new year he will get to know them better than I especially when it comes to finding pairs.  I wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not believe that when I asked about the Oireachtas (Miscellaneous Provisions) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Bill, 1996, I could not get a copy of it.  It is being rushed through Cabinet this morning and it has not been published.  It is to be rushed through the Dáil this afternoon and through the Seanad tomorrow.  Then it will be rushed to the President to sign tomorrow evening.  The manner in which this legislation is being rushed through is the very opposite to how we should do business.  The people are worried about many things and the element of panic <Col N="1187" /> surrounding this measure which is aimed at putting taxpayers' money into the coffers of political parties is out of all proportion.  Why is this Bill being rushed through tomorrow?  I cannot get a copy of the Bill and am told that it will not be available for another hour or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Burke on his appointment as Whip and Senator Hayes on his appointment as assistant.  If they do half as well as the Cathaoirleach did when in that position they will have done very well.  Both of them can count and that would be one of the first prerequisites of the position.</P>
      <P>Regarding the matter raised by Senator Quinn and without going into the detail of the legislation, it would be the general experience that when we deal with legislation in that rushed way history teaches us it is very easy to make mistakes.  Some consideration should be given to these matters.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader if he can arrange time in the next session to discuss the national lottery and the report published on where that money goes. We also need to consider how the money is distributed and the way decisions are made apart from the list of recipients.</P>
      <P>Item 19, Statements on economic and monetary union, was not concluded last week and Members still wanted to speak on it.  This was raised by Senator Howard last week.  Will the Leader confirm that we will discuss the Dublin Summit, the publication of the draft European Union Treaty and the progress of the Intergovernmental Conference in the resumed debate on European Monetary Union?  If not, perhaps he would initiate another debate on the broader issue of European union and enlargement and other related aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate our new Chief Whip and assistant Whip on their new positions and wish them every success.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and his predecessor, Deputy Lowry, on the work they have done for Bord na Móna, especially in obtaining an equity injection which is now being cleared by the European Union.  This is of immense importance.  Perhaps we could debate in the next session how the company's finances are being handled because an excellent job is being done.  The European Union examined the equity injection very carefully and I am pleased it found it to be in order.  The Minister is to be congratulated on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can we discuss the policy on the transfer and closing of post offices?  When a person who runs a post office dies, the branch is closed.  However, some of these post offices are occasionally transferred without being advertised.  This is <Col N="1188" /> something about which there ought to be policies and guidelines and we should debate it.  I am sure rural Senators would agree with me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader organise a debate on this matter in the next session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Burke and Senator Hayes on their elevation to new office.  I assure them of my full co-operation.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly called for a discussion on safety at sea.  It is appropriate to introduce legislation on this because a fishing boat sank yesterday near the Smalls off the east coast. There was a lot of controversy about the rescue, although all were saved.  They were rescued by a helicopter from England for which we are grateful.  Questions are now being asked about where our helicopter was, especially as the accident occurred so near the coast.  The other question is how the boat got into difficulties in such calm seas; apparently it was caused by a freak wave.  There is a need to review safety at sea and enact new legislation in this area as most of our boats are very old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Hayes on his promotion.  I am sorry I did not get the position of Chief Whip but I am not altogether surprised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It demonstrates that party loyalty is not always rewarded.</P>
      <P>On a more serious note, would the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Finance, before or after Christmas, to explain something which he has not yet explained to anyone else, which is the complete surrender to the public service unions between Friday and Saturday while we were celebrating the stability pact with European Union leaders?  That deal was struck in the middle of the night yet we had been told one week earlier that such an arrangement was impossible.  Does this mark the total domination of the Government by the Labour Party and the left?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This is possibly the most irresponsible decision taken by a Minister for Finance since 1977.  It makes Fianna Fáil's bribery <Col N="1189" /> of the electorate look like a minor birthday present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a hard act to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has almost become a ritual for us to ask for a discussion on Northern Ireland. That will not be arranged before the end of the term but could I suggest that the Leader arranges such a debate as soon as possible after we resume?</P>
      <P>There is an example which this House can follow.  It has been established since the days of Aristotle and Plato&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Senator is not going to include all their work on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This House can make a real contribution to the analysis and development of the Northern Ireland situation.  Where there is a political stand-off, as currently exists, what is required is that politics be exercised in a manner that breaks through that log jam.  If people insist on standing firm on constitutional positions no progress will be made.  Using the precedents of the resolution of conflicts around the world, we should have an informed analysis in this House, and invite people, if necessary, to help break the log jam in the knowledge that the art of politics is to break down barriers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that Senator Ross had begun the process of reconciliation with Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Where would the Senator be without me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Senator's instructions from the <i>Irish Independent</i> newspaper were to take this tack.  I can assure him that every time he attacks the Labour Party the membership increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The membership is falling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Tactically, why did the Leader not offer Senator Ross the job he so desired?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Kennedy is right to request a debate on Northern Ireland.  The Foyle Fisheries Commission was fined £40,000 for discriminating against employees on religious grounds.  This is not a subject which I like to pursue but the Government is a joint manager of the commission and must take responsibility for allowing religious discrimination in the selection of employees.  We must deal with this matter urgently.  I am not a bigot and if I have something to say I will say it.  If this Government tolerates being a party to religious discrimination then it <Col N="1190" /> has to be told that we are contributing to some of the problems in Northern Ireland.  We must debate the fundamental issues because there is no point talking superficially about what we might desire.  The House might be shocked that religious discrimination is practised, partly in our name, by the Foyle Fisheries Commission but I work with cross-Border organisations and I feel obliged to raise this issue in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Burke and Senator Hayes on their appointments.  In view of the recent practice where any and all issues have been raised and elaborated upon at length on the Order of Business, is it intended to reform the procedures in this regard?</P>
      <P>It is the last straw when a Senator who is paid a substantial salary by a newspaper comes to the House to attack workers in the public service whenever he feels like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross has struck a chord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>His attendance is negligible and he should be suspended.  His contribution to the debate has no meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to refer to Santa Claus but Senator Ross has already dealt with him.  It seems the presents are not going down well with certain Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>He came too early.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Some months ago I raised the issue of a regional industrial policy and how it impacted on rural development.  In this regard two reports have been published recently.  The first is from the Western Partnership Board, set up by the Government and, although we are awaiting action from it, I commend its chairman, Mr. John Higgins, for keeping the agenda focused on the disadvantages in rural areas.  The second report is that from the Combat Poverty Agency which shows that the most severe deprivation and poverty is to found in housing estates on the fringes of small and medium sized towns in rural areas.  This may come as a surprise to those who have always believed that poverty is exclusive to the large cities.  In this context, there will be many families whom Santa Claus will not visit on Christmas Eve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the public service unions may have been delighted with the outcome of the Government's negotiations, the reality is that many families will go without this Christmas.  There is a perception that rural Ireland comprises small farmers who live on largesse from Brussels.  However, the reality is that many of those people have no land assets, live in local authority housing and do their best to get by.  Will the Leader make time available in the next session for a discussion on <Col N="1191" /> the imbalances in industrial development?  I would not want to be accused of being the dog in the manger with regard to the new industries which have located on the east coast.  However, there is an imbalance, an east-west divide, which we should have the chance to address.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their congratulations.  I also thank them in advance for their committed support and co-operation over the next 12 months.  I support Senator Fitzgerald's request for a discussion on safety at sea, particularly with reference to the fishing fleet.  I also want to congratulate the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, who has responded to calls from this House to restore operation Shannon.  Now that it is in place I have no doubt it will be a great success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate Senator Burke and Senator Hayes on their appointments. I support Senator McGowan's call for a debate on the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  On a previous occasion I raised the report on the safety review of the fishing fleet which was published six months ago.  We have still not debated that.  It is over a year since the <i>Carrigatine</i> disaster, following which the safety review was set up. Fishermen and their families are extremely concerned about safety at work.  We should have a debate on that report as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I would also call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  The situation there has been deteriorating since the events at Drumcree last July.  We have seen disgraceful scenes at Harryville church week after week yet little is said about it here.  It is wrong for thugs to behave in this way on Saturday nights when people are trying to go to their place of worship.  We have shied away from this matter on a number of occasions but we should discuss it during the new session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mooney mentioned two reports and I support his call for a debate on them.  However, we should also take into account the Teagasc report on rural development which states that only 40 per cent of farms will be viable in future.  The problem is, and will continue to be, as Senator Mooney outlined it.  We need to debate the matter urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Senator Wright that the debate on tourism will recommence early in the next session.  He also asked about the Credit Union Bill.  I understand it is on course but I will be able to confirm that tomorrow.  Senator Quinn raised the question of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Miscellaneous Provisions) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Bill being rushed, but it certainly will not be rushed through this House.  There is <Col N="1192" /> all party agreement on the Bill which is largely concerned with regularising the situation of secretaries in Leinster House who have no statutory basis at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is late because of difficulties including union negotiations.  This aspect of the Bill could not be put in place until agreement had been reached.  Now that it has been reached, people are anxious that the secretaries' situation, which all of us deprecate, should be put right as quickly as possible. Another provision in the Bill will regularise the position concerning overnights.  Senator Quinn may not be aware of the real hardship imposed on most rural Senators concerning the rate of overnights and the way they are applied.  Many if not all rural Senators are seriously out of pocket because of the situation which pertains.  That is why the Minister is anxious to have the Bill passed before Christmas.  I will give as much time as is needed to discuss the Bill tomorrow, and if Members want to have Committee Stage on Friday or next Monday there will be no difficulty with that.  I will give as much time as the House requires for the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am sorry if the text of the Bill was not available.  That should not have happened and Senator Quinn has a legitimate point.  The Minister for Finance is dealing with the Finance Bill and the Senator should certainly have the text of this short Bill as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis sought a debate on the national lottery and I have no difficulty with that.  It might be wiser to start a new debate on economic and monetary union after Christmas.  Events are moving swiftly and Members might like to start afresh on that.  I am keen to keep it as an item on the Order of Business so we can have that debate regularly.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald raised the question of safety at sea.  That could be debated early in the new year.  A number of other Senators raised the same issue which I know is close to Senator Fitzgerald's heart.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that Senator Ross has been passed over for promotion once again but I know he will be stoic in the face of adversity.  Who knows?  His time may come.</P>
      <P>I also thank him for his, as ever, very helpful contribution on the Order of Business.  He certainly has a talent for helping his friends and we are all very grateful for that.  However, he made a serious point and of course it will be conveyed to the Minister for Finance.  Somebody else can complain to the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised the question of a debate on Northern Ireland.  I am very keen to have such a debate early in the new session.  A longer debate than is our wont would be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> Senator McGowan raised the question of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  A Bill will be introduced in the new session which will give him an opportunity to outline his views.  Raising the matter on the Adjournment in the meantime would be a useful way of ventilating that particular point.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock raised a question about the Order of Business which, if need be, can be raised at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney and Senator Kelly raised the question of the reports.  I have already assured the Leader of the Opposition that we will have a debate on the Western Development report early in the new session.  If the other reports are germane, they, too, can be included in that debate.</P>

      <Col N="1194" /> The draft order is to be made by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment under section 23 of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, as amended.  Under section 4(4) of that Act, a draft of an order proposed to be made under section 23 must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    <P>The legislation enabling the strategic alliance and the associated board restructuring is the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, which was recently enacted by the Oireachtas.  Senators will recall that these issues were extensively debated by the House during consideration of the Bill.  I propose to briefly review the purpose of the strategic alliance for Telecom Éireann and then outline the purpose of this order and its place in the context of the strategic alliance.</P>
    <P>Telecommunications have an increasingly important role to play in modern society, not only for economic reasons but also for social, personal and leisure purposes.  Telecommunications are becoming more and more important as a driver of economic growth and job creation.  To maintain and further improve Ireland's economic competitiveness and job creation potential, Ireland must have a top quality telecommunications sector.  The Government's objective is to achieve a telecommunications sector which is in the top quartile of OECD indicators of price competitiveness, quality and availability as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The telecommunications sector itself is undergoing a revolution.  Developments in technology, rising customer demand, global-isation of business, liberalisation of the sector and competition are all contributing to this revolution. Telecommunications companies which do not adapt to this rapidly changing situation will not survive.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann, like all other telecommunications companies, is subject to this changing environment.  It is essential that Telecom Éireann be equipped with the capacity to survive and succeed in this new environment.  This is not just to protect Telecom Éireann; it is because a successful Telecom Éireann will play a major part in the achievement of our objective of bringing about a top quality telecommunications sector for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann has made considerable progress in adapting to the new circumstances by, for example, improving its financial structure and reducing prices.  However, further progress must be achieved if it is to become a successful company in the new competitive marketplace.  In order to accelerate the further development of Telecom Éireann, the Government and the company agreed that it should form a strategic alliance with a major telecom operator. Furthermore, it was agreed that the best way to secure a successful long-term strategic alliance <Col N="1195" /> would be to enable the partner to take an equity stake in Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Government and Telecom Éireann sought a partner which would have the necessary commercial and technological experience as well as the capabilities and commitment to support the company in growing and developing its business. The Government approved a mandate for negotiation of a strategic alliance in July 1995 and, following an open and competitive selection process, it approved the signature of an alliance agreement with KPN/Telia in July of this year.  A key element of the deal is the fact that 85 separate strategic initiatives have been agreed between Telecom Éireann and the consortium. These provide a comprehensive strategic support programme involving technical support, expert and managerial assistance, software and system improvements across all business categories.</P>
    <P>When the strategic alliance agreement is concluded, the process of accelerating the transformation of Telecom Éireann can begin with the assistance of the strategic partner.  The success of the alliance will depend on co-operation among all interests involved in the company: the Government as the main shareholder, the strategic partner, the company management and, not least, the employees.</P>
    <P>The employees, in particular, will be in the front line in bringing about improvements in the company's operations.  It is important that they have a voice in the further development of the company.  Up to now the Worker Participation Acts have provided for the participation of employees in decision-making processes of the company through representation at board level. The arrangements which have been agreed, and which I will describe more fully later, provide for the continuation of this arrangement although in a slightly altered form.</P>
    <P>However, a further opportunity is made available by the strategic alliance for employees to participate in the fortunes of the company.  The Telecommunication (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, enables the company to issue, and the Minister to transfer, shares in the company for the purpose of employee shareholding schemes. The Government's intention is that the terms under which the shares will be issued will be to encourage active participation by employees as shareholders in the company and that the scheme should facilitate the continued improvement of the company's customer service, quality and commercial success.  Proposals from unions for an employee shareholding scheme have been received and these are being examined at present prior to the commencement of detailed negotiations.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the arrangements made for the participation of employees in the future development of the company will enable them to make a meaningful contribution to the future direction of the company.  This draft order, which includes arrangements for employee directors <Col N="1196" /> under the Worker Participation Acts, is part of these arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Worker Participation Acts apply to ten State enterprises in total, including Telecom Éireann, and provide for the election of employee directors to the boards of those enterprises.  In the case of nine of the enterprises involved, all nine being commercial State enterprises, one third of the board positions are reserved for employee directors.  In the other case, a non-commercial State enterprise, provision for less than one third exists.</P>
    <P>Currently, the board of Telecom Éireann consists of 12 members appointed by the Minister, of which four are employee directors. This is clearly appropriate where the State is a 100 per cent owner of the company and where the Minister has power to appoint all the directors.  The strategic alliance involving the Government, Telecom Éireann and the KPN/ Telia consortium provides for the sale of up to 35 per cent of the equity of the company to the consortium as part of the arrangement.  The consortium, as a substantial shareholder in the company, will be entitled to representation on the board of the company.  In that case, a revision of the board structure in order to balance the interests of the Government, the strategic partner and the employees, is required.  The provision reserving one third of the total number of seats on the board for employee directors is no longer appropriate in these changed circumstances.  It is more appropriate that the number of employee director seats should be determined by reference to the number of directors which the Minister is entitled to appoint.</P>
    <P>The Government agreed, in the context of the strategic alliance transaction, that the consortium will be entitled to appoint three directors to a board of 12, reflecting their shareholding in the company.  In restructuring the board, the Government sought a solution which would satisfy a number of essential requirements.  These are the need to preserve effective control for the State's majority shareholding; the representational interests of the strategic partner; the objective of maintaining a small to medium sized board for the purpose of effective governance and the need to have meaningful employee representation at the key decision making forum in respect of company operations.</P>
    <P>On the basis of agreement with the strategic partner and following intensive discussions with the trade unions in Telecom Éireann, the Government has agreed a board structure as follows: seven members, including the chairman and chief executive, appointed by the Minister; three members appointed by the strategic partner and four employee representatives.  Two of the employee representatives will be appointed as directors on the basis of an election under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts. The other two employee representatives will be alternate directors, appointed on the basis of the results of an election under the Worker <Col N="1197" /> Participation (State Enterprises) Acts.  The alternate employee directors will be entitled to attend all board meetings but not to vote, except in the absence of the directors to which they are alternates.</P>
    <P>When an employee shareholding scheme in Telecom Éireann is established, the members of the scheme will be entitled to nominate a director for appointment to the board by the Minister.  In that event, the employee director who was second placed in the last election will become an alternate director and the term of office of the alternate director who was placed second of the two alternates in the election will expire.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the draft order is to facilitate the restructuring of the employee representation on the Telecom Éireann board in accordance with the arrangements I have outlined.  The order will fix the total number of members of the board of the company for the purposes of the Worker Participation Acts and the number of members to be appointed under the Worker Participation Acts.</P>
    <P>The Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, provides that an order under the Worker Participation Acts, in relation to the board of Telecom Éireann, may specify that the number of employee directors shall not exceed one third of the number the Minister is otherwise entitled to appoint.  The draft order provides that the number of directors of the company will be 12 and that, of those, two will be appointed under the Worker Participation Acts.  This is the only provision of the order.  However, in addition, the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, enables the Minister to appoint two alternate directors to the board.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of the board of the company will take place as soon as the strategic alliance transaction is concluded.  It is intended that the draft order will come into effect following the conclusion of the transaction.  As well as this order, certain further steps will be taken to complete the restructuring of the board of the company.  These include the expiry of the terms of office of two of the current employee directors, the appointment of those persons as alternate directors and the appointment to the board of the three nominees of the strategic partner.</P>
    <P>The draft order is one element of a process aimed at preparing Telecom Éireann for successful development and growth in a new competitive telecommunications environment. The implementation of the strategic alliance is essential to enabling the company to achieve that success.  The board of the company will have a key role to play in guiding the company to success in this new environment.  The new board structure for the company has been carefully balanced to reflect the various interests involved and I am satisfied that this will facilitate the effective performance of its functions.  I am also pleased <Col N="1198" /> that the employees of the company will continue to have a meaningful representation on the board of the company in this new arrangement.</P>
    <P>I commend this resolution to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In broad terms, I accept the thrust of this order and normally there would be little discussion about it.  However, I wish to pose a number of questions regarding Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>Following changes in Telecom in recent years, the quality of the telephone service provided to the ordinary subscriber has suffered.  I say this as someone who uses the telephone for work purposes on a 24 hour basis.  Changes in staffing levels and the kind of attention given to customers have led to a fall in the standard of service provided by Telecom.  With regard to delays in contacting someone or receiving messages from one's answering service, at night one could wait up to two to three minutes to obtain a telephone number from directory inquiries.  At present, customers are treated in an appalling manner by Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the way 087 numbers are being sold.  We were told this service would provide security against those earwigging on telephone conversations with scrambling machines.  The 087 numbers were considered a must for those who wanted to conduct business confidentially.  Efforts to introduce the 087 number are a disgrace.  Telecom Éireann is not reinvesting the enormous income accruing to it from 087 numbers.</P>
      <P>I greatly respect this Minister who is a man from the midlands.  As I said before, he is the best Minister of State in this Government.  Does he agree with this deal?  As a member of the Labour Party, is he satisfied we got value for money for the 35 per cent share?  While I do not believe it is a good deal, I recognise it was necessary to have a partner.  Our market is so small that we would have been swallowed up in the long term, particularly with the opening up of the industry. Will the Minister of State confirm he is happy with this deal?</P>
      <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, in this morning's newspapers that there will be no further increase in charges for the next five years.  That will be welcomed by telephone users and those who depend on it.  However, costs are still too high and I suggest they be reduced over the next two years.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister had to amend the legislation to take account of the new partners. However, former worker directors have a role to play.  There is an active former worker director on the board of Bord na Móna who makes a considerable contribution because he worked in the company for over 40 years and knows the industry inside out.  While the Minister may only appoint a certain number of worker directors, perhaps former worker directors could be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a straightforward issue arising from the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, passed by the House a few weeks ago.  We are being asked to approve an order arising from that legislation.  I understand an order is required under section 23(1) of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1997, to reduce the number of worker directors under the provisions of the Act from four to two.  An ingenious arrangement has been made to preserve, to a large degree, the presence of four worker directors.  Two will have voting powers and there will be two alternates.</P>
      <P>An ingenious arrangement has been made and I see no reason to disagree with it.  The strategic alliance between Telecom Éireann and the KPN/Telia consortium will benefit all concerned, particularly users.  We also cannot ignore that what is proposed enjoys the support of the unions in Telecom Éireann and the other interests which negotiated the deal and enabled it to be brought before the House.  It is interesting that both companies have in the past provided for worker representation on their boards.</P>
      <P>There is no reason to do anything other than support this order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this order.  Senator Howard called it an ingenious solution and I agree.  Previously there were 12 members on the board.  That number is unchanged but, as three of the members will represent KPN/Telia, the presence of four worker directors would constitute an excess of one-third representation.  The solution of allowing four worker directors to attend board meetings but allocating only two votes to them is ideal and worthy of Solomon.</P>
      <P>With regard to the concept of worker participation on boards, modern thinking refers to &ldquo;stakeholders&rdquo; in companies.  Stakeholders are not just limited to those who work in the company but are considered to include shareholders, employees and customers.  People in Ireland have not yet understood the real benefit of competition for what are traditionally State run enterprises.  This applies not just to Telecom Éireann but to the ESB and other bodies and I am not thinking solely of State run <i>versus</i> privately run enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be marvellous if we had State organisations which could compete with non-State organisations.  We must move quickly into that world and Telecom Éireann is already doing that.  There is a degree of competition in that sector and there will be more shortly.  However, there must be a change of attitude and culture. We still tend to think that if an enterprise is State owned it is ours but if it is privately owned it is only performing for the greedy owners who are in competition with the State enterprise.  This attitude could be seen in the airline sector in the past, yet our State owned airline is much healthier as a result of competition from other <Col N="1200" /> airlines, regardless of whether they are owned by other states or by private companies.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann will also become healthier because of competition.  However, our nation does not seem to understand that yet.  We almost applauded the Minister when he returned from Brussels with a derogation to put off the evil day of competition for another year or two.  When we postponed competition it was not in the interests of the users of the telephone system or in the interest of the users of airlines.  I urge competition because it is best for an organisation's customers.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy referred to the Minister's direction that there should be no increase in prices for five years.  That is great.  However, if we are to have competition, it is the board of directors who must decide whether it is right to increase charges to make an organisation healthier.  When we remove the hands of the Minister and the Government from the running of State companies, we will have healthier State companies and a healthier competitive marketplace. Ireland has yet to recognise that competition is good for the nation and the organisation involved, even if it is a State one. Therefore, it is good for the employees of that State organisation and for the customers which includes all taxpayers.  I applaud the Minister on his solution to this matter.  It is one which was forced by the strategic alliance but we will have a healthier telecommunications system because of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to disagree with the thrust of Senator Quinn's comments.  This Government and the previous one made it clear that State companies were to have a commercial mandate.  If that is limited in the interests of the national good or for social reasons, it should be put to one side, costed separately and whatever subvention needed should be paid.  I have no difficulty with the Minister's draft order which, as Senator Howard said, is quite ingenious. Following Senator Cassidy's comment that he is the best Minister for State in the Government, I would not question his judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the effectiveness of the board of directors system.  I disagree with Senator Cassidy in that we cannot swim backwards in the commercial world.  Ireland is a small market and we have to fight our corner. We have proven we are talented and skilled enough to do so.  In the normal commercial situation, people are appointed to boards not just because they are financial stakeholders but because they bring some element of expertise to it which enables a company to succeed.  If a company does not exploit that expertise among its board members it quickly goes off the rails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have met members of private sector boards who did not seem to have a clue about what they <Col N="1201" /> were doing.  I have also met worker directors on State boards who did not have basic information about the operation of which they were technically in control of.  I am also concerned that there does not seem to be any report back mechanism.  If the Minister appoints someone to a board, what is the relationship between the Minister as a representative of taxpayers and the people he appoints on their behalf?  Is there a reporting mechanism or is there a conflict between board secrecy, the need to operate the commercial mandate and supervising the people's asset?</P>
    <P>As regards the hepatitis C saga, it has now become clear that officials in the Department of Health were notified by the blood bank of information which they did not pass to the Minister.  In this case, what is the purpose of having an official appointed by the Minister who does not report back to him?  I am sure there are very good answers to this.  I am unclear about the relationship between the appointee on behalf of the State and that person's responsibility to the Minister.  I know there has to be a separation of powers but I am confused.</P>
    <P>Is there any mechanism to train worker directors?  There should be proper training in relation to the finances of the company, the ability to assess various proposals and the balance sheet, an awareness of the fiduciary duty and other matters, because they will be sitting with people who had the benefit of attending the Harvard or Smurfit schools of business where they were trained to take control of a company.  I applaud the idea that if somebody has a huge stake in a company, it is their life, hands, skill and brain and they should have an element of control and input to it.  However, that input can be enriched by a proper system of training and education to enable them to do their jobs as directors.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that one of the most appalling aspects which emerged from the sugar company, Greencore, was the inability of the worker directors to find out what was going on in the company.  There is no point having people involved as token figures.  If that was the case, the board could have cardboard cut outs and save on expenses.  The worker directors need to be equipped to keep up with the game in every way. I am interested in the Minister's response to this aspect.  I have no difficulty with the order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their positive contributions.  The purpose of the order is to facilitate restructuring of the board of Telecom Éireann in the context of the strategic alliance between Telecom Éireann and the KPN/Telia consortium.  As part of the strategic alliance agreement, provision must be made for board representation for the partner.  At present the Telecom Éireann board comprises 12 members <Col N="1202" />&mdash; eight appointees of the Minister and four worker directors.  While representation for the partner is to be provided, the Government wants a continued meaningful role for employee directors on the board, together with the continued provision for voting control by the majority shareholder.</P>
      <P>The formula agreed with the strategic partner, taking account of detailed discussions with the trade unions in Telecom Éireann, is a board comprising seven ministerial appointees, three partner appointees and four employee representatives of which two are alternate directors.  I hope the position where the alternate directors do not have a vote will not come into play on a regular basis because it is not normal practice that decisions are made by majority voting at board level.  We have managed to meet everybody's concerns, although it was not easy to reach agreement.  It satisfies the new partner, the majority shareholder &mdash; the Government &mdash; and the workers in the company.</P>
      <P>The new board structure reflects the scale of the alliance transaction, the position of the majority shareholder and the importance attached to the participative role of employees. More importantly, it does this in the context of manageable board structures under which the main board will continue to act as a key decision making forum.  The proposed board structure is designed to maintain employee representation on the board of the company while ensuring an appropriate balance of voting strength among the various interests on the board.  The solution providing for two alternate directors to offset the reduction of employee directors from four to two raises substantive policy and legal questions.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any precedents for the arrangements worked out, which required careful consideration of a number of questions relating to the status of the alternate directors.  The approach adopted was to base the concept on the already existing formula contained in the articles of association.  This formula was adapted to the needs of the emerging situation.  I am satisfied that it was the most practical approach.  I am also happy the solution addresses the concerns of employees, the Government, the company and the strategic partner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any move to retain four votes for employee representatives would lead to the necessity of a board membership of at least 19 to protect the position of the shareholders.  As a consequence, the work of the board would inevitably be devolved to subcommittees, thereby effectively weakening the impact of the employee directors in the process.  The board size would also inevitably complicate the transaction of board business at a time when the company needs to become sharper and quicker to respond to an increasingly competitive market.  The solution to the board restructuring in Telecom Éireann does not by-pass the employee directors or shuttle the representational interests of the staff into a meaningless <i>cul-de-sac.</i>  Employees will continue <Col N="1203" /> to have a strong role at the key decision making forum of the company.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy raised the problems with the 087 telephone network.  While the matter is not directly pertinent to the debate, I will ensure that the Senator's comments are passed on to Telecom Éireann to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>The order made yesterday by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, to which I referred during the debate, will have the effect of reducing the basket of goods which are priced in Telecom Éireann by 30 per cent over a five year period, a 6 per cent reduction per annum.  The order contains a requirement that small users may not be increased.  This gives Telecom Éireann a flexibility it does not have at present.  Up to now the Minister decided the price of everything, but the capping order will give Telecom Éireann flexibility.  This only applies to areas where there is no competition.  If competition exists, the order will not apply; competition will set the price.  The order will only apply to areas in which Telecom Éireann still has a monopoly, such as domestic telephones, etc.</P>
    <P>The stakeholder's position is important and the employee shareholding concept within the company is a positive step in that direction; Senator Quinn raised this point.  There is a figure of 5 per cent in the Bill already available to Telecom Éireann employees as shares for their benefit and they have made a bid for a further share of 14 per cent.  This bid is being examined and will be the subject of detailed negotiations with the employees.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner raised the difficult issue of the relationship between the Minister, the shareholder and the persons he appoints to the board. There is much room for improvement in that area.  Many appointees do a good job, but do not tell the Minister, who is the shareholder, how they are doing it.  There is no reporting back to the current shareholder but this does not take from the good work done by appointees. Occasionally, some people are appointed in the public and private sectors who are not up to the job.  I appreciate they might not last as long in the private sector as they would in the public sector but in some instances the private sector companies which are badly structured will go to the wall and their competitors will take them out if they are not capable of doing their job.</P>
    <P>Training worker directors is taken in hand to a degree by ICTU.  The unions do some of that work, but there should be an in house system which ensures that the best available would be drawn from the worker and other directors on the basis of information in a form which is best suited to them.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy asked if I was happy with the deal.  I could go into great detail about it but I will not do so in this debate because this aspect was covered in the debate on the Bill.  I am happy with the deal, the bottom line is a minimum of <Col N="1204" /> £500 million because the company has an option to take up another 35 per cent share in Telecom Éireann.  The company will be valued after three years and 60 per cent of any increase in valuation of the share held by the new consortium in that period will revert to the State, the company and the shareholder.  Taking all these factors into account, it is a good deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the best deal available in the marketplace.  The market dictated what was available.  We could have received twice as much for just the shareholding, but we could not attract the expertise and 85 separate agreements on its use, which is contained in the deal, and get double the money.  While the money was important because of what is being done with it in the company, the expertise brought in was probably more important.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for a very positive response to the debate.  The House should again ponder what we have decided to do.  First, we agreed to the Maastricht Treaty.  I am probably the only Member of the Oireachtas who voted against it as I felt there were flaws in it from Ireland's point of view but an overwhelming majority accepted Maastricht. Liberalisation and competition are requirements of Maastricht.  Monopolies must be broken up and there must be direct competition. We can no longer be the shareholder and the regulator.</P>
      <P>We are in a quandary.  Which is the most valuable thing for a democratic organisation, through the Minister and the Oireachtas, to hold? Is it regulation or shareholding?  I would win the argument that the power base regulation is more important from the democratic point of view than shareholding because somebody else will decide what happens to the investment one makes by being a regulator but that person will have no accountability to the democratic institutions like this House.  Of necessity, he will have to be independent.  It is desirable for him to be independent from the shareholder but it may not be desirable for him to be independent of the democratic institutions of the State because he will essentially be a policy maker by his implementation of regulations.  However, the people decided what way we were to go.  We must now live with that decision and make it work to the advantage of those who voted for it.  This order implements one part of the Telecom Bill. Yesterday my colleague implemented an order on prices that did not require the approval of the House but this part does.  I ask for the approval of the House.</P>

In 1996 the amount to be made available is £7.5 million and will rise annually until 1999 when, under the provisions of section 4, £12.5 million or 20 per cent of television programme expenditure must be made available by RTÉ for independent productions.</P>
      <P>When I introduced the legislation in 1993, I undertook to place a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas to show how this facility for the independent production sector relating to the national broadcaster would work.  Under section 6 of the 1993 Act, RTÉ is required to make a report to me on its activities regarding the commissioning of independent productions and I am required to lay that report before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Turning to the report for 1994, we can see that, in 1994, £5.6 million was paid into the special account established under the 1993 Act and that £5.28 million was expended or committed on 258 hours of independently produced programmes. The report contains a list of programme makers who received commissions and the types of programmes which they provided.  It also shows that independent commissions covered a range of programme strands which included features, sports, current affairs, drama, agriculture, gardening, variety, documentaries and young people's programming.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1994 report also sets out the arrangements which RTÉ put in place to implement the provisions of the 1993 Act.  The requirement that the independent sector would have the right to make programmes and submit them to RTÉ was one of the fundamental aspects of the 1993 legislation.  An independent production unit was established.  Seven people, including a <Col N="1206" /> commissioning editor, were appointed to the unit. One round of commissioning was operated in 1994 to which there was a most enthusiastic response resulting in 683 proposals from 185 companies.</P>
    <P>At the time of publication, I welcomed the positive tone of the report.  The then chairman of the Authority welcomed the addition made to RTÉ schedules made by the independent sector. In my consultations with the sector following the publication of the report, some concerns were expressed about aspects of the commissioning process.  However, I am happy to say that, in the light of my discussions with the sector, these problems seemed to be teething ones.</P>
    <P>I clarify that it was never my function, nor is it now, to become involved in RTÉ's decisions on the nature of programmes it commissions, to whom the commissions are awarded and how it reaches these decisions.  I cannot emphasise that sufficiently strongly because it is an important part of the distance which I, as Minister, have from this aspect of RTÉ.  This may come as news to some people who have irresponsibly asserted the opposite.  It was never my intention to diminish in any way RTÉ's authority and control over and responsibility for its own programming schedules.  It is a matter for RTÉ, within the parameters of the Broadcasting Authority Acts, to decide on the nature and content of its own schedules.  My concern is to form a view as to whether the 1993 provisions are actually meeting the objectives which I had in mind when they were introduced.  My intention was broadly to provide a statutory base from which the independent production sector could have a reasonable chance of achieving its potential. Senators will recall that the 1993 legislation abolished the cap on RTÉ and provided this facility for the independent sector.  It also made it necessary that there be gender equality on the RTÉ Authority.</P>
    <P>Turning to the report for 1995, it is most interesting and gratifying to note that, in the director general's foreword, the status of independent productions has moved from being described a year earlier as a &ldquo;welcome addition&rdquo; to the RTÉ schedules of 1994 to being &ldquo;a valuable and significant element of the RTÉ schedule&rdquo; in 1995 and the belief is expressed that independent productions will be central to RTÉ's output in the future.  In 1995, RTÉ was required to make available £6.5 million for independent productions.</P>
    <P>The report gives details of activities including the statutory payment into the special account of £6.5 million and other moneys such as bank interest and VAT refunds.  It also shows that 261 hours of programming were commissioned at a cost of £6.5 million in 1995.  Two commissioning rounds were operated in 1995 as opposed to one round in 1994.  The report also shows that independently produced programmes covered a broad range of strands within the schedule.  I am especially pleased with the reported increase in <Col N="1207" /> the value of drama commissions from just over £130,000 in 1994 to over £500,000 in 1995.  I believe that the two reports demonstrate how the national broadcaster can contribute to the development of a vibrant independent production sector without diminishing the role of RTÉ itself as a producer of quality programming.</P>
    <P>The quality of the commissioned programming across the range of the schedule over these two years demonstrates the talent, competence and versatility of our independent programme makers.  What we have seen also is a clear demonstration through programmes such as &ldquo;Dear Daughter&rdquo; and &ldquo;You Die On The Inside First&rdquo; of television that can inform, challenge, disturb, provide access to the excluded and abused and generate real and valuable controversy.  We have seen light entertainment programmes and fascinating and popular factual programmes such as the series on Waterford Regional Hospital.  The mix of programmes commissioned shows that the independent sector can make a vital contribution to the schedules of a broadcaster with a clear public service remit and can carry forward the tradition of providing programming for minority as well as mainstream tastes.</P>
    <P>As before, I will continue to consult with interested parties on the operation of the 1993 provisions to determine whether the objectives are being met.  Next year £8.5 million will have been made available for independent productions. I look forward to the continuation of the development of a successful creative relationship between our national broadcaster and the independent production sector.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I think it would be appropriate for me to congratulate and compliment the independent production sector that is supplying virtually 100 per cent of the programming for Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Feictear dom go bhfuil na cláir seo den chaighdeán is airde ar bhonn teicniúil agus ar bhonn ealaíona araon. Táim dóchasach go leanfaidh an scéál amhlaidh agus go ndéanfar forbairt ar chúrsaí de réir mar a dtéann an tseirbhís in aois.  Is breá liom a fheiceáil freisin go bhfuil cuid mhór den táirgíocht seo i lámha daoine atá lonnaithe lasmuigh de Bhaile Átha Cliath.  This is a strand of independent television production that is not covered by the provisions of the 1993 Act and it is worth putting on record, so that Senators have the total picture, that expenditure by Teilifís na Gaeilge on programme commissions in 1995 was £1.8 million. This year the amount will be £7.5 million.</P>
    <P>I am confident that as the long-term effects of the legislative provisions relating to independent production and the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge enable the industry to put down secure roots at home, independent producers will, in time, find themselves well placed to avail of the explosion in demand for programme material to fill the virtually limitless broadcasting capacity which is being created internationally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1993, the Minister came into the House and removed the cap on RTÉ which was welcomed by most people in the industry.  We are fortunate to have a Minister with such an open attitude and a winning way when it comes to the entertainment industry.  The Minister will long be remembered for the contribution he has made to this sector.</P>
      <P>I agree that there is very good work being done by the independent sector and that they have been given a massive incentive by the Minister to create good programmes and have them broadcast on our national channels.  However, Ireland is a small market.  Australia's success in this sector is the great example for us.  It is an island economy like Ireland with far less attractive markets to sell to.  However, Australian producers were given incentives and they conquered the English-speaking world.  This is why this motion is very timely.  We are framing the budget and all thoughts are of creating more jobs in this sector.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the Minister to the world music publishers conference in Cannes two years ago. He generously graced the conference at which we try to exploit new technologies and productions created during the previous year.  He was the first Minister to attend the conference in a long time. In fact his presence was the reason Ireland had a stand at the conference and he is to be commended.</P>
      <P>The film industry has generated £100 million investment in Ireland this year.  Much of this is due to the Minister's efforts and I congratulate him.  However, what do we need to achieve the success of the Australians?  We need to retain the best production teams and use all the high tech equipment available to us.  However, to keep these people in Ireland we must provide them with a tax base.  The tax incentives which are required are those which currently exist for our writers, sculptors and other creative artists.</P>
      <P>The audio-visual industry is a high risk industry; only about 20 per cent of the work created is successful.  The success rate in the recording industry is even worse; about 25: one. A tax regime of at least 20 per cent must be introduced to keep the best creative talent in this country and persuade investors to continue to take risks.</P>
      <P>In the coming year, £8.5 million will be spent by RTÉ on independent productions.  That is a sizeable amount and is to be welcomed.  I have had a very good working relationship with RTÉ over 25 years and have great respect for them but I fear that between 500 and 1,000 jobs could be in danger in the long term.  I do not want to scaremonger during Christmas week, but perhaps the Minister could clarify the situation for RTÉ personnel and assure them that the increase in independent productions will not result in job losses at the station?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of our tourism industry is in no small way due to Eurovision; we are the leaders in this area.  Eurovision provides a shop window <Col N="1209" /> to hundreds of millions of viewers.  We were successful in 1996 and the 1997 competition will be hosted and financed by RTÉ.  As a result, the autumn schedules have shown a cutback in light entertainment.  The total entertainment bill in RTÉ is less than 2 per cent of the overall budget. RTÉ should be given a special allocation to cover the costs of the Eurovision Song Contest.  Bord Fáilte, An Bord Tráchtála, IDA Ireland and many other organisations will benefit from the huge public relations exercise involved.  The Eurovision programme should not be funded out of RTÉ's budget.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan is aware of the great success of artists from Donegal.  One in particular has proved a great tourist attraction and he will present a Christmas night special on television. Tourism is one of the main sectors for job creation and the amount of money spent on the Eurovision is very small compared to the cost of buying equivalent advertising.</P>
    <P>Riverdance has been a mind boggling success. The best visitor numbers for the months of January and February in Dublin were in 1995 when Riverdance was showing at The Point Theatre.  That show came directly from the Eurovision.  It is all about capturing the public's imagination and we have another chance to do so next year.  The Minister should get a specific budget allocation for the song contest so as not to impinge on the budget for home light entertainment productions.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister continued success.  I thank him for his open approach whenever I have sought to express views or obtain advice from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>These reports indicate that the initiative taken by the Minister in 1993 has proved useful and positive.  The large number of companies which made proposals to RTÉ is an indication of the extent to which the initiative was necessary.  It gave the talented programme makers the opportunity to make proposals for programmes to RTÉ.</P>
      <P>The changing world requires a new approach to creating job opportunities.  We have a wealth of talent in the programme making field and this initiative gives them the opportunity to use their talents.  It also takes programme making out of the confines of RTÉ in Dublin 4.  This has given film makers an opportunity to deal with any issue of social or historic interest in any part of the country and to carry out all the necessary work with a view to making a programme.  As the Minister pointed out, this work has become an integral part of RTÉ's schedules.  It is now accepted as part and parcel of RTÉ's activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the independent productions was &ldquo;Dear Daughter&rdquo; and it had a great impact on the nation's conscience.  It sensitively and honestly highlighted a situation that was almost too traumatic for many people.  It challenged many of the hypocrisies and double standards of a certain element of Irish life which had been <Col N="1210" /> unexplored.  The programme deserves high commendation because it gave many people an opportunity for the first time to openly discuss their sad experiences.  If independent programming can successfully challenge the nation to face many of its taboos it is well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The documentary made by Louis Marcus on the Great Famine was another success.  Each of us had heard stories about the effects of the famine in our own rural areas, of the disasters and tragedies that occurred.  This documentary gave a sensitive vision of the events.  People traditionally read historical material but given that people read less nowadays we have to adapt television to deal with such events.</P>
    <P>The Minister's initiative was wise and positive. Those who produce the independent programmes come from a different background than the confines of RTÉ.  They are less restricted by the system and are freer in their thinking.  In the final analysis the decision must be made by RTÉ to have the programme made and shown. Nonetheless, the independent programmes bring with them a welcome freshness of spirit.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister and RTÉ have budgeted for increased expenditure in the future &mdash; £12.5 million in 1999.  It shows a confidence in the work already done.  I am not aware of the details of the way in which RTÉ decides which programmes will be broadcast but it has done a good job to date.  I hope an open attitude will be adopted, particularly to young people and programmes dealing with issues of interest to them.  I look forward to more challenging independently produced programmes such as those we have seen recently.</P>

      <P>I do not share Senator Cassidy's familiarity with or experience in this area, I echo his generous and well deserved tribute to the Minister for the achievements which have followed this successful initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that it is only now that the 1994 and 1995 reports are being discussed; the 1994 report is water under the bridge at this stage.  The 1995 report was sent to the Minister on 2 April.  Given the intrinsic importance of this issue it deserves to come to the House earlier.  I do not know whether there are deadlines for the submission of reports <Col N="1211" /> but I hope that, in future, in keeping with the significance of the issues and the excitement that can be generated by progress in this area, it will come to the Oireachtas earlier than December of the following year.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on a few points in the Minister's informative speech.  I know it is probably impossible to arrive at judgments, even if one were in a position to do so, about the quality of decision making on commissioned programmes unless one knows which ones were not commissioned.  It is like promotions in certain institutions with which both the Minister and I are familiar, where all those promoted doubtless deserve it but unless you know who was next in line you cannot cast judgment on the decision-making qualities of those who have the largesse to dispense.  While it may not be possible to include that, there should be some way of knowing about the context, criteria and reasons for near misses in greater detail.</P>
    <P>One of the encouraging features of the report is the reference to the high quality of a number of programmes that could not be commissioned. It would be helpful to have more detail on that dimension rather than saying 64 programmes were accepted and over 700 were not.  There must have been many good quality programmes among them.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify his reference to the fact that it is not his function to become involved in the decisions of RTÉ with regard to the nature of programmes that are commissioned.  I accept that, of course, but the Minister stated: &ldquo;My concern is to form a view as to whether the 1993 provisions are actually meeting the objectives which I have in mind&rdquo;.  He also said he was &ldquo;particularly pleased with the reported increase in the value of drama commissions&rdquo;.  I find it difficult to believe that the commissioners would be entirely insensitive to an observation of that type, even though it may be a well justified one.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he &ldquo;will continue to consult with interested parties on the operation of the provisions to determine whether the objectives are being met&rdquo;.  There must be a subtle relationship between ministerial interest in, and justifiable ministerial concern with, the objectives being met, and the actual decisions being taken in a general way.  I would welcome some clarification on how that process operates.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the quality of programmes on Teilifís na Gaeilge agus aontaím go h-iomlán leis.  Is breá liom a fheiceál freisin go bhfuil cuid mhór don tógáil seo i láimhe daoine atá lonnaithe lasmuigh de Bhaile Átha Cliath. Cuireann sé sin áthas orm nuair a bhreathnaítear ar lonnaíocht na gcuideachtaí sa chontae seo taobh amuigh de Theilifís na Gaeilge: 63 cuideachtaí in Éire, seachas Baile Átha Cliath, 105 in mBaile Átha Cliath, timpeall 70 faoin gcéad in mBaile Átha Cliath, 30 faoin gcead lasmuigh de Bhaile Átha Cliath.  Ní thugann sin <Col N="1212" /> an oiread sin dóchais dom agus a ba mhaith liom a bheith agam faoi bhorradh na gcuideachtaí seo taobh amuigh de Bhaile Átha Cliath.</P>
    <P>I presume there is some development in this direction.  Naturally, Dublin has to be a centre of activity in this regard.  Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to people going down the country but I would also like to see people coming up from the country, while based there, to conduct activities of this type so that we will get a national &mdash; and not a disproportionately metropolitan based, activity of this sort.  There are different perspectives depending on where one is coming from, as the Minister well knows.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed the hope that &ldquo;independent producers will in time find themselves well placed to avail of the explosion in demand for programme material&rdquo;.  Will the Minister give some idea what schedule &ldquo;in time&rdquo; envisages?</P>
    <P>I share the hope expressed by Senator Cassidy about the potential.  He referred to the Australian example.  I do not know if one would want to follow every aspect of that but it provides some indication of what the potential might be.  Senator Taylor-Quinn quite rightly referred to our natural talent for this type of activity.  If we cannot provide the talents required by television and film then we will not be successful in anything.  If there is an area where indigenous industry, to use that awful phrase, can develop export markets &mdash; and we are still lagging far behind in the development of export markets, as the Minister knows &mdash; this ought to be one of the cutting edges.  I know perfectly well that I am preaching to the converted but it would be useful if that final paragraph could be fleshed out more specifically to target the dimensions, scenarios and timescales in so far as that is possible.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the success of this initiative.  I hope that when he comes back to report at an early date next year, he will be able to record further progress in this direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am loathe to depart from the consensus of congratulation which appears to greet this motion.  I do not wish to be controversial in any way but I would like to say one or two words about RTÉ itself before we drown in a sea of self-satisfaction as we head towards Christmas.  The first thing the Minister will be aware of is that RTÉ is losing money on its broadcasting activities.  Last year it lost of the order of £2.35 million, purely on broadcasting activities.  We ought to ask why and how this has come to pass.  RTÉ declared an overall profit but that came from elsewhere.  We also ought to ask whether RTÉ wants to make a profit from its broadcasting activities.  I am not sure it really does or that it is under any particular pressure to make such a profit.  The reason is simple; RTÉ is a subsidised national broadcasting station which is not under normal commercial pressure and its ethos, in turn, is to subsidise itself to be a subsidiser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> From memory, I think RTÉ received £51 million from licence fees in 1995 and the year before it was a little less.  Next year, thanks to the Minister's generosity to RTÉ, it will be considerably more &mdash; another £8 or £9 million. RTÉ's consumers have little choice about whether to pay the licence fee.  When this amount is confiscated from them by the Government, they will watch RTÉ whether they like it or not because the station has a monopoly.  In turn, RTÉ is required &mdash; this is what this motion is about &mdash; to give an escalating amount of money every year to the independent production unit regardless of merit, talent or any other criteria.  According to this year's annual report, £6.5 million was directed from RTÉ to the independent production unit in 1995.  That amount must rise to about £12.5 million in 1999.</P>
    <P>Not being a great sympathiser with semi-State bodies, I feel a certain pang of sympathy for RTÉ in this case.  Before the Minister picks me up on that, because he would be more aware of those particular sensitivities than I, I should declare an interest in that a substantial amount of my family income comes from RTÉ.  RTÉ is not, in any sense, master of its own destiny.  Those of us who would require it to make a profit or strive to do so are aware that it is working in a straitjacket. Not only is it subsidised and its subsidy controlled, but its cash profits are directed in a certain way.  The promotion of an independent production unit is obviously something we welcome but the compulsory direction of funds to this area is regrettable.</P>
    <P>We should also be aware of the amount of money which goes to Teilifís na Gaeilge by Government direction.  Reading between the lines of the annual report, there is no doubt that Mr. Corcoran makes it perfectly clear that he is not happy with this, although in the jargon of annual reports one never says that to one's Minister.  However, one does it in such a way as to convey the message to the outside world and if one accuses him of criticising Government policy, he will immediately say that he did not do so.  According to him, Teilifís na Gaeilge makes a dent in the operations of RTÉ and costs it £5.5 million per annum.  There was an initial capital payment of £6.5 million.  This affects the performance of RTÉ and its ability to make a profit.  We cannot have it both ways.  RTÉ is a creature of whoever happens to be Minister.  I beg the Minister not to take this personally.  Long may he be Minister &mdash; for at least another six months.  RTÉ is a creature of the Government and the State &mdash; that is the nature of State broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy asked if the Minister could give some reassurance to the staff of RTÉ.  It is my understanding, not from my family relationships with RTÉ but from other staff there, that morale in RTÉ has been low for a long time. At present, cutbacks are being implemented at RTÉ in both radio and television which have not been particularly well explained to the <Col N="1214" /> employees.  Money is being frittered away on Teilifís na Gaeilge and other areas and cutbacks are being made internally in programmes simultaneously so there is a direct relationship between the two.</P>
    <P>With all its great merits, RTÉ has one in particular, that is, it is the national champion of openness, transparency and accountability.  That is something for which we can applaud many of the broadcasters and I say this without any hesitation or qualification.  Without exception, RTÉ has fairly fearlessly flushed out many of the hidden parts of Irish life and politics and it has been a great pioneer in exposing cant in places where it was necessary, but it should also be transparent and open.</P>
    <P>I have asked RTÉ on several occasions about one or two matters on which it has refused to answer and in certain cases that was perfectly reasonable.  However, I have asked RTÉ publicly and in private correspondence how many meetings members of its board attend and who turns up?  That may seem trivial but it is not.  I have asked many semi-State bodies that question and nearly all of them sent me the necessary reply.  The members of RTÉ Authority are paid £4,000 per year out of public money.  The chairman is paid £6,000.  I am open to question on all these figures, as they are purely from memory. It is unforgivable that those who promote people so successfully and with such great talent expose politicians and pursue the need to account for public money, do not and will not let the public or Members of the Oireachtas know whether they are doing their job.</P>

      <P>It is relevant because we are talking about the distribution of public money to the IPUs.  The way this money is used is important and I want to know whether members turn up.  If they do not, why will they not tell us?  That is relevant to the motion.  Why do I consistently receive a reply to the effect that they will not tell me who turns up at board and Authority meetings.  I do not believe there is some big hidden secret but there is a hypocrisy in the RTÉ culture which expects one thing from politicians and other people in public and private life but will not divulge whether they are earning their living with the licence fee.  I ask the Minister to apply that across all State bodies and to ask RTÉ to give us that information.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators who have taken an interest in this motion and contributed so thoughtfully to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senator Cassidy and all the Senators who spoke about the consequences which flowed from the 1993 decision to include an independent sector contribution to the programming of RTÉ. It is useful to state that the circumstances to <Col N="1215" /> which I was responding then as Minister were ones which had been crucially affected by the 1990 broadcasting legislation which placed a cap on RTÉ's revenue, and this will answer one of Senator Ross's questions.  He said that, following the general election in 1992, the Programme for Government explicitly stated that the start up costs of Teilifís na Gaeilge would be met from those sums above the cap which had been accumulated in RTÉ.  There was a prohibition on RTÉ's capacity to earn, both from advertising and other activities.</P>
    <P>In addition, and in reply to one of Senator Ross's opinions which are very interesting, if morale is low now, one could touch the morale at that point when the cap was in place.  The 1993 legislation, from which these two reports derive, dealt essentially with three matters if I remember correctly: first, the removal of the cap; second, creating capacity for the independent film production sector and, third, some small changes were made, including the provision for gender equality in the composition of the RTÉ Authority.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with Senator Lee's point that the reports should be published more quickly.  I am required under section 6 of the 1993 legislation to place the reports before the Oireachtas and I agree it would be more satisfactory if they were being discussed closer to the end of the production year.  I am aiming towards that.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy raised an interesting point to which other Senators referred.  It is not true to say that RTÉ must spend the independent production unit money.  What is important is that the legislation specifies RTÉ will make the money available.  There are, if one looks at the text of the 1993 legislation, clear criteria on the disbursement of that money once it is made available.  For example, under section 4 (7) of the Bill, the Minister of the day has the power to vary the amounts which have to be made available for independent production.  One of the criteria to be taken into account is the employment conditions within RTÉ at the time.  There is the capacity in the criteria laid down which enable the obligation to make money available for independent production to be examined.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy is right about the export capacity of Australian TV production.  When this business is concluded here, I will be launching a report on the future of the music industry.  I agree with the Senator that music is important to culture and that it can also make a major contribution to employment creation and to the economy.  The external circumstances taking place in relation to television and film production are interesting in that the capacity to transmit far outstrips the programmes available for transmission.</P>
    <P>Within two years, pay television channels will probably be available.  This will be followed, probably in a second generation of decoders, by <Col N="1216" /> digitalisation and digital home entertainment capacity.  These developments will take place within ten years.  In relation to developing productive capacity the idea in 1993 was to give the indigenous independent production sector a platform from which to launch into this much larger market.  It will come from cable, from pay television through satellite and the new digital services that I expect to come onstream about three or four years later.  BSkyB, for example, is one player in this market.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee asked a very interesting philosophical question about my relationship to the independent production, selection and editorial process.  I have never read a script that came into Bord Scannán na hÉireann and I have never seen a proposal being considered by RTÉ under the independent productions sector.  There are seven people and an independent commissioning editor.  She has been very anxious to maintain her own integrity in media with which Senator Ross will be familiar and in relation to her distance from me as Minister.  I have never, do not now, and have no intention of ever interfering in an autonomous artistic activity within RTÉ.</P>
    <P>I meet the RTÉ Authority perhaps once a year and different topics come up for discussion in relation to the future of RTÉ.  The Authority introduced the topic in 1993, anticipating public concern at the costly nature of making drama and the difference between making drama and buying in a programme.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Ross's comment on RTÉ's £2.35 million loss on strict broadcasting activities, it is true that RTÉ is in surplus in the last published report because the commercial activities outweigh that £2.35 million loss in strict broadcasting, but the reasons given for that loss are the cost of purchasing programmes which have escalated with the bid for exclusive sports rights and a whole series of other factors which have made the purchasing of programmes in a scarce environment extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the independent production sector whose activities have been reported here are in a very healthy state.  There are far more suppliers than there are people to be catered for on the airwaves.  It is only reasonable that the independent sector should be able to look to the national broadcaster as a place in which it will be able to reflect life in all its complexity, black and white, good and bad, as it is in both a contemporary and traditional setting. RTÉ is not a commercial body; it is the national broadcaster.  It gets a licence fee for that reason but it also has obligations.  If it is to carry out its commitment it needs support.  It was always my intention that, from 1993, the arrival of material from the independent production sector would be a joining of the creativity from outside with the creativity within.</P>
    <P>I understand the point made by Senator Lee on the location of the companies.  About 70 per cent of the population lives in or near the Dublin <Col N="1217" /> area and some 70 per cent of the companies are in that general area as well but you cannot look at it on a strict population basis.  The greater the diversity of production companies the better chance there is of having a thematic stretch that will include all sorts of experience.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross made an interesting point about the structure of the Authority.  It is very important to draw distinctions between the national broadcaster and others.  In the international entertainment industry, people occasionally communicate.  In national communications, people sometimes entertain but they also have an obligation in the traditional conception of broadcasting to inform, educate, look after minority tastes and so on.  In the second version, there is a very democratic theory of citizenship.  In the first, in which one imposes simply an accountability to the marketplace, there is a strong diminution of the citizens' rights and even at times an anti-democratic impulse. There is the suggestion that a person is entitled to benefit from the receipt of images when, and only when, he or she is able to pay for them.  That is the choice that is opening up between the future of national broadcasters and the immense pay TV conglomerates who are only interested in entertaining to the point at which they can maximise their profits.  There is room in a mixed world for both.</P>
    <P>Teilifís na Gaeilge is not strictly involved here but as the national broadcaster's advertising cap has been removed and the choice of television increased for the first time in ten years, it is not a huge burden to ask RTÉ to provide one hour of television for Teilifís na Gaeilge.  You can only answer this question when you have answered the question for yourself as to the value you put on a cultural diversity which includes the right of people to communicate, using modern means of communication, in the Irish language.  I respect that there are those who do not consider that important.  There are many who do and ultimately all a Minister can do is to take decisions openly. I said from the very beginning that RTÉ would be required to provide an hour of programming. It has and it will.  Teilifís na Gaeilge's start up costs were met from the sums accumulated over the cap, precisely as laid down in the Government programme.</P>
    <P>In relation to matters which are more suitable to an epistolary communication between Senator Ross and RTÉ he will be glad to hear I am in favour of the openness he seeks.  Many years ago he and I discussed the lack of democracy and openness in so many private corporations about which he now writes with more enthusiasm than he spoke then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>May I preface my contribution by apologising for my late arrival.  I welcome the Minister of State and I compliment Deputy Mary Wallace on bringing forward this important Bill. The essence of the Bill involves giving fair and equal opportunity to participate in the democratic process.  It merits cross-party backing and is supported by the major organisations which represent those with disabilities.  I understand a number of organisations made representations to the Government asking it to support the Bill.</P>
      <P>The issue of providing accessible polling stations and the unfair discrimination caused by the lack of such facilities has been raised on many occasions.  Members are familiar with constituents with disabilities who are faced with this problem.  The essence of democracy is the ballot box, but ballot boxes are usually situated in rooms and buildings that are not accessible to some people with disabilities.  For this reason Fianna Fáil stresses that another election or referendum must not be allowed to take place under the current discredited and discriminatory system.</P>
      <P>The two basic principles of the Bill are that people should not be denied the right to vote at their local polling stations simply because they cannot walk, and those who cannot travel to their local polling station because of physical disability or illness should be treated equally with other categories of voters to whom the facility of postal voting is extended.  The current position is that polling stations are situated close to people's homes.  However, a quick assessment shows that a major percentage of such stations are inaccessible to wheelchair users.  What happens? Presiding officers make special arrangements where these people can vote at home under the supervision of a garda.</P>
      <P>The special voting system was introduced in 1986 which required that those applying for registration had to produce a statement of their sanity and capability of voting.  This aspect was reformed by Fianna Fáil in 1992.  However, I believe it is very intrusive and intimidating that people with disabilities must be supervised by a garda when voting at home.  This indicates that they are less trustworthy than other voters.  A full postal voting service includes members of the security forces and graduates of the universities, particularly those who vote in Seanad elections. Is it any wonder that people with disabilities who are intimidated in this way have disappeared from the register of voters in recent years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill suggests that polling and voting must be made accessible for people with disabilities. <Col N="1219" /> Sections 2 and 3 state that any building made available to serve as a polling station must be accessible to wheelchair users.  It is the duty of local authorities to find accessible buildings. Returning officers will be obliged, where possible, to locate polling stations only in places accessible to wheelchair users and to make it easy to mark voting papers and place them in ballot boxes.  It must be made as easy as possible for people with disabilities to vote.</P>
    <P>Postal voting will replace the special voting system and will allow those unable to vote in person, due to physical illness or disability, to vote through the current polling system.  If the Bill is implemented, this will be a welcome reform.  Many groups and organisations representing people with disabilities informed me that the special voting system is so cumbersome that they would welcome this change.  The Bill received cross-party support in the Lower House and there is no need for me to fight my case.  We are in agreement on this matter.</P>
    <P>In publishing this Bill, Fianna Fáil is saying that the widespread marginalisation of disabled voters in the electoral system must be challenged.  We have provided the practical means to begin to meet this challenge.  The Bill addresses the fundamental issue and commands widespread support among those affected by the existing discriminatory system.  I ask the Government and the House to support the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, which was introduced in the Dáil by Deputy Mary Wallace as a Private Members' Bill, is designed to facilitate electors with a physical illness or a disability in voting.  It contains measures to allow such electors who, because of a disability or illness, cannot go in person to vote at their normal polling station to vote at home.  The Bill also gives statutory backing for the provision of facilities to assist voting by electors with a physical disability who are, nonetheless, mobile and able to go to their polling station.</P>
      <P>The Bill in its present form differs from the Bill as originally presented.  This follows detailed cooperation between the Minister for the Environment and Deputy Wallace in amending the original Bill so that we now have short but very workable legislation.  In addition, it will provide the electors concerned with a better opportunity to exercise their franchise, a matter which I am sure this House will welcome.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides for an amendment to electoral law to require a local authority, in making a polling scheme, to endeavour to appoint polling places in which at least one polling station is accessible to wheelchair users.  This, new provision puts the onus on local authorities, in considering a new polling scheme, to do everything possible to ensure that polling places designated in polling schemes have suitable buildings for use by wheelchair users.  Local authorities will have to be more thorough than they may have been in the past in checking out potential buildings for use as polling stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> A further provision to be inserted in electoral law by section 2 will allow local authorities to change a polling place in an existing polling scheme.  This power will enable a local authority to change a polling place which has no accessible building in favour of another polling place which has a suitable building.  This will give local authorities a greater degree of flexibility in ensuring that polling stations are accessible. Under existing law, a local authority is required to make a complete new scheme to effect such a change.  The new provision keeps formalities to a minimum.  The prior approval of the Minister will not be necessary for such a change.  However, a decision to change a polling place will, like the making of a polling scheme, be a function reserved to elected councillors.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the insertion of a provision which is complementary to that set out in section 2.  It requires a returning officer to provide, as far as practicable, polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users.  I take this opportunity to say that, while the Bill addresses the needs of electors with disabilities, its provisions will also facilitate elderly electors and other less mobile electors.</P>
    <P>Section 3 also provides for a requirement on returning officers at an election or referendum to make arrangements at polling stations to facilitate the marking and placing in the ballot box of ballot papers by voters who are wheelchair users.  An example would be the provision of a table of suitable height, located in such a way as to ensure secrecy in voting.  The Department already advises returning officers to provide such facilities at each election or referendum.  The Bill will give statutory backing to the current arrangements and will leave no doubt that the facilities must be provided.</P>
    <P>Section 3 also provides that the Minister may make regulations putting arrangements in place to facilitate voters with visual impairments to mark their ballot papers without assistance.  The Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, in an interim report on electroal procedures, recommended that Braille ballot papers or Braille templates be made available at all polling stations or, at a minimum, at polling stations at which it is known that voters would wish to avail of such a facility.  This is a complex question and is one which needs further detailed consideration.  For example, consideration will have to be given to such matters as the feasibility of using Braille ballot papers and templates under our electoral system where the names of up to 20 candidates may appear on a ballot paper and the fact that an elector may record as many preferences as he or she chooses.  I mention these matters to stress to the House that the provision of such assistance needs careful consideration from a technical point of view.  However, I assure the House that the Minister intends to have this matter examined without delay.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the extension of postal voting to electors living at home who are currently entitled to vote under the special home voting arrangement.  It restricts the right to be entered in the special voters list to electors who <Col N="1221" /> are resident in a hospital, nursing home or other similar institution for persons with a physical illness or a disability.  While not wishing to single out any particular group, the risk of abuse in unsupervised postal voting is likely to be higher where a large number of electors are resident at a single location.  This is not intended to cast any aspersions on the staff in such places.  The possibility of abuse is an eventuality which must be guarded against, even if it only occurs in very isolated cases.</P>
    <P>Ideally, a postal voting scheme should have adequate safeguards to ensure the integrity and secrecy of the ballot.  There would, in the normal course, be a strong case for requiring that the voter have a declaration of identity, witnessed by an authorised person, drawn from specified categories of office holders acceptable for this purpose.  Such requirements apply in relation to voting by diplomats and their spouses posted abroad who are required to have a form of declaration witnessed by an authorised person, normally the Head of Mission.  Likewise, the Electoral Bill, 1994, which proposes to extend postal voting to persons unable to vote locally due to their occupation, requires a declaration to be witnessed by a garda.  However, the Government in agreeing to extend postal voting in this Bill, recognised that a witnessing requirement in the case of such electors would almost certainly be unacceptable due to its intrusiveness as the witness would have to visit the elector at home.  This is the main objection to the existing special voter arrangements.  The approach adopted in the Bill strikes the correct balance, and meets one of the main objections to the existing special voting scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 5 proposes to require returning officers, where practicable, to ensure that they appoint counting centres which are accessible to wheelchair users.  This provision should ensure that wheelchair users have full access to all stages of an election and are not prevented from attending the count because it takes place in an inaccessible building.  Section 6 contains a transitional arrangement to enable the Minister to appoint dates for giving public notice and for the receipt of applications for entry in the postal voters list for forming part of the register of electors which will come into operation in February next.  Once the Bill has been enacted, the Minister intends to appoint these dates without delay.  This should ensure that electors with disabilities living at home will be registered as postal voters in the 1997-98 register, which will come into operation on 15 February.  This register will be used for any election or referendum held between that date and 14 February 1998.  The provisions of this Bill contain a welcome package of measures which will make it easier for electors with a physical illness or disability to vote.  The Government supports the Bill and I hope the House agrees to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Government has accepted the Bill.  This is a very good provision and I congratulate Deputy Mary Wallace and Fianna Fáil on bringing it forward.  Some years <Col N="1222" /> ago we thought it was a good idea to allow people go to the homes of those who were restricted from leaving them to supervise them when voting. However, it did not work out so well in practice because people were afraid of this intrusion into their homes.  There were cases of people falsely gaining access to houses and elderly people were loth to allow anyone into their homes when voting.  The elderly are enthusiastic voters so it is in our interest to enable them to get to polling stations and maximise the poll.  I hope the abysmally low poll in the last referendum was not due to the elderly being too afraid to go out to vote and remaining indoors.</P>
      <P>It is not just wheelchair users who will benefit from this measure.  Many elderly people and those who are less mobile but not wheelchair bound will also benefit.  Voting is also difficult for people who are visually impaired.  Even if ballot papers are printed in Braille the confidentiality of the ballot will be easily broken.  If there is only one blind person voting on the Braille ballot paper in a polling station, whoever counts the votes will know how that person voted.  That is a difficulty I discovered when I looked at this matter in the past.</P>
      <P>I am interested that the Minister of State foresees problems with regard to old folks' homes, where people could be pressurised into voting a certain way.  Apart from having witnesses present, as is proposed, I doubt that we can do much more about it.  It might be a good chance for the medical profession to get involved in yet another way by certifying that people are fit to vote.</P>
      <P>The fact that ill people and patients in maternity hospitals who have their babies on the wrong day, as it were, cannot vote is interesting. I watched the elections in eastern Europe, which is not considered a great bastion of democracy, and was fascinated to see the returning officer accompanied by his assistants pushing the mobile ballot box around the wards.  The practice has obviously gone on for years because it appeared to be accepted as normal.  The attitude appeared to be &ldquo;You had your appendix out this morning or you had a baby this morning but wake up now because it is time to vote&rdquo;.  It is interesting that these countries have devised such a system and it appears to be working well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment on another matter which is not directly relevant to this Bill.  The use of postal votes will have to be examined further.  Senators on the Universities Panel are used to dealing with a postal electorate.  However, there is great pressure for emigrants to be given votes.  The proposal brought forward in this regard by the Minister for the Environment was not considered satisfactory, but that does not mean we cannot look at the matter again.  Should we not try to introduce a postal voting system which will give emigrants influence if not seats?  I accept that the majority of emigrants would like to have influence in terms of seats in Dáil Éireann and that seats in the Seanad will not satisfy them, but it might be possible to start the process by giving them postal votes in presidential elections and in referenda.  In such cases, their votes would be part <Col N="1223" /> of the global vote and would not heavily influence events in constituencies.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State for accepting the Bill and I congratulate Deputy Mary Wallace and the Fianna Fáil Party for introducing it.</P>

If it were not for her initiative in raising this issue in 1995 and 1996, this measure might not have been introduced.  The Bill is an example of the Government and the Opposition co-operating to provide good legislation which will affect our business by increasing the vote.  It is in everybody's interest to increase the vote. Deputy Wallace deserves great credit and praise for this legislation.</P>
      <P>Government do not have a monopoly on wisdom; on many occasions it can be found in the Opposition.  A former leader of the Fine Gael Party, James Dillon, said one can frequently achieve more in Opposition than in Government. I suspect that might be true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is part of a general process of electoral reform.  In the last five years a number of measures have been introduced to change the procedures under which elections are run.  The primary objective of those Bills was to increase the number of people who vote.  The reform in this legislation is much needed by one sector of the electorate.  There is an urgency that it be passed by the Oireachtas and I am delighted the Government has been so co-operative in this regard, particularly this evening.</P>
      <P>Election turnouts are interesting.  In six of the last seven elections the number of people who voted reduced in each election.  There is an underlying trend and message in that for politicians and the Oireachtas.  In 1977, 76.3 per cent of the electorate voted while in 1992, 68.4 per cent voted.  Only one election bucked that trend.  The underlying trend is a continuing reduction in voter turnout at elections and that fact must be confronted by politicians.  We can either assume the attitude of some churches, which decide they will not address the issue of participation in the church, or we can address the issue.  We can bury our heads in the sand and say it has always been thus and we will continue on that road or we will look at ways of increasing voter participation to equal the European averages which this country has not achieved. This Bill is a small but useful step in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Henry that we should be prepared to look at other voting systems.  There is also the issue of disabled people not just voting but being involved in politics.  There are few people with a physical disability involved in the political system and that is a loss for politics.  The main reason they do not participate is probably that we meet late and in inaccessible places.  The <Col N="1224" /> embargo, as it were, was broken by the former Senator Crowley.  He is a shining example for people who believe they have a contribution to make in politics, not just in terms of the agenda for disabled people but in terms of the general good of the country.  Political parties must do as much as possible to advance not only the cause of people with disabilities but also their participation in mainstream party politics.  Politics is where the centre of power lies and until that changes that is the area where people with disabilities should be.  I urge more people with disabilities to get involved in the political system and I hope this legislation will send the right signal to them.</P>
    <P>In 1992, there were 3,933 electors on the special voters list; that figure decreased to 3,293 in 1995. That demonstrates that more and more people with disabilities are not registering for the special voters list.  There is something wrong and we must change it.  By extending the postal ballot to people with disabilities we will encourage them to get involved in the election process and that is useful.  There is also the issue for local authorities of selecting polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users.  That too is a welcome development.  Many buildings being built at present will be used as polling stations in ten or 20 years time.  They should be approved by the National Rehabilitation Board before they are put out to tender or constructed.  I hope this problem will be reduced as more public buildings become accessible to wheelchair users.</P>
    <P>The count is the dynamic centre of politics. Those of us who have stood in elections know the atmosphere of a count, and people with a disability should be able to gain an appreciation of that.  A certain percentage of disabled people are employed in the public service.  What percentage of the staff who count votes are disabled?  I ask the Minister to address this issue. Some councils are achieving great results employing the disabled but others are not.  This is an issue the Department of the Environment needs to continue to push, not just for the disabled but for society.</P>
    <P>I and another Member of this House had the great honour of observing the Russian presidential elections.  Senator Henry stole my thunder when she referred to the mobile ballot. It is a unique system which has always been operated throughout Eastern Europe.  If a voter cannot make it on the day, they ring the polling station and ask them to send out the ballot paper which arrives at four or five o'clock.  Political representatives can accompany the polling officer.  If someone was in hospital, five or six parties may visit to see if the system is fair.  This system works well in Russia.  We should consider using it to ensure that people are given every possible opportunity to vote.  Under the Russian system, if I was in the constituency of Dublin South-West, wanted to vote in a referendum or a presidential or European election, and was in Cork on business on that day, I could vote because a voter can be registered in a constituency they are not living in.  Obviously, this system could not work for the 41 Dáil <Col N="1225" /> constituencies but it could work in a presidential election or a referendum, as Senator Ormonde said.  Under that system more people could have voted in the bail referendum.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Wallace on this timely legislation.  We should pass it with a degree of urgency as the new register will be created in February.  This will allow people who were previously on the special voter's list to be put on the postal ballot list.  I and this side of the House welcome this provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The right to exercise the franchise is the most fundamental right of every citizen.  Deputy Wallace must be congratulated and commended for an initiative which should not have been needed at this stage of enlightenment in society.  She is ensuring that this fundamental right to which we are all entitled to under the Constitution can now be exercised without any inhibition or disqualification.  I do not suggest there was ever a deliberate disqualification, but simply the disqualification of disability and lack of suitability of some polling stations.  Deputy Wallace's initiative and the Government's and all parties' response to it comes at a time when the disabled community is more determined to be seen as a full and equal partner in democracy and in the exercise of their rights at every level.</P>
      <P>Colleagues will be aware of the Centre for Independent Living.  I have been privileged as the nominee of the Irish Wheelchair Association to be closely involved with that movement in endeavouring, belatedly, to ensure that their right to be independent and to exercise their functions will be recognised, respected and vindicated.  It is appropriate that this legislation is introduced at a time when that movement is gaining strength and support throughout the community.</P>
      <P>We all know many young people who have been disabled as the result of serious accidents&mdash; unfortunately, over the Christmas holiday many others may be disabled &mdash; and old people suffer natural disability.  What they have in common is their fulfilment as citizens and their individual dignity in exercising fundamental rights.  I cannot adequately express what this legislation means to them.  Many of them have contacted me to express how they feel fulfilled by this recognition and the provision that they can do what the rest of us do as a matter of routine.</P>
      <P>As Senator Hayes said, in the past the Oireachtas and its elected representatives were not aware of the disability we imposed on this special section of our community.  We did not offer access to the House and give the disabled the opportunity to see what was being done in their name, and to listen to and criticise what was not being adequately done in their name.  This was not done deliberately but rather through a lack of awareness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a happy coincidence that I entered the Seanad as the nominee of the Irish Wheelchair Association at the same time as Senator Brian Crowley.  What any of us do, say or suggest is minuscule in comparison to what his presence here represented and the awareness it stimulated. <Col N="1226" /> As Senator Hayes said, the capacity he demonstrated has stimulated a magnificent response throughout the community and has enhanced the rest of us in recognising the special rights and capacity of those who suffer from disability.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that Senator Ormonde, who has considerable experience and was in consultation with Deputy Wallace on this Bill, is representing our position on it in the Seanad.  She expressed a comprehensive and enlightened view on our behalf.  Men delude themselves that they are concerned with the macro affairs of the economy, the development of infrastructure, education and international negotiation.  Women representatives have focused on the vital human dimension of recognition, which we have overlooked, to the great advantage of representation in public life and to those who have a special right to be recognised.  For this reason I am happy that Senator Ormonde promoted the Bill on our behalf in the House tonight.  It is significant that women in public life have taken such an active role in this matter.  The actions of the Government and Opposition in both Houses and the Minister's enlightened speech will take this issue a stage further, and further stages remain to be achieved.</P>
    <P>I like the suggestion in the Bill that facilities must be provided at every polling station or, alternatively, at a polling station designated for that purpose nearby.  This is a correct, practical and simple provision although it may not be as easy to achieve in some cases as it appears.  The proposers of the Bill and the Government should be commended on the effective consultation and co-ordination process which took place in light of the provision that the returning officer must draw up a list of polling stations which do not meet the criteria.</P>
    <P>This is unusual and significant because it means people will be notified in advance that a facility is not available but they can exercise their franchise, as hitherto, in their homes.  Most disabled people would prefer to go to polling stations in their wheelchairs and be seen to do what everybody else is doing there rather than exercise their franchise in their homes because, in that case, they are not as independent as they want to be.  They want to be seen to vote in the same way as all other citizens.  We should make a constant and determined effort to ensure that, in the shortest possible time, every polling station meets these requirements.</P>
    <P>There is also the social aspect, when individuals go to vote and meet people on the way.  They will not meet as many people as they did in the past due to an initiative, which perhaps was not as enlightened as it was intended, taken by Fianna Fáil in Government at the suggestion of the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, to prevent tribal confrontations at polling stations.</P>

      <P>Some people say they miss the colour and excitement at the polling station. Senator Hayes made an interesting point that the <Col N="1227" /> number of people exercising their franchise is declining.  Politics is an important expression of instinct, theatrics, competition and involvement.  I do not suggest the reason fewer people are voting is the lack of colour and excitement but I am not sure it has not had some small effect on the overall decline in votes.</P>
      <P>I am happy the Bill also applies to the elderly. If they are disabled they should not be discriminated against just because they are elderly.  They must be treated in the same fashion as others.  This ensures that will be the case.  The provision of basic facilities in polling stations is also essential.  It may be necessary to deal with this aspect by ministerial regulation.  I am not sure it can be left to presiding officers because their notion of what is, or is not, adequate may vary.  It is important to have standard facilities, such as tables, to ensure votes can be cast fully and freely in all designated polling stations.</P>
      <P>A number of people is so badly disabled that they are unable to use a pen or pencil, although they are not disabled in any other sense.  Their mental and intellectual capacity more often than not more than compensates and we are all aware of brilliant people who have achieved greatness through disability.  However, they may not have the capacity to write and I presume the position which obtained hitherto will still obtain, that they can communicate their preference to a trusted friend or family member.</P>
      <P>Given the experience of other countries, we almost appear to impose disability in another sense on people who cannot conveniently vote on a particular date, such as commercial travellers or people working in hospitals, etc.  This should be examined to ensure everyone is able to exercise his or her franchise.  Some people will be temporarily disabled and there is no reason people in hospital, even for a short time, cannot vote.  It can be done in Russia and, as Senator Hayes said, they are relatively new to democracy.</P>
      <P>As I said over the years, the only distinction between totalitarian states, which were sometimes held up as examples although I did not share that view, and us was that they were not free to exercise what we take for granted.  For example, people were not free to move outside their countries.  However, they are now free to vote and if Russia, Hungary and Poland, after such a short experience of democracy, can arrange voting facilities for people who are temporarily disabled in hospital, I hope that will be the next stage of reform in Ireland.  It must be possible.  Nobody can anticipate whether they will be in hospital at a particular time but people still have the right and obligation as citizens to vote.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as a significant move in that direction and I again congratulate Deputy Wallace, Senator Ormonde, the Minister and the Government for their response to it.  We are not just recognising disabled people who want to live independently but also enhancing ourselves by recognising them.  For that, we owe thanks to them also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is timely given the recent publication of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  The foreword to the report states:</P>
      <P>We, as people with disabilities, are shouldering our responsibility to ensure that disabled people are included as full citizens in Ireland.  It is now time that everyone else joins this process so that we can all live and participate together as equal members of society.  Our democracy has been in place for over 70 years and, proverbially, familiarity breeds contempt.  We do not have long queues in front of our polling stations, as was the case in the 1994 South African elections.  We are lucky if we get more than a trickle as was demonstrated during the recent bail referendum.  Yet, while the vast majority takes their vote for granted, there are still those in our society who are disenfranchised and effectively excluded from full citizenship.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is designed to further enfranchise people with disability and enable them to exercise one of their most fundamental rights on the same basis and under the same conditions as other citizens.  I recognise, of course, that there is currently a provision for people with a disability or long-term illness to be entered on the special voters' list.  There are also arrangements whereby voters who are mobile, but who have difficulty gaining access to a particular polling station, can arrange to vote at another station.  This has been mentioned already.</P>
      <P>However, these provisions, while welcome, are cumbersome and serve to reinforce the separateness of people with a disability; neither do they take account of short-term disabilities. The proposals in the Bill refer specifically to polling stations but, if implemented, they would also have the effect of making our schools wheelchair accessible, since the vast majority of polling stations are located in school premises.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recently published a report which particularly addressed the issue of access.  In 1994 Democratic Left made a submission to the commission which, among other things, urged that all public buildings be made fully accessible to the disabled.  There is general agreement on the desirability of that objective, yet we seem as far away from realising it as ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent poll conducted by my colleague, Cllr. John Ryan, in Limerick found that 75 per cent of public buildings in Limerick are inaccessible for people with disabilities.  Among the buildings surveyed were those housing public services, major shops financial institutions and hotels, as well as a random selection of churches, pubs and smaller shops.  The survey found that 80 per cent of entrances to all buildings had obstacles, such as heavy doors, narrow doorways, door saddles and narrow opening angles, while 56 per cent lacked necessary ramp entrances.  Of multi-storey buildings, 72 per cent lacked a lift while just 20 per cent had wheelchair accessible toilets.  To add to the obstacles faced by disabled citizens, over <Col N="1229" /> the period of the survey an average of 80 per cent of parking spaces provided for disabled drivers were occupied by able bodied drivers.  That practice is very widespread in our towns.  These figures are alarming but I do not believe they are unique.  I am sure a similar study in Cork or Dublin would reveal the same results.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of our democracy depends on the fullest participation by all those entitled to vote.  Until we have ensured that all those who wish to vote are enabled to do so in as unbureaucratic and convenient manner as possible, our democracy will remain less than perfect.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill, which is an important first step in securing an equal franchise for people with disabilities.  Ultimately, our aim should be that all polling stations and public buildings are fully accessible, that local authorities have a statutory obligation to secure such access and are accountable for any failure to do so rather than simply placing the onus on returning officers or on the custodians of individual buildings.</P>
    <P>This Bill, of its nature, is limited to considerations of voting access but the right of people with a disability to enjoy full and equal citizenship requires much more.  In particular, it is vital that the forthcoming equal status legislation compel those in charge of public buildings to make them fully accessible, and that stiff penalties be imposed on able-bodied people using facilities intended for the disabled.  We will not achieve a society based on equality until the rights of people with disabilities are moved to the top of the political agenda.</P>
    <P>On sections 2 and 3, a lot of responsibility is put on the returning officer.  There might have to be a reference to the local authority in section 3 because of the onus being placed on the returning officer.  That might be addressed in the reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the welcome for this Bill. It is the kind of Bill that, when it comes before us, one wonders why it was not thought of a long time ago.  I welcome the Bill in itself and in its contribution in raising the profile of the disabled in society as a whole.  It improves our alertness to the plight of the disabled.  We have not discriminated against the disabled through malice aforethought but through no forethought, inadvertence and thoughtlessness.  It is only by specifically addressing concrete issues of this type that we will catch up with the neglect we have inflicted on the disabled through mindlessness over the years.</P>
      <P>I am not unduly bothered by the details of the Bill.  We have had discussions from professional politicians on the details and I am glad that we are getting out of the rut of the ritual of polling day, which means that we cannot think of other ways to conduct the poll.  This is a question of willpower.  If we are determined to do it, it is not beyond the intellectual resources of this civilisation to find ways of coping with what are relatively simple problems.  If we do not want to do this, we can think of any number of reasons it cannot be done.  It is a question of political will driving this through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> That is why my one reservation is that there are such phrases in the Bill as &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;.  I am not suggesting that it is intended here but that phrase is an escape route in our constitutional ideology.  Here it is meant positively but there should be stronger phraseology here.  Who decides what is &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; in any given circumstance?  Will local councillors or returning officers decide?  This section could be toughened up.  Instead of endeavouring to do things, it should be made clear that unless an absolutely unanswerable case can be made against doing those things, they are expected to be done.</P>
    <P>The ethos of the Bill is admirable as far as it goes but it should be toughened.  There should be deadlines to ensure that average practice conforms to best practice very quickly.  Lists of best practice constituencies should be drawn up and shown to those which are lagging.  It is a question of willpower once the decision is taken.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy made a reasonable point about people who have to work on polling days and why they cannot have arrangements made without the process of democracy being subverted.  I like Senator Hayes's suggestion that the design for any new public building should gain the approval of the NRB.  There are still a huge number of public buildings, and Senator Sherlock was correct to mention schools, which were obviously designed with no thought of the disabled in mind.  The higher the profile that perspective can achieve for new and old buildings the better.</P>
    <P>In itself and in its symbolic value, I welcome the Bill and congratulate Deputy Mary Wallace and all those who have worked so hard to bring it to fruition.</P>

It is timely as we approach a general election and it is good it has come so far.  It is workable legislation which will be easily implemented and should be in readiness for the electoral register which will be published in February of next year.</P>
      <P>There is concern about the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for returning officers.  There should not be any difficulty.  The returning officer, as far as practicable, should ensure an accessible building is provided.  This is the thrust of the Bill which should be implemented without difficulty.  Local authorities should also work to ensure accessible buildings are made available.  I welcome the fact that access to the count will be available.  If people have access to polling stations to vote, they should also have access to the count.</P>
      <P>I congratulate and thank Deputy Wallace, the Minister of State, the Government and all those who contributed.  This Bill will be welcomed by those who, on behalf of the disabled, have promoted the aims incorporated in it.</P>

      <P>The words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; are contained in a number of sections in the Bill because in small towns and villages it may not be possible to provide a suitable building.  If a decision were made to take a polling station out of a village or area, there would be a reaction to <Col N="1232" /> put it mildly.

It states, &ldquo;The returning officer shall, where practicable, give public notice of all polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users not later than the eighth day before polling day&rdquo;.

However, I cannot understand why it is stated that notice must be given of inaccessible polling stations.  It must be assumed that disabled people confined to wheelchairs exercise their voting rights.  If notice is given that polling stations are inaccessible, what alternative is provided?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled this motion because of the flooding which occurs in the Long Bridge area of Dunmanway.  This problem has been going on for the last 30 years.  Thankfully the houses have not been affected by flooding this year but heavy rain always leads to an unsatisfactory situation.  Houses, business premises, private property, roads and the adjoining school are flooded when the river Bandon bursts its banks.  This poses a health hazard for the people of the area.  I have seen water flowing through houses in Long Bridge. People can look out their back window and see the river rising.  Some of them have poles in their gardens with a mark on them and when the water rises above the mark they put out sand bags. Much damage has been caused to houses over the years.  Money was allocated for remedial work a year ago.  Will those involved in the planning of this work get on with the job so that we will have no more flooding?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  Following the passing of the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995, a list of some nine areas which suffer periodical localised flooding was drawn up for immediate priority consideration for drainage schemes.  The flooding of Dunmanway was among these first nine areas and the Commissioners of Public Works have been involved since then in the investigation of the causes of the flooding.  The flooding in Dunmanway has received speedy attention and the commissioners have been involved in devising means of alleviating the problems encountered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of information I might mention that one of the criteria for selecting areas for inclusion <Col N="1234" /> on the first priority list was that the commissioners had previous knowledge of flooding in an area and had information to deal with the matter.  In this regard, the flooding in Dunmanway was very well known to the commissioners as they had undertaken an investigation into the problem and prepared a report on the matter on behalf of Cork County Council in 1990-91.  However, due to the demands on their staffing resources in 1995, the commissioners appointed a firm of consulting engineers to undertake the necessary investigations and to prepare a preliminary report outlining a range of options for dealing with the problem and making recommendations on the one most favoured.</P>
    <P>It should be mentioned that the incorporation of the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989, into Irish law amended the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to make it a legal requirement for the carrying out of a detailed environmental impact statement for each drainage scheme and for the report to form part of the statutory scheme documentation.</P>
    <P>The 1995 Act also includes this requirement and hence the investigation of flooding problems and the preparation of drainage-flood alleviation proposals for the Dunmanway schemes required that a detailed assessment of the existing environmental conditions in the area had to be established in the first instance.  This effectively means that pure engineering proposals could not be finalised until their impact on the existing environment could be determined.  As the assessment of existing conditions normally requires at least a full annual cycle to be measured this meant that the progress of scheme designs and options were slower than originally envisaged.  Indeed, in that regard, the presence of major areas of environmental and ecological interest in the Bandon valley immediately downstream of the Long Bridge in Dunmanway, the discovery of protected species and habitats in the area in question and the recognition of the Bandon river as an important salmonid river all limited the engineering possibilities available.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, the commissioners are advancing with proposals which primarily involve the construction of embankments and back drain systems upstream and downstream of the Long Bridge, together with the mobilisation of three additional arches in the bridge and associated excavations.  Because of the competing demands on available Exchequer resources and the public capital programme, capital investment projects, such as localised drainage-flood relief schemes are required to undergo assessment to prove their economic merits.  Accordingly, a cost benefit analysis of the Dunmanway scheme proposals needed to be carried out before they could be passed beyond the preparatory stage.  I am happy to say that such an assessment has now been undertaken which shows a positive return for the proposed works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> A design for this scheme is well advanced and preparation of scheme documentation is nearing completion with a view to bringing the scheme to public exhibition stage early in the new year and getting to works stage in April 1997.  The statutory public exhibition of the scheme documentation will provide opportunities for all interested parties to comment on the scheme proposals and to submit such observations to the commissioners for their consideration.  The commissioners are required to consider these observations and, where practicable, to have regard to them in the scheme design after which the scheme has to be submitted to the Minister for Finance for statutory confirmation.</P>
    <P>Works on the Bandon river drainage scheme will commence once all the statutory and other procedures have been complied with and the necessary funds for works will be met from the Vote for the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>The case for Castlebar swimming pool has been well made.  The pool is one of a number built in the seventies and early eighties and both the pools and the machinery are outdated.  The Castlebar pool is a basic swimming facility and to repair the plant would be to throw good money after bad.  As the Minister of State is aware, Castlebar is the county town of Mayo and has a large catchment area.  The swimming pool requires immediate refurbishment and I ask the Minister of State to move the project forward. I understand the contract document are with the Department and I urge that they be approved speedily.  I thank the Minister of State for the efficient and expeditious way in which he has dealt with this matter in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  Mayo County Council submitted detailed drawings and specifications to the Department of the Environment on 2 September 1996 for major refurbishment works, estimated to cost £1.7 million, at the Castlebar pool.  These works include major repairs to the general fabric of the building, replacement of the mechanical, heating and electrical services and <Col N="1236" /> the upgrading of the water filtration and disinfection systems.  The proposed works also include a number of new facilities, including a learners' pool, a sauna and a multi-purpose room. Additional information requested by the Department in relation to the electrical services has been received from the county council and the contract documents are currently being examined by the Department.</P>
      <P>There is a provision of £3.5 million in the Department's Estimates for 1997 for the swimming pool programme.  While this represents a significant increase on the 1996 provision of £2 million, the increased allocation for 1997 will have to meet expenditure on projects already under construction or projects fully approved and on which work is expected to start in 1997. Accordingly, the scope available to release new projects in 1997 will remain limited.</P>
      <P>In allocating funds to particular projects, regard must be had to the capital costs of such projects in the context of the overall capital funds available for the programme.  New pools cost over £2 million and major refurbishment works to existing facilities can cost over £1 million.  Each project must be considered in the context of the competing demands of other local authority projects for the limited funds available and their cases can be equally compelling.  Having regard to all these factors, it is not possible to say at this stage when a firm financial commitment can be given to the funding of the proposed works at the Castlebar pool.</P>
