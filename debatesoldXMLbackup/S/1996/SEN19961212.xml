      <P>I have notice from Senator Kelleher that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to make a statement on the present status of the CIÉ site at Horgan's Quay, Cork; and if there has been any interest shown by people in purchasing and developing it.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to respond to a request from Clondalkin Chamber of Commerce concerning the need for the CCTV surveillance system to be constructed in Clondalkin village and that it be given priority in terms of her Department's budget and spending allocations for 1997.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to give a commitment for the construction of phase 2 of Castleknock community college.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Kelleller's and Senator Hayes's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator McGennis may give notice on another day of the matters she wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Item 1, the Child Sex Tours Bill, has been scheduled simply to allow Senator Henry to withdraw it as a great deal of it was incorporated in the legislation passed yesterday.  Item 2 is a technical amendment made by the Dáil to the Control of Horses Bill, so it should not take long. Item 3 is Statements on the White Paper on Science and Technology, which was requested by Senator Quinn and other Senators.  I propose 20 minutes per speaker, if that is agreeable.  On item 4, the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, I propose 30 minutes per speaker on Second Stage.  Item 3 will conclude at 1 p.m. because I do not want to have too many Statements (Resumed) on the Order Paper.  There will be a sos, item 4 will commence at 2 p.m. and our business will conclude not later than 5 p.m.  If item 4 has not been concluded at that time it will continue at a later date.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed as outlined.  I have read a synopsis of the interim report of the Commission on the Family, which was issued in the last week.  It would be worthwhile if the House could discuss the report in the new year in order to debate in detail the relationship between the family and society, including taxation and all other aspects.  Major changes have taken place in tourism within the last month.  The island of Ireland, North and South, is to be marketed as one unit.  As an item dealing with tourism is on the Order Paper, perhaps before the recess we could debate the major changes in marketing, in the formation of Bord Fáilte and in the selling of the tourism product in the coming year.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to pass on to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs the best wishes of many Protestants in the Northern Ireland for the achievement of success in the peace process.  I regret the hold up caused by the parliamentary arithmetic in Westminster but I hope Sinn Féin will try to understand this problem.  That party is anxious to enter the political arena and this is something which happens in politics.  The IRA activities reported in the newspapers and elsewhere could lead to an outrage before Christmas, as has been widely advertised.  The preliminary movements and transport activities of the IRA have been uncovered in the Border area.  There could be casualties on both sides &mdash; young Catholics could be killed along with the IRA's targets, because <Col N="1115" /> the army is well aware of what it is doing &mdash; and that would be a tragedy.  I appeal to the IRA to think again before doing anything.</P>
      <P>I have a personal suggestion.  The proposals currently going forward to the British Prime Minister are coming from a republican and a Nationalist &mdash; that is, Mr. Adams and Mr. Hume &mdash; so they are excessively green in colour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Leader to put the suggestion to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that they should consider a third element in these talks when formulating proposals.  I will take only a few more seconds, Taoiseach, I mean, a Chathaoirligh.  Many Protestants in the North of Ireland are not Orangemen or members of the Unionist Party. They are held in high regard.  I will not name any of them but you know the people of whom I speak.  It would help a great deal if this element were brought into the preparatory Hume-Adams talks then proposals might be put forward which would be more acceptable than hitherto.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on decentralisation as soon as possible. While we have had many such debates, I am concerned, as are many others, that most jobs are provided in Dublin.  This causes serious social, housing and traffic problems.  It has contributed to the depopulation of rural areas, especially in Border counties where not a single job has been provided in the last number of years.  It is not unreasonable to ask for a debate on job location. It is not correct to say that a company coming into the country decides where to locate its premises.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment largely directs the IDA in these matters.  I request a debate on this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If we allow this trend to continue we will have nothing to sustain those in rural areas but a van load of social welfare money, guarded by the army.  That is not desirable and I request a full and frank debate on this issue.  This phenomenon can no longer described as decentralisation.  Dublin is turning into a concrete jungle.  I ask for an urgent debate on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on refuse and waste disposal.  This is one of the biggest problems facing local authorities and a debate at an early stage would be very useful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening a number of Deputies and Senators from the west attended a seminar by an organisation involved in the development of the west.  We heard some startling statistics on the imbalance in expenditure between the east and west.  I ask for a debate on this issue.  To give an example, many people in Connemara have to boil water for four minutes before they can drink it.  It is barely credible that such a situation exists today.  Very little money has been spent on that region in the past ten years on major infrastructural projects such as the water supply.  I ask the Leader to provide time for a debate on western development and on the difficulties people encounter every day due to the lack of infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to find out whether there are any plans to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the founding of this State next year.  We could have a very interesting debate on the issue just before Christmas and various proposals could be put to the Government.  It is important that we celebrate the founding of this State and that we do so in an appropriate manner which would unite all strands of Irish society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Wright's suggestion about a debate on the report of the Commission on the Family is worthwhile and I will arrange such a debate early in the next session.  He also raised the question of a debate on tourism and I will take item 13 on the Order Paper, Statements on Tourism (Resumed), next Wednesday, 18 December and bring that to a conclusion.  Senator McGowan has also been asking for this debate for some time so I am happy to be able to oblige him.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry asked whether there would be more time if we do not conclude statements on science and technology today.  If it is not concluded today I will put it on the Order Paper again, but if the time allocated today is not availed of then I will not do so.  If it concludes today that is it; if it does not we will take it again. Senator McAughtry made an interesting and constructive contribution and I will forgive him his slip of the tongue.  I will pass on what he said to the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan and Senator Fahey raised the question of a debate on the report on western development which I told the Leader of the Opposition yesterday is very important.  I am more than happy to make time available for that very early in the new session.  If Senator Burke can find some way of framing a motion on refuse and waste disposal we can debate that.  Senator Hayes made a very interesting suggestion that this House could have a commemorative debate on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the State in the next session.  People from all sides of the House would like to contribute to that and I would be very happy to organise it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the order of the Seanad of 8 February 1996 for Committee Stage of the Child Sex Tours Bill, 1995, be discharged and that the Bill is hereby withdrawn.</P>
      <P>I move this motion because the Government accepted my Bill and the Bill introduced by Deputies O'Donoghue and Ryan in the other House.  The Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1996 was passed by this House last night.  That legislation contained the substance of my Bill and there is no longer any need for the Child Sex Tours Bill, 1995 to be on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies Ryan and O'Donoghue for allowing me to incorporate the essence of my Bill into their Bill.  It was fitting that the Bill was passed yesterday, on the 50th anniversary of the founding of UNICEF.  When I told them last night that the Bill had passed during our Presidency of the European Union &mdash; this whole matter is an important topic within the European Union at the moment in view of the atrocities in Europe which we heard of during the summer &mdash; they were most grateful to the House and congratulated us on having passed it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before explaining the subject matter involved, I would first like to touch upon the background to the proposed amendment.  A pair of interconnected amendments, Nos. 30 and 33, are among those agreed in this House on Committee Stage.  I considered it appropriate to amend the major amendment, No. 30, by Report Stage amendment No. 6.  It would also have been appropriate on that Stage to table an amendment to amendment No. 33, otherwise a misalignment between amendments Nos. 6 and 33 would arise. Yesterday I availed of the opportunity in the other House to indicate the need for an amendment to rectify the misalignment between &mdash; I am now using the Dáil numeration &mdash; amendments Nos. 27 and 32.</P>
      <P>The subject matter involved is the duration of horse licences.  Members will recall that, on Committee Stage, the Minister was given powers to opt for licences of less than 12 months duration.  On Report Stage in this House amendment No. 6 extended the Minister's powers to allow multi-year licences.  The legal advice made available to me is that, if the misalignment is not rectified, the fee to accompany any application for periods of 12 months or more can only be the same as one of the fees for any period of less than 12 months.</P>
      <P>I thank Members for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend my congratulations to you, a Chathaoirligh, on taking over this important office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I begin by sincerely thanking my colleagues in Seanad Éireann for the opportunity to have a substantial debate on this crucial issue.  I would especially like to thank two of our colleagues, Senator Quinn who made a contribution to the White Paper from a technology user's perspective and Senator Lee who, through his column in the <Col N="1119" /><i>Sunday Tribune</i>, gave a media airing to this debate, regrettably an all too infrequent occurrence.  It is particularly in longer term policy areas such as science and technology where the implications are profound but rarely of obvious immediate impact, that the Upper House can make a valuable contribution.</P>
    <P>The process of the White Paper began with the reports of the National Economic and Social Council on innovation, growth and competitiveness over 1992 and 1993 and the establishment of the independent Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council.</P>
    <P>The task of the council under the chairmanship of Mr. Dan Tierney, established in February 1994 was to review and make recommendations on science and technology in Ireland and its contribution to innovation and industrial competitiveness.</P>
    <P>There had been, in particular, concern among the scientific community about the level of public funding for research in third level colleges.  There was also concern at the low levels of technological competence in Irish industry and the insufficient attention to research and development and innovation on the agenda of the business sector. Somewhat ironically, these concerns came in the wake of a significant injection of funds into science and technology in Ireland through the EU Structural Funds Programme which began in 1989.</P>
    <P>In the wake of the impact of the Structural Funds Programme, the increasing pace and penetration of technical innovation as a factor in industrial competitiveness, and the wide ranging deliberations of the Tierney committee, I felt it was timely to review the policy and practice behind science, technology and innovation in Ireland and to publish the results in the form of a White Paper.</P>
    <P>In today's debate I do not intend to confine myself to the content of the White Paper because that is, in effect, the culmination of a series of mini debates and issues which it is difficult to encapsulate in one document.  I intend to go over the philosophy behind the need for State involvement in science and technology in terms of the developing nation, to look at Irish science and technology in the wider European and international dimension and to reflect on some of the more important specific aspects and issues that we are addressing.</P>
    <P>In presenting the White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation before the Seanad, it is important to set science and technology in the context of broad national policy for economic development.  The report of the STI Ádvisory Council, or Tierney Report, drew attention to what it considered the lamentable neglect of science and technology issues by national policy-makers over an extended period of time.  Some of these issues had been addressed by a joint Irish/OECD Report in the mid-1960s and some excellent and far-sighted recommendations made. <Col N="1120" /> These might have come to fruition under normal circumstances but for whatever reasons, including the turbulent political situation emerging at that time, effective immediate action did not take place.</P>
    <P>The result was that national science and technology policy remained in a time-warp in Ireland at a period when significant developments were taking place in other European countries, particularly small countries such as Denmark, Norway and Finland.  Our time-warp had a 1950s look to it and was characterised by a heavy concentration of effort and resources on the agricultural sector and related research priorities; very little support for industry-related infrastructure, in particular a failure to develop a strong and effective technological institute geared towards industrial technologies along the lines of similar institutes in Denmark and Finland; and the absence of a research council mechanism for funding academic research.</P>
    <P>It was only with the advent of the European Structural Funds programmes in the late 1980s that a serious effort was made to make up for lost time.  Since these funds were made available from the science and technology sub-programme of the industry operational programme, they were required to have a strong industrial focus.</P>
    <P>The policy thinking underlying the various initiatives in this programme ran along these lines: industry needs support in developing and using new or appropriate technologies but we lack suitable research institutes either in the public or private sector, the National Microelectronics Centre in Cork being a notable exception.  Establishing such research centres from scratch was ruled out as too ambitious although the Spanish and Portuguese were much more adventurous in their use of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Instead it was decided to attempt to make use of existing expertise in the third-level colleges as back-up for industry.  This seemingly risky strategy led to the birth of the programmes in advanced technology in the universities and the technology centres in the regional technical colleges.  Despite early misgivings I believe these initiatives have been largely successful and indeed the White Paper has recommended their continuation and improvement.</P>
    <P>The new policy included other mechanisms for encouraging industrial innovation, including a major invigoration of the existing under-utilised and ineffectually promoted scheme to provide grants for R&amp;D in industry, the introduction of placement schemes for encouraging companies to employ technical graduates, subsidised technology audits in companies and efforts to promote technology transfer from outside the country.</P>
    <P>While industrial innovation and industry-college collaboration have benefited substantially from Structural Funds, another aspect has drawn criticism that it has suffered from chronic under-funding <Col N="1121" /> over the years &mdash; support for academic research.  This area has generated sometimes heated policy debates in the past; academics have argued that they get a very raw deal here by comparison with other countries, while others including for example the Culliton Report, have claimed that Ireland does not need to do any fundamental research as a small and relatively undeveloped economy.</P>
    <P>We do not have any research council mechanism to fund academic research projects as do most other industrialised countries.  Since 1978 various bodies, from the National Board for Science and Technology to Eolas and now Forbairt, have operated a scheme to support such research.  Until the last few years the annual value of this scheme was less than £1 million.  Arising from the Tierney Report and the White Paper this has been increased to £2 million, although to put this in some sort of context the UK Research Councils would have something of the order of £1 billion to disburse; clearly there are great differences between the countries, so these figures can do no more than create an overall impression.</P>
    <P>The position of academic research here is complicated by other factors.  The Department of Education decided in 1988 to abolish all support for post-graduate students.  Only some £2 million is available on an annual basis to fund equipment and buildings for all seven universities, resulting in a cumulative equipment shortfall in the colleges estimated by the Higher Education Authority to be at least £50 million.  At the same time, there is funding for research and equipment going into the colleges through a number of avenues, including the Department of Education and Higher Education Authority grants, national and international, especially EU, programmes and from private sector funding.</P>
    <P>All these factors were recorded in the Tierney Report and reasonably modest proposals were made to redesss them.  The White Paper responded by calling for more funds as resources permit and for the relevant Government Departments to work more closely together while recognising that funding from the EU Framework Programme, for example, has to some extent filled the vacuum in the past.  The White Paper has also endorsed the existing policy emphasis on promoting industrial innovation and made concrete proposals for strengthening this area.</P>
    <P>The White Paper aims to bring Ireland more into line with economic and industrial policies world wide.  We are virtually alone in failing to appreciate the profound link between national science and technology performance and economic growth. That link is now becoming more important as the developed world moves beyond the industrial society to the information age.</P>
    <P>Recent evidence from the OECD indicates that while the manufacturing sector has almost universally lost jobs there are certain pockets of <Col N="1122" /> growth, particularly in the high technology sector. Future employment will most likely be in high technology manufacturing or services which use such equipment to change the nature of existing products or to generate totally new ones.  Over the past decade it is clear that countries where manufacturing employment increased or suffered the smallest loss were those undergoing the most rapid structural change involving an increased share of manufacturing employment in high technology, high wage, high skill, science based industries.</P>
    <P>A number of &lsquo;new fundamentals&rsquo; alongside the more established macroeconomic indicators for European Monetary Union and Maastricht are now influencing science, technology and innovation policies everywhere and will need attention in Ireland if the momentum of growth and development we are currently enjoying is to be sustained.  Some of these &lsquo;new fundamentals&rsquo; which will influence science and technology policy and investment decisions in the future are international and outside the control of national governments.  Others are concerned with the performance of national economies and can be influenced by national initiatives.</P>
    <P>All indicators point to a rapid increase in the knowledge base of world economies, an increase which is closely associated with declining prices for information processing, the convergence of communications and computer technology and a rapid expansion in international electronic networking &mdash; the emergence of the digital economy.  These developments improve considerably the position of less favoured and geographically peripheral and underdeveloped regions as well as providing a completely new context for the debate on regional science and technology disparities.  This raises questions about the future performance of economies such as Ireland's, in particular the capability of Irish owned firms and the access of SMEs to new information, technology and markets.</P>
    <P>Access to the global knowledge base is not automatic.  There are entry barriers.  Lack of connections will mean exclusion.  There are, for example, significant implications for the education and training sectors if there is to be ready access to information and communications technologies.  The status of our communications infrastructure is crucial for access to the international knowledge base.</P>
    <P>As a result of these developments, information and knowledge based concepts of economic development are emerging, concepts which focus on how knowledge is generated, transferred, exchanged and transformed, and on the economic implications of such activity.  The role of knowledge and information in the organisation and conduct of economic activities will fundamentally alter the form and structure of economic growth.  However, there may be the prospect of an increase in growth differentials between those who can and cannot connect easily and usefully to the digital economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> In common with most developed nations, Ireland has ambitions for a significant share of this emerging post-industrial and knowledge based world economy.  We have in place most of the basic prerequisites for this &mdash; a modern communications infrastructure, a mature and internationally respected university system and a young and well educated workforce which is highly mobile and adaptive.  There are, however, some serious weaknesses to be addressed, especially the low level of skills and technology in the indigenous sectors of industry, the relatively slow emergence of a strong services sector in the economy generally and more especially, our very weak national system of innovation.</P>
    <P>A national system of innovation is the term used to describe the complexity of culture and interaction among the actors who produce, distribute and apply knowledge in an economy and which ultimately determines the innovation performance of national firms.  The overall performance of an economy depends not so much on how its various institutions &mdash; embracing the laws and rules concerning patents, incentives and culture for continuous education and training, patterns of co-operation between social partners and so forth &mdash; and formal organisations, firms, research institutes, universities etc., perform individually but on how well they interact with each other as elements of a collective system of knowledge creation, distribution and use and the general culture of the system.</P>
    <P>Different sections of the White Paper examine each of the broad elements of Ireland's system of innovation: the enterprise sector, the higher education sector, the public research sector and the role of the State in funding and supporting science, technology and innovation.  Few will have read all of the NESC Report, <i>Ireland in a Comparative Institutional Perspective</i>, prepared by Lars Mjoset, although anybody interested in national policy formulation should at least look at, but his analysis is centred around this concept. He argues that Ireland suffers from a weak national system of innovation.</P>
    <P>A common feature of all innovation systems &mdash; regional, national and transnational &mdash; is the emphasis on the systemic nature of the innovation process.  Firms rarely innovate alone. Constant interaction and co-operation between the different functions of the firm and between the firm and its external economic and political environment, leads to continuous learning and better exploitation of available knowledge.</P>
    <P>The new world view of the underlying processes of innovation and economic growth has profound implications for policy makers everywhere.  Its significance for the European Union, whose relative economic position has weakened over the past decade, is particularly pertinent.  The European economy is characterised by a high level of structural &lsquo;technological unemployment&rsquo; because of its <Col N="1124" /> comparative neglect of knowledge-intensive sectors.  The Commissioner for Science, Research and Development has highlighted the European Union's principal weakness, brought to light by a series of analyses, as lying in the fact that the economy suffers from an innovation deficit.</P>
    <P>In order to monitor and attempt to regulate the dynamic system of knowledge development and acquisition which is driving the emerging economic order, the traditional portfolio of economic performance indicators must be supplemented by a range of knowledge indicators which provide policy makers with information on such key dimensions of knowledge as: (i) knowledge stock &mdash; its magnitude and availability; (ii) knowledge flows and circulation &mdash; both disembodied and embodied in human resources; (iii) effectiveness of knowledge sharing, its conversion and diffusion; and (iv) economic impact of knowledge sharing and transfer.</P>
    <P>A second priority is a comprehensive reappraisal of education and training in the light of the realisation that learning is an essential part of living and not just a means to an end.  New motivations for learning, new ways to reward learning experiences and new modes of delivering learning are required if economies are to accelerate their progress towards knowledge based economies and ultimately address the endemic problem of long-term unemployment and its attendant social marginalisation.</P>
    <P>These are difficult concepts whose significance is increasingly recognised.  It is only recently that countries have begun to make operative the national system of innovation model, taking it from its conceptual form and particularising it to their own country.  By elaborating on their national system of innovation countries are able to come to a greater understanding of the knowledge flows within their economies and the inter-linkages between different institutions. Some of the countries which have given attention to the process include Canada, Finland, Denmark, Netherlands, Austria, New Zealand and Australia.</P>
    <P>Ireland's White Paper seeks to instigate a similar process here.  My Department, through the office of science and technology, is also undertaking a detailed survey of existing linkages between the major players in the national system of innovation with a view to proposing further concrete actions that might be taken to address the manifold problems identified.</P>
    <P>In discussing the role of technology in economic development, many commentators have noted, for example, the pervasive nature of electronics, the rapid advances in biotechnology and the impact which new technologies have on so many aspects of our lives.  When the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council was established in 1994, it was an uneasy awareness of the pace, scale and impact of these changes which was at the back of people's minds. That uneasy feeling is at the heart of our <Col N="1125" /> frequently negative attitude to things scientific.  It is worthwhile, therefore, when one wishes to consider the future impact of technological change, to look back at trends in the past to see if any lessons may be learned and also to reflect on the past in an attempt to chart a course for the future.</P>
    <P>Technological development has been in progress since man first started to use tools.  The rate of change, however, has become dramatically increased in the last two centuries.  The introduction of steam power in the late 18th century was followed by a widespread mechanisation of production during the 19th century.  The common use of electric power opened up huge consumer markets in the period 1890 to 1940 and, in the last 50 years, we have seen the electronic revolution at its most dramatic with the arrival of electronics and its most important offspring, the computer.</P>
    <P>For countries trying to establish a vibrant industrial base, this has meant a realisation that the major path to prosperity is to be able to convert scientific and technologically-based innovations into products and get them on to world markets.  The ability to undertake this conversion quickly and effectively is the mark of a successful modern economy and is the goal which we must set ourselves.  In the fastest growing economies it can been seen that the proportion of industry based on high technology products is critical.  These are firms in computers, software, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, etc., and they are the technology producers after whom all others must follow.  Although this sector of the economy is small in many countries, it has been shown that it can act as a driver of technology change into less advanced sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>In Ireland our major technology producers tend to be multinationals, a point to which I will return later.  A central part of what we must achieve in this country in technology terms is to firmly link indigenous industry into these technology producers so that business opportunities associated with new products and processes can be transferred and the skills of many Irish firms may be enhanced.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by some historians that science and technology are two separate things which have developed distinctly and independent of each other.  This view proposes that the scientific community is concerned with observation and discovery and the technologists are concerned with application and the working device.  This approach may have been appropriate in the 19th century but today these boundaries have been almost completely eroded.  In practice, it is becoming more difficult to distinguish research from experimental development. Japanese cars, for example, are on the market in two years from design stage.  This is also clear in the biosciences where today's basic research can lead to tomorrow's product.  This places increasing pressure on companies to be <Col N="1126" /> continuously aware of the need to conduct research and development and to innovate.</P>
    <P>A second major issue is the availability of skills. A considerable upgrading in the knowledge and skills of school leavers and graduates will be required to ensure that this country can avail of the possible technological opportunities.  Last year's White Paper on Education also lays emphasis on this area.  All school leavers should have at least a basic understanding of science and technology.  At third level the students produced should be well trained in research and development techniques and the course material which they have gone through should provide them with a suitable basis for a career in industry. To continue this development, the business sector must be encouraged to articulate its needs clearly to ensure there is an effective feedback to the education system.</P>
    <P>The industry base in Ireland is predominantly populated by small firms and is also broadly split between a technologically sophisticated multinational group and a less active indigenous sector.  The Tierney report referred to over 3,800 indigenous companies, employing 105,000 people, and producing an output of £2.8 billion.  This compares with a foreign sector employing 88,000 people producing £6.1 billion.  The dichotomy between high and low level performers is reflected in the different levels of research and development and innovative activity which these different groups undertake.  This division is becoming less dramatic, however, and a central focus of our science and technology policy must be to close the gap between our domestic firms and their international competitors.</P>
    <P>While there are undoubted deficiencies in Irish firms, it is heartening to note that business expenditure on research and development has been increasing at a dramatic pace in recent years, up to 17 per cent per annum.  One quarter of Irish companies perform research and development on a continuous basis and just under half were buying in technology in the form of equipment, licences or specialist skills.  As indigenous firms are smaller and larger firms have the potential to use their size to employ technology more effectively, it is clear that Irish indigenous firms face difficult challenges.  These include a low level of technology, a low commitment of technology development and low levels of innovation and entrepreneurship.  While size of firm is not the only consideration, it is important that the thrust of our actions must be to help firms to either achieve a scale that will allow them to be able to become technology performers, for example, by working together, or to become sophisticated enough to be successful in technology niche areas.  The undoubted success of Irish firms in the software sector is an excellent example of this latter approach.</P>
    <P>It remains the firm's responsibility to build its own innovative capability, although to do this, we must accept it is important for the State to provide assistance, especially where the cost and <Col N="1127" /> risk factors are high.  This assistance may take a number of forms and, additionally, there must be an effective infrastructure upon which companies can draw.  The White Paper puts in place a range of initiatives to address these problems and to help Irish companies to build their own capabilities to access technology.  The central theme is to assist companies by means of finance, skills and information to address their own needs and to be effective in locating and using the sources of technology which have been made available.</P>
    <P>The availability of skills in Ireland is one of the most important features in the attraction of overseas manufacturing and international services investment.  This is especially the case for high technology projects, including health care, electronics and software development.  In these cases, the availability of chemists, engineers and software graduates is critical.  The importance of these skills is not only at graduate level but also at certificate and diploma levels.</P>
    <P>The third level educational infrastructure in Ireland is the key to the continuing attraction of overseas industry to Ireland for two reasons.  It will continue to provide the skills available for industry and, because Ireland and the education sector are small relative to other countries, we are able to be flexible here.  Colleges can respond quickly to the requirements of industry, they can move quickly to carry out specialised research or development work on behalf of companies and they can tailor training courses for sectors or companies.  The programmes in advanced technology, for example, provide a very valuable asset in the development and co-ordination of university research in specialised areas, in the development of indigenous industry and in the attraction of overseas companies to Ireland.  They clearly demonstrate to a potential investor that they can support them in many ways.  These include the provision of contract research and development, ongoing research collaboration and staff interaction.  As Ireland is small, we can be highly flexible and this always gives a good impression to a potential investor.  Skills availability, educational infrastructure and available facilities also provide assistance and encouragement to companies once they have established here.  As a project develops, companies work more closely with the college infrastructure which contributes to greater embeddedness of business in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This aspect of the science and technology system is often overlooked by those who only see research as worthwhile if a commercial product is in sight or by those who believe that mobile investment is merely the product of grants and tax concessions.  However, as yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i> acknowledges in commenting on our continuing success in winning international investment, a priority must be to ensure that the education system continues to turn out sufficient numbers of graduates with the technical, <Col N="1128" /> computer and other skills needed to remain competitive in this field.  That is a core objective of science and technology policy as enunciated in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I also believe that, unfortunately, the value of research activities and training facilities in Irish universities as a valuable asset to overseas companies is a factor not sufficiently demonstrated by colleges themselves in arguing a case for more research funding.  Universities need to promote their research expertise effectively and develop good and broad contacts with industry.  There are many cases of industry/university collaborative research taking place which contribute to the integration and development of overseas companies in Ireland which need to be constantly highlighted.</P>
    <P>The colleges have witnessed a substantial investment by the State, especially over the last ten years, reflecting the rapid growth in student numbers.  Traditionally, the view has been that such investment is made with the expectation of the production of high qualified students. However, recent experience has shown that colleges perceive and are expected to have a strong and identifiable role in economic and industrial development through the wider exploitation of their expertise and facilities.</P>
    <P>This change is predicated upon the fact that the third level sector has built up an increasing knowledge base which is an important resource. This base cannot only be used to solve industrial problems or create new products, it must also connect with a larger body of researchers overseas.  Research plays a vital role in the maintenance of this knowledge base and is used as a vital training activity for graduates.  To put the issue in a nutshell, companies need to get hold of technology and the third level sector is a vibrant source of such technology.  The problem is how to get that transfer to work effectively.</P>
    <P>There are obvious differences in the way in which colleges and companies operate; they work to different deadlines and perceive different benefits to collaboration; college researchers tend to be driven by self-interest and a desire to see their skills and experience put to broad use; companies tend to see problems as short-term and very specific requiring immediate answers. Despite this difference in approach, I think it is possible and necessary to engender a better flow of business between colleges and companies.</P>
    <P>A Forfás innovation study found that, of the innovative firms interviewed, only about 16 per cent use the third level sector as a source of innovation.  This figure can surely be improved but for that to happen both sides must accept the validity of the other's approach.  Colleges must change their reward systems to recognise that academics who work with industry should be rewarded.  It is unacceptable that industry collaboration is not taken into account in recruitment or promotion procedures as much as academic publications.  Equally, firms should understand the pressures on academic <Col N="1129" /> researchers and set realistic targets for collaborative research.  These issues are addressed in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>A particular issue that I wish to mention is the role of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  These colleges have a special role to play as they are located in areas where they can develop close working relationships with industry.  New legislation will help them interact more effectively with firms and their applied curricula will make this interaction all the more attractive to small firms. The regional technical colleges have great potential to become regionally based centres where firms can come for advice and specialist technology training without the disadvantages of geographic location.  The council of directors of the regional technical colleges has strongly affirmed this role and is committed to working in partnership with Forbairt in bringing forward regionally based actions which will serve to develop their local areas.</P>
    <P>The Irish science and technology system is enormously dependent upon support from the European Union.  To a large extent, discretionary spending on science and technology programmes is financed out of Structural Funds.  In particular, the European Regional Development Fund plays a major role in supporting research and development in Ireland.  EU support under the 1994-99 Industry Operational Programme amounts to £220 million for the research and development subprogramme along with an Exchequer contribution of £45 million.  The programme has a specific mission statement.  It seeks to support the enhancement of competitive advantage in Irish firms through the appropriate use of technology.  It aims to achieve this objective through a portfolio of infrastructure, financial and skills supports attuned to the expressed and anticipated needs of Irish industry, briefly summarised as follows.</P>
    <P>Measure 1 &mdash; the industry R&amp;D initiative &mdash; addresses the need for demand led research and development in industry.  It is open to all firms and allows industry to define and cater for its research and development needs by putting the funding to undertake projects which meet those needs in industry's hands.</P>
    <P>Measure 2 consists of a number of schemes designed to increase the capability of industry, to improve the technological supports provided to industry and to increase third level expertise on key technologies for the development of industry.</P>
    <P>Measure 3 consists of a number of schemes designed to improve the ability of industry to manage the process of research and technological development and to enhance the interaction between higher education institutes and enterprises in that regard.</P>
    <P>Measure 4 provides for research support to the third level sector to tap the vein of innovation and more outward looking perspective which has been adopted by progressive researchers within the colleges.  Measure 4 supports both college <Col N="1130" /> based projects and co-operative projects with industry.</P>
    <P>However, this heavy dependency means we must start to address the post-1999 situation when the current round of funding finishes.  The Tierney report highlighted the importance of Structural Funds in the public financing of science and technology activities in enterprises in particular and pointed out that, with the possibility of reduced European Regional Development Fund support for Ireland post-1999, there must be grounds for concern about the long-term funding of the innovation system. The likelihood is that, as a result of our success in making use of Structural Fund support up to 1999, Ireland will probably cease to be an Objective 1 region at that point.</P>
    <P>The overall approach to the Structural Funds issue post-1999 will be a matter for the Government to decide in due course.  For my own part, however, whatever about the progress we have made on other fronts, the area of innovation is one in which Irish industry still lags far behind our main competitors and where continued support is likely to be necessary, and I hope likely to be forthcoming.  In this respect I would refer to an address entitled <i>Towards a New Regional Policy for the Promotion of Innovation</i> given by Dr. Midel Landabaso of DGXVI at the Innovation Day Conference in November in which he indicated that, given the correlation between innovation and research, training and development efforts with regional economic development, closing the inter-regional research and technology gap in the European Union becomes a precondition for reducing what is referred to as the cohesion gap.  In simple terms, there is a strong argument for Cohesion and Structural Funds to be targeted on strategic activities such as science and technology after the current round.  He went on to say that economic analysis confirms that there is an inter-regional innovation, research and technology gap which is much wider than the so-called cohesion gap, that is, inter-regional disparities in income <i>per capita</i>, productivity and unemployment rates between the developed and the less developed regions of the European Union.  It follows therefore that regional policy should increasingly concentrate its efforts on the promotion of innovation if it is to be successful in creating the conditions for a sustained and sustainable economic development process in less favoured regions.</P>
    <P>I would like to report to the House on progress during the Irish Presidency of the research council, including specific initiatives which we undertook.  Two research councils were scheduled in the Presidency calender, the first on 7 October and the second on 5 December.  All the items on the agenda for the December council had important implications and I would list them as follows.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency has been very conscious of the BSE/CJD concerns all over Europe.  The Presidency has drawn up Council conclusions <Col N="1131" /> which call for an enhanced research effort.  I am pleased to inform the House that last week the Council approved these conclusions, which include funding for a major research action plan on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, include funding for a major research action plan on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, including BSE and human related diseases.  The conclusions take on board the report of the high level scientific group, chaired by the Austrian scientist, Dr. Weissman, which recommended targeted research in specific areas.  I have no doubt that news of new funding for research on this important topic will be welcomed by consumer, agricultural and health interests and will also act to restore consumer confidence.</P>
    <P>I inherited from the last Presidency a proposal from the Commission to provide 700 million ecu in additional funding for the EU's current fourth research framework programme, as part of a review process agreed by research Ministers in 1994.  This was rendered redundant by the ECOFIN council's decision not to breach the Community's financial perspectives.  Nevertheless, the Irish Presidency managed to salvage some of the proposal and what seemed like a non-starter in July has regained centre stage.  We secured political agreement at Council last week that will deliver additional funding for research of 100 million ecu for the period 1997-8.  This will provide the research funding for BSE related diseases to which I referred earlier and for other worthwhile projects.</P>
    <P>The launch of discussions on the European Union's fifth framework programme of research and technological development and demonstration, covering 1998-2002, during the Irish Presidency was a major achievement.  The current fourth framework programme embraces all Community research and technology development programmes with funding of 13.1 billion ecu. Research Ministers engaged in a major debate to decide the guidelines which will serve as the basis for a detailed Commission proposal for the fifth framework programme due next Spring.</P>
    <P>Early in our term, and with the encouragement of the Presidency, the EU Commission published its strategy paper for the fifth framework programme &ldquo;Inventing Tomorrow: Europe's Research at the service of its people&rdquo;.  An orientation debate took place at the October Council and, following further encouragement from the Presidency, the EU Commission published a working document on the fifth framework programme in late November.  I presented a Presidency paper to focus matters and a second debate was held at Research Council last week which has moved the debate forward and will assist the Commission in the preparation of its detailed proposal next Spring. I am happy to say that my continued efforts to have the EU action plan on innovation completed during the Irish Presidency have paid dividends. This follows the Green Paper on Innovation which was published earlier this year.  The plan has now been cleared by the EU Commission, <Col N="1132" /> was presented to the December Research Council last week and will go to the European Summit in Dublin this weekend.  The plan is a comprehensive response to the need to put innovation in all its diversity and complexity at the heart of industrial and economic policy and mirrors in many ways the approach in our White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing items, I also took two Presidency initiatives to coincide with national Presidency objectives on drugs and SMEs.  The drugs issue is a major priority for this Government and my Presidency initiative on research in the drugs area complements this wider process.  The initiative relates to the contribution which the European scientific community can make to the fight against drug abuse and detection.  On 12 November, a very successful high level workshop on &ldquo;Research on the Medical, Socio-Economic and Detection Issues of Drug Abuse&rdquo; was held in Brussels, as part of the Irish Presidency initiative.  All 15 member states made valuable inputs to the recommendations in the report of the workshop. These recommendations have been reflected in the Council Conclusions which were agreed by research Ministers last week.  They will in turn feed into the Dublin summit this weekend.</P>
    <P>On SMEs, last week's Council approved a set of Presidency initiated conclusions which aim at making it easier for SMEs to participate in EU research programme activities.  This was an important achievement which recognises the significant contribution that SMEs can make to economic growth, and the fact that technology is vital if SMEs are to make that contribution.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a few brief comments on the much talked about information society as, for most people, it represents the demonstrable capacity of technology in our lives.  The information society concerns the products and services which are emerging on foot of the convergence of information and communications technologies, and the impact which these products/services will have.  The White Paper raises an agenda for discussion on the enormous ramifications of these developments.  At this stage there are more questions than answers.  The information society heralds a new revolution, equal in scale, intensity, effect and implications to the industrial revolution which spread throughout Europe and the new world into the nineteenth century.</P>
    <P>Where this transformation will lead is not yet clear but there are already visible enormous implications for all aspects of life, in business and trade, work and employment, in education, health and leisure.  Many traditional jobs are disappearing as new markets, new types of jobs and ways of working are being created.  Long established industries and ways of life are disappearing.  Methods of communication, independent of time, place or defined structure, are emerging.  The world is being reshaped on a gigantic scale.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> Nobody knows what will be the outcome of it all.  In a sense there will be no outcome as such; there is simply a continuous process but we have the power to influence events.  We have a duty to do so because it is possible to build a better society for all and increase employment opportunities out of what is now happening.  The development of the new age cannot be left solely to market forces.  As the White Paper states, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment put in place a steering group on the information society in early 1996.  That group comprises representatives of the broad strata of society likely to be affected by and involved in the information society.  The group was given a mandate to examine various aspects of the information society with a view to reaching agreement on recommendations regarding how Ireland might best handle the challenges and opportunities which the information society will present in the short to medium term.  I understand that the group hopes to finalise its study before the year end.  I assure Senators that the document will be afforded high priority within the Department of Enterprise and Employment on foot of its submission to the Minister.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the increasing importance of the information society for business firms and the citizen in the EU, the Irish Presidency sought and obtained support for the holding of a special Council on the information society.  That Council meeting took place on 8 October 1996.</P>
    <P>The main outcome of the Council concerned the arrival at a consensus on a resolution regarding new political priorities for the information society.  In effect, the resolution gives a new impetus to various work programmes at both EU and member state level, which are aimed at enhancing Europe's position in the emerging information society.  In particular, the resolution emphasises the need for the EU to improve its competitive position in the highly competitive global information society market for products and services.  The more detailed elements of the resolution include references to the potential of information and communication technologies to generate significant additional employment in EU firms, especially small and medium sized enterprises.  This is an important consideration in the context of relatively high unemployment in the EU.  In this regard, the resolution emphasises the need for private sector firms to meet the challenges and exploit the opportunities which the information society presents.</P>
    <P>A positive public perception of science and technology is one of the pillars on which the White Paper and its objectives is founded.  As the White Paper says &ldquo;all of the decisions in relation to specific programmes, sectors and issues will have a lesser impact unless there is a generally improved public perception of science and technology&rdquo;.  To this end, the Government decision has been to implement a three year <Col N="1134" /> programme of awareness raising and promotional activities, in the areas of science, technology and innovation, targeting key audiences -decision makers in the public and private sectors, the education and business sectors, the media and the general public.  The programme has been placed under the management of Forfás, which is being advised by a steering panel.</P>
    <P>In 1996, four flagship events were undertaken in addition to a campaign of information dissemination.  The first flagship activity is the competition for the National Innovation Awards, launched in November and to be presented in March 1997.  Four awards for industrial innovation will be made, one each for companies employing over 50 people, for companies employing fewer than 50 people and for campus companies, and one overall award for the best innovation by a company of any size.  The aim of the awards is to identify and encourage organisations which promote an innovative culture and thus to increase awareness of the critical role of innovation in determining the growth and survival of firms.</P>
    <P>Information technology and science week is the second of the flagship activities and took place countrywide in the last week of November, with the participation and assistance of many organisations and professional bodies.  This week of interactive events, school activities and media coverage was primarily focused on the general public and young people.  Through the media, people were encouraged to take part in activities ranging from surfing the Internet, to an electronics workshop for primary schools to reading about science and technology in popular magazines or papers.  The aim was to help people to take the first steps in combating their fears of, or apprehensions about, unfamiliar technologies.</P>
    <P>These fears and apprehensions are generally not founded on bad experiences of the area but rather on the absence of any experiences in science and technology.  Most other countries in Europe, and the EU itself, dedicate a week to the promotion of science and technology.  With the aid of private sector sponsorship and the participation of the many professional and voluntary bodies in the science and technology arena, I expect the science and technology week to expand and become a permanent feature on the calendar.</P>
    <P>The two remaining flagships are a television programme about science and technology and a programme of activities for young people and the education sector.  Groundwork for a television series, initially on a pilot scale and for a general audience, is under way, with proposed screening after Easter 1997.</P>
    <P>In the area of young people, projects include the recent publication of a yearbook on science in Ireland, aimed primarily at older school-goers, and ongoing visits to an interactive science roadshow.  Also in hand is the preparation of a CD-ROM aimed at career guidance teachers.  All of these activities have been designed and <Col N="1135" /> implemented with the assistance of teachers' representative groups.</P>
    <P>As we move into 1997, the programme plans to take into account lessons learnt from the first year's activities.  The response to the programme has been enthusiastic and many private sector sponsors have already become involved.  It is essential that the programme is supplementary to the work already being undertaken by individuals and organisations, mostly on a voluntary basis, and that it should have a significant lasting effect on key audiences &mdash; decision makers in the education sector, the media and the public.  The latter is the key factor in the planning of activities for 1997 and 1998.</P>
    <P>I will elaborate on perhaps the two most important recommendations emanating from the White Paper.  Leading on from the need for a better public awareness of science and technology, I am convinced that a major gap in that regard is the absence of a dedicated advisory council.  In seeking to further merge and to improve the productive relationship between science and technology on the one hand and industrial development on the other, the functions of the Science and Technology Act, 1987, are now the responsibility of Forfás.  That organisation has a broad developmental and policy advisory remit and the Act confers wide ranging powers in relation to national science and technology policy.  To be fully effective in this field, I believe that we need independent and expert advice which is capable of commenting authoritatively on relevant issues and thereby contributing to public debate and Government action as appropriate.</P>
    <P>When I published the White Paper I indicated that my first initiative would be to appoint a new council.  I am currently considering suitable terms of reference and membership and I hope to announce the new council early in the new year. I would stress at this stage that I place a great premium on the personal qualities of the members to be able to deliver new ideas, fresh thinking and comprehensive treatment to science and technology policy and not to represent sectoral interests or some of the narrow dimensions which characterised the science and technology debate in the past.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, the major objective is to devise a system to comprehensively, coherently and productively extract the maximum value for the State's investment in science, technology and innovation.  The official survey, known as the Forfás Science Budget, indicates that close on £800 million will be spent by 12 Government Departments and over 30 Government agencies in 1996 in a huge variety of programmes relating to scientific and technological development. Without wishing to repeat the argument in the White Paper, the problem in essence is that there is no global predetermination of how this considerable sum of money should be invested, <Col N="1136" /> nor is there any attempt to establish Ireland's science and technology priorities.</P>
    <P>The White Paper proposes to establish an interdepartmental group under the auspices of a Cabinet subcommittee which will review and comment upon departmental spending and Estimates plans as an input to the annual Estimates process.  As the work of the interdepartmental committee and Cabinet committee develops, my expectation is that we will have a greater understanding of the amounts and output of the investment in individual areas, a consistency of policy approach across Departments and agencies, elimination of any overlap or duplication identified, and ultimately clearer focus and targeting of investment on the areas of priority.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for the opportunity to take up this debate in the House and I look forward to hearing their views on the main issues.  I would instance questions such as: how critical is scientific research and technological innovation to our national development, economic growth and social progress?  How do we bring about a more positive public attitude and acceptance of that need?  How do we encourage Irish industry, especially indigenous companies, to invest more time and effort in the development of their technological and innovation capacity?  How do we develop the other aspects of the national system of innovation such as the third-level, State agencies and financial sector to help industry to become more innovative?  Finally, how do we better target the State investment in science, technology and innovation to achieve the best results?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his long speech on the White Paper.  If he were in Opposition he would have responded by tearing the speech to shreds because there is no beef in what he has said.  There has been no innovation during his term as Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology.  This debate represented an opportunity for him to tell the House about new developments and investment, but unfortunately his speech is a great disappointment.</P>
      <P>The recent publication of the White Paper is to be welcomed in that it is the first of its kind on science and technology in Ireland.  However, it is a pity that the opportunity has been less than enthusiastically seized.  The White Paper is a backward looking document and parts of it amount to little more than a contraction of the relevant pages from the STIAC report.  It is more a Green Paper in that it is a discussion document, despite the fact that we have been discussing science and technology for almost the last four years.  It makes hollow demands that scientists become involved in the debate without placing similar obligations on the Government as the largest spender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> The White Paper seeks to map out a future for Irish science and technology yet it sets no targets or objectives.  It is not an educational White Paper.  If the Minster of State with responsiblility for science and technology is not the key person involved in the development of science, technology and education and of innovation in education then who is?</P>
    <P>There are 50 agencies involved in science and technology, including State agencies, Departments, councils, committees and boards. There is a plethora of agencies and it is especially disappointing, therefore, that the main recommendation by the Minister of State is the establishment of another council.  We do not have a research institute other than Teagasc and are largely dependent on universities and colleges. From my discussions, it seems there is grave frustration and disappointment at the lack of progress on the part of the Minister of State and his Department.</P>
    <P>In supporting fundamental research the State underpins the national science, technology and innovation system.  We cannot have a national STI system in the absence of a skilled national expertise pool generating ideas and results at a fundamental level.  Third level researchers, who are the largest and most productive group of researchers in the State, form the only group to have &ldquo;as resources permit&rdquo; attached to the White Paper's aspirations for it.  The weak drafting of the section of the White Paper dealing with research in the colleges is evident from the many contradictory statements it contains.  The White Paper accepts the need for curiosity driven research but then says that basic research must be prioritised and relevant.  How is it proposed to resolve this conundrum?</P>
    <P>Forbairt is to be charged with establishing research networks among SMEs.  As the Minister of State said, similar networks work in Scandinavia.  However, it is remarkable that the largest research resource in the State, that is, the third level sector, will not be included in this initiative.  This is despite the fact that figures published by the EU show that industrial networks involving fundamental research laboratories are twice as profitable as those which do not do so.  Neither Forfás nor Forbairt, the two major science and technology agencies, have a scientist on their boards.  The matter of research equipment is not addressed in a comprehensive way.  Merely saying that the Departments of Education and Enterprise and Employment might talk to each other about equipment is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>The section in the Minister of State's speech in which he referred to funding spelled out how useless is his speech.  He stated &ldquo;Only some £2 million is available on an annual basis to fund equipment and buildings for all seven universities, resulting in a cumulative equipment shortfall in the colleges estimated by the Higher Education Authority to be at least £50 million&rdquo;. He also stated &ldquo;The White Paper has responded, <Col N="1138" /> calling for more funds as resources permit and for the relevant Departments to work more closely together while recognising that funding from, for example, the EU framework programme has to some extent filled the vacuum in the past&rdquo;.  The Minister of State is the person charged with the job of producing the money.  I hope he will give us some indication that it is a priority of the Government to invest seriously in third level institutions, which are going from bad to worse because of their inability to cope with the challenges and demands made on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State further stated that only 16 per cent of firms use the third level sector as a source of innovation.  He said that this can surely be improved, but for that to happen both sides will have to accept the validity of the other's approach.  Only 16 per cent of firms use the third level sector for the simple reason that it is totally unequipped to meet the demands and challenges it faces.  The colleges, which carry out more than 80 per cent of all research, need access to up to date equipment if they are to teach effectively, attract industrial money for research and maintain the quality of their expertise.  The colleges, as hotbeds of innovation, require equipment to maintain the stream of ideas which has directly resulted in more than 200 campus companies, more than 2,500 jobs and considerable foreign earnings.</P>
    <P>Antiquated equipment is a considerable health and safety issue.  Equipment in several colleges is uninsurable as the cost of maintaining it at an acceptable level of repair is too high.  Scarce resources are diverted into maintaining equipment which it would be better to replace. Equipment which was decommissioned overseas is being dumped in Ireland and traded out stock is being sold as new to researchers here because international dealers know that Irish researchers do not have the resources to obtain the state of the art equipment which their competitors take for granted.  As illustrated by a recent accident, the lives of research students are being put at risk by the failure to implement an emergency reequipment programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has a responsibility to convince his Government colleagues it is time that research and development in our third level colleges was taken seriously and that the wonderful work they do in the absence of a research institute should be recognised and supported.  If some of the £100 million which the Minister of State's party insisted was spent on the long-term unemployed in last year's budget &mdash; much of which has been wasted &mdash; was spent in the area of science and technology in third level colleges, far more jobs would come on stream within 12 months of it being spent.  University College Galway and the University of Limerick, for example, will produce the goods if they get the resources needed for new equipment and new initiatives.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, was in Opposition &mdash; I often admired much of <Col N="1139" /> what he said and stood for then &mdash; he would hammer home the point that the person sitting in the Minister's chair must deliver the money required to produce the goods.  I say to the Minister of State in the strongest possible terms, although I do not want him to interpret it as a personal attack, that he has a duty over the next few months to secure significant money in the budget or Finance Bill for third level colleges so that they can produce far greater and more accomplished research in science, technology and innovation, which they are capable of doing.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the White Paper is no more than an aspirational document.  It spells out many points which were already dealt with in the Tierney report.  We need action in terms of the Government providing the necessary resources.  The Minister of State and his Department must take a clear look at their work and the initiatives they take because it is mindboggling that he would state in this House that: &ldquo;A second priority is a comprehensive reappraisal of education and training in the light of the current realisation that learning is an essential part of living and not just a means to an end&rdquo;.  Is that new thinking?  The House deserves more than such comments from the Minister of State and his Department.  They have failed miserably to move forward the development of science, technology and innovation.  A much more effective approach must be taken than the details outlined in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this debate is taking place in this session.  I take issue with Senator Fahey's contribution.  The Minister of State acknowledged that we are behind most developed countries on this issue.  He does not make any bones about the fact that we have a long way to go in terms of focused spending in this area.  The publication of the White Paper and the consultation process which took place before it, including the Tierney report, flagged the importance of the issue which is being addressed. It is considered central to job creation, developing the economy and focusing on future rather than past needs.  This is necessary if we are to make progress and continue to create jobs in the fast moving climate in which we live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned moving from an industrial society to the information age and also referred to the digital economy.  We are in a constant process of change and if we do not focus on this area, we will be left behind.  It is not enough to just throw money at educational institutions.  It must be linked to the broader economy and industry and provide networks to ensure a transfer of technology and that we will not have research just for its own sake but for added value to the economy.  This is evident in Denmark, Finland and Japan and other countries which have taken this issue on board.  They have <Col N="1140" /> moved their economies forward although they did not all have a head start 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>In terms of the amount of money being spent, the Minister of State said the official survey, known as the Forfás science budget, indicates that almost £800 million will be spent by 12 Departments and over 30 Government agencies in 1996 on a huge variety of programmes relating to scientific and technological development.  I did not intend to quote chunks from the White Paper but on page 56, under the heading &ldquo;Action to Date&rdquo;, it mentions a series of measures which have already been taken.  In relation to taxation, it states that a 400 per cent deduction for incremental research and development expenditure was provided.  It also mentions the business expansion scheme and that basic research expenditure increased from £1 million to £1.5 million in 1995 and to £2 million in 1996.</P>
    <P>It states that strategic research funding increased and mentions college/industry applied research.  The National Research Support Fund Board was established and there was increased funding for technology brokerage, such as Techstart, which is an important scheme.  The annual PhD support grant for individual students was doubled and funding was provided for a new post-doctoral fellowship scheme.  Additional funding was provided for the company technology audit scheme and inter-firm collaborative networks have been piloted.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and his Government colleagues have indicated that, while a series of measures have already been taken, there is still a long way to go.  This is the focus of the White Paper.  Such documents are a summary of what took place previously and include statements on actions it is intended to take in the future.  I reject the negative tone of Senator Fahey's contribution which did not forward the debate in any way.</P>
    <P>It is important to have a clear focus on the type of horizontal and vertical links which are required to move forward.  There is an onus on the Government and public bodies but also on private sector to spend money in that regard.  In most countries mentioned earlier, there is a great deal of interaction between private and public sector funding.  If industries will directly benefit from research, they should be expected to contribute funding.</P>
    <P>I also heard a speech made by Dr. Midel Landabaso at a conference in Dún Laoghaire this year when he made a strong point about the private and public sectors and the educational institutions working together.  He mentioned that regions which will be successful in this area have an interaction between industry, chambers of commerce, local government, regional government, national Government and educational institutions.  He illustrated cases of where it has been successful, such as Amelia Romano in Italy.  His general point was that in all regions which have been successful there is inevitably that type of collaboration and interaction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> A man from south Wales also addressed the conference.  He illustrated how they were forced to move from heavy industry, mainly based on coal, because they were losing energy and the ability to create jobs.  They moved the emphasis to electronics and automation and brought in the Japanese in a focused and determined manner. They learned how to use the methods which have been so successful there and there are now successful developments in areas of south Wales.</P>
    <P>I cannot remember the name of Will Hutton's book but he also carried out a detailed study of how the Japanese work in this regard in terms of the close interaction between the banking system and industry.  He mentioned the transfer of knowledge between firms competing with each other, particularly the motor and electronic industries.  Although they are in competition, they also work together and banks and local money have a major interaction with the companies if a change of direction is needed.  He cited a definite and precise example in his book where one company needed to change direction because it was beginning to lose money.  It brought in the banks and the local equivalent of the chamber of commerce and together they worked out a way forward based on the experience of other industries.  The company was given the economic support it needed and was able to move forward. This type of collaboration is essential if we are to make progress.</P>
    <P>Ireland probably has much to learn from Denmark, given our agricultural indigenous history.  The Danes have developed a complex interaction between basic production on farms and added value before the produce is marketed and sold.  The applied nature of the interaction between basic science in terms of what happens in laboratories and the creation of jobs is important and the transfer of technology is a crucial aspect.  From what I have read on the subject, if we are to have economic growth in these areas we need specialisation in particular regions.  My region is a good example of that. There has been interaction between Shannon development, the University of Limerick, Limerick regional technical college, the technology base around the airport, the technology centre beside the university and the Raheen industrial estate, which has a large research element, particularly in relation to food. Through such interaction one industry feeds off another.  Industries are attracted to areas where such activities occur and people learn from each other.  However, this does not happen automatically, a point which the Minister made. There must be a focus and a way to channel these energies so that they yield the type of results about which he spoke.  In that regard, I welcome the intention to set up an advisory council so that there will be a national focus in this area.</P>
    <P>It is important also to have a regional focus where knowledge and information could be gathered together in an area.  This relates to a point made by Senator McGowan on the Order <Col N="1142" /> of Business.  He spoke about the need to ensure that all new jobs do not go to population centres, in particular those along the east coast.  He was probably thinking about the 2,000 jobs announced yesterday and he has a point in this regard.  The Minister made the point that regional technical colleges offer an opportunity for that type of knowledge and information gathering in areas other than Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Galway or Waterford.  He made a solid point about the need to focus more on the regions and away from the larger centres of growth, particularly Dublin. I hope there will be a response to these initiatives and that we will see results in terms of job creation.  The trade union movement has responded effectively in this area.  ICTU, in particular, has researched information technology, biotechnology and so on.  Workers must also be prepared to look to the future and be innovative.  The trade union movement is part of this process.</P>
    <P>The publication of the White Paper has created a focus.  It is important that institutions of learning respond and have an input.  They have argued in the media and elsewhere for more funding for research and science.  Members of Government parties acknowledge the need to continue to invest more money in this area.  They must consider ways in which their work can be transferred into the economy thereby creating job opportunities.  We are still very concerned about the number of people out of work.  I hope institutions of learning will become involved in the debate on how to channel these energies so as to get the maximum value for money.  We should learn rather than copy from countries which have been most effective in doing this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we have reached this point but we have some distance to go.  I hope those involved in this area, including chambers of commerce and existing industries, will have an input so that it will not be a case of the Government doing everything.  There is an onus of everybody in this regard.  The Minister referred to education.  The public should know what is going on and should recognise that this is not an esoteric issue relevant only to nutty professors in laboratories but that it is relevant to job creation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I called for this debate four weeks after the launch of the White Paper.  I congratulate the Minister on this unusual White Paper which is very readable.  It contains interesting stories about a number of famous Irish scientists and short articles, one of which I contributed, as did Pat Kenny, Dr. Gary O'Toole and others.  The Minister has given us five challenges which I will attempt to cover.  I agree with Senator Fahey that although this is a White Paper, it is, in many respects, more like a Green Paper &mdash; a consultation document.  It is not a like a White Paper which sets out a programme of Government decisions.  Whether it is a White Paper with a green tinge or a Green Paper with white tinge, the fact remains that future policy <Col N="1143" /> in this area depends on a radical shift in public awareness of science, technology and innovation.</P>
      <P>We need to debate this matter in the House but a national debate is also required.  If we do not succeed in starting a national debate on science, technology and innovation, the move forward will be slight or it may even peter out. We need to create a new level of support for these three areas which will fuel an ambitious new programme at a national level to allow us to catch up with countries with which we must compete.  My French son-in-law recently became an executive in CNRS, the French based centre for scientific research.  When he joined that organisation three or four years ago he told me about its work.  I was fascinated because I did not know that considerable State funding went into this area.  I looked to see what we were doing and it was only at that stage I realised how far behind the rest of the world we were.  Senator O'Sullivan described what happens in Japan.  We need to fuel an ambitious national programme to allow us to catch up with countries which we are so far behind.</P>
      <P>The starting point in the debate we hope to spark should be to realise that Ireland is not a scientific nation.  Our culture is clearly nonscientific &mdash; some might even say it is anti-scientific. However, we must change.  The Minister and I will not be fooled into believing this will be an easy job.  Ireland has a clear idea about its identity.  The younger generation is confident about who it is and what it wants to be.  That identity is overwhelmingly based on our culture and heritage and it has become even stronger over the past 20 years with the resurgence of the musical side of our culture, which is good.  By defining ourselves in that way, we have left a vital element of our future economic success on the sideline.</P>
      <P>We have a Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, as is proper, but, notwithstanding the Minister of State's position in the Cabinet, we do not have a Minister for science, technology and innovation.  That position sums up the problem we must address.  Why do we not have a Minister for science, technology and innovation?  The reason is simple &mdash; we do not consider these areas important enough to merit a Department of State and a Minister at the Cabinet table because most of us come from what I term the other side of the fence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how many Members of the Oireachtas have third level degrees but I bet the overwhelming majority of their degrees are in the humanities.  Allowing for the fact that parliaments appear to attract a huge number of lawyers, it is probable that most of the other graduates have non-scientific backgrounds.  I fall into that category in that I have a B. Comm.  Even the honorary degrees with which I have been conferred are in the humanities.  Look at the public service and one can see the same phenomenon.  How many Secretaries of <Col N="1144" /> Departments have a scientific background?  The Secretary of the Department of Education has, but how small is the minority to which he belongs?  How many members of the next level in the Civil Service, deputy secretaries and assistant secretaries, have scientific backgrounds?</P>
    <P>The answers to these questions will show that the overwhelming majority of top level personnel in the Civil Service have no scientific background. There are hundreds of scientists in the public service but most of them are in technical niche areas.  Few of them move to the top level of management.  In saying that, I am not targeting the Civil Service or the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This phenomenon shows a nation that is almost totally driven by people with backgrounds in the humanities.  The same can be seen in business.  I do not like it but the quickest way to get to the top in business is to be an accountant.  Look at how often we recruit accountants to head semi-State bodies.  The chairman of Telecom Éireann, whom I admire, is an accountant, as is the chairman of the ESB, whom I also admire.  These people lead companies that are technologically driven.  This country might not have an &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; but it has a group of people who can be designated as opinion formers or leaders. Overwhelmingly these people do not have a grounding in and share a lack of understanding of science.</P>
    <P>One of the problems highlighted by the report of the Scientific Technical Innovation Advisory Council, which was the precursor of the White Paper, is the low level of spending on research and development in Ireland.  The national spend on research is low, particularly on research and development in business and enterprise.  If we are to change that &mdash; we have no choice but to do so as the future of our economy depends on it &mdash; we must look at the reasons the spend is low.  The main reason is that, as a nation, we are not yet convinced that science and technology matter. Successive Governments have not thought so, as can be seen in our legislation.  The public service, our opinion formers and our businesses do not think they matter, so the public does not think so.</P>
    <P>The reason we spend so little on research and development is due to a national myopia about science and technology.  Were it not for the existence of European funds we would be even further behind in the race.  It is vital, therefore, that we take the White Paper as our starting point.  We have a national problem and it involves everybody.  We have left science and technology out of our national mix and it is extremely urgent that we include it right away.  The Minister, in the five questions at the end of his contribution, asked how we will do that.  Two necessary projects must be undertaken and the White Paper pays little more than lip service to either of them. Some progress has been made in the first project, which is convincing the nation that science and technology are important to our future.  We have made progress in the White Paper by linking science and technology with innovation.  The <Col N="1145" /> Minister of State was strong and clear in making that link and by establishing it we are getting across the idea that innovation is the natural consequence of science and technology.  Implicit in that is the even stronger idea that without science and technology there cannot be innovation.  That proposition is true and Ireland is its proof.</P>
    <P>A few years ago, Scandinavian consultants produced a report which focused on our track record in innovation and highlighted the fact that our businesses are not generally innovative.  Most of our policy consists of piggy backing on innovation that has been created elsewhere.  We have often heard the phrase: &ldquo;If it is such a good idea somebody would have thought of it before now&rdquo;.  We must adopt a different attitude because not much has changed since the production of the Scandinavian report.  Some years ago I read a phrase which caught my imagination: &ldquo;The impossible is often the untried&rdquo;.  Irish people are afraid of making mistakes &mdash; our attitude is let us not make a mistake in case we are blamed for it &mdash; and that is one of the reasons innovation has not happened.  We have almost an inferiority complex in that area.</P>
    <P>Innovation is still low on the list of priorities for both Government and business.  I am seeking to show a crucial weakness in the argument that science and technology are important because they are essential to innovation.  That argument is true but it is less than persuasive for people who do not appreciate the importance of innovation in the first place.  Many people, even those in business, do not realise that the importance of innovation has changed radically in the past ten years.  We are rapidly reaching a stage where the company that does not innovate will have no place in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I attended a conference in London yesterday at which Tom Peters, a management guru, spoke. His original profession was as an engineer.  He told us he went to Cornell University &mdash; only the first and second placed students in secondary school were accepted at Cornell &mdash; to study for his engineering degree.  On the first day of his course, which would have been during the 1960s, a professor said to the class of about 500 students: &ldquo;Take a good look at the guys on your right and on your left because on this day, next year, only two of you will be here&rdquo;.  He continued: &ldquo;Take another look at the same guys because on this day five years, when you graduate, there will be only one of the three of you present&rdquo;.  Tom Peters looked around at the 700 people, approximately, at the conference yesterday and said: &ldquo;You should do the same and look to your left and right because, regardless of the business in which you are involved, if you do not change none of you will be here in five years time&rdquo;.  That is where innovation is important and that is why we must find a way to innovate.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister of State say he has managed to secure BSE funding.  The National Food Centre needs it urgently because <Col N="1146" /> so much depends on the food sector.  Research is necessary in the food sector and I urge the Minister of State to ensure that some of the funding is diverted into the food technology sector, on which so much also depends.  We have seen what happened in the beef sector during the past year.</P>
    <P>We are moving away from the position where only the leaders had to be innovators and those who piggy-backed on the work of others always earned a good living.  Ireland has been doing this for the past 50 years.  Just as we have no culture in science and technology, we have no culture of innovation either.  We have always taken the easy way out and felt that innovation was for others. When we saw how the wind was blowing, then we could choose to follow.</P>
    <P>Those days are gone forever.  We should carve the motto &ldquo;innovate or die&rdquo; on our consciousness.  This is not an exaggeration and applies individually and to companies.  An awareness campaign, such as is mentioned in the White Paper, should focus on innovation, not on science and technology.  We have to sell the Irish people innovation first, then science and technology as the means to achieve it.  It is not only the opinion formers who have to be convinced of this.  Every person in a job needs to realise that the future of that job depends to a significant extent on how much innovation can be brought to bear on it.  The company's past does not deliver job security but rather the company's attitude to the future.  We should realise that innovation is no longer an optional extra or the icing on the cake, it is the factor that determines whether there will be a cake in the first place.</P>
    <P>Those who are establishing the awareness campaign promised in the White Paper should concentrate on innovation first.  Unless that is sold effectively, science and technology will never be sold to the extent needed.  The second necessary project is even more fundamental and relates to the fact that our culture is nonscientific. It is necessary to convince people about innovation and to persuade them that science and technology is the main road to that end but this is not enough on its own.  It is also necessary that we feel comfortable about science and technology, which is not the case now.  We do not feel comfortable because we know so little about it.</P>
    <P>We learned a smattering of science at school.  I was lucky as I attended Newbridge College where the Dominican Father Michael Casey taught.  He moved to Maynooth as a Professor of Science and is still active in his 90s.  Very few had that kind of opportunity.  The media had little material about science and technology.  There is very little public interest in science.</P>
    <P>This can be created in a manner which is not prohibitively expensive.  Anyone who travels abroad regularly will be aware of the emergence of the phenomenon of the science centre.  These use all the tools of modern technology to bring science to people in an exciting and interactive <Col N="1147" /> way.  They are educational and recreational facilities but are tourist attractions in their own right.  They are reasonably economical because they pay much of their own way.</P>
    <P>Not one museum in Ireland is devoted to science.  We have poured money into bringing arts and culture to people, especially in the last ten years.  We can do exactly the same for science and technology.  If we do, we will get the results in a shorter timeframe.  It is necessary to be comfortable about science so we can make the right decisions.  Our ignorance of science has allowed us to starve basic research of funding for many years.  The White Paper says that spending on basic research was doubled in the last year. However, this means it went from £1 million to £2 million in an overall spend of £800 million and illustrates the tiny place basic research plays in the mindset of those who make the decisions.  We have heard of changes today.  However, anyone who claims that basic research is worth only one four hundredth of the overall science budget is unaware of what science is about and how it works.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the tidy, administrative, humanities-centred mind would love to fund only research that will show payback on the bottom line within a short time.  However, scientific life is not like that.  Basic research is the inescapable, unavoidable foundation which must be there if applied science or technology is to thrive.  The State should fund only basic research and insist on the marketplace doing the rest.  There are certain fundamentals which must be addressed first.  If we change the national attitude to science and technology, everything else will fall into place.  We can do this in a few years if we put our minds to it.  However, if we skirt around the task and shirk it, we will never catch up, however much we increase our spending on specific science projects in the short-term.  I am delighted with the White Paper and the Minister's efforts in publicising it.  It is the start of a movement that will change the national attitude to science and technology.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this White Paper.  Senator Quinn mentioned looking at the person beside us who might not be here this time next year.  This time next year, many people on his right or left may not be with us in the same capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1950s the main emphasis in Ireland was on agriculture and the development of cooperative movements.  No effort was made in the scientific field until one Government in the early 1980s appointed a junior Minister with responsibility for science and technology.  The appointment was a recognition that there was a movement towards looking at science and technology and research and development in real terms.  We fell behind as we did not develop this area for the different type of student coming out of our schools.  The IDA has been successful in <Col N="1148" /> bringing many computer companies to this country.  They are coming here because of the level of education in our schools and universities. What is being done to develop this further and provide greater research and development to allow us to enter other fields where there are the same possibilities to provide a huge number of jobs?</P>
    <P>When I visited Taiwan in 1986, I was amazed at their research and development and the money and work invested in new ideas.  Staff were provided to inform, help and develop good ideas. It was a major industry.  We were never in the position to do that.  I will consider my answers to the five questions the Minister put at the end of his contribution.</P>
    <P>As is obvious from what the Minister said, many traditional jobs are disappearing because of new markets.  We could have had a far greater research, development, science and technology programme in place but for the fact mentioned by Senator Quinn &mdash; people are afraid to introduce change in case it fails, because then the person responsible is the worst in the world.  We, as politicians, are the biggest culprit in that regard; if a politician introduces something new which fails, he will be hounded by every other politician and the media.  However, entrepreneurs know that one must have failures before becoming a success.  Our political establishment does not realise that we should support ideas even though not all of them will succeed.</P>
    <P>We have not created a positive public perception of science and technology, although efforts have been made in the schools for the last few years.  From my discussions with entrepreneurs, I know that only those who are improving their product or changing it for the modern day are interested in further investment in this area.  The Government has decided to implement a three year programme to raise awareness of potential activity in science, technology and innovation, targeting key audiences.  That development is required and some schools are doing it already.  Teachers tell me the single biggest problem is that the curriculum is too broad, it is not geared to send students in a particular direction at a sufficiently early stage, so many students do not do something they might be good at.  It is not necessarily wrong to have ten subjects on the curriculum but perhaps the Department of Education could consider the matter in light of these proposed changes.</P>
    <P>What should we do as a nation?  The Minister asked how critical scientific research, technology and innovation was to our national development, economic growth and social progress; my answer is that it is extremely critical and we should do something about it.  The Government must provide a substantial budget on a continuous basis over five years to ensure proper information on particular areas is made available to companies and the public.  If what we do is not focused, the impact will be lost.  I agree with the <Col N="1149" /> Minister's decision to target certain areas to ensure a better result.  That could also help us succeed in the aim of bringing about a more positive public attitude and acceptance of the need for science and technology.</P>
    <P>The Minister also asked how we would encourage Irish industry, particularly indigenous companies, to invest more time and effort in the development of their technological and innovative capabilities.  Companies have not made more efforts in this area because of the pressure of keeping up with the market and making sales, although some of them have tried harder in recent years.  It may be necessary to consider a tax break for companies which are prepared to set up science and technology divisions.  That could be coupled with help from the board the Minister wishes to set up.  Such a scheme would work provided it was properly managed by the Department.</P>
    <P>We must also develop the other aspects of the national system of innovation, such as third level institutions and State agencies.  Perhaps, as in other countries, we could set up competitions for people in third level who come up with new ideas with prizes of scholarships for further training, provided the ideas meet certain standards and are worth pursuing.  These people would then be able to expand and build on their ideas and gain further education.  That might not be the precise road to follow but the correct method could be devised between the third level colleges, State agencies, the financial sector and industry.  When someone comes up with a good idea there is always an industry interested in promoting and improving it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also interested in better targeting for State investment in science and technology.  The Government should provide the proposed board with money on a continuous basis to fund this development over a five year period.  This money should be earmarked from the start so that the scheme does not suffer from &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; funding.  As was stated already, we are behind other countries and were it not for European funding we would be another 20 years further behind.  In 1978, the two agencies concerned in Ireland had a total of £1 million and even then other countries were providing far more money for this area.  It is no wonder that these countries are so far ahead of us with new products, developments and proposals.  However, there is a great opportunity to start from where we are.</P>
    <P>The White Paper gives us, as elected representatives, the opportunity to bring forward proposals to develop this area and this industry as have other countries.  We can only achieve what we want in this area if the Government decides this is the road we want to travel.  We have the opportunity to develop this area because of the large number of well educated young people who are in a position to come up with ideas and who must be given the opportunity to develop them.  Today we have an opportunity to <Col N="1150" /> move this forward and I know the Minister is open to that.</P>
    <P>The State should provide a certain level of continuous funding and industry should provide the research and development facilities to further develop this area.  Other countries have decided this area will be important in the future and we must do the same.  I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this topic and I know we will have more opportunities to bring our ideas to fruition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this White Paper.  I have had a considerable amount of liaison with research scientists and during the summer one of their reports was headed &ldquo;Tierney Report Gathering Dust&rdquo;.  That the Minister has produced this White Paper will show he is determined to bring some of the recommendations from the Tierney report to fruition.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn said we have to sell science to the public.  Unfortunately most of the money we would like to see spent on research, development and innovation will have to come from the State, although more will come from industry.  I will make two suggestions which would be helpful in selling science to the public.  The <i>Irish Scientist</i>, is a yearbook produced by Dr. Charles Mullen and the Minister and Baroness Denton have written forewords in the current issue.  I would recommend it because many of the research projects in this country are reported on in a most readable manner.</P>
      <P>The diveristy of research reported here is incredible.  There are articles on bio fuels from setaside land, on predicting the potential production of an energy crop in Ireland, on food research by Teagas, on research in the UCD faculty of engineering, on environmental sensing of lactic acid bacteria, on combat impacts in Armagh and radioactive atomic data from astrophysics.  The biological, biochemical, genetic and medical sciences are covered.  There are articles entitled &ldquo;Plant Transformation &mdash; a Role for the Future&rdquo;, &ldquo;Growth and Respiration of Salt Marsh Plants&rdquo; and &ldquo;It takes Two to Tango, but not Necessarily in Step&rdquo;.  The last article is about the breeding of deer in the Phoenix Park and how important it is to be a large stag.  It was found that this played a vital part in the breeding process.  There is another article on the influence of growth regulators on geotropism.  There is an enormous amount of very readable information in this yearbook and it should be very widely distributed.</P>
      <P>That we are at last to have a science museum for Dublin and that this is to be established in the Pigeon House power station is important.  I hope that pleas for its support will not go unheeded. Corporate sponsors are being sought and there is hope of support from the European Union.  I hope the Government will be generous and support this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn spoke about basic research which is much more difficult to sell than applied <Col N="1151" /> research.  I do not know how we are to tell the public and industry how important it is but we have to keep stressing this fact to the Minister and the Government.  This area of research is vital.  I have heard it said that basic research has generated more heat than light but that is not true.  It is often very hard to correlate a technology which comes many years later with the basic research but without the basic research there might not be the later initiatives.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom the Treasury estimated recently that the direct economic return on investment in basic research is in the order of 28 per cent; similarly the US committee of economic advisers conservatively estimates that the direct social return on investment in fundamental research is of the order of 70 per cent.  Sometimes it is hard to quantify, but we should be very careful about dismissing the value of basic research because without that research we might not develop much of the applied research which follows.</P>
    <P>Fundamental research in this area must be underpinned by the State.  A great deal of this research will take place in third level institutions. Campus companies have allowed the employment of a large number of people and are seen as particularly relevant in the area of research in the universities, but this is not acceptable.  There are many reasons for supporting fundamental research within the universities because we do not know what new and useful information may come from basic research.  People may understand new instrumentation or develop new methods of analysis of various materials and acquire new research skills.  These may improve existing technologies which then will be applicable to research.</P>
    <P>People in universities are in constant contact on a global basis with others who are doing research in their fields and this can be of great importance.  Even within a university, the fact that different disciplines make contact with each other can lead to huge initiatives.  I read an article in <i>The Lancet</i> once which dealt with the value of coffee breaks. People from different disciplines within a hospital or large university departments often meet at coffee time and incredible developments sometimes result just from an exchange of ideas or sharing of problems, where one person can get informal advice from another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh, on your election.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1996 is to introduce a new statutory framework for the licensing and regulation of the aquaculture industry so as to provide a more effective, legally secure and transparent licensing process which commands the confidence of the fish farming industry and all other relevant interests.</P>
      <P>There are two statutory mechanisms at present under which Ministerial authority can be exercised to licence fish culture or aquaculture. These are provided for by section 15 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, and by section 54 of the Fisheries Act, 1980.  In addition, aquaculture installations or structures on the foreshore are also subject to the requirements of the Foreshore Acts, and land-based facilities are subject to the Planning Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultations and considerations which led to the drafting of the aquaculture section of the Fisheries Act, 1980, took place in the late 1970s when fish farming was in its infancy.  In the period since the introduction of that Act, we have witnessed the exponential growth of the aquaculture industry to the point where it accounts for some 25 per cent of the value of total fish production in this country.  Total aquaculture production in 1995 amounted to almost 27,000 tonnes with a value of some £50 million.  The total number of people engaged in all sectors of the aquaculture industry stood at 2,946 at the end of 1995.  The Government is committed to the industry's continued sustainable development and to delivering on the potential for jobs and growth it offers, particularly in coastal communities.  The planned development and expansion of the industry is a major element of the investment programme in place under the Fisheries Operational Programme 1994-99.  The operational programme envisages doubling of aquaculture output to £103 million by the end of 1999 and the creation of an additional 1,300 jobs over the period of the programme.  Under the programme a total investment of £36 million is planned in new projects and the modernisation of existing facilities.  To date, 51 investment projects <Col N="1153" /> in aquaculture have been approved under the programme involving a total investment of some £13.5 million.</P>
    <P>To facilitate the realisation of the targets for expansion under the operational programme, a sound legislative framework to underpin aquaculture development is essential.  It has been agreed for some time by both the industry and other interests that a thorough overhaul of the existing legislation is essential to address not only deficiencies experienced with the licensing procedures but also to take account of new thinking on planning and environmental issues as well as significant technical advances in aquaculture itself.  The existing legislative provisions do not command confidence.  The claimed failings are both perceived and real.  The aquaculture industry see the present procedures as a disincentive to enterprise and as being cumbersome and slow in terms of finalising licensing decisions.  Others perceive them as failing to have sufficient regard for public rights and environmental concerns.  Furthermore, licensing of marine fish farms has also been constrained by recent court decisions.  There is a large degree of consensus on the broad requirements of any new licensing system.  The degree of common ground on what is needed is particularly significant given the differing, often opposing, perspectives on aquaculture development.  Views on the specific issues to be addressed in new legislation converged in many respects.</P>
    <P>Key industry concerns centred on the need for a streamlined, impartial and speedy licensing framework; enhancement of notification/ consultation procedures for licence applications; rights of appeal against licensing; security of tenure; safeguarding other interests; more effective policing and regulation; a sound statutory basis for licences; new fee basis and the need for explicit policy guidelines to inform decision making.</P>
    <P>Key third party concerns centred on the need for an impartial and transparent decision making process; improved public notification/ consultation procedures; better access to information; improved appeal mechanisms, enhanced regulation, monitoring and control of industry; a clearcut penalties regime to ensure full compliance with licence and other requirements, and explicit policy guidelines to inform decision making.</P>
    <P>Consequently, one of my primary concerns in the drafting of the Bill was to endeavour to strike the necessary balance between the essential development needs of the aquaculture industry and the acknowledged and real concerns of other parties.  Getting this balance right is essential to ensure that the development of aquaculture is planned and regulated in a sustainable way.  Thus, the objective of the Bill before the House today is to establish a new licensing process which will facilitate the continued sustainable development <Col N="1154" /> of the aquaculture industry while meeting local and environmental concerns; give those directly involved with aquaculture, and all other interested individuals and organisations a reasonable opportunity to express their views on particular development proposals within a framework of clearly defined procedures and timescales; and make provision for the establishment of an independent appeals process.</P>
    <P>The Bill draws heavily on the best features and practices of planning law to achieve this objective. It will establish a new licensing and regulatory framework for aquaculture to replace the existing processes under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Acts.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline the main provisions of the Bill and the new framework for licensing and regulation proposed in it.  Applications for licences to engage in aquaculture are to be made to the licensing authority, that is the Minister for the Marine or a designated officer of the Minister in the event of the power being delegated.  A statutory time objective for determining licence applications within four months is provided for with provision to extend this in specified circumstances.  In such circumstances, reasons will have to be given to the applicant and the date by which, or period within which, the application will be determined will be indicated.  This provision takes account of concerns expressed by the industry that there should be a fixed timeframe for dealing with applications.  It will be open to the Minister to delegate the function of deciding on licence applications and reviews of licences, or on particular categories of applications and reviews, to an officer of the Department.</P>
    <P>An independent aquaculture licences appeals board will be established to determine appeals against decisions of the licensing authority. Again, a statutory time objective for determining appeals within four months will apply with similar provisions for extending this period.  The board will consist of a chairperson and five members appointed by the Minister with knowledge or experience of aquaculture, environmental protection of wild fisheries, planning and development or industrial or community development.  The chairperson's term of office will be five years and other members will hold office for a term not exceeding five years to be specified at the time of their appointment.  There is a standard provision for disclosure of interests by the board or persons engaged by it in circumstances where a particular beneficial or material interest exists.</P>
    <P>The board may engage consultants and advisers for evaluating appeals.  The concerns expressed by the industry and the various interest groups on the need for accountability through an appropriate right of appeal have been recognised and taken on board.  The procedures for appeals and their consideration by the appeals board are derived from the streamlined planning appeals procedures established by the planning Acts.  The main features include a time limit of one month <Col N="1155" /> for lodging appeals by any aggrieved person; a requirement to state the full grounds of appeal when appealing; an entitlement for other parties to an appeal, and anybody else who wishes to do so, to make written submissions on the appeal within one month, a discretionary power for the appeals board to invite a further submission from any person concerned with an appeal where it considers it appropriate to do so; a power for the appeals board to decide, in its absolute discretion, to hold an oral hearing of any appeal, and powers for the appeals board to dismiss vexatious or abandoned appeals.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be empowered to issue general policy directives and any designated officer exercising licensing functions and the appeals board, will be required to have regard to such directives.</P>
    <P>The licensing authority may grant trial licences authorising experimental investigations for particular aquaculture developments.  Such licences would be subject to a maximum term of two years and would not be renewable.  Because of the limited nature and duration of these licences, appeal provisions will not apply.  It is clear that there is a need for more flexibility in relation to licensing experimental operations.  For example, trials to establish site suitability, including suitability for fallowing purposes or the viability of farming novel species will have to be facilitated if the industry is to grow and adapt to new developments and technology.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be empowered to prescribe by regulations, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, fees for licence applications, licences and appeals.  The provision will make it possible to lay down fees for applications, reviews or appeals as is the case under the planning Acts, in addition to fees for licences.</P>
    <P>Matters which must be taken into account as relevant in the determination of licence applications and appeals are delineated in the Bill.  These include the suitability of the area in question for the aquaculture development proposed; likely economic effects; other beneficial uses of the water; ecological implications for wild fisheries; natural habitats and flora and fauna.  The aim is to introduce clear licensing criteria as sought by the industry and other interest groups.</P>
    <P>Provisions to deal with unauthorised development and breaches of licence conditions are considerably strengthened.  This will protect existing or future licensees against developments which undermine confidence in the industry and the Department's ability to regulate properly.  It will also allay the concern of other interests who can be confident that the aquaculture industry is properly regulated and placed on the same footing as other natural resource sectors.</P>
    <P>Licences will be open to review after three years.  Any decision following a review will be appealable in the same way as a decision on a licence application.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> I have taken on board concerns expressed by the aquaculture industry in relation to security of tenure, interference with licensed operations and the underpinning of existing licences.  I have made specific provision for these matters in the Bill.  I have also included strengthened provisions with regard to the recapture of fish in the event of an escape from a fish farm.  This is a matter which I know concerns people involved in the wild fisheries sector.</P>
    <P>In preparing this Bill, my Department has had extensive consultations with a range of interest groups, State bodies and other Government Departments, particularly the Department of the Environment and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  The views of BIM and the aquaculture industry representative bodies have been considered fully, together with those of fishery and environmental interests.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture industry has been poorly served by out of date legislation and a licensing process which has failed to deliver decisions within a reasonable timeframe.  Those who wish to lodge appeals, representations or objections against any licensing decision were also poorly served by the Statutes in place.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Bill provides the necessary legislative framework to command both industry and public confidence in the licensing and regulatory processes for the aquaculture industry.  It underlines the Government's commitment to the sustainable development of this valuable industry and to ensuring that aquaculture develops within strict environmental standards with the rights of other users fully protected.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and know that he will be as successful with this Bill as he was with the Harbours Bill.  He was very open in discussing that Bill.  He listened to the arguments made and accepted amendments.  I presume that Bill will be implemented shortly.  Somebody remarked to me that the review of the New Ross and Waterford group is still in progress.</P>
      <P>This Bill is to be welcomed.  Previous legislation was inadequate.  For the first time it will put a limit on the length of time an application is with the Department.  All fisheries, including wild salmon, oyster and scallop beds, sea trout, etc. can exist in harmony, each going its own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three Senators currently in the House are from rural Ireland, from the west and south-west. The development of fisheries should take place in these regions because employment is needed there.  Fisheries is one of the major employers in the west and should be fully developed.  I was amazed to learn that the first commercially <Col N="1157" /> operated hatchery in the world was in Galway in 1852; I do not know how successful it was.  Shortly after, the first attempt to grow salmon in cages was undertaken in Dublin in 1854.  The need for fish farming was recognised even then.  Methods and scientific knowledge have changed since.  The first significantly commercially farmed salmon were produced in 1980.  The then total of 20 tonnes has significantly increased since.  This has created substantial employment of 2,000 people which will increase by 1,000 if the operational programme continues until 1999.  This employment is badly needed in the west.</P>
    <P>One of the problems over the years has been objections to fish farming.  I feel strongly about this because some objections are not from local people.  I do not wish to deprive anyone of their right to object but, if there is no objection from the community or the parish, except from a person from outside who has a summer house in the area, I would not take their objections into consideration.  This might be considered unfriendly towards outsiders but 90 per cent of objections are not from local people who welcome fish farming for its employment potential.  Many have lived all their lives in the area and intend to do so.  It is wrong that someone who lives in a summer home in the area for two weeks per year can prevent progress.  If it should ever arise again, their objections should be overruled on the grounds that they are not permanent residents.</P>
    <P>Fishing is a way of life in the remotest parts of the west and some of these areas are ideal for the development of fish farming.  These are places where there is little or no employment, other than fishing, and aquaculture is welcome.</P>
    <P>In 1974, I was on the fisheries committee in Kerry County Council which was given the task of finding a settlement regarding the oyster beds in Tralee Bay.  The result is that 80 boats now successfully fish oysters from October to March in Tralee Bay, but in a controlled way.  As stocks are taken out, the amount of time for fishing is lessened with the result that as much money is earned at the beginning of the season as at the end.  It would be a pity if mussel farming in cages were allowed there because it is a natural bed. This is an example to show that wherever there is an opportunity to grow and protect natural shellfish beds, the Government should, as it did in Fenit, protect the beds rather than promoting aquaculture.</P>
    <P>I would like to see another development in salmon farming.  I saw a film years ago on salmon ranching in Ireland.  The fishermen did not go fishing but milked the salmon coming up the river of their spawn.  The spawn and young fish then had a better opportunity to survive because they were protected.  When they were reared to a certain size, they were released into the river, returned some years later and were caught by the fishermen.  It is another means of salmon farming, only the fish are released into the wild and are caught on return.  Some are allowed free to <Col N="1158" /> spawn.  We should give that type of salmon ranching a try.</P>
    <P>This is good legislation.  One of the best aspects of it is that a licence application will be completed within four months.  Previously, the process was too protracted and involved too many Departments.  This shortening of time for completion of applications is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the board would be similar to An Bord Pleanála.  I assume that it will not be a full-time board; the secretary may be full-time but the board would meet occasionally. The Bill states that a quorum of three board members is necessary.  Why is it necessary to have a quorum?  Surely individual members would decide on applications and submit their views. The amount of consultation required would be very little, except in the final stages.</P>
    <P>The Bill stipulates that an appeal against the Minister's refusal to grant a licence must be made within one month of the decision.  Is a month 28 or 31 days?  Section 24(6) of the Bill states that a board member may be removed if adjudged bankrupt or convicted on indictment.  It is important to note that no board has ever been convicted of a fisheries related offence.  I am not a legal expert and perhaps only some fisheries offences are indictable, but any previous offence should be taken into account, otherwise it would be similar to having a planning officer who broke the planning regulations.</P>
    <P>It is hard to fault the Bill and any amendments will be minor.  I have discussed the Bill with some of my peers and they are agreed that it is good legislation.  It will make life easier for those involved in fishing and it should receive a speedy passage.  The Bill is timely and necessary and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this Bill.  The contribution from Senator Fitzgerald shows how necessary it is.  A lot of research and consultation has taken place and the Minister has got it right.</P>
      <P>There has been a period of neglect in addressing the requirements of the fishing industry.  Existing aquaculture legislation is enshrined in the Fisheries Acts, 1959 and 1980. This legislative framework predates the rapid development of aquaculture since the mid-1980s and current thinking on planning and environmental issues.  As a sensitive food industry develops, it is important that environmental issues are considered and that planning is controlled and organised to ensure that the industry continues to thrive.</P>
      <P>Ireland has an extensive coastline and clean waters, the ideal environment for this type of industry.  It is important that these assets are protected so that they can be utilised in the best interests of aquaculture.  Increasing worldwide demand for seafood is leading to investment opportunities and generating export revenue and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> The Bill highlights the need to provide alternative employment for fishermen and people living in coastal regions.  Senators will be aware of the changing nature of the industry and it is important that opportunities are created for those dependent on fishing and aquaculture.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture industry makes a significant and growing contribution to coastal communities. Its output is worth over £50 million per year and it employs over 2,000 people.  Further EU and national investment is taking place in the shellfish and fish farming sector with the objective of increasing output to over £100 million and creating an additional 1,000 jobs by 1999.  It will be important to examine how the new thinking on planning, licensing and environmental issues impact on economic development.  It is critical to this industry as it is to other natural resource industries.</P>
    <P>The new licensing system will introduce a time limit of four months for processing licences.  That is an important development as it allows for applications to be dealt with speedily and in an organised manner.  There are strict penalties for non-compliance with licences.  That is important to oversee the industry and how the licensees are carrying our their operations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that it will be open to the Minister to delegate the function of deciding on licensed applications and the review of licences on particular categories of applications and reviews to the officer of the Department.  An independent aquaculture appeals board will be established to determine appeals against decisions of the licensing authority and a statutory objective for determining appeals within four months will apply.</P>
    <P>The board will consist of a chairman and five ordinary members with knowledge or experience of aquaculture, environmental or wild fisheries, planning development or industrial or community development and they will be appointed by the Minister.  It is important that various elements of the industry will have a say on the board.  It will be easy for such a board to deal with the applications.  People with knowledge of all aspects of the industry will get the opportunity to vet each application and deal with them in a proper and informed manner.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appeals procedure &mdash; a period of one month for lodging an appeal and a requirement to state the full grounds of appeal. Other parties to an appeal and everybody else who wishes to do so shall be entitled to make written submissions within one month.  The Minister has approached this in a broad and open manner by giving everybody an opportunity to express their views.  There is a mechanism in place for those who object to applications to express their concerns.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and his officials on this Bill.  It can only give add to a major boost to all concerned in this fast developing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  However, we should have had it many years ago.  Senator Fitzgerald will agree with me.  There will be licensing and regulation of aquaculture, which is badly needed, and also an aquaculture licence appeals board.  Aquaculture is of great value to peripheral and coastal areas in the south and west but as I come from the south-west, I will confine my remarks to that area.  From Kinsale westwards beyond Bantry Bay to the Kerry border at Ardgroom, many people make a good living from aquaculture.  That is why there is a need for regulation and licensing.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of hard work involved, especially in the development of piers. Aquaculture is quite different from deep sea fishing as it involves a great deal of contact with onshore facilities.  Our marine laws resemble those of a land locked country rather than an island country.  Ireland has priceless natural assets around its coast and has good access to harbours. The common fisheries policy and the implications of the Intergovernmental Conference with regard to fishing need to be examined.  Some people say we benefit from membership of the EU but of the £2,000 million worth of fish caught in Irish waters, only £100 million enters Ireland.  While we have 16 per cent of EU waters, we have only 2.9 per cent of the catch.  This needs to be regulated along with aquaculture.  France, Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal have come together in a southern European alliance.  They have 28 votes and are able to form a blocking minority with 26 votes.  This needs to be dealt with especially as the Intergovernmental Conference concludes in July 1997.  I appeal to those involved in the Intergovernmental Conference to take the future into account when dealing with a common fisheries policy.</P>
      <P>Aquaculture accounts for 25 per cent of total fish production and provides 2,946 jobs.  Onshore facilities are important for this industry.  Deep sea fishing involves the catching of fish which are then brought to shore and that is the end of the process.  Grading for mussel fishing takes place on shore and consequently we need regulation for this.  Many activities, for example, tourism operate side by side with aquaculture.  There is also pleasure boating, swimming, skiing and cruising in many harbours.  It is imperative, therefore, that there be proper regulation and that areas be designated for fishing and licences granted to those complying with the regulations. Aquaculture developments in Bantry Bay must coexist with developments on Whiddy Island in the interests of employment and tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Marine, county councils and local authorities will be involved in regulating aquaculture.  Landing facilities must be taken into account in the development of aquaculture and I welcome recent developments in west Cork where moneys were granted for Ardgroom, Ahakista and Roaring Water Bay, where strong, well developed local aquaculture activities are ongoing.  Many local families are <Col N="1161" /> involved in an area where other types of employment are non-existent.  Such moneys are well spent; they will keep people in the peripheral parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the process for application and regulation has been put in place.  Applications should be dealt with quickly &mdash; other speakers have referred to delays of four months &mdash; because when the appeals system, which I welcome, is operative there will be a time limit of one month within which to make objections.  There is no leeway in this.</P>
    <P>While many objectors are genuine, there are others whose reasons are flimsy.  They do not take into account that they could be preventing a person from making a decent living or from developing a natural asset in an area.  We should take into greater account the local objector who may be genuine rather than the outsider who may have unrealistic grounds on which to object.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I know the Minister of State will guide it through all Stages.  He can be assured of the support of the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  In his speech the Minister of State said:</P>
      <P>... one of my primary concerns in the drafting of the Bill was to endeavour to strike the necessary balance between the essential development needs of the aquaculture industry and the acknowledged and real concerns of other parties.  Getting this balance right is essential to ensure that the development of aquaculture is planned and regulated in a sustainable way.</P>
      <P>I welcome this and have no doubt that the Minister of State will strive to the fullest to achieve a proper balance between all of the parties concerned.</P>
      <P>Concerns have been expressed by the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards that there was no consultation with them in the drafting of the Bill.  As the Minister of State is responsible for these boards, perhaps he would liaise with them before Committee Stage.  They rightly state that they should be active in the policing of waterways and other such functions and have outlined sections of the Bill with which they are concerned.  These are not serious, nevertheless, the Minister of State should attempt to resolve them before Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I will speak in more depth on Committee Stage.  The fisheries boards should be actively involved in the consultation and assessment process and in the issuing of licences.  Perhaps the Minister will address this in his reply.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí uilig a ghlac páirt ins an díospóireacht, na tuairimí a nochtadh anseo agus don fháilte don Bhille ó gach taobh den Teach.  I thank Senators Fitzgerald, Belton, Calnan and Burke for their contributions to the <Col N="1162" /> Bill and their welcome for it.  The need for the development of the aquaculture industry has been referred to by Senators in terms of its importance for employment, especially in coastal communities.  It is important, with almost 3,000 jobs in such communities now dependent on the industry, as are additional jobs in the processing and support sectors.  A further 1,300 jobs are to be developed under the operational programme. The ESRI estimates that for every one job in primary production in fish farming, there is a further one and a quarter jobs in the processing and support sectors.</P>
      <P>The importance of aquaculture can also be gleaned from the fact that the demand for marine food is increasing all over the world, while at the same time pressures on wild fish stocks are increasing.  For example, the FAO estimate that by 2010, the market demand for marine food will have outstripped supply worldwide.  The only way in which the increasing demand for fish food and marine food can be met is by farming it.  This is evident from the fact that, as it stands at present, a quarter of the fish produced in this country is now farmed.  The product the consumer sees on the supermarket counter, especially certain species such as salmon, mussels and oysters, is probably farm produced.</P>
      <P>The Irish aquaculture industry produces a product of high quality that is clean, produced in environmental conditions of a high standard and is very healthy.  The Bill seeks to lay the legislative basis for the continued sustainable development of this industry and to strike a balance between the need for the industry to develop and the need for us to ensure that the highest environmental standards are maintained in its development.</P>
      <P>The early years of the industry have been marked by a degree of controversy, misunderstanding and litigation.  I hope this legislation will ensure a future on which the industry can be developed in harmony with other users of the sea and the reasonable concerns expressed about that development.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald, in particular, for his offer to facilitate the expeditious passage of the Bill.  I would be happy to respond in the following Stages to the concerns which might be raised.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat surprised by Senator Burke's contribution.  The regional and central fisheries boards were consulted and we are aware of their views on the legislation.  They will continue to be involved in the licensing process; for example, they are represented on the aquaculture licence vetting committee which advises the Minister on licence applications.  Their views on the legislation have been taken on board.  Everybody involved in this area, including those who have responsibility for protecting our wild fisheries, acknowledges the need for this Bill.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and I look forward to responding to any questions during the subsequent Stages.</P>

      <P>The Foyle fisheries area is governed by the Foyle Fisheries Commission which was established in 1952 by legislation in both the Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland jurisdictions.  It is a joint body.  At present the Foyle Fisheries Commission does not have responsibility for aquaculture in the Foyle fisheries area.  We are currently preparing, with our counterparts in Northern Ireland, new legislation covering the Foyle area which will permit the Foyle Fisheries Commission to be responsible for aquaculture development in the Lough Foyle area.  That legislation, which I hope to introduce in the new year, will deal with that aspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 deals with trial licences, which are very awkward to administer. What size of development would be allowed to have a trial licence?  Could somebody apply for a trial licence for 100 per cent of their cages or whatever, or will only a minimal amount be allowed?  They might have to remove the development after two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the trial licence is to allow an applicant to test out a site or to carry out certain experimental work in relation to a particular development.  For obvious reasons such activity would, by its nature, be limited.  The intention is to set down by way of condition in any trial licence issued the limitations on such a licence.  A trial licence is only issuable on a one-off basis and is not renewable.  If someone applied for a trial licence to grow oysters in a particular area and then, after a successful trial, wanted to proceed with a full scale development, a licence <Col N="1164" /> would have to be applied for in the normal way under this legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>When someone wishes to engage in an aquaculture development it is usually necessary to try out different sites for their suitability.  This is particularly the case with shellfish development because some species grow better in some parts of bays than others.  It would normally be sufficient in a trial licence application to set out the general intention of the applicant with regard to the development and the type of trials proposed.  If a full scale development is intended, the applicant is required under this legislation to make a full application for an aquaculture licence, setting out in that application the full details of the development.  That is then subject to the appeals process provided for in the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the rules and regulations, but would the developer have to make a planning application to his or her local authority before applying for a licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>If the development involves any land use it is necessary for the developer to apply to the planning authority for planning permission in the normal way.  That would be a matter for the planning authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Must the applicant have planning permission before he seeks a licence? Can he be granted a licence and then seek planning permission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be done either way.  For example, an applicant could seek planning permission from a local authority for the physical development associated with the work which could not proceed without an aquaculture licence and a foreshore licence if that is also required from the Department of the Marine.  It can also be done the other way round.  If an applicant seeks an aquaculture licence and a foreshore licence initially, the issue of such licences is obviously subject to planning permission being granted by the local authority for physical works carried out on land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has raised another aspect.  It was stated that the time limit would be four months.  However, the Minister and I are aware that an application for a foreshore licence can be a slow process.  Will the foreshore licence <Col N="1165" /> be granted within four months?  Will all the applications for licences be processed together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator is aware, the fish culture and foreshore aspects are two separate processes.  The intention is that both applications would be progressed simultaneously.  The legislation does not require that the foreshore licence be decided at the same time, but I draw the Senator's attention to section 82 which states:</P>
      <P>The Minister, in considering an application for a lease or a licence under the Foreshore Acts, 1933 and 1992, which is sought in connection with the carrying on of aquaculture pursuant to an aquaculture licence, shall not consider matters of which the licensing authority, in considering an application for an aquaculture licence is, under <i>section 61</i> of this Act, required to take into account.</P>
      <P>This provision will avoid duplication in the consideration of the foreshore licence application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section deals with licence applications.  I may be straying a little from the areas dealt with by the Department of the Marine but if onshore installations are involved in the application, they must be considered by the local county council.  It is the council's function to deal with such matters, but could the applications for planning permission for the onshore facility and the aquaculture licence be dealt with together?  It is important to speed up the process and ensure the two are progressed simultaneously.  Can proper liaison methods between the Department of the Marine and local authorities be created?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two different areas of responsibility involved in this matter. Responsibility for land use and planning decisions under the planning Acts rests with local authorities and An Bord Pleanála.  This is set down in legislation.  If one is applying for a feed house, a store or a boat house associated with an aquaculture development or for a domestic dwelling, the application is made in the usual way to the local authority.</P>
      <P>I understand Senator Calnan's point that there should not be a prolongation of the application process.  If a person wishes to start an aquaculture development, they should not be strung out by having to apply for an aquaculture licence and then planning permission, which could involve a long time in terms of the application going from one authority to the other.  The fact that the aquaculture and planning processes, in terms of the rules set down for time limits, etc., are now similar should cause both to run simultaneously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect that a person who wishes to start an aquaculture development will apply to the licensing authority for an aquaculture licence and to the planning authority for the buildings.  The two can run concurrently and the time limits, including the appeals processes, are very similar. <Col N="1166" /> The types of procedures which apply under this legislation are similar to the planning procedures. In practice, the Department liaises closely with local authorities if applications contain fish culture and planning aspects.  I envisage that this will continue in the future and that the Department's and the local authority's engineers and planners will co-operate closely on applications.</P>

    <P>Section 11 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12(3) states:</P>
      <P>The licensing authority shall, as soon as practicable after determining an application, advise the applicant in writing of its decision and require the applicant to publish a notice of the decision in such form and manner as the licensing authority indicates.</P>
      <P>Would it be possible to include a provision that all interested parties should be notified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of section 12(3) is to require the applicant to publish a notice of the decision in a formal manner.  While there is a requirement on the applicant to publish a notice of intent to apply, there has been some criticism that there is not at present any formal method by which the public is notified when a decision is made.  The subsection places an obligation on the applicant to publish a notice in a form prescribed, which will probably be similar to the earlier notification system, to notify the public that a decision has been made.</P>
      <P>The current practice is that the interested parties, particularly the statutory bodies, including the fisheries boards, are notified when a decision is made.  It is intended that this practice will continue.  I am prepared to consider Senator Burke's point before the Bill is dealt with in the other House and whether it is necessary to include a specific amendment in that regard or if it can be done by way of regulation.  I agree with Senator Burke that it is desirable and necessary that bodies, such as the fisheries boards, should be notified when a decision is made.  In practice, they will know about it in any event because they are and will be part of the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My query is similar to Senator Burke's.  The onus is placed on the applicant to publish the fact that he or his company has secured a licence.  That is slightly vague.  Section 12(3) states that the licensing authority shall: &ldquo;advise the applicant in writing of its decision and require the applicant to publish a notice of the decision&rdquo;.  We need to strength this provision, although I have not tabled an amendment.  Will <Col N="1167" /> an applicant be required to publish a notice in a newspaper?  If it was a normal planning application, the applicant would be required to put a notice in a newspaper stating that he is applying to the Department of the Marine for permission so the public would be made aware of the application.  That gives people who wish to object or to make a submission the opportunity to do so.  It is hard to understand why the applicant is required &ldquo;to publish a notice of the decision in such form and manner as the licensing authority indicates.&rdquo;  Should we not indicate where a person should be required to publish a notice, for example, in a local or a provincial newspaper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>At present when an applicant applies for a licence, he or she is required to advertise it in a newspaper and in a Garda station.  A concern which has been brought to my attention is that when a decision is made, there is no formal process by which there is public notification of it being made.  For example, a decision was made earlier this year to grant a temporary licence for following purposes to a fish farm in Mannin Bay, County Galway.  The application had been in the process for a number of years and objections had been made to it two or three years before the eventual decision was taken.  Some of the objectors made the point that the time lapse between when they made the objection and the decision was made was so great that they had concluded the issue was dead and nobody told them when the decision was made.</P>
      <P>This section provides for a process where there will be a requirement to publish a notice of the decision in a form to be set down by regulation. They will probably have to follow the same path taken in relation to the application.  If there is a time lapse, which might arise if there is a protracted appeals process, the decision will be notified to the public so people cannot say they were not told when it was made.  It is intended that the applicant will be required to place that notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the duration of a licence is 20 years, but section 15 states it is perpetual.  The 20 year period is too long and a licence should only be granted for a maximum of five to ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 15 provides for a maximum period for the life of a licence, which in general will be 20 years.  It will be open to the licensing authority to grant a licence of a shorter duration if it believes it is warranted.  It is reasonable that the industry should have some security because as technology develops, the level of investment required for aquaculture development, in particular the fin fish side, is considerable.  It is necessary to allow a reasonable period so that somebody considering investing in aquaculture will know they will have a licence for a reasonable period and that it will not expire after investing heavily in the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is similar to section 7 (2) which states: &ldquo;A licence may be granted notwithstanding the existence of any public right to fish in any waters to which the licence relates&rdquo;. Would this not infringe on the right of the public to fish?  Should there not be provision in the Bill for full public consultation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision in the Bill for public consultation and among the matters which must be considered are the rights of other users of the water, including the fishing rights of other users in that area.  When an aquaculture licence is granted for oysters or bottom culture mussels or some such species and the applicant invests considerably in feed, sets down the seed and has to wait a number of years for it to mature before <Col N="1169" /> it can be harvested, one must protect the rights of that applicant against people who suddenly claim to have a public right over that area of foreshore.  There have been such incidents.  An aquaculture development might start in an area where nobody can recall any fishing activity having taken place or a public right to fish ever having been declared and, as soon as there is seed in the ground and oysters in the sand, somebody might claim to have a public right over the area.</P>
      <P>Under the legislation, if there are public rights to fish or there are alternative uses of the water, they can be set out by way of objection at the time the application is made.  They can be taken into account by the licensing authority and they can be the subject of appeal to the aquaculture licence appeals board.  The Bill requires that such concerns be taken into account.  However, when the licence is granted this provision will prevent such claims being pursued to the detriment of the operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The boundaries are set out in the application.  An applicant for a licence is required to submit a map showing where the operation is to be carried out and describing the operation. There are also certain requirements with regard to the quality and scale of the map.  From time to time the location of the operation might interfere with or be close to a navigational channel or another operation.  There are two ways of dealing with such cases.  The attention of the applicant will be drawn to the difficulty and he or she will be given the opportunity to amend the map and relocate the site of the operation.  The second way of dealing with the problem is by applying conditions to the licence.</P>
      <P>The conditions will officially set down where the operation must take place.  Nobody will be entitled to farm for fish outside an area which has been mapped and for which a licence has been granted.  Should anybody do so they can be prosecuted under section 65 which provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions will be entitled to prosecute a person who breaches any of the conditions in the licence, including where the operation should take place.</P>

Will there be a marker whereby somebody who sails into an area of water will know they have broken the law and entered a place they had no right to enter?  The Minister of State referred to a person harvesting fish outside the area stated in the licence.  How will outsiders know they are in that area?

      <P>The conditions in the licence will set out how the licence holder should mark the area.  The licence holder might be obliged to place buoys or beacons to ensure the area is visible and safe.  There are probably three types of operation at issue.  One is a fin fish operation which will take place in cages.  The cages will be marked and visible to other users of the sea.  The second type of operation is rope culture for the cultivation of mussels; the practice has been to mark the area with similar coloured buoys in the same bay.  The third operation is a bottom culture activity which does not involve a structure in the water, other than on the seabed, so normal boating activity does not interfere with it.</P>

      <P>Have safeguards been put in the Bill to prevent people who may get involved in aquaculture and have a land base restricting the use of beaches?  This has happened in the past in West Cork.  People who acquired land near the sea wired off parts of beaches as private property, knowing that the area between high and low watermark is the property of the Department of the Marine and is open to the public in general. Someone could start off a land based and a sea based activity and the connecting area could be wired or walled off.</P>

      <P>Are all of the places where licences are to be granted designated for aquaculture, or is every place open for such designation?  If cages, which are fairly permanent, are designated for aquaculture, is there an onus on somebody to ensure they are marked on navigational charts?  I am Chairman of the Dingle Harbour Commissioners and we continuously give messages to Valentia radio saying, for example, that a light in Dingle Harbour is not operational.  As soon as the light is fixed, everything is back to normal.  There are times when a buoy may break loose.  There is an onus on us under the legislation to advise shipping that may be coming into Dingle Harbour that this is happening.  All the marker buoys are marked on the chart.  A yacht came into Ballydavid Harbour <Col N="1171" /> last year and sheltered on the western part of it where it was close enough to an anchor.  How will they know if they come back this year that there are no objects or cages there, unless they are marked on a chart or they are so advised?</P>

      <P>To answer Senator Burke's question, section 20 prevents trespass, damage or interference with a fish farming operation. Unfortunately there was an example in the west earlier this year where fish cages were damaged and the fish released.  Section 20 is not intended to prevent or interfere with the rights of officers of fisheries boards or the Department as regards inspection and the carrying out of their statutory functions which are set down in the Fisheries Act, 1980.  I will double-check and consult legal opinion that the powers the fisheries boards have in relation to the carrying out of their normal functions in this area will not be interfered with by this section.  I assure the Senator the purpose of this section is to deal with illegal interference with fish farming operations and not with the carrying out of the duties of fisheries boards officers.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of markings, section 71 enables the Minister to make regulations which will set out various requirements which will have to be met by licence holders.  They will include the way in which the operation is to be marked. I do not have a direct answer for Senator Fitzgerald on the question of marking on navigational charts.  I will make some inquiries with our marine survey office and establish to what extent the concerns the Senator has raised can be accommodated.</P>

      <P>The position at the moment is that an application for an aquaculture licence goes to the aquaculture licence vetting committee, which is made up mainly of technical experts drawn from the fisheries boards, the Marine Institute and the Department.  They examine the application and make a recommendation to the Minister as to whether a licence should be granted.  Unless there is an appeal to that decision through the courts, that is the end of the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> Under the new procedure the aquaculture licence vetting committee will continue to function.  Applications will be processed through that committee and a decision made on whether a licence should be given, and with what conditions. When that decision is made, there will be a period of one month within which either the applicant or a third party can appeal to the aquaculture licence appeals board, which is being established in a form which is quite similar to the Bord Pleanála model.  This provides an appeals mechanism which does not exist currently.  It is also one which is generally familiar to the public.</P>

      <P>This relates to an earlier observation of Senator Fitzgerald.  It will not be a full time board because the volume of work it will do would not justify that.  The board will convene from time to time to decide matters and it will be serviced by a secretariat.  Some of the matters which the aquaculture licence appeals board will be asked to address will be complex, relating perhaps to environmental impact statements, impact on water quality and points raised earlier on navigational matters.  It is reasonable that the board would have the power to engage, as it sees fit, consultants or experts to advise it on those matters.  It will be a matter for the board, which will be an independent body, to decide who it should engage and it would be quite inappropriate if the Minister or any of those directly interested in the licensing process were to influence that.  If an issue arises as to the impact on water quality, for example, it may be necessary for the aquaculture licence appeals board to engage consultants or specialists to advise on it.  This section gives the board the freedom to do that and as an independent board it will engage those people independently.</P>

I am sure Senator Burke is aware that the prosecution process is an independent one and our advice is that the prosecution function should be exercised independently through the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There might be a case where a fisheries board, in the exercise of its statutory functions in relation to the protection of wild fisheries, objected to the grant of a licence.  A conflict of interest could be claimed in such a situation where the same fisheries board was unable to pursue prosecutions in that case.  In other cases the fisheries board itself might be engaged in aquaculture.  The Central Fisheries Board operates hatcheries which are aquaculture developments and which are licensable under this legislation.  It would clearly not be appropriate that the prosecuting authority would be the same fisheries board against which the prosecution might have to be taken.</P>

      <P>Section 75 is to provide for an orderly continuation of the existing operations and jobs in aquaculture.  When this Bill comes into operation the question will arise as to the status of existing licences.  Section 75 continues the validity of existing licences under the new Act.  If, for example, a person received an aquaculture licence last year for a period of ten years, of which nine years have yet to run, it would be unreasonable to suggest that he or she would have to apply again under this legislation. This enables the licence to continue for the remainder of its life.  The existing licences have already been the subject of a public consultation process under the existing legislation.  Senator Burke also raised the question of the lapsing of licences which have not been taken up.  Section 69 provides for a licence to lapse or be withdrawn.  Where aquaculture in respect of which a licence has been granted has not commenced within two years after the date on which the licence was granted, the licence shall cease to have effect.</P>

It is almost impossible to recapture thousands of fish that have escaped from cages.

I share the considerable concern about this which has been expressed by the operators, in particular with regard to the finned fish, relating to taking the greatest possible care to ensure that there is no escape from a fish farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of section 77 is to reinforce the obligation on a fish farm operator to ensure that the farm is properly secured and that there are no escapes.  There are obviously some <Col N="1177" /> circumstances in which it is easier to recapture stock than in others.  If stock went up a river, for example, it would be easier.  It depends also on how quickly the escape was detected.  The primary purpose of this section is to reinforce the obligation on operators of fish farms to ensure escapes are prevented and quick and effective action is taken immediately after an escape to deal with the damage.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, your officers and the Members of the House for their co-operation in the speedy passage of this Bill through the Seanad.  I appreciate the constructive approach taken by Members on this legislation.  It was not contentious and there has been agreement across the House on the need for new legislation on aquaculture and the need for an approach to its development which is balanced between the need to develop the industry and protect fisheries and the environment.  Sometimes those two objectives come into conflict and I thank Members for acknowledging that the Bill strikes that balance.</P>
      <P>In particular I refer to the contribution made by Senator Burke.  He indicated on Second Stage that he was raising concerns raised with him by the fisheries boards.  I indicated then that I was surprised those concerns were not raised directly with me since the publication of the Bill. However, I reassure him that the Bill expressly provides for the protection of wild fish stocks and ensures that the development of aquaculture is in harmony with the requirement to protect and conserve our wild fish stocks and fisheries.  The last point raised by Senator Fitzgerald on escapes is very much in that domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Senator Burke's contribution I detected a concern that some of the roles or functions of the fishery boards in relation to their involvement with the aquaculture licensing process and monitoring of aquaculture activity were to be diluted.  I assure him there is no such intention in the Bill.  Before the debate in the Dáil, I will proofread the Bill to ensure that if any section unwittingly casts doubt on the role of the fishery <Col N="1178" /> boards or compromises them in carrying out their statutory functions I will deal with it in the Dáil.</P>

Generally, it is a huge improvement on what was in place.  As the Minister of State said, sections on speeding up the process of granting licences have been tightened.  It is good legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many reasons I raised this issue.  Many questions have been asked and answers are needed if the innuendo and confusion which surrounds this sorry episode is to be dispelled.</P>
      <P>In November 1994, a Cork property developer stated he wished to purchase a three acre site at Horgan's Quay from CIE for a price in excess of its market value.  This issue was discussed at the CIE board and it was deemed an appropriate price to pay for the property.  The site was to be developed as a technology park with potential employment of up to 800.  The vast majority of businesses and people in general welcomed this proposal.  The latter saw it as an opportunity to find employment in a city with exceptionally high unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The good news for Cork people did not last long because the former Minister for Transport, <Col N="1179" /> Energy and Communications decided to go on a personal crusade to seek out and destroy corruption in semi-State bodies.  After some time, he found little evidence to uphold his initial allegations and decided to portray this development as a cosy cartel.  There then followed the crazy debacle of surveillance and allegations of corruption in the semi-State sector resulting in a full Dáil debate in the autumn of 1995.  Owing to the exceptional publicity and smear campaign which followed, the development of the Horgan's Quay site was shelved.</P>
    <P>It was claimed in the Dáil debate that other parties would have expressed an interest in the site had they known it was for sale.  Would the Minister confirm if any of these have put forward proposals to purchase or develop the site?  Does the Minister agree with the stance his former colleague took on this development?  It was an unprecedented and callous attack on an individual who has done much to promote and develop Cork city.  As a public representative for the constituency of Cork North-Central, I am appalled at the way the former Minister conducted this affair which has resulted in the potential loss of 800 jobs.</P>

      <P>The history of this matter is important if we are to assess the current status of the site and find out if any proposal is in the pipeline to compensate Cork for the loss of up to 800 jobs.</P>
      <P>If the Minister knew then what he knows now, would he have supported the actions taken?  This is something which must be found out because all businesses in the city welcomed the proposal. There is now a three acre site in a prime location whose only productive aspect is the rats.  There has been no movement since November 1994.</P>
      <P>I find it incomprehensible that this Government could have allowed a Walter Mitty-type character to damage the semi-State sector and the names of many good characters in Cork city.  That is why I raised this matter.  Will the Minister say if we are to be compensated for the loss of the potential 800 jobs, if any interested parties which were claimed during the 1995 Dáil debate to be interested in the site have expressed further interest and what is the current status of the site?</P>

    <P>I wish to explain at the outset that the way <Col N="1180" /> Coras Iompair Eireann uses the various assets at its disposal, including its property holdings, is a matter which falls entirely within the responsibility of the CIE group itself.  Under the Transport Acts, the board of Coras Iompair Eireann may dispose, whether absolutely, for a term of years or for any lesser period, of property which in its opinion is not required for the discharge of its duties.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has no function in individual property disposals by the CIE board.</P>
    <P>As regards the Horgan's Quay property, the Department understands that the site is still used on an operational basis.  Comprising approximately three acres with a possible option on a further two acres, the site is part of the group's total property at Kent railway station amounting to about 30 acres.  The question of its future is currently under review as part of a comprehensive examination by the group of its operations and other commercial requirements at Kent Station.  CIE expects that this review will be completed in early 1997.  As part of the review, it may be necessary to move some operational elements of the freight business to another location.</P>
    <P>The general aim is to put in place a development plan for the station which will substantially improve the integration of public transport in Cork city.  This is in line with the group's efforts to improve and develop the services it delivers to its customers in its core business as a public transport operator.  Options are also being examined for other on-site developments which would be specifically suited to this major transport node with a view to using the group's overall property holdings at the station in such a way as to maximise business development opportunities for the group.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been advised that, over the past year, a number of inquiries have been received by CIE about the development of the Horgan's Quay site.  The parties concerned have been advised that, on completion of the comprehensive review to which I have already referred, CIE will be in a position to deal with these inquiries.</P>
    <P>The overall policy now pursued for CIE property places emphasis on an aggressive and fully commercial strategy.  The aim of this is to develop the group's property portfolio in such a way as to maximise rental income and other direct revenue from the properties themselves while generating additional core transport business and improving facilities for passengers on a commercial basis.  Specific opportunities are pursued through joint venture arrangements, leases and conditional or full disposals as appropriate in individual cases.  Where it is decided to dispose of property which is surplus to operational requirements, the group's policy is to <Col N="1181" /> proceed as far as possible by way of an open public tender procedure in the interests of maximising the realisable value of the assets in question.  Under this policy, CIE's income from its property portfolio has increased from £0.67 million in 1987 to £1.2 million in 1995.  Specific initiatives undertaken in line with the group's commercial approach to its property assets include the major development schemes for Heuston and Connolly Stations recently announced, the development of restaurant, bar, retail and service facilities at various locations throughout the mainline rail network, together with the installation of facilities such as vending machines and public telephones on station platforms.</P>
    <P>There have been two further positive developments in CIE's arrangements for handling its property portfolio.  In the first place, the CIE board's property sub-committee has been reinstated, in line with the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, to assist the board in the commercial development of its property portfolio.  Second, CIE has introduced new procedures whereby all substantial property disposals must be cleared by the board on the recommendation of the group chief executive following an open public tendering process.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that the statutory position remains unchanged.  Responsibility for property disposals is a matter for the CIE board.  While the Minister has no function in this area, he considers that there exists within the CIE group the professionalism, commercial approach and institutional arrangements necessary to ensure that proposals for the future use of the Horgan's Quay site can be developed and processed in a manner which would have his confidence and that of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>In his matter on the Adjournment, Senator Kelleher spoke of surveillance and this is precisely what we need in Clondalkin.  As the Minister knows, Clondalkin village has radically changed over the last ten to 15 years.  What was a small village with a thriving trading centre is now a vast conurbation.  While this presents great opportunities for the traders it also provides difficulties in terms of the level of attacks on them and their property.  This is causing great difficulty for the people and, particularly, for the Chamber of Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chamber of Commerce and the local community require, and ask of this Government to seriously consider, the CCTV surveillance system which is successfully operating in Temple Bar.  That system is now being launched in O'Connell Street and two further programmes will be in place next year.  The community is asking the Minister for Justice to look favourably on such a system for Clondalkin village.  We are <Col N="1182" /> aware that 50 per cent of the funding comes from the community.  Those funds are in place and ready to be used should the Government give this project a green light.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider the expansion of this scheme to Dublin South-West and Clondalkin village in particular.  It is long overdue and, if put in place, will make huge inroads into reducing the level of crime and vandalism in the village.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter which is also of interest to me.  The Closed Circuit Television, CCTV, monitoring system currently in operation in the Temple Bar area of Dublin was launched on 26 October 1995.  It was the first scheme of its kind in this country to be operated by and under the control of the Garda Siochána and was introduced with the co-operation of local interests and operated on a pilot basis.</P>
      <P>An evaluation of all aspects of the Temple Bar system and its effectiveness during its initial period of operation was carried out earlier this year.  The report on the review of the system concluded that, in the appropriate locations and under correct conditions, urban CCTV systems as an aid to policing can deliver benefits.  The Garda authorities report that the CCTV system has had a beneficial effect on crime prevention and detection in the Temple Bar area resulting in a significant reduction in the area's crime rate since its introduction.  It has contributed to the detection of a number of offences including public order offences, road traffic offences and some crimes relating to robbery and drugs.</P>
      <P>Work on a Garda system for the O'Connell Street area is now at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that it will be operational in the very near future.  As a result of the additional funding made available by the Government in the anti-crime package for the expansion of Garda CCTV systems, the Minister for Justice recently decided to provide funding for CCTV systems in Finglas and Tralee.</P>
      <P>While the Minister is fully committed to the concept of CCTV as an aid to policing and would like to see the scheme extended to other densely populated areas both in Dublin and around the country, this will have implications for Garda personnel and resources and must, of course, be viewed in the context of overall policing operations.  These CCTV systems must be carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures and before any such schemes can receive public funding they will be subject to specific technical and procedural standards set by the gardaí and will be subject to open tendering in accordance with the normal public procurement procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> The Minister is aware of the interest expressed by the Clondalkin Chamber of Commerce in a CCTV system for their area and she wishes to acknowledge the Senator's commitment to the project.  However, a number of other applications have also been received from local authorities and commercial interests in Dublin and other parts of the country and these will be considered when priorities for future systems are being <Col N="1184" /> drawn up early next year.  The Senator will understand that the Minister will be co-operative in considering such a scheme for Clondalkin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State and I know he will join with me in advancing the campaign for a CCTV system in Clondalkin.</P>
