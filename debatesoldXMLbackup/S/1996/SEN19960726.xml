Dáil Éireann has agreed to the amendments made by Seanad Éireann to the National Standards Authority of Ireland Bill, 1996.  Dáil Éireann has agreed to the amendments made by Seanad Éireann to the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996.  Dáil Éireann has passed the Courts Bill, 1996, without amendment.</P>

      <P>I have received notice from Senator Norris that, on the Adjournment of the House today, he wishes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the light of the ongoing developments in Northern Ireland, to ensure that Irish representatives at the United Nations take a prominent role in the ceremonies surrounding the international day of peace on 17 September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Norris as suitable for discussion on the <Col N="1342" /> Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Before giving today's Order of Business, I know I speak for everyone in the House when I congratulate a very gutsy little Irish woman, Michelle Smith, who won three gold medals at the Olympic Games, an amazing achievement.  Today we will enact legislation to curb the activities of those who destroy the health, hope and aspirations of young Irish people.  Michelle Smith has inspired hope and determination in young people and I know I speak for the House in saying we are proud of her.</P>
      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2 and 3. On item 1, I propose 20 minutes per spokesperson and ten minutes for other speakers.  With the agreement of the House, speakers other than spokes-persons may share time.  I propose a sos of 15 minutes after the Second Stage of item 1 and then the Remaining Stages will be taken.  On item 2, I propose 15 minutes per spokesperson and ten minutes for other speakers.  Item 3 will be taken without debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the Order of Business.  If there is a need for a sos between the Second Stage of item 2 and the other Stages that would be agreeable. It is worth noting that, in the Message from the Dáil, three important items of legislation, which were debated and amended in this House were agreed by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I add my congratulations to Michelle Smith.  I wish her well tonight.  I wish all our Olympic competitors every success. In the light of our debate on crime today, our superb Olympic competitors who have given Irish people so much pleasure, should be seen as role models to the many young people who find themselves involved in crime.  I hope we will have more heroes and heroines returning with medals from the Olympic Games.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the congratulations to Michelle Smith and the other members of the Irish Olympic team. There is much discussion about the construction of a 50 metre swimming pool. As somebody who deals daily with the needs of children, I would prefer if the Government were to build ten 25 metre pools in places where there are none at present, than to invest huge amounts on super Olympic athletes.  It is better to try to cater for the large numbers of people who want to participate in sport and it would be a better use of money. I urge the Government to consider support for sports clubs of all kinds. Teachers and parents around the country would feel that a 50 metre pool in Dublin, for example, would be of little use to those who live in the country.  I will develop this point in today's debate.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Wright, I welcome the fact that Bills, as amended by the Seanad, were accepted by the Dáil yesterday. They were well considered Bills and have been strengthened by the amendments made in this House.  It is a very satisfactory that the other House accepted them without discussion.  We accept the outline of the Order of Business and look forward to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulties with the proposed Order of Business.  I join with the Acting Leader in congratulating Michelle Smith.  It is a wonderful achievement.  None of us thought we would see in our lifetime an Irish athlete winning three gold medals.  We hope she will win a fourth this evening.  One must stand in awe at the level of commitment and training that brings somebody to that level of success.  I endorse the remarks made about people of this calibre and would mention the other Olympic athletes in the same context regarding the value they have as role models to society.  The role of a supportive family in terms of achievement is also very important.  This is very evident in the case of Michelle Smith.  Her family deserve congratulations as well.  I also congratulate Jim Sherwin and Gary O'Toole on the quality of their commentaries. <Col N="1344" /> They were illuminating.  I hope Michelle wins a fourth medal, but even if she does not her success has been stupendous.</P>
      <P>One of the characteristics of great champions is that they lose with grace. People in America might learn a lesson from this.  We hope that a generosity of spirit will be evident in the rest of the Games and that the true spirit of the Games will emerge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I wish to convey our congratulations to Michelle Smith on her excellent achievement.  Those of us interested in television sport could never have imagined the enjoyment, excitement and tension which we experienced since the Olympic Games commenced.  Michelle Smith is a fantastic role model for the youth of our country.</P>
      <P>Approximately 3,000 children will meet at Mosney in a few weeks' time to participate in the National Finals of the Community Games.  Their wish is to participate.  Winning a medal is a bonus; the most important aspect is to provide people with the opportunity to participate.</P>
      <P>What has been achieved to date has been beyond all our dreams.  I wish the other athletes the very best over the next couple weeks.  To those who do not win let me say that participation is more important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the comments made thus far, especially with regard to those made by Senator Wright on the amended legislation which passed through the Dáil yesterday.  I pay tribute to my colleagues, Senator Daly and Senator Cassidy, as well as to the Leader of the House and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, on the amendment which I hope creates a precedent for the future where members of local authorities will no longer be excluded from nomination to semi-State bodies.  The amendment was fought for tenaciously in the House <Col N="1345" /> and was graciously accepted by the Minister of State.  This is what democracy is about.  It also reflects on the role of this House in improving legislation. The fact that it passed through the Dáil yesterday without debate indicates the merit of the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the remarks on Michelle Smith, I appreciate what Senator O'Toole said.  He has his agenda as an educationalist and he is right.  I ask the Acting Leader to convey to the Government the widespread feeling that we should have the best facilities, including a 50 metre pool.  It does not matter if it is in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but this is our final meeting of this session, a special sitting and I have not yet had the chance to raise the matter.  The House should reflect the widespread feeling that we should have the best facilities to prepare our athletes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It has in the context of asking the Leader to raise it with the appropriate Minister.  If necessary I will put down an amendment to the Order of Business because I feel strongly about this, as should many other people. I have no monopoly in this matter.  To take up Senator Neville's point, I am proud to have been associated with the Community Games since its inception and I too hope to be in Mosney.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but it is an important matter.  I am my party's <Col N="1346" /> spokesperson on Arts and Culture.  Who would question the viability of spending on the arts?  Why then should anyone question the viability of a 50 metre pool?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to say something similar to Senator Mooney but I will put it in a form you may be able to accept, a Chathaoirligh.  Would the Acting Leader ask the Minister of State responsible for sport to come to the House in the autumn for a debate on funding for sport facilities?  On an allied topic, it was great to see Francis Barrett, a member of the travelling community, representing Ireland in the Olympics.  It reminds me that one year ago, the task force on the travelling community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator, I allowed one Member from each group to refer to our contestants in the Olympics and I do not want the matter covered again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Well done, Senator Kelly, one has to get it through to this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The context is slightly different, a Chathaoirligh.  The report of the task force on the travelling community <Col N="1347" /> was launched a year ago and has yet to be debated in this House.  I ask the Acting Leader to arrange such a debate for the autumn as the report contains much which should be discussed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Acting Leader to raise with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry the decision by the Government and the EU to take the money for compensation under the BSE scheme from other areas of the CAP.  This is a big setback for farmers at a time when it has been established that there has been under-expenditure to the tune of £500 million at EU level that will be paid back to different Governments.  It is unfortunate that other parts of the agriculture budget should have been raided to fund BSE compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise on today's Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but I am asking the Acting Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Government.  As Presidents of the various Councils of Ministers we are now in a position to act in this area.  I understand this money has not yet been paid back, it is only being costed at present.  Perhaps we can do something about this over the next six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate our Olympic athletes, not only Michelle Smith but also Francis Barrett who carried the banner for his community.  It was great to see the travelling and settled communities come together to celebrate his victory.  We can search every Programme for Government, including that of Labour/Fianna Fáil, and every party's manifesto but none mentions a 50 metre swimming pool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no will to build it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Just because successive Governments have not done it, does not make it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of a politician's job is standing up for other people but we should begin standing up for ourselves. I resent and reject Gary O'Toole's criticism. He said politicians should stay away from the celebrations.  Politicians have helped to provide facilities for clubs in all sporting bodies.  I ask the Acting Leader to agree with my sentiments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Acting Leader bring the following to the attention of the Department of the Taoiseach? There is confusion about the allocation of the peace and reconciliation fund.  There are three organisations distributing the peace and reconciliation fund.  There are 74 organisations involved as well as Cooperation North, IBEC and a token contribution to local authorities.  It has been widely advertised that funding is available from the peace and reconciliation fund.  People seeking money are confused as to where they should go. The southern Border counties have received a box of applications that can hardly be lifted off the ground.  Where do they go with them?  The reply given is that there is no money for bricks and mortar in the South.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator have a question on today's Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Acting Leader ask the Department of the Taoiseach to deal with this matter?  There is a strategy committee, the peace and reconciliation forum and the county enterprise boards.  There is organised confusion in the country, especially in the Border regions.  Will the Taoiseach make a statement to clear up the confusion? He should get his act together because we do not want to mislead people who intend to set up small businesses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible to make provision for the presentation of a report by the delegation who recently visited Iran so that, for example, we could pay tribute to the outstanding job done by the Cathaoirleach?  It is important the House should be informed of these matters, particularly since it was a historic visit and the first time a delegation, composed entirely of Members of this House, went abroad. The Irish public and taxpayers are entitled to know how wisely public representatives act on their behalf in difficult and arduous missions that are sometimes regarded as junkets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate our athletes, particularly Michelle Smith, Francis Barrett who is representing his community in an extremely dignified way, and the other members of the different teams, including those who were unsuccessful.  We sometimes forget, particularly when under attack by the American media, that the Olympic ideal is to compete and not simply to win.  I congratulate all members of the team.  I want to make one mildly sectarian point.  There has been unseemly wrangling between the different parties about 50 metre swimming pools.  The Independent Members raised this issue about six weeks ago and received a very dusty answer from Minister Allen.  I sincerely hope that, in the light of Michelle Smith's success, we will reopen this debate and that we will have a 50 metre pool and 25 metre swimming pools throughout the country.  The Seanad will then show it plays an important role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>A comment was made after the 1988 Olympics that we did extremely well because none of our swimmers drowned.  Thank God that attitude has changed.  I ask the Acting Leader for an early debate on the attitude of Government, the national lottery <Col N="1350" /> and various public bodies to sport. There is a grave need for a debate on the attitude of some to elite athletes and to those who want to compete.  We can only have a comprehensive debate if the Minister with responsibility for sport and the Minister in charge of the national lottery come to the House.  The report on the ten year review of national lottery disbursements is now available.  We a need a comprehensive sports policy.</P>
      <P>The question of a 50 metre pool should be discussed rationally.</P>

We have reached the interim stage of the national development plan and the National Roads Authority will make decisions shortly into which we should have an input, although we have not had one since it took over responsibility for main roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a day when we are to discuss crime, we should not forget the atrocious crimes which have been committed in Rwanda and Burundi over the past number of years.  We should be <Col N="1351" /> cognisant of the fact that there has been coup in Burundi which could have desperate consequences for the African continent.  I am not sure if anything can be done at this stage, but the international community should adopt a coordinated approach to ensure that what happened in Rwanda will not happen in Burundi in the next few weeks.</P>

Is é an chéad uair ríamh a chuala mé Gaeilge á labhairt ar ócáid mar sin.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Michelle Smith on her wonderful achievement. As Senator Dardis said, the peak of fitness which she has achieved is amazing. No doubt it has something to do with the good food and drink she is getting in the &ldquo;Poitín Stil&rdquo;.  I strongly condemn the disgraceful attitude and the behaviour of the Americans.  Because they could not or did not win, they did not have the graciousness to congratulate Michelle Smith.  This House or the Government should make a protest to the US State Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Lee said.  I asked on an earlier occasion whether the House could debate the report of the review group on the Constitution but I did not receive an answer so I will ask again.  I say this because I was worried watching this wonderful lady, Michelle Smith, sing every word of &ldquo;Amhrán na bhFiann&rdquo; on receiving a gold medal and responding to Seán Bán Breathnach in the first language. <Col N="1352" /> If all these young athletes who plan to emulate her swimming feats started speaking Irish, what would that do to the recommendation of this group of august people who want to see first language's role reduced?  It is a very worrying trend.  If they emulated her, we could have all our young people speaking Irish in no time.  Can we have a debate on the matter in the House?</P>

      <P>I want to add my congratulations to Michelle Smith, but, as one who spent five years knocking my head off the wall trying to get a 50 metre pool and national sports centre off the ground, I am sceptical of any such development being realised.  It is the same irrespective of which side of the political divide a person is because the reality is &mdash; let us face it &mdash; that we, as politicians, have no interest in sport.  It is not an issue with the electorate.  As somebody said earlier, it was never in any party's manifesto.  Even if it was, there are people in the Department of Finance who will never commit any serious expenditure on sport.  If Michelle's wins did nothing other than wake us all up, she will have done well but we need a major change of attitude among senior officials in the Department of Finance.  The last three Ministers for Finance, who include a former Taoiseach and the Leader of Fianna Fáil, the current Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach need to instigate a major change.</P>

      <P>When congratulating Michelle Smith a number of Senators raised the issue of sport and the 50 metre pool.  A few weeks ago there were calls for a debate on sport and, from my recollection, the Leader said he would <Col N="1354" /> organise a debate in the autumn.  I assume nobody is calling for an earlier debate on any issue at this stage. Senator Fahey introduced a note of realism on the provision of a 50 metre pool but I think public opinion has shifted in recent times.  I certainly hope we will be able to move in that regard. There seems to be an assumption that if its goes ahead it will be based in Dublin. However, other places have made submissions, including the National Training and Coaching Centre at the University of Limerick.  It would not automatically go to Dublin.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, for coming into the House today and for her and the Government's support for Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill.  I am sure the Minister will join me in congratulating Deputy O'Donoghue for introducing this important legislation.  This Bill was presented to the Dáil the day after the terrible murder of Veronica Guerin and a short time after the equally terrible murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe.  The Minister will agree that these murders and the increased public perception that the level of organised crime is spiralling out of control have galvanised Members of the Oireachtas with a firm and determined sense of purpose to move forward together in the fight against crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Donoghue and the Leader of Fianna Fáil stated, our party will be completely constructive in relation to any other legislation introduced by the Government to bolster the fight against crime.  Much of the legislation introduced by the Government during yesterday's meeting of the Dáil <Col N="1356" /> will be welcomed by this side of the House.  A point may be made about there being a famine and then a feast, but that is another day's work.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House because it seeks to deal with the problem of crime and the term &ldquo;untouchable&rdquo; which is associated with that problem. This is the central criminal concept the Bill seeks to address.  The Taoiseach correctly stated that no one in the community is untouchable.  In so far as various criminal elements have sought to place themselves on an untouchable pedestal in recent years, this imaginative Bill created by Deputy O'Donoghue is to be welcomed as spearheading the fight against those who claim to be untouchable.  The legal concepts in the Bill are interesting, bold and imaginative. The Minister will agree that it brings civil law concepts to bear in the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>The first of the two civil law concepts being brought to bear in the criminal sphere is the notion of interim and interlocutory orders.  Members are aware of these orders from their use in common law injunctions where a person enters court <i>ex parte</i> and says stop, a wrong is about to happen.  That concept is now being transposed to the criminal sphere.  It will enable an officer of the Revenue Commissioners or another authorised person &mdash; the Bill was correctly amended in this regard by the Dáil &mdash; to enter court to request the freezing of assets which they believe are the proceeds of crime and which should not remain in the ownership or control of the person in whose name they are held.  It is very important that an officer of the Revenue Commissioners can enter court directly to make an application.</P>
    <P>The second vital element of the Bill introduces the concept of the civil burden of proof to cases involving criminal assets.  The existing criminal law stipulates that to secure a conviction one must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person has committed an offence. The creative aspect of the Bill is that the civil burden of proof will apply, in other <Col N="1357" /> words, the lesser proof of the balance of probabilities which will basically be 59 out of 100 as opposed to 99 out of 100. These two civil law concepts will be transposed to the criminal sphere.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister agrees that, good as it is, the Bill will not be enough in itself.  What are needed are convictions, action and freezing orders because members of the public are not interested in legislation; they are interested in results.  People want results.  They want to feel safe and know that gangsters are not roaming the streets.  One aspect of this Bill I hope we will see will be a reporting mechanism to the Dáil and Seanad.  We would like to know how many freezing orders will be made over the next few months.  We would like a proper report from the Minister.</P>
    <P>My second point deals with publicity. I accept that in certain cases some proceedings may be held in private and that there are specific provisions in the Bill relating to this.  The use of publicity against some of these untouchables is itself a way of dealing with them.  If freezing orders are made, the public has a right to know and would like to know, and we as legislators should know.  I think the Minister is on record as saying that assets have been frozen under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  I would like to know if there have been freezing orders under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>I was delighted when the Government decided to accept this Fianna Fáil Bill.  Almost all the Government amendments have been good.  The amendments in relation to receivers &mdash; where one may be appointed to administer the property &mdash; and the sections relating to the bankruptcy of the respondent and dealing with the official assignee, winding up, immunity, etc., are welcome.  We have had similar freezing legislation before.  This was the subject of a High Court decision I believe in the Clancy case.  In that case, Justice Barrington said there were three requisites to any freezing legislation: one, the respondent had a right to be heard, two, there <Col N="1358" /> would be a scheme of compensation in cases where somebody's assets had been wrongfully frozen.  In this legislation the respondent has a right to be heard at the interlocutory stage, and that is good. However, there appears to be a dilution in the amendment to the original Bill in relation to the respondent putting in an affidavit as to his or her sources of income over the last ten years.  In the original Bill, this requirement of an affidavit for ten year income was mandatory but is only at the discretion of the court in the amended Bill.  In all cases where the Garda or Revenue Commissioners have come to the conclusion that an interim freezing order should be made or subsequently an interlocutory, the affidavit of the respondent in relation to his or her means should be obligatory.  This would put an onus on such a person to state in writing how and why they came to own this and that.</P>
    <P>Part of the public frustration is that the Revenue Commissioners have in several cases by way of personal audit arrived at ordinary citizens' doors and asked how they earned this and that.  If the Revenue Commissioners or the Garda Síochána come to the initial conclusion that a restraining order should be made, it should be mandatory for this affidavit to be sworn by the respondent.</P>
    <P>Another point I make relates to loss. The public do not want this Bill to result in large compensation claims from people who have had restraining orders made against them and subsequently discharged.  I accept, and Deputy O'Donoghue accepts, that somebody who is the subject of a restraining order which turns out to be based on incorrect information is entitled to compensation. However, that compensation should be reasonable and confined to actual loss as opposed to economic loss.  If somebody puts a freezing order on my bank account which contains £10, I might be entitled to get back my £10 and interest on that sum.  However, I am not entitled to claim that if I had had that £10 on a Friday I could have invested it in a few shares or put it on a horse and won £1 million and therefore claim £1 million <Col N="1359" /> compensation.  It is important that we do not open the door to astronomical claims for compensation against the State, but there is a question mark on the degree of loss for which a wrongly accused person can apply.</P>
    <P>If we are going to get tough with the godfathers of crime, let us get really tough with them.  There is an ironclad determination in the Fianna Fáil Party that the godfathers of crime will be tackled head on.  Despite the introduction of this legislation, there is still a feeling throughout the country that many people will continue their gangster activities unhindered.  Two weeks ago, on 14 July, I was shocked to read on the front page of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> that crime bosses had halted a crackdown by the Revenue Commissioners on the selling of illegal cigarettes. The import of the story was that the Revenue Commissioners had been stopped in their investigation into the illegal sale of cigarettes by an intolerable level of intimidation.</P>
    <P>I presume the person who wrote the story is a responsible journalist.  I also presume that her claim that she was informed about this by the Revenue Commissioners is true.  If that is the case, it is extremely serious that the Revenue Commissioners could admit that they have been intimidated into stopping a serious investigation.  I hope the Minister can give an assurance that nobody is selling illegal cigarettes in any part of Dublin city.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most important and far-reaching Bills to be introduced in the fight against crime.  It is draconian legislation because it interferes with one of the primary constitutional rights, the right to private property. However, nobody has the right to use private property to trample on other people's rights.  Nobody has the right to private property by breaking the law and nobody has the right to misuse or abuse the right to private property in order to conduct a life of crime and deny the State its lawful revenue.</P>
      <P>I commend the Government for having accepted this Bill.  I hope the Minister will join with me in praising Deputy O'Donoghue for the magnificent work he did on the concept of this Bill and in revolutionising to a certain extent the fight against crime by way of legislation which, as an Opposition spokesperson, is all he can do at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions about the constitutionality of this Bill have been raised.  Not I, the public or the Minister want people who might be the subject of a restraining or freezing order taking this legislation through the courts so as to render it ineffective for several years.  The public demands that Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill will be effective very quickly.  I hope &mdash; I am not sure if this can be communicated in official form &mdash; the President will refer this Bill to the Supreme Court so that an early decision can be made as to its constitutionality.  I will go further. If the Supreme Court finds any aspect of this Bill unconstitutional, I hope the Minister will quickly bring forward a <Col N="1361" /> constitutional amendment so that criminals cannot hide behind their constitutional rights while denying others the basic right to live a normal and free life in their own country.</P>
    <P>There will be no delay on this side of the House in supporting any changes to the Constitution, including changes in relation to bail, if that is required in the fight against crime.  There is nothing that will not be done, there is no support that will not be given by this side of the House if the Minister moves quickly and decisively to fight the people who organise themselves professionally to enrich themselves and to undermine the very foundations of our democratic society.</P>
    <P>In the name of Veronica Guerin, Detective Garda Gerry McCabe and all the unnamed victims of crime in this country, I commend Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill to the House.  I praise the Government amendments to it and I hope it will be passed speedily by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Second Reading of the Proceeds of Crime Bill in this House and acknowledge the role played by Deputy O'Donoghue in the other House in originating these proposals in what was then the Organised Crime (Restraint and Disposal of Illicit Assets) Bill, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In agreeing to the principles of the Bill I undertook to carefully examine the issues raised by the proposals, constitutional and otherwise, and to bring forward any necessary amendments. The latter half of Senator Mulcahy's contribution gave me the impression that as a lawyer he might still have some worries about its constitutionality.  His colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, did not have a scintilla of doubt about the constitutionality and correctness of his Bill as first published.  On Committee Stage the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, was able to show on my behalf that the Bill needed very substantial amendment to guard as far as possible against the risk of the Bill being overturned on constitutional <Col N="1362" /> or other grounds in the courts if the President exercises her right to refer the Bill, or if any individual sent it, to the courts.  As a result, the Bill the House is dealing with today has been extensively amended and has a new short title.</P>
    <P>An examination of the Bill will show that what started out as an eight section Bill is now an 18 section Bill.  It has been amended from the Title down as is necessary.  This measure, which the Government is accepting in its wholly amended form, and the other measures which the Government brought forward yesterday are necessary.  We are not trying to create a Richter scale of toughness where I am really tough, somebody else is really, really tough and somebody else is really, really, really tough.  That is not what we are about; we want to put effective legislation on our Statute Book.</P>
    <P>I do not mind whether the newspapers call me tough or soft.  I will do my job in a responsible way and ensure that any legislation to which I put my name will, to the best of my ability and that of the legal advisers and staff available to me, stand the test the time.  That will continue to be my primary responsibility in accepting Opposition legislation. Other Bills have not stood the test of time, despite the best efforts and endeavours of Ministers over the years.</P>
    <P>In addition to this Opposition legislation, I have also accepted serious legislation put forward by Senator Henry, Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy Eoin Ryan.  That legislation is undergoing extensive amendment but the spirit and principle of the Bill are accepted.  However, Members of the Opposition who frame Bills naturally do not have the same access to legal advice as I have available to me.  I am acting as the Minister for Justice, rather than as Nora Owen, TD.</P>
    <P>The amendments are extensive but they have kept in place the main principle of the original proposals, as Senator Mulcahy said, which is that the High Court is being empowered to freeze and ultimately dispose of property <Col N="1363" /> which it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, is the proceeds of crime.  While keeping to the broad principles of the original proposals, the amendments which I put forward in the Dáil and which are now part of the Bill, have made some changes of substance. Perhaps I might briefly mention the more important of these and explain the reasoning behind them.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the main change of principle brought about by the amendments is that the scope of the Bill has been expanded to cover the proceeds of all crime.  I do not want to differentiate between one sort of crime and another in terms of this power.  The original proposals covered only certain offences, namely, the theft, illegal acquisition and/or destruction of property valued in excess of £10,000 or the distribution of controlled drugs.  Even then, the Bill would only have applied to these offences where they were organised or committed by two or more persons.</P>
    <P>Apart from serious drafting errors in the provision itself, the concept of such a narrow list of offences, allied to the requirement that more than one person must have been involved, could have led to the most serious difficulties in the actual enforcement of the provisions of the Bill.  It would have been a legitimate defence &mdash; if I can use that word in a civil context &mdash; for a person facing a freezing order, and where there was some evidence of criminality, to say that he or she had derived the property from an offence committed alone or that the property derived from offences not listed in the Bill.  A court might have had great, if not insuperable, difficulties in overcoming this argument, perverse as it would be.  It might simply have been impossible for a court to find, even on the balance of probabilities, that property derived from a particular type of offence rather than another or that a particular offence had not been committed alone.  At the very least, this limitation would have made it immeasurably more difficult for a court to implement the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> I did recognise, of course, that one of the objectives of this limitation was to target the Bill on persons with significant property rather than petty criminals. I think this point is substantially met by limiting the provisions of the Bill to property which is worth at least £10,000 and which is the proceeds of crime.</P>
    <P>Another change of substance, although in keeping with the principle of the original proposal, was in the procedure for applying for and obtaining an interlocutory order.  This is the main freezing order, which can last for up to seven years.  The Bill as published provided that a court, on application to it, was obliged to make an interlocutory order in respect of property where an interim order already applied to the property, unless the person claiming to own the property could show that it was not the proceeds of crime.  In other words, the Garda or the Revenue Commissioners simply had to point to the existence of an interim order which, of course, would be made <i>ex parte</i>, for the onus to shift to the respondent.  The revised proposals require the Garda or the Revenue Commissioners to make a case to the court that property is the proceeds of crime, and only then does the onus shift to the respondent.  It is still a tough measure but it is now a more balanced one which is an important factor in legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>I refer back to all our efforts to find an adjective when people say &ldquo;He or she is tough&rdquo;.  We have to be careful and cautious about serious infringements of people's rights that might actually have the effect of not being able to do what this legislation is trying to do.  The respondent will have the opportunity of hearing the case against him or her and of then responding to it rather than, as was originally provided, having to show that the property is not the proceeds of crime without necessarily hearing the case made by the State at all.</P>
    <P>Another change is that the onus of proof of innocent origin of property will be on the person claiming to own the <Col N="1365" /> property at the disposal stage.  This was the case in regard to the freezing of property in the original proposals &mdash; and of course is still provided for in the revised Bill &mdash; but not in relation to the disposal of property.</P>
    <P>I believe that to have required a court at the disposal stage to be satisfied that property was not the proceeds of crime, without any obligation on the respondent to show that the property was of innocent origin, could have weighed too heavily against the purpose of the proposals. If it is thought necessary, when seeking to freeze property, to place an onus on a person claiming to own the property to show some proof of innocent origin, what is likely to happen if that onus is removed when it comes to seeking the disposal of the property seven years on?  Presumably, the property would in many cases simply be handed back, perhaps even with compensation, as the State would no more be in a position to discharge the full onus of proof at the disposal stage than it would have been at the freezing stage.</P>
    <P>In addition to these changes, I put forward a number of amendments to deal with the practicalities of freezing property for a number of years.  Provision is now made for the appointment of a receiver to manage frozen property and there are parallel provisions for the variation of freezing orders where it is essential for some business or trade, subject of course to any restrictions which the court may consider necessary. All these provisions are new.</P>
    <P>I also thought it desirable to provide for a number of eventualities which were not catered for in the original Bill, such as the bankruptcy of a person whose property is frozen or the winding up of a company which owns property which is frozen.  These are essential provisions, the absence of which could have, indeed would have, severely affected the practicability of the Bill. There were also a great number of drafting amendments to the extent that the Bill was, in fact, revised in its entirety.  I will not dwell on the detail of all those changes but it does illustrate <Col N="1366" /> the need there was for a fundamental revision of the Bill.</P>
    <P>What we now have in the Bill before this House today is, as a result of the changes which have been made to it, what I hope will be an effective mechanism for dealing with the unacceptable phenomenon whereby a certain number of people have, through a pattern of criminal behaviour, acquired significant wealth.  Of course, this phenomenon is not new and I want to stress that there are already extensive provisions in place, in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, to deal with this situation.  While not inferring that Members of the House are unaware of that, there is certainly ignorance concerning that both among the public and media commentators. Under that Act, where a person is convicted of an offence on indictment, the court can, on the application of the DPP, inquire into whether the person has benefited from the offence and, if it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there has been such a benefit, the court can require the repayment of that benefit.  If necessary, the property of the convicted person can be confiscated to satisfy the requirement of the court.</P>
    <P>There is also provision for the DPP to apply for a court order freezing property in advance of a prosecution to ensure that the property will be available for any confiscation.  These powerful provisions are already in place and are working.  The measures in the Bill before the House will, therefore, supplement the existing provisions for confiscating the proceeds of crime.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy said he hoped there would be convictions, etc.  One of the difficulties of this Bill is that it does not require any conviction or a crime.  It is simply a mechanism to freeze, to take out of use the criminal's assets.  This Bill might freeze their bank accounts, etc., but it does not go on to convict them of the crimes from which they might have made these moneys.  That will be done by the 1994 Criminal Justice Act.</P>
    <P>In 1994, when the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, was <Col N="1367" /> examining ways of freezing assets, she chose the recommendation and advice of the Law Reform Commission which said it might be dangerous to go the way we are going and that it was better to link the freezing and confiscation of assets with a conviction.  This meant we ended up with the assets being frozen and the person locked up, hopefully following a conviction, and we had a double victory.  This legislation is another mechanism and tool to freeze assets. However, we should not underestimate the need for the existing legislation because it is working.</P>
    <P>The disclosure mechanism in the 1994 legislation required building societies, banks and other financial institutions to report lodgments of over £10,000 where there was a suspicion it might have been a money laundering exercise &mdash; I am sure Senators have seen signs to this effect in banks and other financial institutions. Since I signed into order that disclosure mechanism, up to 31 December 1995, seven months after it was put in place, 199 disclosures with a monetary value of £19 million had been made; in the first seven months of this year, a further 182 disclosures with a monetary value of £9.5 million had been made; that means a total of £28.5 million was reported as being in some way suspicious.</P>
    <P>In 1995, only 15 of the 199 disclosures have been written off as not constituting an offence.  In accordance with the law, the Garda has a certain period after the disclosure is made by the bank or financial institution in which it can carry out a speedy investigation to ensure that, for example, the person's grandmother had not died and left him with a large sum of money, that he had come into a windfall or won the lottery.  There is an immediate examination to ensure there is no unjustness involved in lodging this money.  Somebody in this House might come into a windfall and find a disclosure order being made on them.  There is a period during which the Garda try to check there is not a legitimate reason for a lodgment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> Only 15 of the 199 disclosures, and a small number of the 182 disclosures this year have been written off as not constituting an offence.  The remainder are being, or have been, examined.  I will not go into the kind of detail Senator Mulcahy wants.  I am not the prosecuting authority and I do not rehear and retry cases.  There have been confiscation orders and people are being convicted as a result of the information from the disclosure of money lodgments. This is working and this new Bill will add another piece to the jigsaw of dealing with people who commit crime in this country and try to launder money through legitimate structures.</P>
    <P>These proposals have to be seen in the context of the other measures which I and the Government have already put in place.  First, we are putting in place the mechanism to effectively implement these new provisions.  I am referring to the new Criminal Assets Bureau to be headed up by a Chief Superintendent and comprising Garda, Social Welfare and Revenue officials.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, yesterday introduced legislation to provide a statutory basis for this new bureau which will mark a new approach in focusing the concentrated attention of all the relevant authorities on persons suspected of having substantial criminal assets.  Work on the bureau will start immediately in advance of the passing of the legislation.  This work will be greatly facilitated by a second Bill introduced yesterday by the Minister for Finance, the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Bill, 1996, which will enhance the free flow of information between the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners in relation to criminal assets.</P>
    <P>These developments also have to be seen against the backdrop of other legislative initiatives which I have recently or am currently undertaking.  The Drug Trafficking Bill was given final approval in the Dáil yesterday and is one of the strongest pieces of criminal law passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Criminal Law Bill is currently before <Col N="1369" /> the Dáil and I look forward to debating it here.  It abolishes many outdated provisions which needlessly complicate the criminal law, such as the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours, and puts in place clear and effective powers of arrest for the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, is also before the Dáil having passed Second Stage only yesterday.  One of the main purposes of the Bill is to free, as far as possible, members of the Garda Síochána from non-operational duties in the courts, for example, by permitting the giving of evidence by certificate.  All these measures are part of a comprehensive and coherent plan to reform our criminal justice system and make it more responsive to the demands of our time.  This needs more than legislation, vital though that is.</P>
    <P>Every aspect of the existing structures needs to be examined and improved. We need more prison spaces &mdash; not the freeze experienced over the last decade &mdash; and more probation and welfare officers.</P>

Each and every one of these things has been or is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> I welcome the Bill before the House today.  It forms part of a wider programme of reform which I and the Government are undertaking.  I acknowledge and pay tribute to the work of Deputy O'Donoghue in originally bringing forward these proposals. I hope that I have been able to play a part in improving them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the Minister was heard to generously pay tribute to Deputy O'Donoghue from the other side of the House.  That is the type of approach to this legislation which gives confidence to the general community and population.  There is no one person in whom all the wisdom for the resolution of these difficulties resides.</P>
      <P>For three to ten years, we were told that the elimination of unemployment or the reduction of the numbers unemployed should be the first priority of Government.  In the last month this has changed and Government representatives and representatives of other political parties are now saying that the first priority for any Government must be the attack on crime.  I make that point to stress that there is a fickleness in public opinion which should not be allowed to determine the long-term direction of State policy in looking after the common good.  Measures must be taken but it takes a steady hand to move this forward properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a close connection between unemployment and the crime rate. However, it gives sustenance to the wrong people to give the impression that, because disadvantage can lead to crime, it should in some way should be offered as an excuse for crime.  They are two significantly different things.  There can be no excuse for people who make a decision to commit crime.  It is wrong and will always be wrong, regardless of background.  There may be circumstances which alleviate it and there may be fundamental issues which need to be addressed, and that is an issue to which I will return.  Once in this House I said cynically that with the prison population <Col N="1371" /> coming mainly from easily identifiable areas of the State, it might be cheaper and easier for the State to build walls around certain housing estates and call them prisons given the lack of opportunity there for young people.  I still believe that there is a direct correlation between disadvantage and crime but I do not believe in the &ldquo;weeping liberal&rdquo; line that crime can be excused because the criminal is disadvantaged.  Once we make those distinctions we can move forward.</P>
    <P>There is a similar situation with the common good and civil liberties.  They are both important in their own way and those who go only for one or the other miss that importance.  We have all heard stories of people who felt their civil liberties were infringed upon or that power was being abused.  A Minister of State &mdash; he was not a Minister of State at the time &mdash; said that at one time he was being persecuted by a Garda.  I do not know if he was right or wrong but the case got much publicity at the time and the person felt there was an abuse of power.  I do not know if there was and for my purposes it is not important.  An engineer friend of mine who has never been in trouble, he never even received a parking ticket, but he happened to look like an escaped criminal and he was treated diabolically by the authorities. It was a case of mistaken identity but the man has been shattered since that time.  He was seen by many people accused of various crimes.  An apology might have helped but it was not even given; acknowledgement of mistaken identity was the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>I had grave reservations about the powers given to gardaí to break into people's homes on the basis of road traffic legislation initiated by the previous Administration and passed by the current Administration recently?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It was amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>My reservations were that people would find themselves on the wrong end of the legislation when <Col N="1372" /> their doors were broken down and the gardaí could claim they felt a person in the house was involved in a hit and run accident.  We will regret some of these measures but I make these points to offer a balance.  We need an overview and people should not be afraid in their homes.  As the Minister has said on a number of occasions, that is happening at present.  There is no real answer to it.</P>
      <P>When people from middle class areas talk of city areas noted for crime and criminals, it should not be forgotten that the most frightened people in the country live in those communities.  These are old people who bolt their doors with six or seven locks at 6 p.m. and will not go out until nine or ten the following morning. The people living in these communities are decent, hard working and honest.  They are the great victims in the sense that when their addresses are known they are assumed to be of a certain type.  It is not always appreciated that people living honestly in those areas are constantly the victims of crime; very often they do not even report them.</P>
      <P>The issues involved are bail, detention, evidence, courts, assets and jail.  I am distinguishing between detention and jail.  By detention I mean detention for questioning.  I recognise that I am going beyond the Bill but every other speaker has done this, including the Minister.  On the important issue of bail, 99 per cent of ordinary people believe that bail is given on the basis that the court is of the view that the person will not offend during the bail period.  That is not the case.  Bail is only granted when the court is satisfied that the person will not abscond from the jurisdiction.  The vast majority of people would agree that where a judge feels that a person might commit crime while on bail, bail should not be granted.  There would be full support for such an approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An associated step which might be taken is, for the small percentage of people on bail who commit crime, such offences should be factored into the sentences. Legislation tends to contain provisions for punishment for people found <Col N="1373" /> guilty of offences.  The Minister should introduce legislation to allow for such punishments to be increased in the event of an offence being committed while the person is on bail.  Additional pressure must be brought to bear on people not to commit offences while on bail.  Such a step would need enabling legislation and the Minister should consider it.  It would be well received by the public and would not infringe on people's personal rights.  It is a measure that would only have effect in the event of an offence being proved.</P>
    <P>Detention is the most difficult element on which to strike the right balance. The Minister has tried to tackle that with recently published legislation. I must admit to getting confused with what legislation has been published, what is pending and what has been passed.  Recent legislation will allow a period of detention for questioning to be extended in certain circumstances. There are few objections to such a move because it is positive and it creates a balance in allowing more protection for people taken in for the first time.  It is a measure which gives no sustenance to the weeping liberals nor to the hanging and flogging brigade, but strikes a balance between the common good and general civil liberties.</P>
    <P>It pains me to say that given the way society is developing, the nature of the need to protect the common good means that civil liberties will be constrained to some extent.  I regret that state of affairs, but I accept it.  It is our duty as legislators to ensure that it is as controlled as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of evidence, the recent move to allow Garda evidence to be presented in a <i>pro forma</i> or certificated manner is welcome.  Anybody who has followed a court case will have found a huge element of time wasting involved in the provision of the specific minutiae of the Garda handling of evidence and in having to bring gardaí to the stand to prove such technical points.  I support this move, although I am aware some of the Garda groups have reservations about it.  In general, <Col N="1374" /> however, the approach to the issue is clear and will be widely welcomed.  It will allow the court process to move more swiftly.</P>
    <P>There is less of a confrontational element, which is so central to the operation of the courts in this jurisdiction, in the UK jurisdiction where there tends to be a process of agreeing technical and other aspects of evidence before cases get to court.  I am not sure if this has developed by a process of legislation or evolution of court procedures.  The efficiency of the courts could be enhanced by having a process where certain items of evidence, after or leading up to the entering of a plea, could be agreed by both sides beforehand and would not have to be proven in the court.  This could save much time.  Will the Minister consider this?</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism of judges and the Judiciary over the past couple of months.  Since I was first elected to this House in 1987 I have become aware of the great distinction between the operation of the Executive and the Judiciary; that is a healthy distinction. While it is right that judges paid from the public purse should be answerable and accountable, that needs to be balanced in terms that they should not feel the way they do their business should be in any way constrained by the views of politicians.  Politicians are entitled to speak generally about the operations of the courts, but the courts themselves should implement legislation and make clear the way they conduct business.  If it is conducted incorrectly the Government should introduce corrective measures through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of members of the Judiciary, especially members of the higher courts, are people of the highest integrity.  They are sensible people and while I often strongly disagree with them, I have never seen them abuse their position.  It is when the judgments of the five judges of the Supreme Court are published that one can appreciate the tortuous process by which they <Col N="1375" /> interpret the law, to be clear about precedent and to move matters forward while taking account of the position of society.  As I said, they are people of the highest calibre.</P>
    <P>There have been too many examples in the lower courts of people whose idiosyncrasies have become legend. They remind me of the old parish priests before they came under the power of the bishops; they could do what they wanted and could not be sacked.  A District Justice in the midlands area expressed views on politicians and politics which crossed the divide between the Executive and politics on the one hand and the Judiciary on the other.  The words would have been better left unsaid.  Judges should be allowed proceed with their work and to organise themselves and deal properly with problems within their own profession.</P>
    <P>The need by people to prove that they came by ownership of assets innocently will be welcomed.  In any tightening of the justice system there is always the worry that the small person will get booted.  This is a classic example where this cannot happen.  A youngster from Seán McDermott Street does not have to worry about the seizure or foreclosure of assets.  It will only apply to somebody with assets and a person who is in a position of wealth and influence.  I welcome moves to tackle this aspect.</P>
    <P>Eight years ago I was involved with anti-drugs groups in the north inner city and I sat on a number of Government and European committees.  Mr. Felloni was first imprisoned about that time but people in that area knew he had salted away about £330,000 &mdash; a lot of money at that time &mdash; which stood to him when he was released in four years.  It will give people sustenance to see the wheels of justice catch up with him again.  Those like Mr. Felloni who have power, influence, property and flashy cars and spread their largesse around, become role models and success stories for innocent young people in their community. Those people should be beaten down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> We must move forward and tie this debate in with the education system. Many people in these communities do not have a system for distinguishing between right and wrong in the wider community.  The frame of reference is different from what it used to be.  A recent UK survey showed the most common way for young people to be introduced to petty crime was through robbing food off supermarket shelves.  I have no reason to believe Ireland is different &mdash; my colleague Senator Quinn probably knows more about this. These are not big robberies, they are just stealing a cake or a chocolate bar, but it is how involvement with crime begins.  The goods stolen do not cost much but it is easy to move from stealing something worth 50 pence to something worth £5 and upwards.  We must look at the problem at that level, to give people a new set of values and to give communities confidence that these values will allow people to live full lives and achieve their potential.  That is a hard thing to do and education on its own is not the answer but it is part of the solution.  I would like to develop these ideas at another time.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister.  She has had a few rough months but Ministers for Justice always do, and long may that continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the legislation and congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue for bringing it forward and the Minister for accepting an Opposition Bill.  Over many years Opposition spokespersons in both Houses have brought forward Bills which were automatically turned down by the Government. <Col N="1377" /> The first breakthrough was during the Fianna Fáil/PD Coalition when two Bills from Deputy Shatter were accepted.  I had the frustration of having quite simple Bills turned down and seeing the exact wording of my Bill subsequently introduced in other legislation by a Minister for Justice.  In that context I welcome the response of the Government and the Minister to Deputy O'Donoghue's Private Members' Bill. Its powers to restrain and confiscate assets are necessary to shift the balance of the application of our laws to the detriment of the criminal.</P>
      <P>I do not like using the term &ldquo;drug barons&rdquo; to describe organised criminals; &ldquo;drug super criminals&rdquo; is a better term. We give them an aura of something other than what they are by calling them barons.  Drug super criminals are adept at ensuring they are at arm's length from the coalface of criminal activity. They will not be found with their hands dirty.  They get lesser men to do their dirty work.  They organise the activity and plan the entrapment of vulnerable people into using drugs.  They organise the importation and distribution of lethal, dehumanising and often fatal substances.  Their underlings bleed unfortunate people of their income and force them to steal to feed their habit once they are addicted.  These organisers reap the vast benefits of their activity.  They live in big houses, have expensive lifestyles, frequently fly abroad and cannot be touched by the State forces of law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Conviction in court for criminal activity requires proof beyond reasonable doubt.  In a civilised society, this must always be the case.  Organised criminals, whether drug barons or those who organise spectacular robberies, are adept at ensuring there is no admissable evidence to obtain a conviction.  When arrested, as previously stated in the House, they stare at the wall and remain silent.  The recent changes introduced by the Minister regarding the right to silence will improve the situation. However, these professional criminals <Col N="1378" /> ensure they have an alibi when their hired hands commit the crime, whether it is robbery or the importation and distribution of drugs.  The dogs in the street know who these people are.  The late Veronica Guerin knew who they were and was prepared to expose them.  She paid dearly for her efforts.  The Garda knows who they are and it is impossible to accurately reflect the level of frustration within the Force at having to tolerate and look at the lifestyles and riches of the most notorious and dangerous criminals.  This lifestyle must be removed from them.  The law as it stands cannot deal with that but we have reached a point where the law must deal with it.  We can no longer tolerate the power and control these organised criminals have over our society.  The Bill before the House will play a strong role in doing this.  I share the regret that these measures are necessary.  However, the present drift towards anarchy must stop.  The super criminals must be dealt with.  We can no longer tolerate the brazen flaunting of their ill-gotten gains, often cleverly laundered and untouchable under present legislation.</P>
    <P>The solution to the drug problem is multifaceted.  The Minister for Health and the Minister for Education have taken initiatives on the issue of demand. By their nature these have a medium to long-term effect.  The issue of demand must be tackled as vigorously as that of supply.  I am confident this Government has introduced and will introduce measures to deal with the demand side of the problem.  There are many areas, especially in Dublin, where drugs are an integral part of people's lives.  They grow up without knowing a life outside heroin addiction.  Drug super criminals exist because there is a market for drugs.  Multimillionaire criminals are benefiting from this trade in misery and death and it has been known for many years that the State cannot deal with them.  Some years ago we saw a wealthy criminal drop his pants to gardaí in mockery and defiance when acquitted, despite the widespread knowledge that <Col N="1379" /> he was benefiting from professionally organised crime.  At present the State does not have the power to tackle, prosecute or to send these criminals to prison. Recent measures introduced by the Minister will dramatically improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The place to hit these untouchable super criminals is in their pockets and so deprive them of the proceeds of their work.  We must stop the excesses of the super criminals, take away their ill-gotten millions and eliminate their lavish lifestyles.  We must also stop the brazen disregard for those who aspire to a decent society and those who wish to succeed by hardworking means.  We must end the disregard for the Garda Síochána which is charged with ensuring a civilised society so that decent people can go about their work without being executed.</P>
    <P>Over the past decade confidence in the criminal justice system has been undermined.  Those who killed Veronica Guerin believe they are untouchable and under present conditions it appears they are.  Society, as we know it, will disintegrate if this continues.  Super criminals will become more powerful and will have more influence through fear and death than the Houses of the Oireachtas if the present drift continues.  Unless we introduce measures to stop this drift, we are looking into a very black abyss.</P>
    <P>This Bill will play an important role in removing from the super criminals the benefits of their dastardly occupation.  It will enable the High Court to freeze and dispose of the proceeds of crime.  It authorises the initial application for a restraining order to be made which will ensure the criminal does not remove the assets and frustrate the order of the court.  The court may, if satisfied, make an interim order freezing assets.  It must then order the person whose assets are frozen to file an affidavit within 21 days setting out the assets owned or controlled by him or her.  A person must also file an affidavit setting out the sources and amounts of income over the proceeding ten years.  The person in <Col N="1380" /> possession of assets which are suspected to be the proceeds of crime must state openly from where they came and how they were paid for.</P>
    <P>The Bill authorises the court to order the discovery and production of relevant documentation in the possession of any person.  Bank statements and business records can be obtained by the court for inspection.  The criminal will have to openly and publicly assert their claim of ownership and defend it in the face of cross-examination in the court. If the person can satisfy the court on the balance of probability that such frozen assets are not the proceeds of organised crime, they are unfrozen and returned to him.  If he fails to satisfy the court, an interlocutory restraining order is made to deprive him of the use of the illicit assets.</P>
    <P>The Bill also empowers the High Court to make disposal orders in respect of frozen property.  This will be done if no adequate affidavit as to the income and assets have been filed.  As the Minister said, the Bill and the issue being debated are not new.  In 1994 this issue was debated at length in this House when the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, introduced the Criminal Justice Act.  At the time some of us argued that the measures in this Bill should have been included in the 1994 legislation.  However, our arguments were rejected on the basis of a report by the Law Reform Commission. We accepted the views of the Minister that it would have been unconstitutional and that it was dangerous legislation.</P>
    <P>Under the 1994 Act if a person is convicted of an offence on indictment, the DPP can apply to the court for a confiscation of assets order requiring a person to pay a sum equivalent to the benefit which the court is satisfied they obtained from committing the offence. The Minister outlined the success of the 1994 legislation over the past 12 months. Is the standard of proof determining the extent to which a person benefited from an offence applicable to civil proceedings, which is the balance of probabilities, although of course the conviction <Col N="1381" /> itself must be obtained in the normal criminal standard which is beyond reasonable doubt?</P>
    <P>When the offence concerned is a drug trafficking offence the court is empowered to make strong assumptions about the origins of the defendant's property, such as, that property transferred to him or her in the six years prior to the proceedings were as payment or reward for drug trafficking.  The Bill before the House today is an important measure in tackling the drugs problem but is only a small part of the package to deal with that crime.</P>
    <P>For many years Senators interested in this issue repeatedly asked successive Ministers for Justice to bring the Garda force up to a proper level and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors repeatedly highlighted the need for this.  It is encouraging that at long last a Minister has responded positively to this request and I congratulate her on doing so.  I welcome the decision of the Minister and the Government to increase the strength of the Garda with the recruitment of an extra 400 gardaí over the period from 1 July 1996 to December 1997; this is in addition to the 350 new gardaí already planned for 1996 and a further 350 in 1997.  There will be a further 400 recruited next year.  We must also be conscious of the fact that there will be retirements so it is not a net increase but I reckon there will be a net gain of approximately 800 gardaí on the beat.  It is a very good start.  I understand the limitations with regard to training, etc., because the resources are not available.  If the Minister wished to train many more than number which I believe is necessary, I would hope the policy of recruiting those 400 extra gardaí would be continued until we reach the level for which the AGSI has repeatedly asked of 12 years ago when there were around 11,000 in the force.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the additional 300 civilians to be recruited between now and early 1997 to enable an equivalent number of gardaí to be released to operational duties.  In effect, the Minister is talking about a net increase of 1,000 <Col N="1382" /> gardaí &mdash; two lots of 400 recruited and 200 released from their desks onto the beat.  As I said, the Minister must continue to review this with the objective of bringing the total force to at least 11,000.</P>
    <P>Numbers are not the only determination of the Garda's success in tackling crime.  Efficiency and effectiveness play a key role in the delivery of any service. I welcome the fact that the Minister is reviewing this by the setting up of the co-ordinating group under the Strategic Management Initiative which will undertake a review of the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the Garda Síochána against the background of the challenges which it now faces and is likely to face in the future.</P>
    <P>The success of the implementation of the legislation is most important.  The super criminals must be denied the enjoyment of their ill-gotten gains.  This will be facilitated by the Government's decision to set up a special unit headed by a garda to target suspect assets, which will comprise Garda, Revenue and Social Welfare officials.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to refer to the prisons because I raised the issue of the revolving door policy over the years.  I remember that a féile in Thurles three or four summers ago caused the release of 100 prisoners in Limerick Prison to allow for arrests.  It is forgotten that there was a national debate about the problem with the revolving door system at the time.  It was raised here on a regular basis and totally ignored so I welcome that, at last, a Minister has responded positively to deal with the situation.  I welcome her decision to build a new remand prison capable of holding 400 prisoners on a site already available at Wheatfield Prison at an estimated cost of £40 million. I also welcome the fact that the Minister has obtained Cabinet approval for the capital funding for the construction of Castlerea's main prison which will provide 125 extra places and the women's prison in the Mountjoy Prison complex. I especially welcome the decision which I had called for on a number of occasions to expedite work in 1996 on a <Col N="1383" /> new wing at Limerick Prison which will provide 55 extra places.  The Minister has put in train a plan to create 640 extra spaces in our prison service.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue for introducing this necessary legislation and the Minister for accepting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which should be implemented as soon as possible.  I compliment Deputy O'Donoghue for introducing it.  It is difficult for someone on the Opposition benches to draft a Bill because they do not have the necessary resources. Deputy O'Donoghue was placed at a disadvantage because he did not have access to the expertise which is available to the Government.  The Minister's amendments were introduced as a result of legal advice which was not available to Deputy O'Donoghue.  We must consider how Opposition spokespeople can have access to relevant information and expertise.  The Bill has not been changed dramatically, so we must give tremendous praise to Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there is a provision for the DPP to apply for a court order to freeze property in advance of a prosecution. That suggests there will be a prosecution in every case where a freezing order is given.  I am not sure what effect a freezing order will have in terms of a charge being brought against the person against whom the freezing order is made.  Is the person charged with possession of goods which were deemed to have been stolen or acquired illegally after which a freezing order is given?</P>

      <P>In some cases it was discovered that the money may have been the result of windfalls or winnings from the national lottery and the applications were thrown out of court.  However, orders were made against a number of people.  The general public should be aware that these orders have been made and that there are suspicions about the origin of the assets held in people's bank accounts.</P>
      <P>There is no press reporter present in the House so this issue may or may not receive publicity.  Certain individuals who supposedly left the country in recent weeks did so as a result of the publicity they received.  If there is evidence under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, that certain lodgments were made which were deemed to be criminal in nature, why is this not publicised?  Why are photographs of those involved not published?  In America, police authorities publish photographs of what they term &ldquo;Public Enemy No. 1&rdquo;.  The individuals I refer to are criminals and enemies of the people and maximum publicity must be given to court cases in which they are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1385" /> Are there reciprocal laws in other countries with which the provisions of this Bill can operate in tandem?  Today's criminals will not build ostentatious houses or appoint their wives to operate equestrian centres.  A trip to Newry from Dundalk takes no longer than 30 minutes and it is easy for people to transfer ill-gotten assets across the Border; they can do so unless those assets are frozen.  I fear there will be a major transfer of criminal assets to Wales, Liverpool, Newry or Belfast if reports about the connections between various crime lords are to be believed.  Are there any reciprocal arrangements under which we can prevent these assets leaving the country because there are rumours that this is already taking place?</P>
    <P>Earlier speakers referred to increases in the numbers of gardaí.  On the surface it appears there will be a huge increase but, in effect, this is not correct because there will also be a large increase in the number of retirements in the next four years.  The age profile of the force means that many gardaí will retire in the near future.  Therefore, the number of gardaí will have to be substantially increased.  Why is a garda of 57 years of age or a detective of 60 years of age deemed to be no longer fit for duty? Successive Garda Commissioners have made a major input towards a resolution of the country's crime problems but they must retire at a relatively early age and are removed from the system. Replacements must be trained and we are losing people with great expertise.  If these officers are merely dropped from the system, they will not be replaced by recruits because their expertise in detective and surveillance work is built up over a long period.  It is also important to maintain the continuity of the contacts they developed during their careers.  I am not referring to increasing the compulsory retirement age.  If there are people in the Garda with certain skills they should not be forced out because they reach their 57th birthday.</P>
    <P>It was not until photographs of super criminals appeared in the papers that <Col N="1386" /> many members of the public realised they were consorting with criminals. There must be some law in Ireland which makes regular consorting with criminals a crime.  Therefore, it is important that all criminals should have their photographs taken.</P>
    <P>I am not sure about the lower limit of £10,000 because it infers that petty criminals whose proceeds from crime are below £10,000 are not criminals. That is a nonsense.  If they steal goods amounting to £10,000, they can steal £20,000, £50,000 or £500,000.  There is one such person in every town in Ireland today and they should be as liable to the Proceeds of Crime Bill, 1996, as someone with assets totalling £2 million, £5 million, etc.  That is a point that might be taken on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It indicates co-operation on both sides of the Houses in fighting crime.  It is appropriate that there is no party political point scoring on this debate, that we are approaching it in a spirit of co-operation and bringing to it the best of various viewpoints.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's positive response to the Fianna Fáil Bill and her significant addition to it.  Its central purpose is to allow for the freezing and ultimate disposal of property which the court is satisfied has, on the balance of probability, come from the proceeds of crime.  That is its central point and I welcome the Minister's expansion of the area of cover to all proceeds of crime. She has also made a change in the onus of proof of innocence.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole made a good point when he said that we are dealing with the disposal of money.  In that sense, the area of civil liberties is not a major consideration in this legislation.  We are talking about people who have a great deal of money.  If they have property it can be frozen.  I would be more concerned about civil liberties if we were to limit a person's individual freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to get the balance right in relation to bail and the right to silence. <Col N="1387" /> We are dealing here with people who have money.  In limiting their freedom by granting the courts power to freeze their assets before proof is furnished that they were obtained through illicit means, the invasion of innocence until proven guilty is entirely justified as is the change in the onus of proof.  We are dealing with ruthless and clever people who will use any loopholes to escape with the proceeds from their illicit activities and hide that money and not let it be known that it was secured it by illicit means that caused untold misery to a huge number of people.  In that sense, we must be clever in using whatever means we can to detect what they are doing and to take action against them.</P>
    <P>This legislation is one of a series of measures the Minister is taking &mdash; other measures have already been taken by the Minister and by other Departments &mdash; to get at the individuals we describe as drug barons.  They are clever people and we must use whatever methods we can to put them behind bars and to get them off the backs of people who already have enough problems without their children being at the mercy of drug barons.</P>
    <P>The legislation that will be before the House later this afternoon ties in with this legislation.  There will be difficulties in dealing with properties being transferred to other people's names, money being put into offshore accounts and simply getting at the drug barons.  In that context, it is important to have a designated body to carry out such work. The Minister is legislating for the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau. The Labour Party had previously called for the establishment of a special unit comprising personnel from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Welfare, the Garda Síochána and the Customs Service to target these individuals in a focused way.  I welcome the Minister's introduction of that legislation.</P>
    <P>The bureau must have teeth and protection and must be capable of co-ordinating <Col N="1388" /> the activities of the Garda Síochána, the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners.  They are dealing with ruthless people. Deputy McCreevy, a former Minister for Social Welfare, told the Dáil yesterday about intimidation of social welfare officials.  We have also heard of it happening to other personnel who tried to investigate these barons.  Clearly we need people who are well protected, well paid and well equipped so that the people they are investigating will not be able to get at them.  That will be difficult but the political will exists to do it and it can be done.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, we must use the various measures together to target the drug barons effectively and disabuse them of their belief that they are untouchable. This will be done with the necessary determination.  It will require not only the input of finance and resources but also the effective use of those resources. In that context I welcome the action being taken with regard to examining the situation in the Garda Síochána.  I also support the recommendation of Mrs. Justice Denham's group that an independent body be established to oversee the provision of court services and I welcome the provision of extra judges.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that there is a determination to use the Garda Sóchána effectively.  I was disappointed to read a comment in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently by a representative of the Garda Federation. It was suggested that the proposals in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill would reduce overtime payments but would not increase the number of gardaí on the beat.  The representative went on to say: &ldquo;The only absolute effect this new measure will achieve will be a greater Exchequer saving and a further reduction in Garda supplementary income and consequent morale&rdquo;.  I do not understand that statement.  I assume that if the gardaí are not sitting around all day in court and being paid overtime they could be doing something else for being paid overtime.  They could be <Col N="1389" /> doing something effective, such as going out on the beat.  I have heard no explanation or retraction of that statement and a statement of that nature must be challenged.  If we are paying people with public money, regardless of whether they are gardaí, judges or otherwise, to implement legislation on the Statute Book we must ensure that they are being used effectively.  This is a very important point.</P>
    <P>When this legislation is enacted, we must ensure that there are no delays in having cases dealt with by the courts.  I have already referred to various aspect of that issue, but consideration should be given to fast tracking the cases of those who are making money out of drug addicts and the community.  We must take the necessary measures to ensure that these people are brought to trial as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I was one of the Members who went to Buswells Hotel yesterday to meet with groups representing various Dublin communities who have been so badly affected by the drugs crisis.  I spoke at length with two women from Kilbarrack who have been working on this problem for years.  Both are mothers of drug addicts and they explained in great detail what they wanted.</P>
    <P>Today we are discussing the question of stopping those who impose such hardship and wreak havoc on their communities. This is the criminal justice area.  Community groups such as those I met yesterday want these people targeted. They know that people at the lower levels have to be targeted as well but the most important thing from their point of view is to target the people who flaunt their wealth and who are ruining children's lives.</P>
    <P>Community groups put just as much emphasis on the other aspects of this issue, such as education of communities and treatment.  I know we are not discussing those issues today but they are all connected.  If we take the customers from the drug barons by empowering those who are addicted and the communities around those who have the potential to become addicts, then we <Col N="1390" /> will be taking business away from those who sell drugs.</P>
    <P>We have to approach this problem from all directions.  We have to give support to communities which themselves put forward plans.  I was told yesterday that community groups have been asked by the Eastern Health Board to put forward proposals as to what should be done.  We have to listen to these people who have experience of the problem and we must ensure that the authorities work with them.  We need to improve co-ordination between the various sevices. Representatives of these groups told me they are not sure where to go when looking for a particular service. Local communities need a co-ordinated approach.  They have to know where they can go to have issues resolved and to have various parts of a solution brought together.</P>
    <P>These groups see a need for preventative education.  Their young children see adults and older teenagers taking drugs and accept it as normal.  That is another area about which they feel strongly.  The various aspects of this issue are linked and we have to bring the various aspects together.  Today we are concentrating on the justice side. The Bills being enacted to combat this problem are linked.  This is an important Bill, as is the Bill we will discuss this afternoon.  The Labour Party fully supports the Bill and congratulates both Fianna Fáil and the Minister for the progress being made.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill which the Minister has brought forward, based on Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill.  I welcome all the other initiatives the Minister has taken to fight crime, particularly the battle against drugs.  I am delighted she has decided to use the Richmond Hospital for extra court space.  This is a most imaginative use of <Col N="1391" /> the hospital and will, I am sure, be welcomed by all who ever worked there.</P>
      <P>I would like to see some other aspects of criminal legislation put forward as well.  My hobbyhorse is prisons and the independent prisons board.  Senator O'Sullivan mentioned Mrs. Justice Denham's recommendation that there should be an independent court service. I hope that is brought in as soon as possible because I would not like to think of us invoking the Denham report in ten years time the way I have invoked the Whitaker report on several occasions.</P>
      <P>The freezing of assets is incredibly important in the fight against those who are making such enormous amounts of money from the drug business.  I wish to focus today on the use of children by these people in organised crime.  The involvement of children in crime has been well known for some time.  We have seen from recent court cases how many important criminals in this city are involving their children in what has become a family business.  They are involved not just as couriers and pushers but as names for the laundering of money through bank and building society accounts.  While I welcome the fact that many bank accounts have been investigated, I found it astonishing that a young girl aged 20 years had an account containing £50,000 which nobody seemed to think was unusual &mdash; although she owned her house and also rented an apartment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of Mrs. Justice Denham's report focuses on the delays within the courts.  The area where delays are the most serious is the children's courts. Anyone who has dealings with children knows there has to be a close association between the misdemeanour and the sanction for what has happened to have any relevance to the child.  Delays of three to four months in the children's courts are most unfortunate because this appears like three to four years to a child.  Senator O'Toole was right in pointing out that we must look at the involvement of children in crime.  Surveys in Great Britain have found that <Col N="1392" /> most children become involved in crime at a very young age by first stealing food from supermarkets.  While we are looking at the situation of young children who become involved in crime, it is also important that we raise the age of criminal responsibility from seven years, which is the lowest in Europe.</P>
    <P>Younger and younger children are becoming involved in the drug trade.  It is important to keep as many of them as possible outside the court system.  They should be dealt with, when at all possible, by intervention.  I have spoken in the past about the Garda liaison scheme which has been incredibly successful. This non-statutory agency should be given every support.  I know the Minister has expanded all the schemes. However, it is essential when we look at the age of the children coming into court &mdash; and not just for possession of drugs but for involvement as couriers and pushers &mdash; that we immediately ensure this scheme is expanded as much as possible.  It is important to conduct research in this area.  When these children come into court do we know if this is their first brush with the law or if they have been involved in crime for some time?  We have very little knowledge of what is happening in that area.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister mention the expansion of the probation service. This is vital because children need to realise that their misdemeanours are being taken seriously and that they will be supported.  This is particularly important if they come from what can only be regarded as criminal families.</P>
    <P>The Bills before the House deal with drug related crime in particular.  It is important to remember that we now have teenage addicts &mdash; 12 to 14 year olds &mdash; coming before the courts, yet there are no medical facilities within the State to treat them.  It is most unsuitable to send them to detoxification programmes with adult addicts who may be trying to kick the habit for the umpteenth time.  We have to get at the criminals as early as possible.  Detoxification for these children is incredibly important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> It is unfortunate that there has been some resistance to the Minister for Education's programmes in primary schools on the prevention of drug abuse because that is where it has to start.  We had the same sort of trouble with the Stay Safe programme.  I was pleased to hear that the Minister is holding a conference on best practice in substance abuse prevention educational programmes in the autumn in association with our Presidency of the European Union.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the profile of prisoners in Mountjoy Prison who are involved in the drugs business.  It costs £68,000 to keep a child in Trinity House but how much more could be done on a one-to-one basis with families?  Such families, very often comprise lone parents, usually women, who are bringing up large families.  If these child drug addicts are not treated, they will become the super drug criminals of the future.  Sadly, as Senator O'Toole said, such people too often provide a very acceptable role model in deprived areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Fianna Fáil on what it has done and I also congratulate the Minister on the way she has handled the issue.  I listened with great interest to Senator O'Toole's speech which was commendable. However, I disagree with his comment that it was good for the Minister for Justice to be an open target in certain respects.  He has a much more robust sense of how one deals with things than I have but whatever about the fairness of party political conflict, it is irresponsible for the media to attack a Minister for Justice without adequate justification. The place of law and justice in society is far too important for it to be played around with as a media football. In that respect I would be far less tolerant towards attacks of that nature on a Minister for Justice compared to any other Minister in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving aside the tragic affair of Veronica Guerin, in general the media has not distinguished itself in handling issues of justice over the past couple of years.  Civil liberties are crucial in any <Col N="1394" /> civilised society but the balance has swung much too far in favour of the criminal and, therefore, the direction of this legislation is correct.  All citizens are entitled to freedom from fear.  Anybody who has seen the fear in an old woman's eyes after her house has been burgled, even if she has not been personally attacked, knows what fear means for many of our defenceless citizens.  The first duty of the State is to protect citizens who cannot protect themselves.</P>
    <P>The legislation broadly strikes the right balance.  The bulk of complaints made by the demonstrators yesterday were justified as were most of the arguments they advanced.  There is an important place for education and for rehabilitation, but we are failing to recognise that, irrespective of what one does, there is an element of evil in human nature which will try to find a way of expressing itself whatever programmes or resources are put in place. Drugs almost crystallise the articulation of that evil.</P>
    <P>Valuable and worthy though many of the moves towards the general liberalisation of society that have occurred in recent years are, nevertheless they too are now contributing towards an ethos in society which makes the whole drug dimension almost inescapable.  We may control it but we will not eliminate it because it is an integral part of the logic of the ethos to which most of us subscribe nowadays.</P>
    <P>A report in <i>The Irish Times</i> today mentioned the appointment of Garda representatives in The Hague and in Madrid.  There was an implication that Holland and Spain are not behaving in a way that we would wish in terms of their attitudes to the drug trade.  I do not know whether that is true but if there is any truth in it at all, it points to the importance of having a European wide policy on drugs.  I know that is part of our policy during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union, but these are issues which are obviously of European wide significance.  This makes it all the more important that our own house should be seen to be in order as far as <Col N="1395" /> possible in the way we handle these matters.  In that way we can try to promote our way of looking at things on the wider European stage with a reasonably clear conscience.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward the various elements of this legislative package.  I was a bit disappointed, to say the least, with the comments of Deputy O'Donoghue who introduced the original Bill. Before the discussions took place in the Lower House yesterday, he said the legislation being introduced was not adequate.  Deputy Bertie Ahern made a similar point.  That was like shutting the stable door when the horse had bolted. This was a change of heart from Members who had introduced tax amnesties for the same type of people who bought substantial amounts of property in the county in which I live. We have seen what happened since the pressure was applied in recent times.</P>
      <P>Why are we talking about a seven year order in relation to the freezing of assets?  Other jurisdictions freeze assets within 90 to 120 days.  If genuine persons with assets can produce the legitimate details of how they got the money to purchase them, why can this not be done much faster?  There may be a problem with it under our Constitution; it may be necessary to amend it to bring that time forward.  The assets could be sold off and used for the rehabilitation of areas of this city and country which have been destroyed by these drug pushers.  I think, wish and hope that the Minister can examine the overall position and see if this provision can be changed dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that we are forming an overall plan to deal with inadequacies in areas which were not <Col N="1396" /> addressed over the last number of years. Many comments have been made by politicians about prison places not being provided.  The remand prison at Wheatfield should have been built but it was put on the long finger in 1988.  We all know who was in Government during that period and subsequently and no money was provided to build this prison, although the site was available. There is no point saying that nothing was done.  All parties had the opportunity to deal with this problem but we ran away from it because the Department of Finance would say there were not sufficient funds to do it.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that suspects' cars and other belongings can be seized under this Bill.  If the vehicles were used by the Garda to show the children living in the estates where the seizures took place that they were purchased by these criminals with drug money, we might be sending a very important message to them about the results of becoming involved in drugs.  With the review currently taking place in the Garda, we should be working towards a more efficient and effective organisation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to make these points.  Many provisions that should have been put in place in the past were not.  Comments were made by a reporter that my family was affected by drug pushers in the area where we lived, and they were.  He also stated I had not given proper information to him that the Garda was informed; in fact, the Garda had been involved in the case for over 12 months.  When the second incident took place, the Garda was also informed.  When I asked the particular individual if he thought I was not telling the truth, he said he thought I was but he printed it differently.  Not alone am I saying this today but I also said this here before when we were talking about criminal legislation.  It is very unfair of the particular individuals involved to report as other than the truth something I said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I thank Senator Farrelly for sharing <Col N="1397" /> his time.  Today has proved the usefulness of combining the suggestions of the Opposition and the Government to present a united front to fight crime.  I acknowledge what the Minister said about Deputy O'Donoghue and Senator Mulcahy and their constructive approach to this issue.  These Houses should provide leadership and display a united commitment to fighting crime. The Minister said yesterday in the Dáil and again today that everybody must play a part, whether it is the ordinary man or woman on the street, the media or those who form public opinion.  All must come together if we are going to win this battle which affects the fabric of society and young people in particular.</P>
      <P>We all have a duty to respond to this challenge.  This legislation is part of that response and I hope it will be a success. There are ill-gotten gains in the accounts of these drug menaces, as we should call them rather than attributing a status to them.</P>
      <P>I support this legislation.  It is part of an overall package being introduced by the Government assisted by the Opposition and the various parties.  No one person in the Department of Justice or no one Minister has the panacea for every problem.  It is important to accept good suggestions, even if they need amendment from time to time.  The message should go out from the debates yesterday and today that, while politicians may have been lacking at times in the past when dealing with these issues, we are responding now.</P>
      <P>If there were delays and a tardiness in the past, we all stand condemned.  No Member can say it was the fault of any one party.  It has been a combination when one considers the various parties which have been in Government over the last ten years.  There is a recognition now that things must be dealt with differently.  I support the legislation and I hope it can deal with some of the great problems which affect us.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and the legislation.  I congratulate the Fianna Fáil Party and particularly <Col N="1398" /> Deputy O'Donoghue for initiating it.  To be fair, the Minister was gracious enough to acknowledge the Deputy's contribution to this legislation in her opening remarks.</P>
      <P>The legislation has been improved significantly.  I accept the Minister's point that there is more expertise and more people available in the Civil Service and the Department of Justice to advise on the drafting of legislation than in the parties, even though their resources in intellectual terms can be considerable.  From that point of view, it is appropriate that the Department should have an input into the legislation. However, I also believe that the Civil Service is not the repository of all knowledge.</P>
      <P>There is a lot to be said for studying legislation in these Houses.  We have had recent examples where this House has amended and improved legislation and the House acted very responsibly in doing so.  The Minister said this morning that the legislation should stand the test of time.  I subscribe to that.  It has been the case where legislation is introduced on a reactive basis as a short-term measure that we can, on occasion, get it wrong, particularly when it is rushed through the Houses.  That said, I understand the need for urgency in this case. We are confronted by a direct threat to democracy and society and the State must react quickly, decisively, effectively and strongly to put down that threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should send a signal to the people who are responsible for these types of activities, organised crime, drug peddling, etc., not those who do the dirty work.  One of the most effective short-term signals we could send to them would be to secure the convictions of the killers of Veronica Guerin and Detective Garda Jerry McCabe.  Let them see that they cannot get away with sheer bloody murder, which appears to be the case now.  I expect that would be done within the strictures the law imposes on us all.  I hope and wish those convictions are secured; if that were done, it would be possibly more effective <Col N="1399" /> than the legislation being brought before the Houses in the past two days.</P>
    <P>If we do not put this situation right, we are looking at an increase in the number of vigilantes and punishment shootings we have condemned in this House.  Society will decide to take the law into its own hands if we do not provide the weapons to stamp out these activities.  If society acts on its own behalf we are on a slippery slope to ruin.</P>
    <P>We have always given serious, detailed and prolonged consideration to legislation.  That is as it should be, but once the legislation is passed it is no good unless we implement it.  The Minister and several other speakers have mentioned this.  I can think of occasions in this House when legislation was passed after great and detailed consideration, amended and improved and I have subsequently strained to see if the legislation has been used effectively.  In some cases I cannot see that it had any effect.  I hope in passing this legislation that the Minister, the Government and all of us will show the determination required to make sure the legislation is implemented and used to stamp out the activities of these criminals.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Garda Commissioner, the Garda senior management and the gardaí themselves must be provided with backup to do their job well, and not just financial support.  I proposed recently on the Order of Business, and I propose again, that the Garda Commissioner be given administrative control of the money provided in the Estimates and that he would prioritise the areas on which it would be spent.  The Department of Justice has far too much control over that money.  Those on the ground know how best it can be spent. In that context I find it extraordinary that a Minister of State should launch an attack on senior Garda management yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister support what he had to say?  The Minister of State is reported in the newspapers as saying there was a time when a TD could have a Garda moved, &ldquo;but now a Garda can have a TD moved&rdquo;.  That is an extraordinary statement for a Government Minister to make.  I cannot understand why a backbencher would make a statement like that.  Then the Minister goes on to say that &ldquo;judges have got away with murder for long enough&rdquo;.  That too is an extraordinary statement for a person in Government to make.  From time to time we in this House have criticised aspects of judges' decisions or the operation of the Garda, but I cannot recall anybody having made such extraordinary statements about the Judiciary or the Garda.</P>
      <P>There is a somewhat flippant suggestion that the senior management of the Garda should not attend State functions or receptions.  We all go to them, and properly so.  The senior gardaí represent the Garda at such functions in the same way as senior members of the Army represent the Army.  It is appropriate that senior gardaí would be present at such functions.  It is also appropriate that the Garda Commissioner, if he is unhappy about aspects of the way he is allowed to do his duty, should comment. I do not wish to suggest that any those people would involve themselves in politics.  They go to great pains, and historically have taken great care, not to do so.</P>
      <P>The outburst to which I refer was extraordinary and I wonder if the Minister supports some of the statements that have appeared in the newspapers. The newspaper article reported that it was stated in respect of judges &ldquo;... we have had enough of their interfering with the Legislature and the Executive. The tail will have to be wagged a bit and judges will have to change the way they do their business.&rdquo;  That is an extraordinary statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to maintain the traditions of the House.  He may have been named elsewhere but I will not name him.  What is the Minister's attitude to such remarks?</P>
      <P>I find the tax amnesty disturbing, especially the degree to which it was a charter for people who were involved in crime to find a way to launder money and to have the State facilitate them in doing so.  It was a retrograde, unhelpful step.  Crime bosses will only face reopening of their files where the State can establish by clear proof that the money represented the proceeds of crime.  We need to examine other aspects of legislation and what has been done through budgetary instruments.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas is not responsive to the pace of change in society.  We are still hidebound by procedures which date back to the last century and which are totally useless in dealing with the crisis which is developing.  Do we really think the legislation we are introducing will terrify the top criminals into changing their ways?  I refer to the people who go to the races, mix in polite society and are accepted as part of it.  Do we really believe the legislation will worry them? They are using the most modern means to evade the law.  If there are unethical sophisticated accountants and lawyers who are of the same ilk as the criminals, we are on the hind foot in terms of being able to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the need for the legislation and that we must take this course to ensure such people can be dealt with. However, I will not go so far as to say that rumour, innuendo or being &ldquo;known to the Garda&rdquo; should be sufficient grounds in itself for interfering to an unwarranted degree in the liberties which we enjoy.  I do not want to be the person who is apprehended on a whim <Col N="1402" /> by a garda or by anybody else while walking down Kildare Street and then have to give the reason I was on the street.  The Minister made the point about the need to be cautious on this aspect.  I support her views but society demands that these people be dealt with effectively and are put away.</P>
    <P>I have an amendment tabled for Committee Stage dealing with using the money for education and rehabilitation purposes.  The Minister will know the intention of the amendment from yesterday's session in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We are focusing on the criminals but we must also focus on the demand side of the equation.  It is important to remove the demand for drugs as much as possible and this has to be done by way of education, rehabilitation and funding the agencies which have an input in that regard.  Earlier this year I was involved with the local rotary club in Newbridge.  We visited the various schools around the town with a member of the Garda Síochána.  I was disturbed when he told us that in the town of Newbridge, which has a population of around 15,000, approximately 50 people were regular drug users five years ago, but today there are about 500 regular drug users.  When children were shown Ecstasy tablets, cannabis and other substances, it was disquieting to note how readily they could identify them.  We must accept how pervasive the drugs culture is in our society and that we have a major uphill battle to counter it; one of the arms, and it is only one arm, of the battle is legislation, and the demand side of the equation must also be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The inability, through a culture that goes back many years, of various State agencies to co-operate fully with one another must be addressed.  The Minister has made efforts to overcome some of these deficiencies.  However, it is a pervasive feature of the public service which must think hard about its responsibilities in terms of how it cooperates within itself between, for example, the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda Síochána, Customs and <Col N="1403" /> Excise and whatever other agencies are involved to ensure meaningful co-operation at every level.</P>
    <P>The gardaí have a responsibility within their own organisations.  After the murder of Veronica Guerin, members of the Garda Representatives Association and the Garda Federation told many interviewers on radio what should and should not be done. However, nobody asked them what they proposed to do within their organisations to ensure that their difficulties were resolved to enable them combat this menace effectively.  I wonder why this question was not posed.</P>
    <P>The State and society are entitled to expect service from us, whether we be Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, members of the Garda Síochána or whatever.  If we approach matters in this spirit, some of these difficulties, which appear to be insurmountable and with which the Minister is grappling, would disappear more easily.</P>
    <P>I hope that the gardaí will be given the resources, and not just financial resources, to deal with this legislation and to use it effectively, and that the intention of the legislation, which is laudable, will be carried through to positive action on the ground.  I was taken by the figures the Minister gave for those who had come within the scope of the earlier legislation.  It might be no harm and would be a salutary lesson if those names were published.  If the people at the top can be marginalised from &ldquo;polite society&rdquo;, that might be as effective a sanction as any other, although I am enough of a realist to know they are likely to move to another, more accommodating jurisdiction to carry on their activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and the Government for adopting the broad thrust of Fianna Fáil's Bill on the proceeds of crime.  This is welcome because over the last few years we have let down the people who elected us and look to us for guidance and support.  I hope that together we can at least set in <Col N="1404" /> motion the process of dealing with the problems currently destroying our society.</P>
      <P>The proceeds of crime covers everything from petty theft to the large scale importation of drugs.  We have always had petty theft but in the last few years we sent out signals to well-organised criminal gangs and individuals with large amounts of cash at their disposal that they can import drugs at will, flout the law, execute people on our streets and get away with it, because the State cannot prosecute these people.  That is why we are discussing this legislation, because if we had used the existing provisions and put people behind bars for their crimes, we would not have to force current and previous Ministers and Governments to introduce these Bills.</P>
      <P>The Proceeds of Crime Bill is welcome. The ideas in it were put forward by Deputy O'Donoghue, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Justice, and it acknowledges that we have a huge problem which we can only deal with through proper procedures.  We can go a step further.  The recent execution of a drug addict, Mr. Josie Dwyer, had all the hallmarks of a desperate society which had been totally let down by the Oireachtas, the Garda, the Judiciary and the prison service.  These people felt alienated, had nowhere to turn and, unfortunately, a drug addict was beaten to death by a vigilante gang which felt it was protecting its families and estates from the evils of drugs.  Everyone condemned this act but we had to wait for the shooting dead of Garda Jerry McCabe in Limerick to realise the State was again under attack from individuals. Finally, the tragic execution of Veronica Guerin spurred us into action and the realisation that we had to do something immediately.  I regularly speak on crime and I may be repetitive but I will continue repeating myself until such time as we have done something concrete which is visible and tangible to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The O'Callaghan case in 1966 set the precedent for granting bail.  That was 30 years ago and many things have changed in the meantime.  The State is <Col N="1405" /> no longer under attack from subversives but from individuals who have amassed huge fortunes either through organised crime or the importation and distribution of drugs.  It is these individuals we wish to attack.  There is not much point tracking down, prosecuting and jailing drug addicts and people at the bottom end of the scale but unfortunately, that is what has happened all along.</P>
    <P>We have not been successful in a prosecution against those involved in organised crime and drug dealing. Recently, I brought the case of the transfer of a prisoner to the attention of the Leader of the House.  This person was sentenced to eight years for the importation of illegal drugs to the value of £7 million off the south west coast of Cork.  He served 70 days of his prison sentence before being moved to Shelton Abbey.  The transfer of Christopher O'Connell sent signals that crime does pay.  We may pass all the legislation we wish but something has to be done to ensure we do not send signals that we are soft on crime or that the State cannot cope with it.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána will have to be examined.  The average garda, when discussing the problems of organised and drug related crime will say that they are powerless.  They say they do not have the resources or time to cope with it. The Garda would tackle this problem if it was given encouragement.  How many times have we heard of people being brought before the courts, sentenced and released after a short term in jail? These issues resulted in us almost panicking and saying something has to be done.  There have been heated exchanges with the Minister in this House and the Government was slow in reacting.  We were promised legislation and a referendum on the bail laws on a regular basis.  We were promised more prison spaces and extra gardaí but there was little action until the executions of Veronica Guerin and Garda McCabe.  It is appalling that it takes such tragic events&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Successive Governments have been shielded from reality. We we debated crime recently in this Chamber I said I was concerned about who advises the Minister on this issue. These people are also shielded from reality.  How many officials in the Department of Justice live in or visit Darndale, Knocknaheeny in Cork, Southill in Limerick or any other estates where many lives have been destroyed by the problems of drug related crimes? Why is there not more co-ordination between the various services, such as the social services and the Garda?  This would provide a channel of information to the Minister who can decide whether legislation is being implemented.  If Bills are placed before the House, we can discuss them in depth and ensure that when they are passed the resources are made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this Bill will be passed and its provisions implemented immediately.  If the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda are not given the resources to tackle individuals who have evaded all forms of capture, we will have failed once again.  I do not believe any Revenue Commissioner who enters the Civil Service from university would put their hand on their heart and say they were willing to chase criminals who are orchestrating executions on the streets. I do not blame them as we would not protect them.  I hope the Minister will ensure the proper resources are made available when this Bill is passed.  I have suggested we establish a team of &ldquo;untouchables&rdquo; linking Customs, the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda.  This would at least ensure they have proper resources and the backing of legislation to successfully prosecute.  I thank the Minister for accepting this <Col N="1407" /> Bill.  I hope she does not disappoint us by not making the resources available to ensure its provisions can be implemented.</P>

      <P>It is only a few weeks since Veronica Guerin was in the House with me.  She would welcome the Minister's support for the Fianna Fáil Bill if she was here today.  Veronica Guerin spent the last few weeks of her life in my company.  She was to learn about my job after which I was to spend a week helping her to do hers.  I did not spend that second week learning how to do her job.  As we discussed the horrors of her work and those with whom she came in touch, I realised I could not do her work.  It also opened up a view which I had not heard before despite all that has been written and spoken about here.  I learned about the horror of drugs, criminal activity and criminal leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to welcome this Bill as I know Veronica Guerin would have been.  Any legislation in this area demands the strictest care and vigilance. We should always be reluctant to endorse what I call &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; legislation. We should be in favour of safeguards which would encourage or force <Col N="1408" /> us to review regularly legislation which is quickly passed through the Houses. We should ensure that when we pass a law it does not become frozen and, therefore, difficult to change.  It is our duty to review the situation regularly.</P>
    <P>We should ask if this new system works and if there are restrictions on freedom which are no longer necessary. The reason we should ask the first question is to reassure the public that the legislation is not window dressing.  The reason we should ask the second question is to ensure that we do not pass on a legacy of repressive legislation to future generations.</P>
    <P>We should accept that there are different crimes which need different legislation.  The Offences Against the State Act relates to the prevention of terrorism, while this legislation is against crime.  We should try to find a system to review legislation to ensure it is being used correctly.  This Bill, which received a full hearing yesterday, is welcome. We are trying to ensure the best legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>Let us not lose sight of technology in the fight against crime.  I am interested in the efforts in the United States to use electronic tagging as a way to free prisoners, while ensuring they do not commit crime.  It is cost effective and ensures that space is used for the worst criminal cases.  There would be no market for drugs if we were able to remove the customers.  Let us not lose sight of the opportunity to include whatever measures are necessary in our education system to avoid the demand for drugs described by Senator Dardis.  These steps must be taken in conjunction with those being taken in the House today.  I welcome this necessary Bill.  I am sorry it is necessary but let us make sure we review it on a regular basis to ensure it does the job for which it was intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Our fundamental obligations under the Constitution are being attacked and undermined, and that has been the case for some time. The Constitution states specifically that, as legislators, we are obliged to defend <Col N="1409" /> and vindicate the personal rights of citizens. These personal rights include the right to life, bodily integrity and to own private property.  Therefore, it is our function, as legislators, to ensure that the action we take on a variety of fronts helps us to build up the rights we enjoy which have been a feature of society for a considerable time.</P>
      <P>It is a sad reflection on society that, in a sense, we celebrate while we condemn. We enjoy celebrating the achievements of Michelle Smith and what it represents in terms of commitment and all that is best in society. While everybody wants to be associated with that and to praise and acknowledge it, we know that politicians are being attacked because it is seen that the ills of society are our responsibility in some way.  Clearly, it is our responsibility to advance and protect the fundamental characteristics of a stable happy society. Therefore, I am prepared to look at this Bill from two angles.  First, my normal reaction would be one of concern at introducing a range of Bills, of which this is one of a number, in a hurried fashion.  I will not say it has been introduced hastily but there has been a sense of urgency to deal with an issue which has existed for some considerable time.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to see a broader approach.  We talk, and rightly so, about the need to inform, through education, and have an enlightened system, but should we not return to basics and ask about our responsibility as parents?  Will we say it is the responsibility of teachers, gardaí, health boards and everybody else except us as parents.  It is time we faced that basic fact.  There lies the primary responsibility.  For too long, there has been too great a focus on the exercise of individual rights without recognising that this must be balanced by family and parental responsibility. We do not have sufficient time to deal with that issue today but it is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I resent the fact that criminal thugs or pirates &mdash; do not call them barons &mdash; are undermining the base of society.  They control the empire of unlawfulness and <Col N="1410" /> we must react.  I have said before to the Minister that this is not something with which one Minister in any country can deal.  I am convinced that until all Governments remove the base of this criminal empire, which is operated by evil men and women, and provide whatever is necessary to extricate the addicts from the grip of evil people involved in a multi-billion pound industry, which is undermining the basis of society not just in Ireland but around the world, we will not solve this problem.  Governments have a responsibility to recognise and register the addicts.  We should provide, under a controlled programme, what will otherwise be provided by the drug criminals who will continue to undermine our society.  In the meantime we must take short term action.</P>
    <P>This Chamber does not have a direct role in nominating the Government. However, we have a responsibility to look at all legislation in a reasoned and informed way.  We should not be rushed, as seems to be the pattern these days. The Minister may recall &mdash; I will not be offended if she does not &mdash; that nine months ago I sympathised with her because she was constrained by elements of the Left in Government who prevented her from taking effective action as a result of their alleged concern for individual rights.</P>

      <P>It is important that there is a reporting mechanism whereby the Oireachtas can be informed of the actions taken under the provision of this legislation in respect of freezing assets.</P>
      <P>As a short-term measure, I support the Bill.  However, it is essential that the Minister indicate to the Oireachtas what has been achieved in respect of this legislation which forms part of a package of very urgent measures.  I would prefer if these actions were taken in a more considered way.  In so far as they are being taken in a hasty fashion, the Minister should report to the Oireachtas with regard to what is taking place.  If we are to grant powers of this nature, I would like to know how effectively they are being implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I welcome its introduction.  Deputy Owen is a good Minister for Justice and I made that point when she was recently under pressure.  The intention of the Bill is to ensure that crime does not pay.  It is very important that the public is made aware that crime will not automatically yield the enormous benefits in the north inner city area of Dublin that it did in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interests of generosity, elements of this Bill clearly derive from work carried out by members of Fianna <Col N="1413" /> Fáil.  This is a co-operative measure but I listened with horror to the debate in the Dáil and some of the discussions on radio.  As an Independent Member, I support Fianna Fáil when I believe it is right and I support the Government when I believe it is right.  However, Fianna Fáil descended to an infantile level by attempting to play for political advantage.  The language used by Deputy O'Donoghue, although I have considerable respect for his intelligence and sharpness as a lawyer, was regrettable. The public is not interested in large political parties playing a serious issue for their partisan political advantage. Both parties are to blame but particularly Fianna Fáil and the sooner this type of behaviour stops the better because the community in which I live suffers seriously from drug abuse and we are not about to have a political football made of this issue.  Any honest attempt to deal with this problem will be welcomed by the people among whom I have the privilege to live.</P>
    <P>Having made a number of strictures, we should deal with this Bill in an adult manner.  Members should not be dog in the manger and state it is their Bill or that one party first had the idea for its introduction.  That is the essence of childishness.  I received a number of lessons about being a dog in the manger from Fianna Fáil during my early days in this House.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of a larger package.  I would like to quote an important editorial from the <i>Bar Review</i> which places the entire group of measures in context. This may go outside the scope of the debate but it is important.</P>
    <P>A referendum on changes in the law on bail is to be held in November which, if successful, will have a very substantial effect on the right of accused persons to bail.  It will, if passed as suggested, reverse the spirit and substance of the O'Callaghan case in 1966.  Most importantly, it will discriminate directly against disadvantaged persons in our society by <Col N="1414" /> requiring that cash or its equivalent be lodged as bail money.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the referendum will be preceded by a fully informed debate in order to facilitate a meaningful consideration of the relevant issues.</P>
    <P>The right to silence is also to be affected, though why the existing provisions in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which affect that right, have not been employed is unclear.  Consideration is also being given to have any drug trafficking offences heard by the Special Criminal Court and legislation to seize and freeze suspected assets of crime has been introduced for debate.  The Misuse of Drugs Bill introduced by Fianna Fáil envisages seven day detention, partially validated by an <i>ex parte</i> application to the Circuit Court and the abolition of the preliminary examination by the District Court.</P>
    <P>These law reform provisions will, if enacted, introduce the most radical single package of alterations to Irish criminal law and procedure ever put together.  However, many of the proposals have, in the present climate, received little, if any, intelligent public debate yet.  Shrill voices have been raised to attack those who defend accused persons.</P>
    <P>This is a time for clear thinking and decisive informed action on a range of comprehensive measures.  Legislation passed in undue haste is likely to give rise to unforeseen consequences and it will then fall to the courts to reconcile and remedy the fruits of such haste.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the appointment of a Ministerial Task Force to consider a co-ordinated approach to combat and reduce the demand for drugs is welcomed as an essential component of any comprehensive package designed to deal with the criminals who trade in drugs.</P>
    <P>Having issued some reservations, it ends there on a note of welcome although I end the quote in the middle <Col N="1415" /> of the editorial.  I specifically welcome something which I, in the footsteps of someone who should be regarded as an important spokesperson in this area, Deputy Gregory, have requested for many years, the establishment of a coordinated group to strengthen the efforts of the Garda, the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners. The Minister refers to this directly in her speech.  I strongly welcome this.  It is one of the more important provisions in the Bill.  The Ministers said, &ldquo;I am referring to the new Criminal Assets Bureau, to be headed up by a Chief Superintendent and comprising Garda, Social Welfare and Revenue officials&rdquo;.  She refers to the fact that yesterday in the Dáil the Minister for Finance introduced the necessary statutory financial provisions for this.  That is welcome and I am glad to see the speed and efficiency with which the necessary financial machinery was introduced to give this effect.  It is fine to be talk in these wonderful 18th century rooms about these complex problems out in the jungle of Dublin life, but unless you provide the real means and the money to fund measures and establish them they are going nowhere and are meaningless.  I welcome this clear and practical demonstration. I hope we will have someone from this House watching to ensure these are implemented.  I welcome this provision as it is one of the more important ones in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I notice more prison spaces are being built.  In the short term I have no doubt that is necessary, but, having criticised Deputy O'Donoghue, he made a good point and it is something that should or might be examined.  The time of the Garda is frequently spent on travelling to and hanging around courtrooms on comparatively small issues of speeding offences and parking tickets.  If it were possible to examine the case for allowing some degree of on the spot fines, it might free up a significant proportion of Garda time which could then be devoted to these more serious areas. <Col N="1416" /> I accept, in the light of the American experience, that there are risks, particularly peculation and corruption on the part of gardaí.  I would not wish to suggest anything that could lead to the deterioration of the excellent standard of service we receive from the Garda. But, instead of going through this rigmarole of bureaucracy, form filling, hanging around and having cases delayed, etc., we should have a parking fine of £50 or a speeding fine of £100.  If the Minister could do that, it would be valuable.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is correct in attacking the economic basis of the drug barons.  I have made it clear on many occasions that this will never fully cure the situation.  Only one thing will: the destruction on a global basis of the financial foundation of this.  Many people using Singapore airport have seen the notices and been told on the airplane that if they bring in a joint they will be hung or shot or whatever the punishment is.  Yet, every day people are prepared to risk their lives because, as I have said many times, the only drug more powerful than heroin is money.  As long as that base remains people will traffic in drugs.</P>
    <P>It may be a terrible prospect and it is something not everybody would look forward to, but in the long run it will be necessary to allow drugs freely into circulation and to allow people who choose to inject themselves to do so with whatever substance they please.  It is not the State's responsibility to act as nanny.  Free circulation would ensure that the supply is cheap, unadulterated and controlled.  Addicts would not inject themselves with adulterated substances. That might seem a terrible prospect but it is no less terrible than what we have at present.  The American Government throws thousands of millions of pounds into its war on drugs while simultaneously it fed £40 million worth of cocaine onto its streets through the CIA in order to fund the subversion of Nicaragua. I laugh at the hypocrisy.  If, globally, we could attack the problem <Col N="1417" /> realistically we could do something about it, but we must start treating our population as adults and allow them to make choices with which we disagree.</P>
    <P>A briefing was given by parents yesterday to Members of both Houses and I regret I could not be present.  The parents are not terribly interested in drug barons being attacked; they want facilities in their areas.  No Government has been serious about tackling the problems of the inner cities.</P>
    <P>I have tabled an amendment to this Bill and I hope the Minister will accept it or introduce her own amendment &mdash; I am not interested in having my name on it &mdash; and Senator Dardis has tabled a similar amendment.</P>
    <P>Both amendments seek to ensure that the moneys generated by the sequestration of funds will be channelled directly back into the communities from which the money was taken, at the cost of so much misery and hearbreak, to provide facilities for those communities. One of the mothers asked yesterday: &ldquo;What will our children do in this area? There are no swimming pools.  We hear about Michelle Smith and Sonia O'Sullivan and we are proud of them but there is nothing like that for our children. There is no decent playground, there are no facilities, no halls, no community organisations&rdquo;.  I wrote to the Minister for Education today to ask her to reconsider the decision whereby a group of north inner city schools was denied recognition as a cluster for special funding even though had they existed in rural Ireland they would be so recognised. These issues are important.</P>
    <P>The Abbot, the Monk, the Penguin and whatever else they call themselves are becoming role models because they are seen as successful and clean. According to the newspapers they are involved in athletics, personal fitness and so forth.  They are seen as successful in their communities and, by their example, they lead other young people to be seduced into this terrible way of life.  Instead of simply attacking them I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this money is earmarked for the communities <Col N="1418" /> to which I have referred rather than being diverted into improving the pavements in Foxrock or elsewhere. Taking their money is not enough for these barons.  The money was a blood tax on the innocent people of the inner city and it should go back into those areas to ensure that another generation is not lost again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue, Fianna Fáil spokesman on justice, on his hard work in the past 18 months in presenting so many Bills to the Dáil.  I am delighted the Government has accepted the Bill and I wonder why there was such a delay in it taking action in this area.  It is hard to run a household so I suppose it is difficult to run a Government that is made up of three political parties.  Perhaps there were other difficulties.  It is odd that with the power of the Department of Justice and all the organs of State something could not be done about the more than 30 unsolved murders in the State.  Some of those murders could be termed &ldquo;assassinations&rdquo;, particularly that of the garda and the journalist.  This is a sad reflection on the Government of the day.  I wish the Minister every success in the difficult task ahead of her.  I know she has the will to do the job although it seems that in the past she did not get the support to which, in the public interest, she was entitled.  Deputy O'Donoghue drafted the original Bill, most of which has been incorporated into the Bill before us.  Considering the lack of resources available to the Opposition he is to be congratulated on his achievement.  I am sure the public will thank him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are living in strange times.  I hope this Bill will strengthen the powers of the Garda Síochána, the courts and the Revenue Commissioners to protect the public.  However, as soon as they take action many do-gooders become vocal and I sometimes wonder what they are trying to do.  Criminals and murderers have been breaking the law for many years and have been involved in some <Col N="1419" /> terrible crimes, especially recently.  I remind the do-gooders of the reports in the newspapers and on television of old people battered to death and tortured with cigarettes and hot irons.  People talk about civil rights, but what about the rights of the victims of those crimes, including Detective Garda Jerry McCabe?</P>
    <P>I have special regard for the Garda.  I had an uncle who, as a young garda, lost his life while protecting public property. I know what families go through in these cases.  I was not born at the time but my mother told me about the trauma that that family experienced for years.  We are proud of the Garda Síochána. It is respected throughout the world and does its best.</P>
    <P>I spoke here a few weeks ago, as did the previous speaker, about the system we have in this country which means that gardaí waste much of their time in court.  A member of the Garda might have to spend a full day in court in order to prosecute a minor offence.  I was listening to the Minister on the radio yesterday and was delighted to hear that this system will be updated so that gardaí will be able to devote their time to pursuing those who have committed crime for so many years.</P>
    <P>These people do not recognise the Government or the organs of the State. They attacked the free press when they assassinated Veronica Guerin.  They have no regard for anybody.  The do-gooders should think very seriously before they clamour for the system to remain as it is because the public is sick and tired of it.  To add insult to injury, in many cases these people get free legal aid, paid for by the taxpayer, when they have broken every law in the book.</P>
    <P>Judges are not above making mistakes. I get very annoyed when judges pass sarcastic remarks when some unfortunate person who has been caught committing a minor offence is before him or her.  Those to whom the remarks are made cannot very well reply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> That is very hurtful to the families concerned and it takes from the dignity of the courts.</P>
    <P>About nine months ago there was a case, not too far from the Minister's constituency, where a young boy, who came from a family of 12 and whose father was unemployed, was challenged by a bus inspector on his way to a FÁS course.  The bus inspector should ask how many hundreds of millions of pounds have been squandered by CIÉ over the past 40 years.  The young fellow was brought to court because his bus ticket was short by 10p.  He had nobody to represent him because he was not well off and was sentenced to two months in jail.  A young solicitor &mdash; I heard about this on Pat Kenny's radio show &mdash; took up his case and brought it to the High Court where the judgment was reversed.  That young man was trying to do something for himself but because he underpaid his bus fare by 10p &mdash; a service subsidised by the taxpayer &mdash; he would have had a criminal record.</P>
    <P>The judges should cop themselves on in terms of the remarks they pass and the sentences they hand down and have more time for the less well off.  I am sure the Minister agrees that young people are losing respect for the law &mdash; Garda and judges &mdash; because of such carry-on. Thank God it is rare but it should not happen at all.  Judges can also sneer and take pot-shots at public representatives. A certain judge in the south recently criticised councillors going to conferences. He should keep his nose out of political affairs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in the press &mdash; it is a pity I did not bring the newspaper with me.  These gentlemen should remember our freedom was dearly bought and that the councillors concerned were elected by the public. These snide remarks do not do any good for the standing of public representatives. <Col N="1421" /> It is not good to hear people of very high standing passing such remarks in District Courts.  I am not ashamed or afraid to make that statement because it needs to be said. They could devote their energies to other areas.  Young people lose respect for the courts as a result of that carryon.</P>
      <P>People who employ others and pay their taxes and rates can be caught by a speed trap.  Their licences are endorsed and they are fined.  It happened to two Members of this House in the last 12 months.  They were fined £500, had their licences endorsed and were put off the roads for six months.  Those gardaí should be out looking for the murderers who assassinate gardaí and journalists. It is a disgrace.  If somebody comes out of a country pub there is a squad car around the corner, while the criminals are free in the big cities.  I plead with the Minister to ask them to devote their energies to the areas to which they should be devoted.  If that was done we might not need as many extra gardaí.  It is not good enough for them to devote their energies to pursuing people who are trying to make a living, employing others and pay their taxes.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the increase in the number of gardaí on the beat in the bigger towns and cities.  That is a step in the right direction which I am delighted to see but it should have happened long ago.  It is not possible to beat crime from inside a squad car. There should be more communication between our young, highly trained gardaí and our young people.  I welcome the Bill but we must support the Garda if it is to work, because they cannot move in the right direction without public support.  We need to support the Garda Síochána if the provisions of this Bill are to work.  Without the support of the general public they cannot move in the right direction.</P>

      <P>The Minister said I had questioned the constitutionality of the Bill, whereas Deputy O'Donoghue had accepted it.  However, if the Minister <Col N="1422" /> checks the record she will see I did not say that.  I said the public would not want people who are the subject of restraining orders to drag this legislation through the courts for a long time, including constitutional challenges.  I did not address my mind to the constitutionality issue because that was teased out in the Dáil.  On the basis of the Clancy judgment, I suspect that the Bill, as drafted, is probably constitutional.</P>

      <P>If the President were so inclined, it would be appropriate to refer this Bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality.  That, however, is a matter for the President and one in which the Seanad does not have an input.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole implied that judges were answerable and accountable to us. In one sense they are in that judges can be impeached by the Oireachtas for stated misbehaviour.  In general, however, they are not answerable or accountable to us.  They exercise their functions independently.  Senator O'Toole's remark should be corrected because a wrong impression could be created.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion the Leader of the House, Senator Manning, spoke about some comments that judges had made. My colleague, Senator Byrne, also commented on them.  There is no problem with a general exchange of views. Judges will frequently say that certain legislation needs to be enacted and they certainly utter criticisms.  Equally, it is not impossible for us to make broadly based criticisms or statements, but we should underline that each arm of the State must act independently without being fettered in any sense.</P>
      <P>Both Senator O'Kennedy and myself made the point that there should be more reporting about people whose assets are frozen, although the Minister pooh-poohed the idea, if I can use that horrible expression.  This applies especially to this Bill, although there are provisions about confidentiality.</P>

      <P>Or in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> There are various ways in which the State can publicise issues.  This is an important point.  It is not stretching things to say that this Bill has been urgently brought before us because of a public outcry.  It is important for the public to see justice being done.  It would be interesting to publish over the next six months exactly how many freezing or restraining orders have been made under this legislation.  The Minister should think seriously about some mechanism of reporting the Bill's effects back to the Oireachtas.  The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996, provides for an annual report to the Oireachtas and an annual review as to whether the Bill should remain in operation.</P>

      <P>It is important because the Senator is requesting this reporting mechanism when the first part of this legislation is implemented, the making of a restraining order.  The Senator must remember that the final act is not until seven years later when a decision is made on the property.  I would warn the Senator against asking me to do something which might jeopardise a case. Court reporters are present when a restraining order is agreed by the court. If it is done publicly and openly, then it can be reported in the newspapers.  The Senator should guard against asking me, before a case is even finished, for the sake of giving some comfort, by saying the following ten people had their property seized.  These people may not subsequently lose their property and may be innocent of the order put on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point.  The way around that is, at least on a biannual or annual basis, to publish <Col N="1424" /> anonymously the number of interim and interlocutory orders and the total amount which has been frozen.  That would not give rise to the danger the Minister has correctly identified.</P>
      <P>I am not saying it is an omission, but I am not sure if this is meant to be legislation for all time.  Since there is no annual renewing provision in the Bill, it appears that it will be on the Statute Book forever.  I am not saying whether that is good or bad but I was under the impression that this was extraordinary legislation to deal with an extraordinary set of circumstances in the same way as the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 is related to amendment No. 1 and both <Col N="1425" /> may be discussed together.  I want to correct a misprint in amendment No. 2. In the first line of the amendment, the words &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; appear as one word.  It should, of course, be two separate words.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (5), line 8, to delete &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may be used to promote awareness of the dangers associated with controlled drugs within the meaning of section 2, subsection (1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, or may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was moved by the Progressive Democrats in the Dáil, so I do not intend to detain the Minister and the House very long by going through the arguments raised there.  We are attempting to designate that the moneys which would accrue to the State as a result of this legislation would be used in a dedicated way to deal with education on drugs and rehabilitation programmes. That is a commendable step.</P>
      <P>There were calls when the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill, 1993, was going through the House for similar provisions in the Bill.  Of course, that Bill allows for the confiscation of proceeds of crime and of drug trafficking when there is a conviction.  This is somewhat different, but I suggest strongly that it is the correct way to approach the matter.</P>
      <P>I would be disappointed if the Minister was to give me a range of administrative reasons why this cannot be done. We have gone past the point of finding administrative excuses which, in other words, mean that the Department of Finance says there would be difficulties involved in departing from normal practice in respect of Estimates or that it would create accounting difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This comes back to a point I made on Second Stage.  If we are to adopt that type of defence we are being unresponsive to the needs of society.  It has got to the point where we cannot hide under these excuses any more if we are to deal effectively with legislation.  I would have <Col N="1426" /> more respect for the Minister if she said that she will not do it rather than give me a catalogue of reasons as to why it cannot be done.  Increasingly, we are finding refuge under the camouflage of procedural and administrative reasons as to why these matters cannot be done.</P>
    <P>It comes back to the question of the different agencies and how they relate to each other.  We have Department of Finance legislation and Department of Justice legislation and these structures restrict our ability to deal effectively with these people and bring them to justice.</P>
    <P>There is much I could say on the matter and, perhaps, the argument has been well debated in the Dáil.  I urge strongly that the Minister accept this amendment. It will be suggested that this will result in the legislation being returned to the Dáil.  We will be told that it is urgent and, for that reason, an amendment should not be accepted.  I am sorry, but I have to disagree.  If there is such a necessity, the Dáil should be recalled to deal with it.  It is not a valid excuse.</P>

      <P>I support the point made so effectively by Senator Dardis.  This House has a constitutional responsibility to refine and amend legislation. We cannot be limited in the performance of our duties simply because the Dáil is not in session.  We are required to perform the duties and responsibilities laid upon us by the Constitution.  If the matter raised is of sufficient weight and importance it must be addressed even if it means some little inconvenience for Members of the other House or the Government.  I agree with what Senator Dardis said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that Senator Dardis has a similar amendment.  Naturally, I prefer my own because it is more specifically focused.  I should not really argue against a colleague's amendment, but it is just that little bit general to use the phrase &ldquo;promoting the awareness&rdquo;.  I support his amendment in the sense that if it was not possible to accept my amendment then, as a second best, I <Col N="1427" /> would like Senator Dardis's amendment to be accepted.</P>
    <P>There are already a certain number of programmes in existence.  One must consider the level of deprivation in particular communities.  The money generated is generated specifically within and from those communities.  I described it earlier as a blood tax exacted by drug barons against these communities. Rather than dissipating the funds in a more generalised educational programme, which I would also welcome, these people who have paid that money in sorrow and misery should at least have those resources put back into their community.</P>
    <P>I speak particularly for the north inner city of Dublin where virtually nothing has been done by any administration. Institution after institution, opportunity after opportunity has been stripped out of the North inner city by the city and national authorities.  The latest to go is the Bord Fáilte office in O'Connell Street, closed down and transferred to Suffolk Street on the south side.  There is not even a kiosk on the north side giving tourist information. Everything is stripped away out of the north inner city.  Job opportunities are taken away all the time.  It seems only appropriate that that money should be given back into those communities which have nothing.</P>
    <P>As I said this morning I am sorry and ashamed that I could not attend the briefing in Buswells Hotel yesterday by members of the different communities and drug addicts and their families. They all said they were indifferent to the idea of asset stripping the Monk, the Abbott, the Penguin, etc.  What they really felt was necessary was to get resources back into the community.  This seems the most appropriate and efficient way.  This money was blood-sucked out of these already deprived areas.</P>
    <P>Why should it go into a generalised pool when Government after Government has starved these already deprived areas of resources except on the one <Col N="1428" /> occasion.  When Deputy Tony Gregory held the balance of power.  I thrilled at the spectacle of Garret FitzGerald and Charlie Haughey paying court to a little office in a tenement in Ballybough.  I laughed when I heard the middle classes saying &ldquo;How dare he make bargains and deals&rdquo;, as if this was some obscenity that had never been inflicted on political life before.  What they were really saying was that people who have no voice, power or influence should never be allowed to bargain.  Deputy Gregory was a voice for the voiceless on that occasion.  I was delighted.  He wrung a commitment to a housing programme from central government with which I totally disagreed but I was glad he did it. It was in the wrong place and I objected strenuously to the destruction of 18th century buildings.  We argued hammer and tongs but I was delighted that at least he succeeded to some degree.  I got them out of where I did not want them and we compromised.  If we are serious about tackling this we must ensure that not only is the money stripped away from these people but it is diverted back into where it will do some good.  My colleague, Senator Henry indicated to me at lunch that, like myself, she raised this issue with the Minister previously, so there has been time to consider it. Senator Henry has said she will be very pleased to add her name to this amendment. She will add a very persuasive tone to this discussion and she is prepared to second this amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Norris for allowing me to second his amendment. I support the thrust of both amendments but I prefer Senator Norris's amendment.  I was interested yesterday when the demonstrators outside the House and who spoke in Buswells said that none of us understood what they were going through.  I wish I could say that in the past I had not been in areas like Killinarden and Brookfield and inner city areas.  One should be careful about naming places as it casts a slur once an area is described as having problems with drugs.  Therefore I will <Col N="1429" /> not name the other areas to which I have been.  The demonstrators stood outside with their banners but the same thing is happening in the inner south city, in the north inner city and in the suburbs adjacent to the north inner city.</P>
      <P>It is agreed that an enormous amount of the crime committed by Mountjoy Prison inmates is drug related and it is important to remember that the postal addresses of 75 per cent of those in Mountjoy Prison are from five postal areas, within Dublin, and they are not the most salubrious areas.  They are the areas where this money should be reinvested because the money has, as Senator Norris said, been kept out of these areas.  Last month when we discussed this matter I put the proposition to the Minister who was in the House that whatever moneys were obtained by the confiscation of assets should be ploughed back into the areas from which they had come.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris's amendment is broad enough to allow the money to be put into many fields.  For example, it could be put into education &mdash; the Minister for Education is anxious to have smaller classes in deprived rural and urban areas; it could be spent on a better home school liaison scheme to ensure that parents, many of whom are unemployed, get a better understanding of the importance of schooling for their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice said this morning that she would like to see the probation service expanded, and this is an important area for investment.  There are only 200 probation officers and we would need 800 to 900 to have an equivalent <i>per capita</i> ratio as the UK.  The Minister could put money into rectifying that shortage.  The Garda juvenile liaison scheme could receive more money to better carry out its invaluable work. Almost 90 per cent of the children who become involved in the juvenile liaison scheme as opposed to going before the courts, do not reoffend.  Senator O'Toole stressed the importance of dealing with children when they first become involved with crime and this is <Col N="1430" /> particularly important with drug related crime.  It is far more difficult to deal with long established addictions than those which are new.  I referred to the detoxification units this morning and money might be made available under this proposal.</P>
    <P>We talked earlier about sporting facilities and that money might be available to site them in the inner city.  I am not the only person to whom Sister Marie Joseph has appealed for what she terms &ldquo;only £3.5 million&rdquo; for sporting facilities for the south inner city.  Such an amount could become available quite quickly from confiscation.  Rather than put the confiscated assets into the great maw of the public purse, the money could be specifically targeted to improve the facilities and standards of education in the deprived areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the intent and the sentiments of the Senators' proposals. We would like to ensure by whatever means possible that additional State resources would go to the areas that have been mentioned.  In the short time I have been Minister for Justice I have done what I can to extend the funds at my disposal to the areas which, heretofore, were not considered the responsibility of the Department of Justice &mdash; the extension of the youth diversion schemes, the extension of grants to groups such as ICON to deal with drugs in the inner city and to women's organisations so they can carry out research into how the courts deal with sexual abuse victims; the extension of money to the community alert schemes, which is the first time every they have received money from the Department of Justice, <Col N="1431" /> and the extension of facilities and money to the victim support associations.</P>
      <P>I do not take the credit for all the improvements.  Some of them had been started before I became Minister and I extended and augmented such funding to organisations which may be more in touch on the ground than the State agencies.  I know Senators are trying to ensure that, when money begins to become available under this legislation, it would be ringfenced and earmarked. Neither amendment does this.  The amendment uses the words &ldquo;... may be used...&rdquo;.  Section 4 (5) provides that all assets or moneys which accrue for disposal under the legislation go to the central Exchequer for disbursal by the Minister.  The Senators have not amended that section.  Even from a techncial point of view the amendment does not do what the Senators say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, we appreciate that there was a very clear reason for that: technically we were precluded from doing what we would like to do in this area.  Our amendments were carefully drafted to prevent them being ruled out on grounds of expending money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has made the case for the rest of my argument. Often the Opposition will move amendments like this to create a sense of urgency and direction for the House and the Government of the day to take on board what people would like to see happening with money.  However, it would be wrong for Senators to send the message that, because I am not in a position to accept these amendments, I will not take their import and intent back to Government to ensure that, when the need is there, the necessary resources must be diverted from other areas of expenditure.  Indeed, the Government has shown its resolve on this both in the past few weeks and previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> Taxpayers provide the money.  As Minister for Justice I do not, nor does any other Minister, provide it for all the services in this State.  Money is sent to the central Exchequer and each Department lobbies for its share under the Estimates system.  For example, a Minister once asked me if I thought he had buckets of incoming money from road taxes coming into his office; for many years I have asked why car taxes do not go direct to the local authorities.  That money goes to the central Exchequer and is then sent to the councils.  It may be argued that they do not get the full amount due, for example from car taxes, but that is another argument.</P>
    <P>The intent of the Senators in these amendments is laudable and supportable. However, they do not ringfence the money.  Even if they were passed, they would not mean anything to the communities because one would be dependent on the Government of the day to decide where the money would be spent.</P>
    <P>More importantly, it will be seven years from the passing of this legislation before any money becomes available. Senator Henry made a valid point to the effect that the amendments might have been better in the 1994 Act.  When in Opposition I supported an amendment to this effect but the then Government comprising of Fianna Fáil and Labour did not accept it, probably for some of the technical reasons Senator Dardis does not want me to mention, such as the Estimates process.  In that case there was a prospect of money accruing fairly quickly once the regulations were introduced.</P>
    <P>However, under this legislation, once the assets are frozen they remain frozen in the hands of a receiver.  The only relaxation of the assets during the seven year period would occur if the persons whose assets were frozen goes to court to claim that they needed money to maintain their families.  An even more compelling reason is that not a single penny will be available from this for seven years.  I do not think Senators do not want drugs awareness programmes <Col N="1433" /> or facilities to be established in those communities except through this mechanism; they want it to happen now. There are also dangers and implications in attempting to ringfence the money.  It may be decided by a future Government that this will be the only money for such programmes so that only on the whim of the courts will funds for drugs awareness projects be diverted to those communities. Again, I do not think that is the intention behind the amendment.</P>
    <P>My reason for not accepting these amendments is not that I do not like Senator Dardis, Senator Henry or Senator Norris or that I do not agree that more resources should be diverted to these areas.  The funds should not necessarily come from my Department because for too long it has been the whipping boy for everything which is wrong in society.  Far more effort should be made by other Departments and currently the Department of Education and the Department of Health are working in conjunction with the communities. Senator Dardis knows better than I that some things which have to be done in inner city communities &mdash; unfortunately, a number of people involved in crime come from there &mdash; add to the feeling of alienation.  Those communities do not want drug treatment centres, post-prison centres, etc., even though a high percentage of people from the area will have to use them.  It is a fraught and difficult argument and it is not so straightforward that one can simply throw money at the problem, although no one has said that.</P>
    <P>It is for the Senators to decide this but it would not send a good signal to divide the House as it might appear that the spirit of the amendment did not commend itself to me.  I undertook yesterday to communicate the spirit of this amendment to the Government during the Estimates process, so several Departments will take definite steps to put money into the communities where most of these serious problems now pertain. As Senator Norris said, most of the money made by these big criminals has been made on the backs of the poor and <Col N="1434" /> marginalised who have not had education and jobs opportunities.  It should also be said that much of it has been made through manipulation, robbing and thieving in better off areas.  Many people from those areas have also suffered through losing their property and possessions, and businesses have been subject to fraud.</P>
    <P>I also said yesterday that I had spoken about this matter to the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, who chairs the committee set up by the Government on measures to reduce demand for drugs. He said on Committee Stage that he would immediately look at the concept and intent of these amendments.  I have no doubt that when his report is submitted to the Government &mdash; which will be by the end of September &mdash; it will recommend measures such as those suggested by the Senators.  That means the money these communities need will be injected now rather than in seven years' time.  Millions of pounds are already being put into communities through local development initiatives and many other methods but some of it is not targeted and focused to provide things which we would take for granted.  If my child wants to swim or play football or hurling he can go to the nearest pool or park by bus or bicycle and there is usually a club to run the facility.  Many communities do not have that ease of access.</P>
    <P>I ask Senators to take a measure of my bona fides from the fact that I have always been agreeable to accepting amendments from this House where possible.  I understand the intent and import of these amendments but they would not do anything to relieve the need for more money in these communities. There will be nothing to distribute for another seven years.  I appeal to the Senators to consider what I have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister I do not intend to make this matter divisive but the best way to make it non-divisive would be to accept the amendment. There are two sides to that coin.  I did not ask the Minister not to mention <Col N="1435" /> these matters; I asked her not to use them as an excuse for not accepting the amendment.  The use of the words &ldquo;may be&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; gives discretion; I accept it does not impose an imperative on the Minister.  Nevertheless, by having it in the legislation it would be difficult to avoid that responsibility.</P>
      <P>In relation to the fact that it would take seven years before these moneys would begin to accrue to the State, there is no suggestion in the amendment, or in the argument for it, that the moneys which are at present devoted to these schemes and other areas of relief should not continue.  It is suggested this money be dedicated to this particular function. It was significant that the Dublin citywide drugs crisis campaign made the same point yesterday.  They are at the sharp end of this problem and experience it daily.  They recommend the problem be dealt with by a co-ordinated approach including rehabilitation and treatment.</P>
      <P>We must address the conditions which create the drugs problem.  We have already discussed the demand aspect on Second Stage and what needs to be done to address this as well as the supply side.  This is the area where most can be done to address the demand side of the equation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, spoke about the compelling logic of having a provision like this when this matter was before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security but somehow that logic became less compelling when the matter progressed further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important we listen to the communities. They are totally unimpressed by arguments about administrative difficulties. How can they begin to understand them?  We have created a dinosaur which on every occasion is being used as an excuse for non-responsiveness. Legislation comes before us where it is the &ldquo;opinion of the Attorney General&rdquo; that something cannot be done. My experience with lawyers is that for every one opinion in one direction, <Col N="1436" /> there are two opinions in the alternative direction.  They will argue about the number of angels on the head of a pin.</P>
    <P>We are discussing a broader issue.  We have created a dinosaur which is totally unresponsive or, if it is responsive, it is over such a time scale that it is not relevant. What are we doing if we are not listening to the people who are giving these messages loudly, clearly and explicitly?  They are asking us to do things which they regard as reasonable and legitimate.</P>
    <P>I have no argument with the Minister about intent.  We all have the same intent.  The issue is the expression of the intent and how it is expressed within the legislation and within the support we give to communities.  I know the Cathaoirleach wishes to conclude this matter speedily.  I could say more about it but in deference to the House and the fact we are discussing other legislation this afternoon, I rest my case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister has said in terms of taking the sentiments expressed, however clumsily, in our amendment back to Government.  I hope she will do so urgently and that she will press this with all the vigour of expression and style which she has demonstrated in this House.  I hope she will use those qualities in Cabinet to urge this measure.</P>
      <P>I was unaware that a similar amendment was tabled in the Dáil yesterday or that my colleague Senator Dardis was to table one today.  I arrived at this view independently.  I am sorry I did not know it was being discussed yesterday because I would have had the opportunity to listen to the debate and inform myself more as a result of that discussion, but I am glad it was raised.  The Minister said she supported a similar amendment to the 1994 Act and that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has spoken about giving a commitment from his Department to try to meet the spirit of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Not from his Department but from the ministerial committee on <Col N="1437" /> the reduction of demand.  He is a Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for making that clear.  There seems to be a commitment from all sides, so we should look for action.</P>
      <P>As regards the substitution of &ldquo;may be&rdquo; for &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, it may appear that we were weak and pusillanimous.  Unfortunately, that is because of the nature of Seanad Éireann.  My advice, which was well given, was that we would have been limited by the provisions under which the Seanad is forbidden to spend money.  If we had expressly said &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, the Cathoairleach might have been obliged to rule my amendment out of order.  I then discovered Senator Dardis had tabled an amendment.  When we reviewed the amendments with the able assistance of the staff of the House, it was pointed out that Senator Dardis had discovered a formulation of words which appeared to get over that difficulty.</P>
      <P>It was not from a lack of passionate commitment or from a source of pusillanimity, whatever that is, that I changed my amendment to the weaker version but to ensure that it would be discussed. If the House had the power to spend money, we would be at it hammer and tongs day and night.  However, in their wisdom, the framers of the Constitution prevented us from so doing.</P>
      <P>Money must go to these areas for practical reasons.  There is a substantial lack of proper methadone maintenance programmes throughout the city.  Hundreds of people commit crimes daily because they have no alternative to feed their habit.  Some money should be immediately diverted to these methadone maintenance programmes.  People are not only stealing but are committing suicide because they cannot get to these programmes.  The Cabinet has the capacity to put money aside for these programmes immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted the Minister mentioned ICON.  I have worked with that splendid group.  It also works with a <Col N="1438" /> section of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce of which the Minister is aware. The Dublin 2010 committee is looking at the question of crime.  I am a very junior member of that committee and the Minister's interest is welcome.  We have been looking at the areas for which this money would be useful.</P>
    <P>For example, there was a programme for children in deprived areas who had an interest in horses to develop this interest responsibly so that the horse's welfare is looked after as well.  They were given a positive understanding of animals and a healthy recreational interest in life.  There was a type of stock-car racing programme and those who liked joyriding were given an opportunity to drive the blazes out of old bangers under safe and controlled circumstances.  This was successfully done in Belfast but it was stopped in Dublin because of the money required for insurance &mdash; the critical factor was money.  That would have alleviated a problem in the city.</P>
    <P>I have two final points.  First, I am aware there is a seven year delay but I do not understand why. There must be some gifted accountants who have a positive view on life.  I know there are many gifted accountants, but let us try to find an optimistic accountant who is also creative.  Let him look at this and say, &ldquo;We have so much money frozen, why not establish a system of parallel funding?&rdquo; When the Minister has £10 million in her deep freeze, the sell by date for which is the year 2010, why not have a parallel credit facility against which she can draw such as those available from banks, and provide that for the inner city?  Even I, a financial illiterate, have managed to pull that one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>Finally, the Minister referred to taxpayers' money; this is the first time this afternoon that I have found her to be inaccurate.  This is not taxpayers' money.  This is money on which no tax has been paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is highly unlikely.  A very large portion of it will not have been liable to tax because it would have been generated by people importing substances on which it is unlikely the Revenue has exacted a commission.  In circumstances where these substances are distributed to the marketplace, it is equally unlikely that any tax has been generated to the Exchequer.  Certainly in terms of drugs money, I would be surprised if any tax revenue was paid, so it is not taxpayers' money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Taxpayers' did not generate this income so it is unusual, distinctive and atypical in this sense and this is a good argument for the Minister to use at Government.  She can say that this is not taxpayers' money.  We accept that there is a cogent argument for money which is paid by the taxpayer in general circumstances to go into the general pool, but that argument is not sustainable when one is dealing with significant amounts of money on which no tax has ever been paid by the citizens of this State.  That is an extra argument for saying let us get this money in some shape or form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not feel that this must be the Norris, Henry or Dardis amendment, and I am sure Senator Dardis feels the same.  I accept the Minister's goodwill. If she is as committed as she says, she should use the force of these arguments to return to Cabinet and say that we will <Col N="1440" /> have this money even if it is after seven years.  Presumably, the money will be banked and will generate interest.  I certainly hope that is the case.  As a taxpayer, I would be very angry if the Minister is not being as prudent as me.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows there is no panacea by which one can ensure children do not become involved in drugs, but something she said influenced me a great deal in supporting Senator Norris's attitude to the amendment.  She said that if her children wanted to go to a swimming pool, play football, hockey, camogie, etc., they could get on a bus or on their bicycle and do so.  This is exactly what has been important for my children and it is what the Minister and I would like to see available to other children, especially in deprived areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> I ask the Minister to tell the Cabinet how we wish to see this money spent. There is no harm in various areas taking out bank loans in the hope of what is to come.  We should ask people what they want.  I was interested to see in these reports how much money is available. Ms Felloni, for example, had £50,000 in the bank at 20 years of age.  I wish I had a 20 year old child with £50,000 in the bank &mdash; not acquired by those methods of course.  It is important to talk to communities to find out what will help in their areas.  For too long we have not consulted with people in problem areas. We trust the Minister to express our wishes in this regard.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming before the House and spending a considerable amount of time debating the Bill.  I do not say this lightly because there are other Ministers who do not grace us with their presence.  It is a compliment to the House when a Minister takes the time and trouble to divert from their busy and important schedules to give us the benefit of their knowledge, wisdom, experience and expertise. I sincerely thank the Minister, her co-operation is deeply appreciated.  I also thank Members for their contributions. The debate was constructive and everyone who spoke was well meaning and well intentioned.</P>
      <P>Veronica Guerin was murdered on 26 June 1996, one calendar month ago.  We have done a good day's work in her name and that of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe.  We have had a very mature debate and done our bit.  I hope that other elements of society will combine with our leadership to try to rid Ireland of this scourge.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her able handling of the Bill.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach stated formally that the Bill will be reported without amendment. It might appear that the Seanad, as an amending body, has failed in its duty by not amending the Bill but I do not believe we have because we have argued matters with the Minister.  It was not possible to amend the Bill in some areas for a variety of reasons.  On the other hand, the Minister has given a firm, clear and solemn undertaking that our concerns will be represented, fully and vigorously, at Cabinet.  Members can rely on the Minister because we know her to be able, vigorous and trustworthy in the deepest political sense.  In that light, I believe that, despite the fact that the Bill will be reported without amendment, we have not significantly failed.  We have strengthened the context within which this Bill will come into law.  I accept Senator Mulcahy's point that it is important that the Bill is rapidly implemented.  As to the parentage of the Bill, I prefer to leave that matter <Col N="1443" /> in dispute.  Technically, however, I would have imagined in my innocence that the Bill was proposed from the Government benches with the able support of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, together with the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, provide for a fresh approach to the investigation of crime in Ireland.  The individual agencies cannot tackle the problems alone; a new mechanism was needed to bring them together and these two Bills provide that mechanism.  The Bill before the House today will facilitate immediate co-operation between the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.  That co-operation will be put on a statutory basis when the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill is passed in the autumn.</P>
      <P>The fight against organised crime has three main elements: a well organised level of law enforcement with harsher penalties and more prison spaces, a serious attack on the assets of criminals and action on the demand side.  This Bill is concerned with the second of these elements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with the details of the Bill, I want to say something about the first element.  The appointment of a new Garda Commissioner and the review body on the Garda should ensure that there is a fresh approach and a new impetus to the fight against crime.  The Garda obviously has the pivotal role in fighting crime so it is essential that it is well managed, well motivated and have the confidence of the public.  I believe that the new commissioner has the <Col N="1445" /> opportunity to ensure this and I wish him well in his new appointment.</P>
    <P>In the fight against crime, the new Bills brought forward by the Government will ensure co-operation among certain agencies.  Other State agencies, for example, the judges and the courts system, also have a duty to act in the best interests of the community and in co-operation with the Executive.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, and certain provisions in the Bill before us today enable the Minister for Justice to bring professional advisers into the remit of existing money laundering legislation.  I believe that professional advisers have a duty to the community to ensure that they do not facilitate criminals in their activities.  Last year we had the not particularly edifying spectacle of the Government being castigated for attempting to ensure that professional bodies did not facilitate tax evasion.  Speaking as an accountant, I have no difficulty with a requirment that professional advisers must not faciltate law breaking.</P>
    <P>If we are to be serious about tackling organised crime, it is time to take the gloves off against the racketeers' attempts to hide behind accountants and lawyers in their financial transactions. The relationship of privilege is important in the context of legal proceedings and this Bill provides for protecting this privilege.</P>
    <P>One of the steps which the Government took to counter major organised crime, particularly in the drugs area, was to set up a special group to examine ways of targeting the assets and proceeds of criminal activities.  This group was chaired by the Department of Justice and comprised representatives of the Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Welfare. The group made a number of proposals aimed at improving co-operation between State agencies in their fight against organised crime and to remove any obstacles which would hinder their efforts in tracking and targeting the assets of criminals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1446" /> The group put forward a series of measures to allow for freer proactive exchanges of information between Revenue and the Garda Síochána in the case of suspect assets and activities than is allowed by law.  Changes were also recommended to secure the anonymity, and thereby the personal safety, of Revenue officials in pursuing tax assessments of suspected persons, and to allow for the use by Revenue of Garda intelligence information in making tax assessments without disclosure of the source of this information, unless authorised by a senior Garda officer.  The group also recommended a number of amendments to the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to implement the important and necessary legal changes recommended by the working group and thus clear the way for closer and more concerted co-operation between the State agencies in the fight against organised crime.  The implementation of these measures will form a useful part of, and has to be seen in the context of, the overall action we are taking.</P>
    <P>As part of this it is necessary to amend and extend the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  There is a doubt whether information or material obtained under the money laundering provisions of that Act could be used by the Garda Síochána and Revenue in relation to other criminal offences or Revenue offences. The money laundering provisions of the Act were passed specifically to meet the obligations of an EU directive.  The directive itself, however, permits the use of money laundering information or material in the investigation and prosecution of other offences provided specific legal provision is made to do so.  This Bill includes a suitable amendment to the 1994 Act to allow for the wider use of money laundering information.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Act already makes provision regarding applications to the courts by the Garda Síochána for search warrants for purposes related to drug trafficking and related offences.  Under existing law the warrant may be issued <Col N="1447" /> to &ldquo;a specific member of the Garda Síochána, accompanied by such other members of the Garda Síochána as the member thinks necessary&rdquo;.  In the context of the proposed attack on criminal assets it would clearly be desirable that the warrant should allow for any non-Garda person working in or with the proposed Criminal Assets Bureau, including Revenue and social welfare officials, to take part in the search.  A suitable amendment to the 1994 Act has been included in this Bill.  Further, the Bill also makes certain changes, which I will outline later, to the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879, relating to access by the gardaí to the books and records of all relevant financial institutions.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the individual sections of the Bill.  The first four sections amend the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  Section 1 inserts a new section into the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  This new section allows Revenue to provide information to a garda not below the rank of Chief Superintendent or to a body set up under statute or by the Government to target the assets of criminals.  To release information the Revenue Commissioners must have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the information relates to a person who has derived profits from an unlawful source or activity and that the information will assist in a relevant investigation. This provision will allow for exchange of information without requiring a court order and, at the same time, provides reassurance for ordinary law abiding taxpayers.  The section maintains existing safeguards for information received by the Revenue Commissioners from another State under a double taxation treaty.</P>
    <P>Section 2 amends section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, in two respects.  First, it ensures that documents and materials concerning the identification of customers and transactions are retained by the designated bodies for use as evidence into any offence and not solely money laundering offences as provided for at <Col N="1448" /> present.  Second, it inserts a new subsection to enable the Minister for Justice, in prescribing a designated body by order under that section, to exempt that body from certain of the obligations generally imposed on designated bodies by the 1994 Act.  This will basically allow any such order to deal with the issue of legal professional privilege where an order is made extending to solicitors, for example, the obligation to report money laundering.</P>
    <P>Section 3, which is related to section 2, amends section 57 of the 1994 Act to permit information reported under that section to the Garda Síochána to be used not only in any investigation concerning money laundering but for an investigation into any other offence. The working group considered the question of extending the list of bodies and professions to which sections 32 and 57 of the 1994 Act dealing with money laundering apply.  The group, and indeed the Government, acknowledge that the overwhelming majority of the members of these professions are law abiding people who would be horrified if they thought they were involved in laundering the proceeds of crime. Nevertheless, the group was firmly of the view that the extension of the money laundering reporting requirements in this way would be of considerable assistance in the fight against organised crime.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided, therefore, that the reporting requirements of the money laundering provisions of sections 32 and 57 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, should be extended to solicitors, accountants, auctioneers and estate agents.  This can be done by the Minister for Justice by order under the 1994 legislation but will take place only following detailed consultations with the professional bodies on the operational procedures and standards to be applied by the professions in question. This will ensure effective reporting and allow for the practical operation of the requirements at professional firm level. For the information of the House, there have already been discussions between <Col N="1449" /> the Department of Finance last year and the bodies representing solicitors and accountants on the operation of the existing money laundering provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends section 64 of the 1994 Act to enable a member of the Garda Síochána, carrying out a search under a warrant issued under that section, to be accompanied by any other persons, for example, a Revenue Commission or Department of Social Welfare official rather than, as section 64 currently provides, only other members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 to 9 are alike, making similar provisions in relation to a number of different tax heads.  Section 5 amends section 184 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  That section provides for the making of an assessment to income tax in the absence of a return or in circumstances where the inspector has received information as to the insufficiency of any statement received from a person. Section 5 puts beyond doubt that the inspector may, in making an assessment, use information received from the Garda Síochána.  It also provides that where Garda information is used, the origin of the information is not to be revealed except with the permission of a Chief Superintendent, so as to protect Garda intelligence gathering.  Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 make similar provisions in relation to corporation tax, stamp duty, capital acquisitions tax and residential property tax, respectively, as section 5 does for income tax.</P>
    <P>Sections 10, 11 and 12 provide for anonymity for Revenue Commission officials in particular circumstances. Section 10 amends section 18 of the Finance Act, 1983, which provides that where an inspector of taxes has reason to believe that an account in a financial institution is being concealed by a person for tax purposes, an authorised officer of the Revenue Commissioners may apply to the High Court seeking information regarding the account.  The changes now being made provide that where the court is satisfied that it is in the public interest, any documents relating to an application or order under the <Col N="1450" /> section will omit the name and address of the authorised officer, and in any cross examination or depositions made, the name and address of the authorised officer will not be revealed in court and the officer may give evidence in the sight and hearing of the judge and only in the hearing of anybody else.</P>
    <P>Section 11 amends section 19 of the Finance Act, 1983, which provides for the assessment to tax of profits or gains arising from unknown or unlawful activity.  The amendment relates to an investigation by any body set up to target the assets of criminals and provides that where, following an investigation by such a body, an assessment is raised under section 19 of the 1983 Act by an inspector who is a member of that body, the assessment may be issued, and the tax due demanded, in the name of the body rather than in the name of the individual officer.</P>
    <P>Section 12 also relates to anonymity of Revenue officials involved in any body established to target criminal assets.  In particular, the section provides that, when exercising his or her powers and duties on behalf of the body, a Revenue official will not be required to identify himself or herself but will be accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána who will confirm that the official is an officer of the body. Furthermore, the Revenue official will perform written duties in the name of the body and not in his or her name.</P>
    <P>Moving on to sections 13 and 14 of the Bill, it is also proposed to amend the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879, in three ways.  The purpose of these amendments is to allow the Garda greater and speedier access in the course of a criminal investigation to documents and records in the possession of financial institutions and other entities.  Under the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, the High Court may grant, on the application of a garda of superintendent rank or higher, an order permitting the Garda to inspect and take copies of the books and records of licensed banks, the State banks and the building societies. <Col N="1451" /> However, as pointed out by the advisory committee on fraud established by the Government and chaired by Mr. Peter Maguire, SC, the Act can only be used in relation to a limited number of financial institutions.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, accordingly, in section 13 to extend the application of the Bankers' Books Evidence Acts to allow the courts to make an order allowing the Garda to inspect and take copies of the financial records of credit unions, Stock Exchange member firms, investment intermediaries, moneybrokers, <i>bureaux de change</i>, life assurance undertakings and futures exchanges.  It is also proposed to provide that the Minister for Finance may, following consultations with the Minister for Justice, add to the list of entities to which the Bankers' Books Evidence Act applies.  The list of entities is broadly similar to the list of designated bodies in section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, on which duties in respect of suspected money laundering are imposed.</P>
    <P>Section 14 amends section 7A of the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879, in two ways in line with the recommendations of the Maguire report.  First, it extends the definition of a &ldquo;banker's book&rdquo; to cover documentation associated with or related to a bank's books and records, including such documentation in electronic form.  This means that it will be possible for the Garda, on foot of a court order, to inspect letters and other documentation in the possession of a bank or other entity defined in the amendment to the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879, contained in section 13 of this Bill.  The reason for this amendment is that the Garda currently has access to the books and records of financial institutions but not to the underlying documentation on which such records are based, such as letters and lodgement slips.</P>
    <P>Second, this section provides that the Garda may apply to the District Court or the Circuit Court, as well as to the High Court, for an order allowing them to inspect and copy extracts from the <Col N="1452" /> documents of an entity to which the Bankers' Books Evidence Act applies. This amendment will speed up the process of applying for an order under section 7A of the Bankers' Books Evidence Act.  The introduction of these provisions is an urgent, measured and important part of the overall package we are introducing in response to the crime situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill establishing the Criminal Assets Bureau, which is currently before the Dáil, will consolidate the effectiveness of the measures in this Bill.  At the same time, this Bill will clear the way for the operational parameters of the bureau to be put in place now in advance of the enactment of the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill and for actual on the ground action and co-operation to take place.  I am grateful to the House for its agreement to take all Stages of this Bill, which I commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We will do all we can to facilitate her in the speedy processing of the Bill; there will be no difficulties from this side of the House.  This welcome Bill is aimed at ending an extraordinary system of effective legislative gagging which has been imposed over the years on Revenue officials, gardaí and certain other people in the public service.  It has had the extraordinary effect of frustrating public interest, specifically in the investigation of crime.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an important adjunct in the legislative package which was passed yesterday by the Dáil.  Its purpose will be endorsed by most right thinking people and while I have heard some whimperings from extreme elements in civil liberties groups, in general, nobody who has the public interest in mind could possibly oppose this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heretofore, as the Minister's speech clearly indicated, a scandalous situation existed.  That was illustrated last night on RTE's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; television programme in which a retired member of the Garda Síochána regaled us with the adventures of the late Martin Cahill, <Col N="1453" /> known as &ldquo;The General&rdquo;.  He said that Revenue officials who had visited that gentleman's house in Cowper Downs had their investigations brought to a halt by Mr. Cahill.  He dismissed their inquiries regarding the taxability of his very considerable wealth by claiming openly that it was based on crime.  As crime was outside the remit of the Revenue Commissioners they could not continue their investigations, nor could they bring their knowledge to the assistance of the Garda Síochána who were being treated with contempt by that late but not much lamented individual.</P>
    <P>Al Capone was imprisoned after a long criminal life, not because the American authorities succeeded in producing proof of his known criminality, but because of infringements in his tax affairs.  It is astonishing that we had to wait until these recent tragic crimes were committed before we regularised this aspect of our laws.  In a sense, however, it is better to do it now than not to have done it at all.</P>
    <P>It is bizarre that a criminal in Ireland could shield himself from Revenue investigation simply by pleading that his money came from crime, and after that admission remain a free man.  It is astonishing that that situation should have been allowed to continue.  Such a bizarre interpretation of how the interests of law abiding citizens are protected by the State beggars the imagination.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome because it aims to bring to an end something that we all now, regrettably too late in the day, regard as having been bizarre.  Will it achieve all that it is intended?  How will the courts interpret the Bill when it becomes law?  Will judges apply the will of the Legislature or will they, as they have done all too often in the past, come up with their own novel interpretations of the will of the people, as expressed by their elected representatives, to bring something which we all regard as having gone too far to an end?  I realise that the Minister cannot legislate for legal interpretation. All she can do is put a Bill before us which is as tightly drafted as <Col N="1454" /> possible, and then hope that good sense will prevail in the courts.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of the Bill which I welcome is that it facilitates interagency activity in a way which has been absent heretofore.  It is extraordinary that different State agencies, all with their own investigative capacity, have been forced by law to confine their investigations within their own narrow areas.  They have not been allowed to get involved in the war on crime on a united basis.  We should be under no illusion that a war has been waged against the people, business life and families of this country.  We have to commit ourselves relentlessly until the war is won.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an important adjunct to that process as well as being an adjunct to the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, for example, to which the Minister referred. That is important legislation.  The type of joint agency approach envisaged in this and in the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill has a great deal to commend it and I and my party certainly welcome it.</P>
    <P>At a minimum, it will mean that the scandal and the gratuitous insult to the taxpayer of the conspicuously rich crime barons abusing, for example, the social welfare system, local authority and general medical services can now be brought to an end.  These benefits are incidental to the main purpose and intention of the Bill, the investigation of crime and the wealth of criminals.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, however, with some facets of the Bill.  This is not in any way meant to be a negative criticism and I know the Minister will take it in the spirit in which it is offered.</P>
    <P>The Bill seems to focus, in addition to revenue and public services, only on financial agencies; the Minister knows my views on this.  Section 13, for example, deals specifically with banks. She outlined precisely why it is worded in that way.  It provides additional legislative jurisdiction governing material which may be in their possession.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that professional groups, specifically solicitors, accountants and auctioneers, will be <Col N="1455" /> included under the remit of other legislation. However, I still wonder why there is no specific reference in this Bill to information in the possession of accountants, auctioneers and solicitors or even bookmakers &mdash; the Minister did not mention that group in her speech. All these groups can, wittingly or unwittingly, innocently or with culpability play a role in money laundering activities. Why have we not made a specific reference to them?  Section 13 states that it can be extended them by ministerial order but it would be a good practice to mention these professions specifically if these are the ones the Government and the Ministers have in mind.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned, for example, at the exclusion of solicitors and the effect of this.  It would be good and prudent to mention them.  I am not suggesting that solicitors as a group or profession would willingly allow themselves to be used as a bolthole through which criminals could escape.  I accept without question that the overwhelming majority of solicitors uphold and vindicate the law to the best of their ability. However, there are a small number of firms in this profession which are not only careless of their responsibilities but act wittingly and in concert with major criminals in this city and throughout the country.  I accept absolutely that the number of such rogue solicitor firms is very small and could perhaps be numbered on the fingers of one hand, but they do exist.  These incidences are well known, particularly within the legal fraternity. It is astonishing that the legal fraternity, a self-governing profession, has allowed and tolerated these firms.</P>
    <P>For example, in the current issue of <i>Phoenix</i>&mdash; this is not a magazine Members often cite but it gives considerable insights and prints stories that others would not &mdash; there is an example of an intriguing discussion of the activities of one particular solicitor, a gentleman called Orange.  There is no doubt that this gentleman did more than just act on his client's instructions.  When a <Col N="1456" /> solicitor acts outside the norm, he could play a highly significant role in organised crime.  Yet, while solicitors are clearly envisaged as being one group to which section 13 may be extended, they are not specifically mentioned in the Bill and this is an oversight.  Although I accept what the Minister said about other legislation being used to widen the scope and specifically refer to solicitors, they should be included here as well.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with another issue regarding the same profession.  This arises, and I have spoken to the Minister privately about it, from a judgment made by the last President of the High Court in the case of Doran <i>v.</i> McGuire and others.  In essence the judgment in this case absolved the solicitor who provided information, which he must have known to be erroneous, on the basis that the solicitor was acting as an agent. Even though he knew that all the information passed to the solicitor acting for the purchaser of the site was wrong, and indeed false, the defendant, by pleading that he was acting as an agent, could duck liability to compensate a young couple who have been damaged irreparably because of his activities.</P>
    <P>I accept that this judgment was in a civil matter.  It has only emerged recently after an extraordinary and contemptible delay on the part of the High Court when the legal fraternity were allowed to play ducks and drakes without any consideration of fairness, equity or justice.  This judgment could have a bearing on how the courts interpret this Bill and the other legislation being put in place and the role of solicitors in the context of that legislation.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting a High Court judge will go out of his or her way to frustrate the will of the people and the Oireachtas in this matter.  However, I am conscious that this judgment is regarded as something of a benchmark and I wonder whether it will have an interpretative effect.  The application of Mr. Justice Hamilton's judgment in the Doran case could provide the shield for unscrupulous and indeed criminal solicitors. I am anxious the Minister consider <Col N="1457" /> this point.  I know that her officials, who are aware of the case, will be able to ease my mind in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious to see a specific reference in the Bill to other professions which have been mentioned, specifically accountants, auctioneers and bookmakers. I note that the Minister omitted the latter from her contribution.  We all know that the horse track, betting and gambling constitute an area which facilitates money laundering.  We are anxious to ensure that any potential loophole in the law is closed.  I am sure it will because the Minister is as anxious as I am that the legislation will be comprehensive, not just in its wording but in its impact.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the responsibility of the courts and I agree with her. She specifically referred to the need for the courts to interpret the law and see themselves as proactive.  Other State agencies, for example, the judges and the court system, have a duty to act in the best interests of the community in co-operation with the Executive.  I agree with the Minister.  All too frequently the courts do not see that as their responsibility.</P>
    <P>I can understand why the courts guard jealously the concept of the separation of powers.  Anybody who has any interest in constitutional law would observe that, but all too often the courts go too far in interpreting the law and sometimes do so in such a bizarre way that it stands the very meaning of law on its head.</P>
    <P>There were criticisms of judges in the other House last night from which I do not dissociate myself completely.  Too often the best legal brains in this country have been employed in a way that frustrates justice.  It does not help to promote justice and it certainly has not helped to bring criminals to justice in the past.  For example, the article in <i>Phoenix</i> and the judgment to which I referred relieved that solicitor of a substantial financial penalty.  How this can happen?  How is it that when it comes to a court case so many of the legal minds can be turned to interpretations <Col N="1458" /> which give succour and aid to the criminal and very little aid or comfort to those who do not commit crimes?</P>
    <P>Judges in recent times have seen fit to point the finger at political leadership.  I am not a sensitive politician and we are all used to taking criticism but the judges could turn their scrutiny on their own activities over the years and on the legal profession.  It seems that all too often the legal profession is prepared to be naive, accept all that is said to it and use its best brains to interpret the law in defence of what is ultimately indefensible. We on this side of the House will do all we can to facilitate the speedy passage of this Bill.  I compliment the Minister on its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. The purpose of this welcome Bill is to implement the important and necessary legal changes which were recommended by the working group set up earlier this year by the Government to examine ways of targeting the assets and proceeds of criminal activities.  As we are aware, the working group had representatives from the Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Welfare.  Its recommendations when implemented would pave the way for better co-operation between the State agencies in the fight against organised crime.  The group put forward a series of measures to allow for freer proactive exchange of information between Revenue and the Garda Síochána in the case of suspect assets and activities that is allowed to date by law.  It is hoped that this Bill will remove any obstacles which would hinder the efforts in tracking and targeting the assets of criminals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also covers the safety of Revenue officials in pursuing tax assessments of suspected persons and to allow for the use by Revenue of Garda intelligence information in making tax assessments without disclosure of the source of this information unless authorised by a senior Garda officer.  The new Garda Commissioner, Mr. Pat Byrne &mdash; I take the opportunity of wishing him well &mdash;<Col N="1459" /> is confident that major drug dealers can be brought to justice and that to get at drug dealers' assets was a step in the right direction.  There is a myth that Ireland is one of the most densely policed countries in Europe but two independent surveys conducted in 1992 and 1995 stated that Ireland is ranked 9th out of 12 countries in the ratio of police to public.  That is why this legislation is of critical importance in tackling the drug barons and drug-related crime. Better co-operation between Government Departments and agencies is a must.  It is critically important that there is a very high level of co-operation between them.  This problem is as much the responsibility of the Departments of Finance, Education or Health as of the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>The working group set up by the Government considered the question of extending the list of bodies of professions to which sections 32 and 57 of the 1994 act dealing with money laundering apply.  It is obvious they felt that the extension of the money laundering reporting requirements in this way would be of considerable assistance in the fight against organised crime.  The reporting requirements of the money laundering provisions of sections 35 and 57 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, are now extended to solicitors, accountants, auctioneers and estate agents.  This will ensure effective reporting and allow for the practical operations of the requirements at professional firm level.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that this Bill is before the House.  For far too long drug barons have been living in luxurious houses, driving fast and expensive cars, dripping in gold, wearing the most expensive clothes and drawing social welfare benefits. We have been looking at them, reading about them and watching them on television.  The ordinary person in the street has been asking how this can be.  In fact every politician in the House has asked the same question.  We have heard and read of Revenue Commissioners being attacked when they investigate some of these drug barons. <Col N="1460" /> We have heard of intimidation of Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Síochána.  We cannot stand for this in a democracy.  We must stand up to people who are a threat to society and democracy.</P>
    <P>This legislation will also benefit young people.  It will deal effectively with the drug barons.  I hope we will see better co-operation between the various Government Departments and agencies so that the drug barons will be put behind bars once and for all and we may help to stop the greatest threat to our society.</P>
    <P>As the law stands, if assets are to be confiscated it must be proved that they are the proceeds of drug or other serious crime.  If a person is convicted of a drug related offence and has £0.5 million, he or she could say it was won in a bet.  It would be difficult to identify it with the proceeds of drugs.  What might be common knowledge is not legal proof.  Some criminals have cultivated reputations for being heavy gamblers, frequenting casinos and gambling clubs and some use teams of runners to place heavy bets with bookmakers.  Such money buys expert advice.</P>
    <P>This legislation will put the onus on solicitors, accountants and estate agents to report suspicions they might have that people are attempting to put illegal money into the system.  The 1993 tax amnesty was a godsend for criminals.  It allowed many of them to legitimise their operations &mdash; to set up companies to front their illegal trading and invest in a variety of portfolios, including property. Through a combination of terrifying threats and lucrative kickbacks, the drug lords have been known to persuade bank officials to participate in their scams.  They have also become associates of respected members of the business fraternity and have gone into business for themselves.  Paying the best consultants has enabled some criminals to set up a network of companies and businesses which can launder money at will.  They also invest in the comparative safety of offshore banks and companies away from the police and tax officials.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" /> There is frustration in the Garda that the judicial system has failed to keep pace with the dramatic and sophisticated development of modern crime. We hope that the legislation passed by the Dáil yesterday and being debated here today will deal effectively with this. There is wholesale intimidation of the police, judges and juries.  It was brought to my attention recently that a defendant is entitled to have the names and addresses of members of a jury in certain courts and there has been wholesale intimidation of jury members.  This matter should be seriously examined because those who serve on juries act in the public interest and their names should be confidential.  I welcome the Taoiseach's announcement that the Government's package will mean 600 extra gardaí on the streets, hundreds more prison spaces, more judges and bail reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>My party supports the Bill.  Every possible means must be made available and used against criminals and this Bill will be another weapon in the State's armoury in tackling the threat posed to society by organised crime.  The unprecedented levels of violent crime require radical measures and I welcome the measures proposed in the Bill.  However, legislation on the Statute Book will be of little benefit unless it is followed up by thorough and rigorous enforcement.  The public is demanding rigorous enforcement of the law and it is becoming impatient with the legislators. All parties must accept responsibility that legislation such as this was not put in place long ago.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the Revenue Commissioners may give information relating to a person to a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána or to the head of any body established to identify the assets of crime, to deprive criminals of the benefits of such assets and to pursue subsequent investigations leading to proceedings.  These are welcome aims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that relevant investigation means investigating other <Col N="1462" /> offences in addition to drug trafficking or money laundering.  It is also welcome in that it puts into effect a legal presumption in favour of the Revenue Commissioners to the effect that a certificate or signature will stand in legal proceedings unless the contrary is proved.</P>
    <P>As politicians we cannot preside over a society in which the ill-gotten gains of criminals are flaunted in the shape of big houses, fast cars, yachts and expensive foreign holidays.  Our greatest duty as a nation is to protect decent, law abiding citizens.  Their rights to live in safety without fear of intimidation or threats are fundamental in any democratic society.</P>
    <P>The proof of this legislation and other legislation before the Oireachtas yesterday and today will be in its effectiveness. We must use the legislative muscle at our disposal to come down heavily on those who have made fortunes on the backs of the most vulnerable, especially young people.</P>
    <P>We have arrived at the stage where ordinary people can only look in amazement at the fortunes amassed by people from the proceeds of crime and the failure of the institutions of the State to act against them.  I meet people in my own constituency who find it difficult to make ends meet.  Some of them are in low paid work and find it difficult to meet their mortgage repayments.  They have no hope of ever flying to Lanzarote, Majorca or other such places and they look on people whom they believe to be involved in lives of crime flaunting their wealth.  Many believe that the State had the powers to act, but did not, against such people.</P>
    <P>This Bill allows the various organisations in the State &mdash; the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda Síochána, the Department of Social Welfare and others &mdash; to come together.  When enacted, the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill will provide for this on a statutory basis.  It will be possible for them to use their combined resources to tackle these criminals and the proceeds of their criminal activity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> The Bill is welcome, but there is a difficulty with the tax amnesty.  Fear has been expressed that many criminals used the tax amnesty to effectively launder their money and have acquired immunity and protection from the law. Under money laundering legislation, banks are required to report suspicions about the origins of customers' finances, but the State and the Revenue Commissioners were not in a position to investigate people unless there was proof when the burden of proof placed on them was greater than the burden of proof created under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Many of those we are trying to target in this Bill have already ensured they have immunity from the law through the tax amnesty.  There have been reports to this effect in the newspapers and criminals themselves have declared that they have availed of the amnesty.  The Minister for Finance said that their affairs could be reopened, but it is the opinion of my party that the burden of proof to be placed on the Revenue Commissioners under the tax amnesty legislation is greater than that provided for under this Bill.  In view of this I have put down an amendment to ensure that the provisions set out in section 1 of the Bill will also apply to the tax amnesty legislation.</P>
    <P>If we want to gain public confidence and make it believe we are trying to tackle the drug barons and those who have made fortunes from criminal activities we must ensure all necessary measures are taken.  In the other House the Minister for Finance seemed to be of the view that this was not necessary but I believe there is doubt.  If it is not possible for the proceeds of crime which were laundered through the tax amnesty to be investigated, my amendment should be supported.</P>
    <P>We have a duty as legislators to ensure these people know it is no longer acceptable for them to roam freely through society, do as they like and tell the institutions of the State that they are untouchable.  It is sad that we have to introduce legislation to ensure the anonymity <Col N="1464" /> of Revenue and Department of Social Welfare officials who will give evidence in these cases but none of us would ask officials from any Department to put the lives of themselves or their families or their property at risk. It is unfortunate that we have reached this stage but this legislation accepts that we have and that we must put forward measures to deal with it.  We have read of the various threats and malicious attacks carried out on officials working on our behalf of and that of the State and I am glad this Bill will give them anonymity when reporting or dealing with these matters.  This is a frightening development but it has come to pass.</P>
    <P>I did not speak on the Proceeds of Crime Bill but I am glad the Government is trying to clamp down heavily on criminals.  I do not know how successful these measures will be but they are a step in the right direction and from that viewpoint my party is willing to support them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  As one commentator put it in today's newspaper, at last we are in a position to fight back effectively.  One might say he was somewhat insensitive to the position of this House as two Bills which form part of the Government's anti-crime package are being discussed here today. However, he is right to say there has been a substantial change in the mindset of politicians and society in general on the problem of organised crime.  It is now up to all of us to put words into action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is important to consider the Government package as a whole, its principal element is the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill which passed Second Stage in the Dáil yesterday.  The establishment of a special anti-drug baron and antimoney laundering unit, comprising the powers of the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and Department of Social Welfare investigators, was part of my party's recent policy document on <Col N="1465" /> the drugs problem.  I am pleased this proposal forms a central plank in the Government's package.</P>
    <P>Our party document deals with the whole drugs problem, including treatment and demand reduction.  I look forward to seeing the results of the Government's ministerial task force on demand reduction, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  Reducing the demand for drugs on the street through educational measures and the expansion of youth services or by offering treatment to those who wish to kick their habit, is as important in the fight against drugs as any measure passed here today.  If demand is reduced, there will be no money in drugs and all the problems will be solved.  This aspect will have to be pushed by the Government and everyone concerned with this issue.</P>
    <P>Those who will work in the Criminal Assets Bureau will volunteer for their positions but they will be well rewarded for a difficult and dangerous job.  We all know there is intimidation.  These will require every protection the State can afford.  I welcome the provision in this Bill that affords a maximum level of security and secrecy to members of the Revenue Commissioners or the Criminal Assets Bureau in giving court evidence. The prime purpose of this Bill will be to facilitate the work of that bureau when it is established.</P>
    <P>We have discussed the drugs problem in this House in the last year.  While I would not go as far as Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, whose comments in the Dáil were given extensive coverage in the newspapers today, it would be foolish not to recognise there is more to solving this problem than just resolving legal difficulties.  There have been difficulties at operational level.  The Minister for Justice declared in July 1995 that there would be co-operation between the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda and other relevant State agencies.  The establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau, although long overdue, is particularly welcome in this regard.  The Bill allows the interchange of information between the various <Col N="1466" /> State agencies which will be essential in the task of the Criminal Assets Bureau, whose work would be impossible without it.</P>
    <P>This Government has been subjected to much criticism from the Opposition on this issue over the last few months.  It could be inferred from listening to them that they had never been in Government. One of the Opposition parties held the Justice portfolio for the full seven years prior to them losing office. However, the record of the Opposition in some of the issues is far from impeccable. In particular, I refer to the prolonged campaign against section 153 of the Finance Bill, 1995, which would have forced financial auditors to inform the authorities of any wrongdoing in their client's account.  There is a similar provision in the Bill which has not led to the same level of opposition.  Could it be that they know their opposition to section 153 was misplaced?</P>
    <P>I have seen evidence of the damage to young people caused by drugs.  A neighbour of mine, a young girl of 21, has been in hospital for a number of months following the effect of drugs. Nobody knows the dangers.  Is it right that people make money at the expense of the health and future of our young people?  I welcome this Bill as part of the Government's anti-crime package and I agree with Senator O'Toole that it is a strong package.  I assure the Minister of our full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I am pleased to contribute to this debate.  The measures which make up the Government's crime package mark a significant departure in our criminal justice system.  This Bill is only part of the package but an important one. There are a number of important initiatives which comprise the Government package.  I welcome the commitment to conduct a review of Garda operations. It is important people have confidence in the Garda system.  Low morale in the force must be tackled quickly.  At the Garda conference in Galway a number of years ago, the débâcle between the <Col N="1467" /> GRA and the federation did not augur well for how society viewed the Garda and how they conduct their business. We are aware of the difficulties which have faced the Garda recently.  I hope they do all in their power to bring the two organisations together.  Everybody is at fault in relation to the problems in society.  With the appointment of a new Garda Commissioner, we have a chance to review existing Garda operations as suggested recently by former Commissioner Culligan.</P>
      <P>This Bill has a number of functions.  I welcome in particular the section relating to sharing information between the respective State agencies involved in combating drugs.  This measure should have been in place already.  It is a principle which needed to be extended.  It should be included in legislation being prepared by the Minister for the Environment to allow local authorities access to information to prevent anti-social elements, including drug barons, from being housed.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the measure contained in this Bill to ensure secrecy for tax inspectors of revenue officials involved in the prosecution of offenders is overdue.  The murders of Veronica Guerin and Garda Jerry McCabe made it clear the lengths to which these barons are prepared to go to protect their vile trade.  It has been clear for some time that special measures are needed to tackle these barons.  The establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau is critical in that regard.  It was called for by my party colleague, Deputy Shortall, recently in the Labour Party policy document on the subject.  The establishment of this bureau is, in effect, a declaration of war against the baron &mdash; one which we must fight and win.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Calnan pointed out, section 2 imposes an obligation on the authorities and people working in the financial sphere to report suspected money laundering.  My colleague was right to make the comparison between this measure and section 153 of last year's Finance Act.  There is a significant <Col N="1468" /> difference in terms of the harm done to society between tax evasion and money laundering.  However, we are trying to ensure compliance with the rule of law.  Tolerance of any level of tax evasion sends out the wrong message, that is, that the law applies to some, but not to others.  I commend the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who contributed to the debate.  As a chartered accountant and auditor with some experience of investigations and as a former Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, I believe the question of inter-agency co-operaton has remained outstanding for some time.  The different services have had their own traditions and there were also perhaps legal barriers preventing the full co-operation, which we would like to see.  Doubts can now be completely set aside because this legislation and the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, 1996, will provide a positive framework for full co-operaton between the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>As somebody who represents a constituency, parts of which face a considerable drug problem and in which a number of criminal families operate and as somebody who comes from the centre of Dublin, I do not believe we should live in a climate of fear caused by excessive media hype where we do not feel we have the resources to beat the criminals.  The message being sent out as a result of this week's debates is that we have the will to beat the criminals and that we will provide the necessary legislative and other resources.  Let us not exaggerate the intelligence, charisma and resources of criminals, although they are extensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that in 1983 we faced the first heroin epidemic in Dublin. That was dealt with by appropriate improvements in legal measures and in Garda management and operations. The major families at that time were successfully put behind bars.  With politicians and parties acting collectively <Col N="1469" /> this week, we also have the power to do so again.  We have probably been slow to react to the changes in criminal practice and to the massive increase in the spread of drugs.  During the epidemic in the early 1980s, heroin was very expensive. In parts of my constituency a bag of heroin to smoke costs three times the price of a packet of cigarettes.  That is what has changed the scene more than anything else.  One can buy an ecstasy tablet for a rave or a disco for a small amount of money.  If one needs to come down after taking the tablet, one can buy heroin to smoke, relatively cheaply.</P>
    <P>Criminals and the international drug trafficking trade have created a much wider market where, unfortunately, all children, regardless of their background, will be targeted.  That is why I agreed so profoundly with what Senator Calnan had to say.  We are addressing the law and order side today but we must tackle the demand side.  If children in places like Clonakilty, County Cork, and Dublin do not buy Ecstasy tablets &mdash; and it is not a drug of choice not just for poor kids but for well-off middle-class young adults to buy at the weekend &mdash; then the market will be cut at its source.  We need to operate on both fronts.</P>
    <P>On a number of points raised specifically by Senator Roche and his worries about the professional bodies, I agree that the professional bodies &mdash; which are self-regulating and have argued that self-regulation ought to continue as they are the best regulators of their own affairs &mdash; have an absolute duty not to hide clients behind a notion of professional self-regulation.  Solicitors, accountants and estate agents have that duty to the rest of the community.  The reason they have not been included in the Bill today is that the Minister has undertaken to consult with those bodies after which they will be included in the appropriate money laundering legislation. These bodies cannot stand back now as shrinking violets and say they have reservations which would not enable them to take part in this drive against organised crime and racketeering. They will enter into negotiations <Col N="1470" /> with the Minister and the Department of Finance, but let it be clear that those professional bodies have an enormous duty to society to help this campaign against organised crime.  I hope they face that responsibility and that we do not hear any special pleading such as we heard at the time of the debate on section 153 of the Finance Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>Everybody, including well healed accountants and lawyers, must put their shoulder to the wheel.  I can tell the Senator that the powers exist.  Discussions will take place because we must take account of privilege, not in relation to client accounts but on legal advice &mdash; the privileged relationship particularly between a lawyer and client.  They have a duty to co-operate.  If those professional bodies fail to co-operate enthusiastically, I would be very surprised.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan raised the tax amnesty and Deputy Michael McDowell raised this point in the Dáil.  The Department of Finance and Revenue officials did not agree with the Deputy's interpretation.  He is an esteemed lawyer and I know he has advised his party on this position, but the officials have no doubts about their ability to reopen cases under existing legislation.  They have been permitted to do so in cases which relate to the tax amnesty.</P>
    <P>Let us nail this canard that somehow or other the tax amnesty is usable to hide the benefits of crime.  It is not and the Revenue and the Department of Finance are confident of their ability to use their powers which have already been used in a number of cases, one of which may have involved criminal activity, and several other cases related to more general tax matters.</P>
    <P>If a difficulty should emerge, the legislation can be reviewed because all sides are in agreement &mdash; this was specifically written into the terms of the tax amnesty &mdash; that criminals should not be afforded any protection under the tax amnesty.  Let us be quite clear about that.  I give the Senator that undertaking.</P>
    <P>This Bill is like John the Baptist in that it is a precursor of the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, 1996, which will <Col N="1471" /> come before this House in the autumn. The mechanism of co-operation can be set up as soon as this Bill is enacted.  We will then have the formal statutory basis for the bureau in the autumn, in other words, we will have an excellent opportunity over a number of months to see if there are problems to which specific attention must be given.  Having worked as an auditor and chartered accountant, in the Department of Social Welfare and now as Minister of State at the Department of Justice, I am aware of this lack of co-operation.  I give Senators an absolute undertaking that if there are obstacles to the fullest co-operation between the different agencies and the effective operation of this bureau, we will take that on board in the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill when it comes before this House in the autumn.</P>
    <P>As regards the points made about bookmakers, we have been advised by the gardaí that they are satisfied with their powers in this respect.  It is possible for the Minister to extend provisions to them but under the Betting Act, extensive powers are available to the Revenue Commissioners and, specifically, to Customs and Excise.  The working group was satisfied that the powers were satisfactory.  I give an undertaking that if we need to extend the powers of the gardaí or others in this respect, we will do so.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" />&ldquo;1.&mdash;Where a &lsquo;relevant person&rsquo;, within the meaning of section 63A of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 (as inserted by this Act), furnishes a certificate to the Revenue Commissioners that he has reason to suspect that any person to whom a certificate has been issued under the provisions of the Waiver of Certain Taxes, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993 may have made a false declaration under section 2(3)(iv) of that Act, the Revenue Commissioners shall, notwithstanding any provision of that Act, furnish to the relevant person such particulars, documents and information as the relevant person may require to assist in determining whether the declaration in question was false.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I propose this amendment because for someone to have their tax amnesty affairs reopened should not require proof of the falsity of the declaration as a precondition but should require that where somebody, who is a relevant person within the meaning of section 1 of this Bill, certifies to the Revenue Commissioners that he or she has grounds to believe or reasonable grounds to suspect that the funds to which a certificate relates were illegally obtained, he or she should be able to break the secrecy provisions of the amnesty with a view not to sustaining the matter by proof but investigating whether it is true.  This is of major concern to my party.  As the Minister said, Deputy Michael McDowell raised this matter yesterday in the other House.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance are satisfied they have the power under the amnesty legislation to reopen files and that they do not need the burden of proof which we believed was necessary.  Nobody accepted that criminals should be allowed to launder their assets and legitimise their position through the tax amnesty.  I was also pleased to hear that when the bureau is placed on a statutory basis we will have <Col N="1473" /> an opportunity to discuss it.  I accept the Minister's commitment to amend the legislation if necessary.  On that basis, I will not press the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 deals with accountants and solicitors.  I listened carefully to the Minister of State's reply on Second Stage and I fully endorse her efforts in relation to the Bill.  I supported many measures regarding the right to silence and changes to the bail laws when it was not popular to do so. With the greatest respect, I have reservations about section 2.  I appreciate the serious challenges faced by the Government, the Garda Síochána and other State agencies involved in tackling crime and I completely oppose the hype and high profile given by the media to many criminals in the past.</P>
      <P>Much of what we are attempting to do is important and there has not been any knee jerk reaction.  The Government has been very careful and prudent in its actions.  However, this area of the legislation should be examined carefully. I read the Minister for Finance's Second Stage speech on this issue.  I accept that he is an accountant and has much interest in this matter &mdash; the Minister of State also has a professional interest in it.  In the past, I have had cases of murder, rape, armed robbery, etc.  Under our system of justice, and even under the British system at its worst, confidentiality is maintained between solicitor and client at all times. We should not allow drug barons and other criminals to push us into changing the privilege that has existed between solicitors, accountants and auctioneers and their clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> As a person who has been involved in the area of law, I have great reservations about this issue and I hope the Minister of State will examine it carefully. I accept the right of a journalist to have privilege regarding information they receive and also their right not to disclose their sources.  The Minister of State will be aware of a recent European Court decision regarding the media's right to privilege.  A situation will develop where solicitors representing someone charged with a serious offence will be obliged to walk a narrow line if they have to disclose information relating to money laundering or proceeds that are lodged with them.  It is a difficult and dangerous area.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to be prudent and careful in this area of the legislation. I do not say that as a shrinking violet because I have made unpopular statements on the effort that is required to tackle organised crime.  The Revenue Commissioners have extensive powers under legislation introduced by Deputy Bertie Ahern when he was Minister for Finance, to enter properties, seize books and retain them indefinitely.  When a person purchases a property, the solicitor acting on his or her behalf must submit their details and information on the vendor must also be submitted.  A vast amount of information is required, including PRSI numbers, names and addresses, where people reside and even their relationships and families. We are entering into something which will cause problems in the long term.</P>
    <P>We have one of the finest Attorneys General and I pay a warm tribute to him and the Government for their work on this, but we must be prudent and cautious. Everything needs change and that is good.  However, there are some areas where change may not be advisable and this is one of those instances.  I accept that the Revenue Commissioners have experienced intense intimidation and threats and many brave people working there fulfilled their duties in spite of that.  There are sufficient powers without entering into an area where, as the <Col N="1475" /> Minister said, there is privilege in regard to legal advice.  When you start dividing and separating it, you enter uncharted areas.  If someone who is charged with some serious offence or is about to be arrested comes to me, I will feel hamstrung in advising them.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that, under a later section, the Revenue Commissioners are granted privileges.  They need them because, in the past, Revenue Commissioners and social welfare officers had to give their names and addresses and some were subjected to horrendous abuse and intimidation.  I am glad that gardaí will now accompany and protect them.  In this instance, however, if a solicitor has already been in consultation with a client and the information is suddenly disclosed, the solicitor has no such anonymity to hide behind.</P>
    <P>I have never disowned anything I ever did or said and do not intend to do so in the future.  However, we are entering uncharted waters and I ask the Government not to go a step too far.  We in this House and those in State agencies cannot allow these people to push us a step too far because they in their own way are attempting to break the system.  We must ensure the system we have is carefully preserved because it has stood the test of time under different administrations here.  It is the one used in Britain and across Europe.  We must be careful and prudent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept absolutely the sensitivity of the issue of confidentiality outside of the client relationship and the profession and the issue of privilege but would caution the Minister in the opposite direction.  Professional bodies in this country have far too willingly accepted their privileged position and, unfortunately, have allowed a tiny minority of no more than four or five clients in Ireland to behave in a way which is profoundly against the public interest.  I do not accept that nor do I accept that privilege in any profession should be a shield for criminal and antisocial behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> I am surprised that negotiations with the various professional bodies have not been completed at this stage.  I share the Minister's view that the 99.999 per cent of solicitors, accountants, auctioneers and other professionals in Ireland who are law abiding people have nothing to fear from this legislation.  The purpose is not to destroy the centuries old concept of privilege but to prevent it being abused.  That is the point the Minister made and, if I interpreted it correctly, I agree with her and do not think there is any danger or that we need worry about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Enright is a solicitor and an honourable member of that profession.  The Government is consulting the professional bodies on the important question of privilege.</P>
      <P>We are facing a new level of organised crime and racketeering and we need new and appropriate mechanisms to deal with it.  We are talking about laundering assets and putting the proceeds of crime, particularly of the drugs trade, into legitimate property or businesses. In order to buy property or invest in a company, drug barons must use professionals to launder the money and legitimise their cash holdings in property or another asset.  We will need specific and special powers to deal with the small percentage of professional advisers who may be thus involved.</P>
      <P>We use the term &ldquo;enabling&rdquo; in relation to alcoholism &mdash; people, without necessarily meaning to, enable others to become alcoholics and to continue drinking.  A small percentage of professional advisers is prepared to enable drug barons.  This legislation may restrict somewhat the traditional rights and entitlements of privilege enjoyed by legitimate professional advisers but it is necessary in the interest of choking off money laundering and the availability of drugs money to be put into legitimate businesses.  This is a fundamental aspect of money laundering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The example of Al Capone is apposite. Law enforcement agencies in the <Col N="1477" /> United States have found that while it might not be possible to prove certain matters on the criminal side, it may be possible to attack assets.  For many professional criminals it is a far worse penalty to have their money taken away from them than to serve a limited period of time in jail.  In this legislation we are talking not just about impoverishing the criminal but also their families and associates.  What makes them big guys and gives them status in their communities is when they drive down the street in big cars, speak into mobile telephones and wear designer clothes.  We will take all that away from them and prevent them putting their money into legitimate accounts in building societies or into property and businesses.  In order to do so we must modify some of our traditional approaches to ensure that we have the weapons we need.</P>
    <P>The concept of privilege with regard to legal advice is protected under the Constitution and we are very aware of that.  It will be necessary to safeguard that.  In this Bill we are giving the appropriate weapons to the new bureau, the Garda and other bodies to ensure that they will have the power to act against the small percentage of professionals who are enablers of money laundering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported the restriction on the right to silence.  I am in favour of changing the bail laws.  I went so far as to say that drug offenders should be sent to and detained on Spike Island. I also said I would turn Spike Island into a type of Alcatraz where those who had perpetrated such horrendous crimes, abused people of all age groups and wreaked havoc on society would be committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certain that we will tackle and beat the drug barons.  We will certainly put them behind bars and out of business. When that is done, however, the laws we pass now will remain on the Statute Book.  If, for example, a person buys a property with £400,000, the Revenue Commissioners will be aware of that transaction and will be entitled to get information from the purchaser.  If <Col N="1478" /> that person does not have the information the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to see his or her books and details so they can find out exactly what he or she has done.  These are considerable powers.  I am in favour of granting whatever additional powers are necessary, but there will be considerable constitutional difficulties on foot of this provision which I am anxious to avoid. The Minister is doing so much that is correct in this regard that I would prefer her to be prudent and careful in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche is correct and I will not contradict him.  There are good doctors, solicitors and politicians, but a certain percentage of people in every walk of life act, not just on the borderlines of the law, but outside the law. Some people do not conduct themselves in a proper manner.  However, we cannot make great changes simply because one or two people cause problems and destroy the good reputation built up by other members of the profession.  Legal professional privilege has existed here and in Britain through the most difficult of times.  In Britain, even during the worst times and where they have had terrorist offences, no effort has ever been made to break the priviliged relationship between solicitor and client.  The same holds true for other European countries.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is not old fashioned. This change will have long term repercussions and affect many people.  I do not consider our discussion today amusing. We should be very careful.  I am very uneasy and concerned at what is happening.</P>

It states that the officer may give evidence in the sight and hearing of a judge and in the hearing only of anybody else. I presume that means the official will give evidence behind a screen.</P>

I am aware of the problems many of them encounter when they go into areas and the threats and intimidation under which they are obliged to carry out their duties.  That problem also arises in relation to court cases.  Some people in the media publish the name of those charged with an offence, but are also on occasion anxious to publish the name of the official.  It is one of the problems faced by civil servants since <Col N="1480" /> they are no longer anonymous and can create difficulties in discharging their duties.  I agree with Senator Roche that some effort should be made to ensure that those who publish the names or photographs of officials are sanctioned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding what the Minister of State said, which I accept, I still believe it would be better if we mentioned the principal professions with which we are concerned here &mdash; not in the sense of fingering them or making an accusation but because it would give power to the Bill.  It would be better to do it that way rather than by ministerial order.  In a sense, mentioning the professions puts a greater emphasis on the responsibility which lies on those and other professions to observe this provision.  The list includes auctioneers, accountants, estate agents, solicitors and bookmakers. That is not an exclusive list but <Col N="1481" /> it does put a very special responsibility on those persons.  It would be prudent of the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very good debate earlier about the concept of privilege, particularly in relation to the legal profession.  As I said, we have undertaken to consult the professional bodies.  The powers are there for the Minister to extend it by order and it is our intention to do that after the appropriate consultation, particularly in the context of privilege.  Having heard Senator Enright at length, it is necessary to get that constitutional point right and it is appropriate to consult those bodies. As I said, I confidently expect that, unlike discussions which took place last year with some of those bodies, this year accountants and lawyers will endorse and support this legislation while, at the same time, guarding due constitutional privilege in relation to privileged relationships with clients where these exist.  I appreciate the Senator's concerns but if he could accept what I said it will be included after the appropriate consultations to address the constitutional point correctly.  The Senator said earlier that sometimes one entered unknown territory regarding how judges would ultimately deal with Acts.  It is important to address any constitutional queries which arise, such as those which Senator Enright raised.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I do not want to use the term &ldquo;abortive&rdquo; but there were consultations last year.  At that stage they were exercised about the possibility of having to come forward in relation to tax evasion.  This specifically relates to money laundering and criminal activity, particularly in the context of the drugs trade.  The professions are self-regulating on the basis that they are responsible.  Given the kind of crisis facing society I expect them to fully and enthusiastically live up to their serious responsibilities.  I am confident that, as Senator Enright said, the vast majority of professional advisers will be happy to co-operate with the Garda Síochána, the new agency or with any other agency in the fight against drugs and organised crime.</P>

If the laws available to the State and to the Revenue had been utilised in the past some of this legislation would not be necessary.

Some of these professions, to use the Minister's own term, are far from &ldquo;shrinking violets&rdquo;.  Last year, when other Ministers approached these professions, in a way that would have been generally accepted by the public, progress was not made because these are fairly tough professions.  They were not particularly forthcoming last year.  I do not believe that there are ongoing discussions with the bookmakers at present because there is an oversight in the Bill.  While I will not call for a vote I would like my reservations to be recorded, not to be difficult but simply to put it to these professions that if they adopt an obstructive position with the Government in this matter they will not get solace from the Opposition benches.</P>

Since the passage of the earlier Bill, during the course of which I remarked upon the fact and regretted that I had not attended the briefing session <Col N="1485" /> in Buswell's Hotel held by various people in relation to the drugs issue, I discussed this matter with some of my colleagues.  I discovered that as far as I can make out, no Member of the Seanad received such an invitation. Members of the Dáil were invited.</P>
      <P>In fairness, one should be permitted to state this because it would be unfortunate if it was left simply with my regret that I had inadvertently not turned up, implicating the entire House in a discourtesy to this group of people. In fact, if there is discourtesy it lies with the other party.  I hope the Minister does not mind this because it is important that we should not be left with the impression that no Member of the Seanad turned up to a briefing.  No Member of the Seanad was invited and that is a pity.  I hope that in future if these groups release a statement to the effect that they invited both Houses and only 50 out of over 200 turned up, they ensure that invitations arrive at the addresses of Members of the Seanad.</P>

The groups to which Senator Norris referred were very concerned with the demand side and the provision of education, <Col N="1486" /> sporting facilities and health care.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that parents or anyone who has dealings with young people realise that all sectors of society are exposed to the scourge of drugs.  All our young people, in rural areas or in cities, face the same temptations.  The hopes and prospects of participating in society and gaining employment are very important.

I would like particularly to thank the officials of the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Justice, the Garda and members of the working group who contributed their expertise and knowledge to the formulation of this Bill.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, this Bill clears the way for absolute sharing and pooling of information and for the Criminal Assets Bureau to bring together all our resources to fight the criminal.  The money generated by the drugs trade is enormously significant.  Like Senator Norris, every Member is conscious that the drugs trade is no protector of geography, class or anything else.  It is pervasive throughout society.  I did not have an opportunity to meet the parents yesterday because I was in the House, but many of them have suffered and were bewildered as to how their families got involved.  That should serve as a warning to us all.</P>
      <P>Although we are concentrating on the criminal aspects of the drugs trade this week, we are all aware that it is just one side of the picture.  Equal attention needs to be given to deterring young people from getting involved in drugs and where, unfortunately they do, making appropriate treatment and support available to them and their families.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>My motion relates to the need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in light, among other things, of the ongoing developments in Northern Ireland, to ensure that Irish representatives at the United Nations take a prominent role in the ceremonies surrounding the international day of peace on 17 September next as already suggested by the Northern Ireland based group.  Reconciliation through Communication. I would like to outline some of the background to this matter.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I was contacted by a gentleman called Vincent Coyle from Derry who wrote to a number of public representatives.  I will not make the mistake I made earlier of suggesting he write to all Members of the House.  He wrote to some Members with detailed information concerning the idea of an international reconciliation day in which a massive number of emblems would be printed and distributed after a formal presentation at the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1488" /> At first sight this might appear a little naive, but I am not sure that the Government is in a position to maintain this case, especially in light of the effective and moving example they themselves set when they launched the white ribbon day and many of us chose to wear that emblem.  That, according to some of the sophisticated elements in the press was derided as being tokenism, sentimental and rather blurred. However, it caught the attention, hearts and minds of a great number of people and so also with this.  There is an international day of peace already declared and there are various movements for peace.  I was on the committee of the Peace Train.</P>
    <P>We often see the word &ldquo;peace&rdquo; invoked.  What has been added by Mr. Coyle and his group in Derry is an important element, that is, reconciliation &mdash; peace through reconciliation. We saw the classic need for this in Drumcree in the last few days because there had been no reconciliation on the ground between the opposing communities. A newspaper today states that a majority of Roman Catholics surveyed in Belfast believe there will be a Roman Catholic majority in the North of Ireland within 30 years.  The majority of Protestants surveyed in Belfast believe there will be a Roman Catholic in 20 years.  That is an interesting discrepancy because it suggests that there is very little communication between the two groups when they have not even agreed on this demographic development.  It seems to me that underlying that is a fear.  The Protestant community clearly fears they will be swamped.  If there was dialogue, communication and reconciliation, these fears would be appeased in a much better way.</P>
    <P>Mr. Coyle's proposal has received generalised support from various Ministers of this Government, members of the European Commission, various agencies of Government, etc., but he is being continually placed in a Catch-22 situation.  Before the ceasefire he mounted the &ldquo;Derry Can Do It&rdquo; campaign to hold the 1995 Eurovision Song <Col N="1489" /> Contest in Derry city, RTE having staged the contest for two successive years in the South.  This may appear to be a dream but look at what has happened. Nobody believed that contest could be successfully staged in Millstreet yet it was an immense success. It says something for the vision of Mr. Coyle who, in his document, quoted President Kennedy who said that the best way to secure the future is to invent it.  If we could invent a future in which there was peace achieved through reconciliation &mdash; the only way to achieve permanent peace &mdash; and if by imagining it, we could accomplish it, even if in the process we were labelled &ldquo;naive&rdquo;, we would have done something very worthwhile indeed.</P>
    <P>The project was booked for the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The Minister also encouraged the project in a number of letters. However, he indicated that there was no heading under his budget to provide finance; finance is, of course, part of the kernel.  Former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, pledged full support for the project and accepted an invitation to become a patron.  Contacts were established in over 30 countries worldwide and words of encouragement and well wishes were received from many of them.</P>
    <P>The aims and objectives outlined in various documents I received from Mr. Coyle are clearly put: to raise international awareness of the reconciliation process so vital in establishing a sustained and sustainable peace in Ireland and indeed the world; to involve ordinary people as well as world leaders in the process; to allow all those of goodwill the opportunity to proudly wear the proposed symbol of a white dove inscribed with the word reconciliation on their breasts in a public statement of unity; to declare a commitment towards achieving reconciliation on all levels from personal to cultural to communal; the day would provide a platform of significant international PR potential and place Ireland and her friends firmly on <Col N="1490" /> the world stage and it is proposed that on 17 September, during the two week build up to the day, it is intended that Reconciliation through Communication present to President Clinton 1 million white dove emblems in a gesture of thanks from the people of Ireland to him and to his administration and Government for all the help they have given to the people of Ireland and the central role they have played in assisting in establishing peace in other world conflict resolution zones.  A number of these emblems would be distributed to the individual states that make up the United States and the various nations that make up the United Nations.</P>
    <P>It turned out that 17 September had been celebrated for a number of years as the international day of peace &mdash; not peace and reconciliation &mdash; by the UN. A development of this project was engaged in, particularly having had the encouragement of certain sections of the EU Commission.  I refer to a letter of 30 January 1996 from Mr. Esben Poulsen on behalf of the President of the Commission, Mr. Jacques Santer, which states:</P>
    <P>... I admire your enthusiasm and commitment ....  The peace and reconciliation programme can only be successful if new ideas like yours are generated from within the populations of Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland themselves.</P>
    <P>The next development Mr. Coyle and his group suggested was that the peace and reconciliation element should be added to the existing 17 September celebrations in the UN in New York.  As 17 September is designated as UN day of peace and is celebrated in the UN building in a brief ceremony at which the Secretary General, together with a handful of other representatives, symbolically rings the peace bell, it was suggested that immediately thereafter the Secretary General together with the representatives from the UK, Irish and Norwegian missions be handed the reconciliation emblems as a gesture of <Col N="1491" /> thanks and goodwill from the people of Ireland, symbolically reaching out the hand of friendship to the world.  Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali would also be presented with a custom made ceramic reconciliation chalice.  There were strong indications that various television companies, including RTE which, although it was not in a position to make special allocation of finances for coverage, would be enthusiastic about covering such an event.</P>
    <P>The significance of such a public relations exercise was underlined when, in order to defuse a potentially ugly media situation which had developed around the success of Michelle Smith, President Clinton made a public relations gesture by being seen on television enthusiastically supporting her. He clearly understands the significance of peace through reconciliation at the level of international sport.  For the level of peace in a situation of possible violent conflict, even civil war, it is worth us making a similar effort.</P>
    <P>A letter was sent to Reconciliation through Communication from the Department of Foreign Affairs, following this amended suggestion, from somebody who was helpful, Mr. Sé Goulding of the human rights unit, which stated:</P>
    <P>As you are already aware, the day in question has already been designated as the International Day of Peace by the General Assembly and as 17 September is also the first day on which this General Assembly convenes, we have been advised that it would be unacceptable to attempt to supersede this with an alternative designation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the agenda for this opening day has already been carefully prepared and decided upon in such a way that amendments or additions are not possible.</P>
    <P>Therefore it would not appear possible to incorporate your suggestions, e.g. the peace bell into the programme. While I accept that the proposal <Col N="1492" /> is one which has merit, regretfully, I have to inform you that such a presentation will not be feasible in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note there is a certain level of misunderstanding.  The peace bell is already included in the ceremony. It is not an additional formal item which is being suggested.  It already exists and all we are suggesting is a presence at the ceremony.</P>
    <P>In the extensive correspondence related to this matter, Mr. Coyle is repeatedly encouraged and pushed from one person to another.  He is directed, for example, to Co-operation North and the International Fund for Ireland.  At one point Mr. Coyle attempted to approach individual businesses, corporations and trusts and he was told by them that they already contribute to the IFI or Co-operation North, for example. When he approached them he was rejected.  I am surprised at this, especially in the case of Co-opreration North because no later than a couple of weeks ago I heard one of the chief executives of Co-operation North say on RTE radio that he did not know what was wrong with this country in that there is £15 million waiting to be allocated and to date he had only received applications for £2 million.  There is £12 or £13 million lying fallow and he asked what was to be done with it.  In the circumstances where there is this volume of support for a well meaning and potentially extraordinarily useful and valuable enterprise, how is it that, without explanation in a situation where there are surplus funds, such a worthy project is dismissed without any detailed examinations or explanations?</P>
    <P>I know nothing to the discredit of this organisation or the two individuals with whom I have dealt &mdash; Ms Morelli and Mr. Coyle.  If there is anything in the background of the organisation which leads to suspicion and so on &mdash; I am delighted to see the Minister of State shake her head &mdash; we should be told. We are entitled to an explanation, not perhaps directly from the Minister of <Col N="1493" /> State but certainly from Co-operation North.  Where there is a superfluity of funds and somebody protests on the radio about the dearth of applications and when a serious well founded, valuable, politically significant application is made, it is a pity that it should not be actively supported.</P>
    <P>Sadly I today received communication from Mr. Coyle saying that in the circumstances, and having spent considerable amounts of his own time and money, he considers it necessary to withdraw from the project.  I spoke to him by telephone this afternoon.  He is, as usual, optimistic.  He told me it was a beginning, that at least it has been open, that there has been this level of support and that the day of reconciliation falls on 17 September every year.  If now we start making preparations for next year and even if the ideas of peace and reconciliation result from this small debate and the degree of publicity we have managed to get are moved forward, then I believe he feels that his work will not have been in vain.  Given the kind of valuable energy he has maintained from the early days of civil rights in 1968 in Derry to today, he will be vindicated.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Norris for raising this matter. As the Senator has explained, 17 September, which will also be the opening day of the 51st session of the UN General Assembly, is the International Day of Peace.  The commemoration is entirely at the direction of the Secretary General.  These ceremonies inevitably centre around the opening of the General Assembly itself.  As the Senator has said, the day is traditionally marked by the ceremonial ringing of the peace bell which is a simple but formal occasion to which the Secretary General invites the permanent representative of each country accredited to the UN.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the suggestion made by the company.  Reconciliation Through Communication Limited, to my Department regarding the possibility of permanent <Col N="1494" /> Irish participation in the Protocol surrounding the ceremony and including the distribution of symbolic doves to those dignitaries present.  However, it must be borne in mind that this is a highly formal occasion at which only the ambassador of each accredited country will be invited.  It would, therefore, be inappropriate for a single mission or group of missions to appear to seek to direct the Secretary General in fulfilling the functions of his office in commemorating this day.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, while the invited Irish representative will participate, I regret it will not be possible to arrange for the participation of any NGO in the ceremonies as at present constituted, or for the distribution or presentation by Irish officials or others of emblems or gifts originating from an NGO, such as the one referred to by the Senator.  I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has recently made this position clear to Reconciliation Through Communication Limited.  I assure the Senator that the formal nature of this ceremony does not mean that the commitment of the Irish people to the search for peace throughout the world will not be represented to the Secretary General of the UN or to the other member countries of the UN on this day.</P>
    <P>On the points made by the Senator, I think the addition of the concept of reconciliation to the day of peace is profoundly good.  For instance, I am intensely involved in a range of diplomatic initiatives on Burundi where the situation is fraught and dangerous.  The key there is reconciliation and finding a pathway through the ethnic tensions and rivalries which exist.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to be obstructive but in the context of the UN we are bound by the powers of the Secretary General and the ceremony is at his disposal. However, I am not sure whether there are any ceremonies in Ireland on 17 September so it might be appropriate to mark it symbolically in some way in order to initiate the process and to take it from there.  The UN is a body with which one often deals at great length so <Col N="1495" /> Mr. Coyle might be advised to allow a year for preparation and perhaps to originate the project in Ireland, get the support of people like the Norwegians who have been much involved in these initiatives, and see if it can be built from the ground up.  I cannot comment on the relationship the group has had with Co-operation North because that does not come within the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>As the Senator is aware a great many individuals and organisations are seeking to give expression to the widespread desire for peace and reconciliation.  In common with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, I think these initiatives are profoundly positive.  They are sometimes technically difficult to implement but they represent the will of many people to express our desire for peace.  In that context I welcome this group's work and <Col N="1496" /> I know the huge amount of time and energy which goes into it.</P>
    <P>As I said, in the context of the UN and the specific day I cannot be helpful to the Senator at this point but there may be other ways of approaching the matter.  It may have taken Picasso only a couple of minutes to scrawl a dove but it became a profound symbol of the concept of peace for many generations so these ideas are important.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her positive response and for her suggestions which I will pass on to Mr. Coyle.  However, I shall continue to try to find out why Co-operation North, with such an expansive residue of funds, found it impossible to deal with this in a detailed way.  Perhaps I will take that up with the organisation myself.</P>
