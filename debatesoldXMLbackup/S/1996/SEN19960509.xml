      <P>I have received notice from Senator Honan that, on the Adjournment of the House today, she wishes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to outline the efforts being made by the State agencies under his aegis to ensure the retention of 130 jobs in Butler Engineering.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to outline the response of his Department to the archaeological finds at Kiltalown in west Tallaght and to report on the feasibility of a heritage park at this site.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2 and 3.  Item 1 will be taken without debate by agreement and item <Col N="542" /> 2 from now until 1 p.m. and from 2 p.m. until 6 p.m.  Part I of the Bill, which is the most substantial part, will be taken until 3.30 p.m. and the remaining parts will be taken from then until 6 p.m.  Item 3 will be taken from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.  As I mentioned yesterday, we are pleased to see the Harbours Bill, 1995, through its final Stages today.  Will the Leader outline the legislative programme for the rest of the session?  If he cannot do so today, will he do so next week?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The report by the visiting committee on Mountjoy Prison appears to be discussed by everybody except the Members of the Oireachtas.  Will the Leader find out when this report, which should be public property, will be made available to Members of the Oireachtas?  I gather it has been referred by the Department of Justice to the Attorney General's Office, but I would like to think there was not much delay in giving an opinion on whether there was the possibility of libel with regard to the report because it is being discussed on radio programmes.  In fact, all the complaints in the report appear to have been raised in previous years and, indeed, addressed in the five year plan which Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn introduced when she was Minister for Justice.  I would be grateful if the Leader would find out how soon we will be in a position to discuss this obviously very disturbing report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the remarks made by Senator Henry on the report of the visiting committee on Mountjoy Prison.  When it becomes available &mdash; and I hope it will be soon because it is being debated extensively in the media &mdash; we will have an opportunity to debate it in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Finance Bill, I note that the Leader said he expected it to finish at 6 <Col N="543" /> p.m.  I assume in the unlikely event that it continues until 6 p.m. he does not propose to have it concluded by a single vote on all the outstanding issues because that would not be a good move on his part and would not be welcomed on this side of the House.  I know that if he were on this side of the House, he would not welcome it either.</P>
    <P>The other matter is an important one which was raised last week.  Once again, I appeal to the Leader to make the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture, Food and Forestry aware of just how much disruption has been caused by the continuing dispute in the public service. I do not want to enter into the debate about the various agreements that are in place and how important they are.  At this stage the dispute is causing serious hardship for individual farmers, in particular, and others.  Will the Leader do whatever he can to influence the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister for Finance, who, I understand, has primary responsibility in this area, to ensure this dispute is concluded as quickly as possible?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Ministers for the Environment and Health to get together on a matter which is causing great distress throughout the country?  There was a headline in this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> concerning bacteria getting into a new unit in St. James's Hospital; but there are other hospitals around the country &mdash; and I know of one in particular &mdash; where the patients are asked to bring in bottled water because the hospital's water is either contaminated or not fit for use.  If this is the case in certain hospitals around the country, it is time a survey was carried out to find out what has happened to the water supply to these hospital, that is, whether it is that it is an old system or whatever. Apparently, the St. James's Hospital water system is a new one, so both Ministers should get together urgently on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> On the Order of Business, I ask that the Government convey to the United Nations that we are satisfied with the reports coming from south Lebanon. This morning Mr. Peres said: &ldquo;Do not trust the United Nations&rdquo;.  This is coming from one of the two countries set up by a vote of the United Nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise a matter relating to agriculture which Senator Dardis has already raised, that is, the unrest caused among farmers by the Civil Service strike.  It is causing farmers great concern, especially at this time when farmers are buying and selling breeding bulls.  Bulls are being exchanged at present having had no tests carried out on them.  This is serious for the bovine disease eradication scheme.  The Minister introduced a new scheme recently which will prove to be a disaster.  I told him that in this House.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to ask the Government to take steps to co-ordinate action at Government level to prevent the further pollution and degradation of Lough Derg in the Tipperary, Galway and Clare area.  It has become a matter of great concern.  Fish kills are being noted every day.  The quality of the water, which is a special asset to the people around there, has been degraded.</P>

Everybody is anxious to get it on the Statute Book and into effect.  Next Wednesday I will outline the business we intend to see processed between now and the end of the session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry and Senator Dardis raised the Mountjoy visiting committee report.  I will find out immediately after the Order of Business when it is intended to publish it.  I will communicate with both Senators and if needs be <Col N="546" /> try to arrange a debate.  Senator Dardis asked when we will finish today.  I do not even recognise the word &ldquo;guillotine&rdquo;. The time of 6 p.m. is aspirational.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dardis and Senator Kiely mentioned the effects of the CPSU dispute.  Everybody is aware of the hardship and disruption and I will pass on once again their concern. However, I know that every effort is being made to try to resolve this dispute, which is not a single, stand alone dispute but part of a wider network.  I will also pass on Senator Lanigan's concern about bacteria and the quality of water.</P>
      <P>It is my view that the report of the UN more or less coincides with the observations of the Irish troops, so I do not think there should be any difficulty in accepting that report.  Senator O'Kennedy mentioned Lough Derg.  It is my belief that there is a plan for Lough Derg but I am aware of the deterioration in that beautiful lake and I will pass on the Senator's concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as expansive as the mover of this recommendation in saying that I reject the recommendations moved in the name of Senator Fahey.  I can elaborate if needs be, but they are out of line with the attempts we are making to reform income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the changes he made in the Finance Bill have no real significance as regards the amount of extra income to be gained and that he should consider the increased levels outlined in the recommendation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that. The increased limits will exempt a further 16,000 taxpayers who in turn will have 18,000 children.  The overall number of people who will be exempt from tax in 1996/97 because of the exemption limit is 95,000 with 17,000 children.  If one looks at any of these components on their own, one can make a case for increasing or reducing that limit.  The reality is that one must look at it in its totality.  The totality of what we have done across the spectrum of income tax reductions is very substantial.  Over 100,000 people, including children, or 95,000 former taxpayers will be out of the tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that people on lower pay are no better off in real terms as a result of the changes?  Regardless of what the Minister may say about taking more people out of the tax net, the reality is that when one examines the budget tables people are no better off than they were before.  There is no incentive to work unless it is correlated with the social welfare code.  Too many people are on <Col N="548" /> unemployment assistance and it is not worth their while to work because of the levels of tax they are forced to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complex area in that a number of different factors must be looked at.  Of course, the case can be made for greater tax reductions &mdash; we would all like to do that and we are working at it.  However, we have to work within the means available to us and on a programme basis over a number of years.</P>
      <P>The focus this year, because of the debate which has taken place for the last number of years, has been on trying to ensure the benefits in tax relief are focused on the lower paid.  That is what we have done.  I can go into the detail if Members wish.  It is impossible to construct a tax system where everybody is a winner, and anybody who suggests it is possible is, perhaps inadvertently, misleading the public.  We have concentrated tax relief on the lower end of the income spectrum.  That, plus the changes we made to PRSI and the fact that people leaving long-term unemployment are entitled to retain their medical card, means there is a considerable improvement in the total picture.</P>
      <P>I do not want my comments to be taken as complacency or conveying a sense we have achieved what needs to be achieved and there is nothing else to be done &mdash; that would be erroneous.  We have a long way to go in terms of changing our tax system but it cannot be done overnight.  It has to be done in the context of the wider picture.  That is what we propose to do this year and I do not propose to go further in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to explain this to the public.  The Minister says he is endeavouring to help lower paid workers.  However, I wish to give as an example a student who works as part of his college course in a co-op and because he earns a few pounds he loses the benefit of his covenant.  I know that <Col N="549" /> has been changed because covenants have been abolished&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>So have his fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been abolished for the future but I am talking about a student who last year lost the benefit of his covenant because he earned a small amount of money.  Can the Minister explain to these young people what is Government policy in relation to low paid workers and people who find it very difficult to survive at college without incurring enormous expense and who lose the benefit of their tax covenants because they earn a few shillings? In such cases there is not even an incentive to stay in college.  It is time to stop bluffing about what is being done for lower paid workers because nothing is being done for them in this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the number of people who would fall out of the tax net as a result of provisions in the budget and the Finance Bill.  Could he explain how, given all the people who have fallen out of the tax net over the last ten years, there are still people paying tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing this particular resolution.  I would be happy to engage in a long debate on all this but let us put some facts and figures on the table in respect of the changes which have taken place in the last number of years.  In regard to the long-term unemployed and low paid workers in the competitive, exposed sector &mdash; in other words, non-public servants &mdash; last year the first £50 of income they earned was exempted from PRSI and that has been increased this year to £80.  Those are dramatic changes.  If one looks at income tax and ignores everything else one is not looking at the full picture.  I know the nature of the Bill is such that we have to do it <i>seriatim</i> and look at it item by item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the debate we had about how it was not worth someone's while to come off the live register to <Col N="550" /> take up a job, particularly if they were lowly educated and unable to earn much more than £150 or £200, we made significant changes in PRSI for such people coming into the paid labour market.</P>
    <P>We have also made very significant changes for sections of the economy which complained to me during the currency crises in 1993 and 1994 they were losing market share and some of them were going out of business.  The customers of traditional, labour intensive businesses tend to be large British retailers.  Clothing companies across the country were complaining that a rise of two or three points on the Irish pound <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling was wiping out their bottom line because their profit margins were very low; the labour cost component of their total product output was inordinately high, as much as 40 or 50 per cent, given the nature of what they were doing.  What we did for them on both fronts was unprecedented and has taken a great deal of pain out of the system. We reduced employers' PRSI by 3 per cent for anybody earning less than £13,000 per annum and exempted from PRSI the first £80 per week earned by an employee.</P>
    <P>In regard to the long-term unemployed sector, I would be the first to admit we have a very badly co-ordinated and non-integrated system of payment of wages and tax and social welfare. We have a great deal of work to do there which will not be easy to implement.  However, under this year's budget, someone who has been out of work for a number of years and gets a job can now retain their medical card for three years.</P>
    <P>No Government since the foundation of the State has done as much in terms of tax changes and financial measures for the long-term unemployed.  I challenge anybody to refute that.  Of course, we could always do more and we would all love to pay no tax.  However, the reality is the people who do not want to pay any tax are those who also demand all the services delivered on a 24 hour basis, seven days a week.  Those two <Col N="551" /> things cannot be done at the same time; it has to be one or the other.</P>
    <P>No Minister for Finance deliberately sets out to be unpopular or approaches his or her job with a view to screwing as much tax out of the system as possible. That is not in the nature of anybody seeking re-election.  All Ministers for Finance, with one recent exception, knew they were going to have to seek re-election.  Therefore, they were influenced to a certain extent by such considerations.</P>
    <P>I said clearly that in this year's budget we were focusing on the long-term unemployed.  I know the policy measures which were introduced &mdash; the PRSI changes and the income tax focus &mdash; disappointed a number of people.  I said we had a choice to make.  Politics is about choices and we will address other issues in next year's budget.  However, the measures we introduced for the long-term unemployed, such as the medical card retention and the £80 per week subsidy for people over a certain age, will address the problems of the long-term unemployed, which exist despite all the buoyancy in the economy.</P>
    <P>We are the best performing economy not just in the EU but in the OECD group &mdash; which includes New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Korea, the United States and Canada &mdash; in terms of net job creation.  Last year, one in every ten jobs in the European Union was created in this country &mdash; by the private sector not by the State &mdash; even though we account for only 1 per cent of the EU's population of 373 million.  We are trying to reduce the number of jobs the State is creating.  Let us have some facts about what is going on.</P>
    <P>I can give Members the schedule of what the improvements would be, but to have an amendment that says &ldquo;increase this limit to a certain amount&rdquo; would add extra costs which I cannot accept because the budget is framed.  In so far as we had the resources to do so, we focused our attention on income tax this <Col N="552" /> year on the interface between the long-term unemployed and low paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes a plausible case but it does not stand up in reality.  This week a man in my clinic had been offered a low paid job, yet a fairly significant contribution would be taken out for tax and PRSI.  The man explained that he could not go to work because he would lose his rental subsidy worth £90 per week.  At least the Minister's statement acknowledges that there is bad co-ordination between the social welfare and tax codes.  Until the Minister tackles the problem, the £100 million being spent this year on initiatives for the long-term unemployed will go up in smoke.  I accept that the Minister has made progress but he must tackle the lack of co-ordination between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Finance.  We will not find any solution to this problem until it becomes worth an employer's while to take a person on and worth that person's time to get off the dole and onto a weekly wage.  What impact does the £140 PRSI relief's removal have on the lower paid?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get those figures for the Senator in a moment.  It still leaves them ahead in terms of net gain relative to where they were this time last year.  The Senator said that someone who came to his clinic was getting a £90 rental subsidy.  Was it £90 per week? I would love to know where that person is because I can tell the Senator that any community welfare officer who authorised a £90 weekly rent subsidy is in serious danger of being called before their supervisor.</P>

      <P>Having raised the matter many times in the House, I welcome the decision to extend the medical card to those in employment for three years. The impact is more important psychologically than financially.  The knowledge that the medical card will be made available for three years should be promoted because many patients do not know about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Henry has said.  Part of the difficulty is that much of the employment that becomes available for long-term unemployed people, or for those with a low skills base, is of short duration. Because of the nature of the modern market economy, the employer cannot give commitments beyond a number of months or a year.  Consequently, the job's time duration guarantee can be very short.</P>
      <P>People act rationally when it comes to their own self interest.  They do a calculation on the short term benefits, what they would lose and the time they would have to spend getting back to where they currently are.  That is a function of the failure of our social welfare administrative system, which, notwithstanding what I have just said, has improved in leaps and bounds.  The integration of the two leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax and social welfare group, which has been sitting for over three years, has completed its work but its report has not been finalised.  Senators, however, should not hold their breaths for any dramatic revelations because it is quite disappointing and poses problems for all of us.  I would refer the House to the ongoing controversy about taxation of short term benefits.  Senator Daly is aware of it, given the area he <Col N="555" /> represents.  People want it both ways, which, I suppose, is the norm in politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised with the Minister the question of students who are in co-operatives as part of their training for university degrees.  This applies especially to the computer area where most students will enter long-term jobs. I appreciate the difficulty this Minister and his predecessors have had with the long-term unemployed.  The way to tackle that, however, is to make sure the young unemployed are dealt with quickly so they do not get into the chronic situation affecting many of the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>It is frustrating for students who find it difficult to get through long courses such as the University of Limerick's degree course for computer scientists. All such students are being employed as soon as they qualify, but they find it difficult to get into the colleges.  Can income earned by students in co-operatives be exempted in some way that would not interfere with benefits from covenants, for example?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to the Senator on that.  Much depends on the individual's circumstances, including income coming to the parents which is obviously being transferred.  We got rid of covenants because they were being abused in a manner which was growing exponentially.</P>

The system is different now in that every employer is obliged to take tax and PRSI where it is appropriate on a weekly basis because it is calculated on a weekly basis.

      <P>As I said on Second Stage, whoever came up with the proposal to give a tax break to old age pensioners living alone is not dealing with the reality in the west.  I went to an active age group in Letterfrack, at which 27 people were present, only two of whom could qualify for the rebate.  If the Minister cannot accept this amendment today I ask him, in the name of common sense, at least to examine it seriously.  It provides that anyone in receipt of an old age pension who lives alone and thereby qualifies for a living alone allowance, who therefore would be a member of a contained group, would be entitled to a payment of £100 towards a security alarm.  That is approximately 30 per cent of the cost.  I press this recommendation strongly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In view of the crime and vandalism inflicted on old people throughout the country but particularly in the west over the past few months, there is a need to give support to old <Col N="558" /> age pensioners claiming a living alone allowance.  In the group I met, only two out of 27 qualified.  At a subsequent meeting of the same group, one of the companies displayed a security system which is widely available &mdash; it has been developed by former members of the Garda Síochána and costs £250, with an annual monitoring fee of £40 &mdash; and it emerged that only two or three of the group were able to afford this system.  It is not that everyone will apply for a rebate but many need the security of knowing they can get an alarm if they so wish.  I urge the Minister to consider this proposal instead of the tax allowance being enacted.  We were told yesterday it would cost £10 million if the 100,000 people in this category applied for the measure in my recommendation. What would it cost if that number of people were given the Minister's tax free allowance, which most of them cannot claim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking clarification. The Minister will recall that when this measure was announced in the budget there had been a spate of activities in rural Ireland which were a cause of concern to all.  Thankfully these have abated, but as we approach winter people will be intensely interested in availing of this provision.  I received inquiries after the tragic events of the last few days and many people are uncertain about the proposal.  Section 5 (1) states that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;qualifying individual&rdquo;, in relation to qualifying expenditure, means an individual who, at the time the expenditure is incurred, has attained the age of 65 years and who, for the greater part of the year of assessment in which the expenditure is incurred, lives alone [.]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people at risk can often include an elderly couple, but this appears to apply only to a single person.  There is no greater safety having two persons aged 70 or over rather than one in a house. We will receive an avalanche of inquiries from people in that category over <Col N="559" /> the next few months and we should be clear whether we are bringing in a set of regulations which will reduce the number who qualify.</P>
    <P>I also ask for clarification of section 5 (4), which reads:</P>
    <P>Any deduction made under this section shall be in substitution for, and not in addition to, any deduction to which the individual might be entitled in respect of the same payment under any other provision of the Income Tax Acts.</P>
    <P>That appears to mean that if people are already availing of certain deductions what they receive under this section will not be in addition to what they currently receive but in substitution for it.  Is any financial assistance available to those who fall within that category?</P>

      <P>This recommendation meets the question raised by the Senators on the Government side, that is, whether two elderly people aged 65 years of age upwards would be covered by this scheme.  It would not involve an enormous amount of money because the cost of installing an alarm system would be the same whether there were one or two pensioners in the house.  The Minister would be doing a lot of elderly couples living in isolated areas a favour if he accepted this recommendation.  It would also meet the views of some Senators on the Government side who recognise, as we do in the west, that there is a grave problem, especially in isolated rural areas.</P>
      <P>The amount of additional expenditure incurred by the Government in covering elderly couples would be limited. I will not document the cases in which elderly couples were beaten up, robbed and left in a bad way, both physically and financially.  This would provide a minimal amount of assistance and the Minister would do well to accept the recommendation to include an elderly couple living together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Daly's recommendation is very sensible.  Even if we look at it from the point of view of the implications to the Revenue Commissioners, it would not matter whether it was a married couple or a single person in terms of the cost to the State.  I have reservations as to the merit of the scheme.  I accept it would be of some benefit to people living in villages and towns, but putting alarms in houses where only sheep will hear them is questionable. The time it would take gardaí to get to some of these areas would be so long that the robbery would have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A better way to approach this is through Community Alert and Neighbourhood <Col N="561" /> Watch schemes where people look after their neighbours.  That was the approach taken by the farming organisations in response to a problem at a particular time.  I note what Senator Howard said about section 5(4) in that it would be only open to people who do not qualify under any other relief.  If farmers with taxable incomes installed an alarm systems in their farm houses, tax deductions would be involved and they would qualify in any event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this welcome scheme but we must consider the cost given that people are always talking about paying taxes and if we widen the scheme it will cost more.  Many people live alone and some have neighbours and relatives who look after them, while others live in towns with houses close by and they do not need alarms.  We must assess the number who need them.  Perhaps in the next budget the Minister might see fit to extend the relief to two people, if the demand is not too excessive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea for this proposal came from an elderly constituent of mine, a retired civil servant, who came to my clinic about six months ago. My constituent made the observation long before the tragedies in rural Ireland hit the headlines and made the point that there should be some relief because of decline in the sense of security which we all feel, young or old, urban or rural.  The idea was considered and, understandably, the instinctive response from the permanent government in the Department of Finance was not to give anymore concessions, which <Col N="562" /> is its job.  Unfortunately, I was not persuaded.</P>
      <P>We began with the possible cost and tried to get a handle on the figures. According to the statistics available to us, 400,000 people are over the age of 65, of whom 100,000 receive the living alone allowance.  Therefore, to meet the cost of the proposal by Senator Fahey £10 million would be required, assuming that everyone availed of it.  The concept behind this idea is to address the problem of the sense of insecurity which people living on their own feel.  It is undoubtedly true that a person living alone will visit people from time to time and that is the reason they need not be living alone for 12 months of the year. It is written in that way so that somebody will not legally lose their entitlement if they go to stay with a friend or relative for an extended period, as is frequently the case.</P>
      <P>The original proposal was confined to people with taxable income living alone. On consideration, we extended access to the tax relief to their relatives.  As regards the situation in County Mayo, Senator Fahey was perhaps not aware of the change which had been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">

      <P>They must be a very unique statistical example of society that they do not have a niece or nephew or a son or a daughter, either by adoption or guardianship, who would be deemed to be a relative under the terms of this.  I assure the Senator that the Revenue Commissioners will be as sympathetic and as understanding as possible. That group of people must be remarkably unique in its&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about them having a relative under the definition I have given who would be in a position to assist them in this regard.  If <Col N="563" /> they are in the position which the Senator describes, I can assure him that all is not lost.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, as part of the budget package announced a couple of days after it, mentioned additional measures to address the same issue.  It may come as a surprise to the Senator that £2 million in grants will be made available by the Department of Social Welfare to voluntary groups to support the installation of security equipment.</P>
      <P>FÁS will encourage the development of special schemes aimed at enhancing the security of the elderly.  Local voluntary and community groups will be encouraged when planning for this year's student summer job scheme to consider projects which will provide basic security for elderly people living alone.  In addition to what we are providing in this legislation, that facility will be available.  The £2 million could be used to address the category to which the Senator referred.</P>
      <P>To address the point made by Senator Dardis, in rural areas an alarm can be a radio one to alert a neighbour; it does not have to be a box on the gable end of a building.  I take the point that it has limited value in rural areas.  If somebody is connected to a telephone, they can get an alarm system which is linked through the telephone to a point of contact in the vicinity.  We are trying to address the sense of insecurity which people living alone feel.  By virtue of their isolation, the problem is compounded in rural areas.  The definition of alarm includes a radio alarm or something people can press to alert somebody that they are about to be intruded on.  We do not know how well this will work.  We have estimated that the cost will be about £5 million over two years, given certain assumptions about the take up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I partially answered Senator Howard's point by way of intervention during Senator Dardis's contribution. Subsection (4) is exactly as Senator Dardis interpreted it.  Under it a person cannot receive a double allowance.  If a person buys part of an installation, tax <Col N="564" /> relief cannot be claimed for this, even though it may qualify for such relief, if tax relief has already been sought for an alarm system in that person's family home and business because they are connected.  This is a standard provision in all tax systems.  This relief is available to a wide definition of relatives, which covers a substantial number of people. If this does not work, particularly in rural areas, there is a provision of £2 million for the Department of Social Welfare to provide this kind of facility. If there are difficulties, I encourage Senators to contact the Department of Social Welfare to find out how that money can be allocated.</P>

      <P>What percentage of the 100,000 people who live alone are in the tax net?  What would be the cost if they claimed the tax allowance?

      <P>We estimated that there are about 12,000 to 13,000 people with taxable incomes living alone.  The original proposal would only have benefited a small section of the community. This is why we expanded the relief to include relatives.  It is impossible to give the Senator a figure on this but we have to assume, given the nature of Irish family life and the sense of support which, happily, still exists, that it is a substantial number.  The relief is at the standard rate of 27 per cent.  The total cost for 100,000 people living alone at £100 each would be £10 million.</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify the point made by Senator Howard.  The reason the amendment refers to a person receiving the living alone allowance is simply to clearly define the people most affected.  I carried out a survey with the aid of the Garda Síochána on the number of people in Galway who were the subject of attacks over a three month period.  In every case the people lived <Col N="565" /> alone.  They were clearly staked out. The people who attacked them knew they were attacking people living on their own.  In each case, as far as I am aware &mdash; there were one or two cases on which I could not obtain details &mdash; the people who were attacked were not in the tax net.  Some of them did not have relatives who claimed tax relief.  In isolated rural communities of small farmers, like Letterfrack, there are few people in the tax net.</P>
      <P>Although I appreciate that the scheme works well for those it accommodates, I feel strongly that it does not accommodate the many people in rural Ireland who live alone.  The equipment supplied by Telecom Éireann provides old people with security not just against attack but against falling in the bathroom. They can press a pendant and a phone will ring in Enniscorthy where their neighbour, next of kin or the local garda will be informed.  This equipment provides significant security for these old people.  It can save the Exchequer significant amounts of money by preventing the misuse by these people of services provided by the State because they need security.  I am aware of the £2 million provided by the Department of Social Welfare and this is a helpful addition.  However, not many of the 100,000 people will necessarily apply for it.  A percentage will certainly do so but people want the security of knowing they can obtain this system if they want it.  Many people in my area and throughout the country cannot afford an alarm system at present.</P>

      <P>We could discuss this issue for the afternoon but would still not advance it too far.  How much additional funding would be required to extend the scheme to elderly couples over 65 years of age?  I am far more attracted to the proposal of the Minister for Social Welfare, Proinsias De Rossa.  People in the tax bracket would be better off than some of the people living alone who need this equipment.  It might be more advantageous to people who need this service if the Minister for Social Welfare's <Col N="566" /> scheme was expanded.  Under the scheme proposed here, better off people will qualify for the benefits provided for installing alarms whereas people on lower levels of income outside the tax bracket who need this equipment will not obtain any benefit.</P>

      <P>This innovation is imaginative and responds to a deep concern which was expressed last year when the threats to people living on their own throughout the country worried a large number of people.  There is no ideal answer to this.  It is like people looking at their gardens and deciding that the task of doing all the weeding is so big that they will not even start.  If we are to solve something, we should start in a small way and attempt to nibble at it. Otherwise, we will never start.  In this case the Minister has started.  The ideal answer involves Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch and family involvement.  The modern technology being developed, particularly by Telecom Éireann, of radio links and alarm <Col N="567" /> systems will help put many minds to rest.  This imaginative innovation deserves congratulations.  The points which have been made are well worth taking into account.  This scheme is worth pursuing and I am sure the Minister will pursue any additions needed to improve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill must be taken in its entirety.  An erroneous criticism, which has been made with great frequency by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, is that the Government and I are not capable of controlling public expenditure. Giving people grants to install alarm systems is a step in that direction. Ireland has suffered from a grants culture for years and if we want to move towards an enterprise culture, which will be this country's saviour in the future, we must try to wean people off the grant mentality.</P>
      <P>As it involves weaning people off and not cold turkey, the easiest way to do this is to move towards some form of tax incentive.  I understand the points made by Senator Fahey and Senator Daly, but I do not accept that the process, which is painful, slow and without success in many quarters of the country, must be reverted.  We must move people in the direction of doing something for themselves and assisting them in that regard.  There is a belt and braces approach in that money, albeit a small amount, is available for those who, through no fault of their own, are unable to help themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not know how well the system will work.  Senator Quinn is correct.  A start must be made somewhere and the cost provision must be modest.  The total cost provision in expenditure terms from the Department of Social Welfare for security related measures for the elderly, based on the task force report, is approximately £8.5 million.  It is estimated this measure will cost approximately £2.5 million in the current year and £5 million over the two years it will run.  If the response is much greater than <Col N="568" /> anticipated or if anomalies are thrown up &mdash; reference was made to some of these and it may not be possible to foresee others &mdash; the scheme will be refined. However, a start must be made somewhere. The various Telecom Éireann alarm schemes are eligible, including the pendant scheme to which reference was made.  The Revenue Commissioners deem these as qualifying for the tax measures.</P>
    <P>In relation to the point made by Senator Daly, this country has in many respects been cursed by a grant mentality and we must move, however slowly, from that to more self-reliant communities.  Tragically, isolated communities are becoming an increasing phenomena across Europe.  It is not peculiar to the west &mdash; 65 to 70 per cent of the population of Europe now lives in urban areas.  The drift from the land is accelerating and this is compounding the problems of isolation and economic infrastructure in rural Europe.  Modern technology and community alert schemes, such as those proposed in the Bill, are ways of trying to offset some of the negative aspects of the drop in population.  If Senators have the possibility of influencing local communities to run schemes which will connect people through a community alert system in their areas, I encourage them to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to accept the recommendation for a variety of reasons.  The issue of giving tax relief for child support and help in the home is enormously complex and was extensively discussed during the passage of the Bill in the other House.  It was also extensively debated by the tax strategy group, which comprises officials from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and the three political parties in Government.  This group was formed by the previous Administration and continues under this Government.  Early in the year it starts considering and evaluating at length taxation proposals from political and other sources.  It gets technical input from the Revenue Commissioners regarding the practicality and administrative implications of the proposals and from the Department of Finance in relation to their cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of child support and taxation relief for childminders has been examined in considerable detail. However, we are not in a position yet to come forward with a scheme which will stand up or meet the needs of a variety of constituency interests.  For example, two people are working.  They get married and have a child and one decides to stay at home to mind their child. Another example is a couple in exactly the same circumstances who both continue to work and decide to hire somebody to look after their child.  Many problems involving inequality in the household arise, specifically regarding <Col N="571" /> the Constitution and the recognition of the contribution of women in the home, although this is a non binding part of the Constitution.  For example, should the marriage allowance be increased for a couple where the wife &mdash; it is invariably the wife &mdash; chooses to stay at home to mind the children?</P>
    <P>One is back to the Murphy judgment regarding equal tax allowances, and attempting to give tax relief in that sense causes all types of complications. What relief is given to a mother who has a career but who decides not to work outside the home for a number of years?  This poses enormous difficulties and when one runs it through one's mind, one begins to realise the legal complications associated with it.</P>
    <P>Another aspect involves trying to bring people in the black economy into the white economy in terms of childminding. This area is fraught with considerable difficulties.  People either have somebody come to their house or alternatively they leave their child in a house to be minded on their own or with other children.  The cost of a person in the black economy, who is in receipt of social welfare and receiving payment for minding children four days a week, coming into the white economy is enormous, given that a condition would be that they must be in the white economy. They would then lose all their associated social welfare benefits.  The cost of tax relief required to fund a single person on unemployment assistance, who is receiving approximately £70 a week plus entitlements, taking a job as a childminder is enormous in real terms.  In addition, there are complications.  Many people are receiving money to mind children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why would the tax relief be enormous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that, in black economy terms, the going rate for having one's child minded is approximately £80 per week.  This is in on top of what the person gets under the social <Col N="572" /> welfare system, which is approximately £70 per week, plus rent allowance, if they are claiming it, and other entitlements. For that person to come out of the black economy, to sign off from social welfare, to work as a child minder and to have the same amount of money in his or her pocket at the end of a week, close to £180 would be required. To provide tax relief to enable somebody to fund charges of £200 per week, as against a charge of £80 per week, becomes very expensive, and this is before addressing the legal difficulties of discrimination in the tax code regarding a mother who had been entitled to a working income, but who opted to stay at home and mind the children while the husband goes to work.  It is constitutionally frail.  Our legal advice is that it would not stand up in court.  If we lost we would be into a massive income allowance again, which would distort the tax system in a horrendous manner.  I was committed to this.  There are many arguments why it should be encouraged.</P>
      <P>Another aspect that was considered was the provision of tax relief for creches.  The cost of a creche can range from £40 to £60 per week.  I do not know what the cost of our creche will be when it is operating, but it will operate on a cost basis.  In most workplace creches, the employer or employing organisation provides the capital infrastructure of the creche and does not charge rent, but the operating costs must be carried by the participants.  The cost is usually around £40 to £60 per week, depending on numbers. To provide tax relief on that runs the difficulty of discrimination against those who stay at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, many people have made their own private arrangements.  They do not want their children to attend a creche.  I am sure Senator Henry, with her medical expertise, will confirm that one of the quickest ways of exposing one's children to every disease in circulation is to send them to a creche because they will pick up everything very quickly.  Many parents do not want this, nor do they want their children to <Col N="573" /> be minded in a creche; they prefer to have a neighbour do so.  People make many informal arrangements for minding their children.  As soon as a tax concession is introduced to support that, all these kinds of anomalies will be produced.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to the sentiment behind the recommendation.  We have not closed the book in respect of it.  If we want to improve the position of women in the workplace, which the Government is committed to doing, we are going to have to make it easier for parents &mdash; I mean both parents &mdash; to enable this to happen.  We do not have adequate child support systems in place to help working parents, but our current state of knowledge and ideas on the issue have thrown up more problems than solutions.</P>
    <P>In the other House, Deputy Cullen, whose wife is Danish, remarked that there is also a growing revision of opinion on this issue in Scandinavia, where people have had the experience of a generation of intensive creche and childcare facilities.  Children in Scandinavian countries go to creches very early in life and, on reflection, there is a growing view that this may not be the best way to provide support for working parents.</P>
    <P>My long response to the Senator is an indication that we have looked at this issue in considerable depth and with sympathy.  However, we have unearthed more problems in terms of the tax instrument than solutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very disappointing because so many women's groups have looked for tax reliefs of the kind suggested by Senator Fahey.  The Minister enumerated many problems regarding the introduction of such relief.  I would have thought it would have provided more employment, especially in the services industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the same problems arise with regard to providing tax relief for elder care, an issue which was discussed at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights?  At least with children <Col N="574" /> one can define the length of time where care may need to be provided. However, many people who may be in their fifties, especially women, may have to give up well paid jobs to return home to mind an elderly relative whom they think may need care for three months, but require it for longer.  One woman who left her job ended up minding her elderly relative for nine years and was nearly as much in need of care at the end of it as the person she looked after.</P>
    <P>We are looking at the possibility of getting tax relief for such people so that they could employ somebody at home and stay within the workforce themselves. With an elderly person one has little knowledge as to how long they will require assistance.  Will the same arguments against the provision of relief be made?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's response and I accept the complexities of this proposed change.  I put down this recommendation because if we are serious about equality for women who want to pursue their careers, there should be some acknowledgement in the tax code, such as the change proposed here, especially when one considers the very high levels of tax paid by couples where both partners are working.</P>
      <P>I admire the Minister's frank admission that he cannot afford to interfere with the black economy which is booming. I dwelt at length on Second Stage on the need to make a fundamental change in the way we assess inability to work of the long-term unemployed.  If we pay somebody unemployment assistance we do it on two principles: the first is that they are available for and seeking work and the second is that they do not dare to take on any work while they are in receipt of assistance.  As the Minister has acknowledged, this leads to the black economy which we all know is rampant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time for a fundamental and radical change.  Some people in receipt of unemployment assistance who are long-term unemployed and are likely to <Col N="575" /> remain so should be allowed to take up employment opportunities of the kind we have been discussing while they retain their unemployment assistance. They would then be paid an additional amount to work a certain number of hours each week.  This would overcome the problem which the Minister acknowledges exists.  It would also bring common sense into the way the taxation and social welfare codes run against each other.</P>
    <P>It would be useful if there were more frank admissions in regard to the system, similar to that made by the Minister, and an acknowledgement from officials and politicians that there are ludicrous situations which should be changed, even if such change is contrary to the principles for which we all stand. I ask the Minister to take on board this suggestion to tackle the problem of long-term unemployment rather than trying to find jobs that are not available and which, in any event, are not worth people's while to take up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator Henry's remarks, in its review of the issue of childcare, the Second Commission on the Status of Women did not recommend tax deductions.  It said that what was needed were more child support systems, such as creches in the workplace.  This seems to be the approach which should be taken.  Some companies &mdash; such as Fruit of the Loom in Donegal, for example &mdash; have realised that in order for them to retain their skilled workforce, particularly on the fabrication side in Buncrana, they must provide a creche in the workplace because people are moving back and forth and it is expensive.  Until it makes economic sense for the employer and the employee, it will not happen.  We should encourage this development and we are trying to give a lead with the establishment of a creche here, which we hope will be up and running by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards care for the elderly &mdash; the other side of the equation &mdash; we have <Col N="576" /> made some changes in the carer's allowance and in money for the incapacitated. One can never do too much, but whatever is done will always be open to the charge that it does not go far enough.  However, it is moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey mentioned the black economy.  The issue he raised will not be addressed until we have raised the gap sufficiently between low paid people in employment and what someone can get on the social welfare system.  That is why tax relief concentrates on the lower, not the higher paid and why the Progressive Democrats are screaming with such ferocity.  They regard themselves as having a remit for people at the higher end of the pay spectrum and what we are trying to do does not address their priorities.  Politics is about priorities and making choices.</P>
    <P>The Senator suggested that we should allow people to keep their flat rate unemployment assistance while earning a further £50 a week &mdash; a net of £150 per week.  Many people who go to work in dark winter days do not take home that amount of money because the economy cannot pay them any more since this is an open competitive world, which will become even more competitive. I am not suggesting that we reduce the level of social welfare entitlements but that we reduce the level of tax on low paid people so that there is a gap between what some people get while they are working and what somebody gets on social welfare.  We must lower that gap without disrupting the lower end of the labour market, otherwise we will create chaos in the economy.  It will take time to do what the Senator is suggesting, but it is not only the way forward for this country but also for Europe.</P>
    <P>The Senator mentioned 80,000.  That is the gap between the live register figure, which is 281,000, and the figure from the labour force survey where people described if they were working or not.  Some 198,000 people questioned in the labour force survey, which is done <Col N="577" /> according to European statistical standards, described themselves as looking for work or being out of work.  That gap has widened.  The labour force survey has been running for approximately 15 years.  In 1985 there was a gap of less than 1,000 or 2,000 between the figures from the labour force survey and those from the live register.</P>
    <P>We have compounded that gap by giving people rights of entitlements by equality, which I support.  Where a husband and wife, who is the dependent, are unemployed and she wants to prove her identity as an independent citizen or to get a slice of the money, Governments introduced regulations, with the support of the Houses, to allow that woman to sign on for unemployment assistance.  The couple could then split the money between them.  That had a beneficial effect for people who were able to get money in their own right, but it increased the live register figure by 7,000 because 7,000 couples split and became 14,000.  However, there were not 7,000 extra people looking for employment on the live register.</P>
    <P>There are other administrative anomalies. People who never visited a social welfare office but who want to avail of a FÁS course in order to go back to full-time employment after ten or 15 years at home must meet the administrative requirements of FÁS.  They must sign on, which means they are included on the live register but they do not receive money.  They are not looking for work but for qualifications to enable them to do a FÁS course.</P>
    <P>We have compounded the live register statistically from that point of view. Even if one strips away 20,000 from the 80,000, there are still 50,000 to 60,000 people in a potential black economy, who will not get back into the labour force on a regular basis.  They are better equipped in rural Ireland where their chances of part-time irregular work are much greater than in the urban centres of Dublin, Waterford, Cork and Limerick.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 20, paragraph (a), line 5, to delete &ldquo;20 per cent.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;30 per cent.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>People should take out annuities to ensure they have a sufficient pension when they retire.  Many people are anxious that they will not be able to provide for themselves in retirement.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify this because there is not only concern in the public service.  The Minister for Social Welfare said in a recent speech that the country would not be able to afford pensions in the future.  Could the Minister clarify what the general policy will be and how he sees it developing?  Can he extend concessions to people who provide additional protection for themselves on retirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The thinking behind this is a reflection of the changing nature of employment in both our labour market and that of Europe.  We have asked the insurance companies to respond to this change by designing new types of pension plans that reflect a changing pattern of employment.  Traditionally one got a job when one was in one's early twenties, whether one went on to third level education or left school during or after second level, and if one was made permanent one had access to a pension scheme as, increasingly, companies had contributory pension <Col N="580" /> schemes.  These schemes were assisted by the tax system to encourage people to participate in them and make provision for their retirement.</P>
      <P>However, the job for life syndrome which underpinned that pension system is now changing.  Many people do not become permanent.  In many cases school teachers, for example, do not secure permanent posts until they are in their late 20s or early 30s, which is quite different from the experience of five or ten years ago.  Likewise, the job for life syndrome in the private sector is disappearing. People, therefore, find themselves making good salaries but the 15 per cent figure is static throughout the 20 or 40 year earning period.</P>
      <P>In this section I am trying &mdash; it is only a start &mdash; to address the problem where somebody approaching the end of their working life realises that their pension has been underfunded or they wish to make extra provision or they want to devote more of their income to pension provision.  If they are over the age of 55 they can now put in 20 per cent of their income instead of 15 per cent.  The last time this provision was changed was in the early 1960s and no age differential was made.  It was raised from a flat 10 per cent to 15 per cent.  This provision is targeted at the category of people who are over 55 and who want to make more prudent provision for their retirement. The provision has been welcomed.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what will be the full cost.  There was an argument against doing this because the full 15 per cent was not being drawn down; the average take was 12 per cent.  However, that was a reflection of people getting into the system late or not being able to make enough provision for themselves.  We are concentrating it on the last five or ten years of a person's working life when many of their primary family expenses will have been discharged and they are in a position to take this action. We are behind the rest of Europe in terms of this demographic cohort and our pension problems are less severe than those of other European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> However, they will be substantial and will begin to impact from about the year 2020.  Unless we take corrective action now we will have a serious problem at that time.  This is a small step in a bigger process to address that issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is most disappointing for my constituents.  During the past year this House debated the extension of free fees to students in part-time courses.  It is far more difficult for students in part-time and night courses to undertake such courses.  The fees of many of these students are paid by employers, especially if they work in the Civil Service, the Garda and so forth, so their difficulties are not so great.  It was suggested that about 50 per cent of such students are in that situation.  I must accept that statistic as I am not in a position to find out the correct figures, although postgraduate students have told me that they did not think the figure was that high.</P>
      <P>While it is welcome that individual students can claim tax relief for the fees, it is still difficult that these fees are not being paid.  I realise this is the responsibility of the Department of Education. I am also sorry that if other members of the family are paying the fees they cannot avail of the tax relief.  Some of these students are in jobs in which they pay very little tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> I am also disappointed that covenants for postgraduate students have been removed.  When I brought this matter up previously the Minister acknowledged that there are losers in every situation. I am disappointed that the extension does not apply to those in postgraduate education.  Some people in postgraduate education have to string out courses and PhDs for much longer than is warranted because they must earn a living at the same time.  It is very difficult to get grants to study for post-graduate degrees in this country.</P>
    <P>Only a small effort has been made in this section and I hope the Minister and his officials realise that the removal of covenants has made a huge difference, particularly to people pursuing post-graduate degrees.  It has also made things difficult for people in part-time and night courses even though these are often the people who put the most effort into getting third level education. Many are in second chance situations. While this provision is of some relief to some of them, I am disappointed that far more has not been done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We provided for an extension of support for such people on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  I will explain why it was made and why it is constrained in this way.  It will not be extended because resources do not permit it.  If my parents had not been in a position to enable me to be trained as an architect I would have ended up, hopefully, as a carpenter.  I was, there-fore, very conscious of the advantage I had received which other people, through no fault of their own, had not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where somebody leaves school after the leaving certificate, gets a job and decides, out of their income, to do a course of any description in third level &mdash; the section specifies a course of two years duration or more &mdash; it means they are paying their own way through college and foregoing their nights out on the town to use the money to pay fees and other expenses.  I believe that person should be encouraged and that is <Col N="583" /> what this section is designed to do.  It is not designed to do more.</P>
    <P>While I empathise with somebody who is doing a PhD and finding the going difficult, their employment prospects are wonderful at 96 per cent.  One will not find a single PhD unemployed for an extended period of time.  This city is full of finance houses that would throw money at them &mdash; interest rates are at their lowest since 1960 &mdash; to complete their course and get into the labour market.  I understand the concerns for people who are finding it difficult but individual cases make bad taxation law.</P>
    <P>Third level education gets a disproportionate amount of resources.  There is also the argument that if one wished to deal with the problem of long-term unemployment, more resources should go into the primary school sector.  We had the Dale Tussing report from the ESRI many years ago.  We are all familiar with the statistics but yet we have not changed it.  We could even argue that this city and economy hardly needs the output of three medical schools, but that may be too close for comfort to Senator Henry.</P>
    <P>The cost of training a medical student is high and is borne by the taxpayer, some of whose children never get a decent second level education, never mind a third level one.  There are big issues of equity involved here.  The Senator took a bad example.  My heart does not bleed for a group of people doing Ph.Ds because their employment prospects are wonderful.  They are extremely bankable in the present climate.  They may not necessarily get the job they want but that can also be said for many others.</P>
    <P>This extension is explicitly here for that person who decides that they will put themselves through a course.  It does not have to be a regular conventional university degree course.  This covers any public or private institution recognised by the Minister for Education, in effect, an NCEA course.  If it is to be of market value, we have confined it to a <Col N="584" /> two year premium.  However, the principle is sound and I have no hesitation in advocating it, but it should be confined to that specific group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Perish the thought that we should think of closing any medical school in this State or that the Minister thought I was looking for some sort of tax concession so these people could have more highly paid jobs.  That is not my concern.  I am concerned about the amount of employment provided in this State because graduates have high technology qualifications &mdash; the Minister is always telling us about this &mdash; and the number of people who have to give up their research projects.  Such projects have been important in the development of industry in this State.  For example, when the Digital factory in Galway closed, Boston Instruments tried to move in within a short space of time.  However, we are having greater trouble in trying to get industries to employ the recently laid off low skilled workers of Packard Electric.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need people in this country with high tech qualifications for high technology industry.  A large number of them are in research fields such as physics, for example, which are not appealing to the finance houses of this State. These students can quickly get employment and research grants in Boston, Cal Tech or the Silicon Valley very quickly. But when I ask them to stay in our universities, they say why should they do so when they can only get a £4,000 grant at best on which they cannot manage.  I am not worried at them getting high paid jobs in this State &mdash; a certain number will &mdash; but that we should retain them. The only way we can get high tech industry to come to this country is if we have high tech people to employ.  It is difficult to get people to return from Boston, Cal Tech or Silicon Valley to our industries.  One ends up appealing to their sense of national interest in encouraging them to stay.  However, if we did manage to get them to stay at postgraduate level, they will put down <Col N="585" /> roots here.  This would concern me more than the individuals involved.</P>
    <P>Finance houses tend to look more at accountants than people with Ph.Ds in polymer physics, but it is the latter we want to maintain.  People involved in the computer industry, which is vital to this country, are currently being taken by Japanese companies.  At this time of the year recruiters from around the globe are taking the best of our young graduates and will sponsor their postgraduate degrees in high tech industries.  My son went to a Japanese pharmaceutical company; fortunately he came back.  There are many Irish chemical engineers, pharmacists and chemists in Japan at the moment.  We would be fortunate if we could bring some of them back. However, the Japanese companies are extraordinarily keen to keep them there.  I want to keep these people to lay down a base here so we would then have them for our high tech industries.</P>

      <P>I would be glad to support an amendment to this section along the lines suggested by Senator Henry.  I am not sure whether she wishes to pursue this course.  We could oblige her if she was willing to follow us through the division lobby.</P>
      <P>My heart does not bleed for Ph.Ds either, although my pocket has leaked badly from having two sons, one doing a postgraduate course, in the University of Limerick.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It has revalued my financial position.  Many students are living away from home and the cost of their accommodation is enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of a qualifying individual in the Bill seems to debar some people who may be partly through their courses.  For instance, if a person was in a post-leaving certificate course in one of the recognised colleges which are mainly used to pursue degree and diploma <Col N="586" /> courses, would he be debarred under this qualifying provision?  If this was the case, it would be counter-productive. The more qualifications a person has, the better his chance of improving his position.  While post-graduate courses are important and many students do them to enhance their future salaries, nevertheless many students with certificates may wish to pursue diploma courses in recognised courses at these higher level colleges so they could eventually study a university degree.  In debarring people with certificates, the Minister is defeating part of the purpose of his proposals.  I am not sure if that is the intention and maybe the Minister can clarify that definition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every sympathy for Senator Henry's general case. However, when priorities must be made, one must decide at what point do we move from a grant mentality, which is free fees, to a support system.  A number of new companies coming to this country are beginning to develop research projects with the various institutions. The universities themselves have been transformed from being virtually 100 per cent dependent on either a State grant and fee income for their revenue to moving into a vigorous relationship with the market and private sector companies and achieving much cross-fertilisation in income, research and facilities for training graduates. However, that does not address some of the training needs of some graduates who need primary training before they can begin applied research for which there might be a market price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of prioritisation, I would be more sympathetic towards primary schools.  I still think graduates are bankable; but if not, there should be some kind of extended loan support scheme for somebody at that stage in education. It is hard, when looking at the spread of education and demand coming from the Department of Education, not to be driven in favour of giving extra resources for deprived primary school areas.  If we can give a person a leg up at <Col N="587" /> the beginning of their potential working lives, that advantage will be carried through, rather than at the other end where that person has, by definition, already received a lot of support.</P>
    <P>There should be some form of extended financial support to enable students to finish their research work and stay here.  On a historical note, the reason we have five medical schools and many universities is that we have been sending people abroad for years as administrators of the British Empire &mdash; some quarters do not like to admit that. That is where many of our engineers and doctors received their training and experience.  The fact that they are going to Japan and might come back with some skills &mdash; and perhaps a factory &mdash; is a decided improvement on coming back as a retiree from Kenya or Malaya, as Malaysia was then called.</P>
    <P>On Senator Daly's point, this is a focused confined relief.  It is not proposed to extend it at present; we must see what the take up will be.  Where somebody contemplates making the commitment to a course, the minimum length for which will be two years and where the cost would be fairly substantial, the person is getting the incentive of a tax relief.  A short-term course of six weeks, for example, should be taken on by either the person, if they are at work, or, alternatively, by their employer.  I forgot to put on the record of the House that many working people who do evening courses have their fees paid by their company.  The companies, in many cases if not all cases, qualify for tax relief on that cost.  We are not interfering with that provision; it will continue anyway.  This relates to where somebody cannot avail of that, does not want to ask the company for it or wants to do a course which the company does not feel is relevant to its particular needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The persons to whom I am referring are the young people who have just finished the leaving certificate, may have done a two year certificate <Col N="588" /> course and wish to do a further year to get a diploma.  The fact that they have a certificate debars them from availing of the relief to do the diploma course.  That is the way I read it.  If it is different, will the Minister tell me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point about primary education, because how can anyone hope to go on to second level education even without adequate primary education.</P>
      <P>Sometimes I get a little dismayed about us constantly talking about encouraging high technology industry to come to Ireland.  Again, Senator Daly's point is important here.  One must have the people to become involved in these industries and they do not all need Ph.Ds.  There must be people with certificates who go on to get diplomas, etc., because all these industries are based on parameters.  However, they need people with high skilled training, be it at the level of diploma, certificate, Ph.D, etc. If you look at the employment pages in the national newspapers, you will constantly see numerous jobs advertised in the fields of computers, engineering and technical areas.  Unless we make some attempt to encourage people in these areas and to encourage them to stay here, they will emigrate.</P>
      <P>The Minister is quite right in saying that we supplied the engineers for the British Empire and the judges for Kenya.  I would not like to see Ireland supply the engineers and computer operators for Japan and America as we need to supply them for our own needs first.  There is a dire shortage of computer graduates in Ireland at present.  I think I was told there was a shortage of about 200 per year and I do not see that being addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My worry about trying to address this is that there were people, as Senator Daly and I have been saying, who have a certain level of education and see they can do more, not just for themselves but within that field, if they received further training and I do not think enough is being done to encourage them.  I hope the Minister will see himself in a position <Col N="589" /> to address it further, because while education is something which cannot be removed from people and is the best thing a person can do for a child, it is also extraordinarily important for the community.  If we are not going to put money and effort into high technology training, there is not much point in us talking about high technology jobs.</P>

      <P>Sections 16 to 24 deal with the question of the BES and related activities, and I must acknowledge that it has been an innovative programme for a number of years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>He has been raising in a series of articles an issue which should be addressed by the House and certainly by the Minister.  In summary, whatever the benefits of the BES are, it has become a virtual gravy train for the financial institutions who administer it. The money which is administered does not belong to these institutions &mdash; it is provided by the investors who wish to avail of the financial and tax advantages which come with the scheme &mdash; and the borrowers are not borrowing money which belongs to the financial institutions, but the institutions which administer the scheme charge commission, first, to the investor and then to the company or individuals obtaining the capital.  In some cases, according to one of these articles, one is looking at a combined charge of between 8 and 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it was ever the intention of the Minister, his predecessors, the Government, or its predecessors that it should become that type of gravy <Col N="591" /> train for these administrators.  What I want to raise with the Minister is this: in view of that, have we not now approached the stage where we should be examining controls on the costs which these institutions apply to the administration of the schemes?  As I said, I endeavoured to find an appropriate section on which to raise it.  I am not sure whether it is appropriate to section 21.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise an issue similar to that raised by Senator Howard about the business expansion scheme.  What role could local authorities play in the administration of the business expansion scheme?  I come from a rural part of the country which is serviced by both urban and county local authorities which play a huge role in the area.  There are few large companies in a county like Mayo which can raise sufficient funds to attract large projects, which would qualify for backing from various Departments, whether tourism based.</P>
      <P>The local authorities can and could be the chief players in the business expansion scheme.  Could the local authority administer a business expansion scheme?  It is my view that they could not under the existing system because a company must be established.  Could the local authority set up a company to administer these schemes?  They would avail of the cash bonanza to which Senator Howard referred and to which Senator Ross refers in the media.  I ask the Minister to explain and expand on it.</P>

      <P>The explanatory memorandum seems to identify certain things which do not appear to be spelled out in section 21.  I cannot correlate the contents of section 21 with the explanatory memorandum.  Are shellfish and aquaculture products covered?  It appears that horticulture, mushrooms and so on have been singled out, as has the cultivation of plants.  However, the cultivation of oysters or mussels and the development <Col N="592" /> of aquaculture and fishery products do not seem to be covered.  Why is that distinction being made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has asked me some technical questions, some of which I am not sure I will be able to answer so Members will have to bear with me while I accumulate the answers.</P>
      <P>Senator Howard's opening point was delivered with much greater passion and far greater flamboyance by Senator Ross last night.  I am not sure if he was rehearsing one of his articles or just letting off steam, but either way the House was kept enthralled by his description. Senator Howard, in a much more subdued manner, gave the same message.</P>
      <P>No individual is obliged to go to a designated fund.  If a company wants to raise money under the BES, it can do so.  It does not have to go to one of these funds.  However, it is easier to go to the fund.  Only 40 per cent of all the money raised with the BES go through designated funds.  If a person feels they are getting bad value, there are about six or seven designated funds which, one could argue, are enough to provide competition. The financial institutions are never great at getting into real competition. Perhaps it is an extraordinary coincidence that they are charging similar costs in and around 8 per cent.  I would defer to other Members who know more about the details of this than I.</P>
      <P>If a company looking for BES money feels the cost from one of the designated funds is too high, they are entitled to go elsewhere.  Some 60 per cent of all money going into the BES goes through individual placements.  With the help of chartered accountants or financial advisers some companies raise BES funds directly and, therefore, those charges do not apply to them. Obviously, there are costs associated with any of these things but, depending on the amount of money raised, presumably those costs are cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Burke asked whether a local authority could administer a BES fund. They would have to get designation <Col N="593" /> status from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  It would seem more appropriate to the county enterprise board which would be a better body to facilitate the scheme.  Senator Daly asked whether aquaculture and mariculture qualify for BES funding.  The answer is, yes it does.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise, in slightly more detail and with a great deal less passion, one of the subjects I mentioned yesterday.  The Minister has already touched on it.  Is the Minister satisfied with the current administration of the scheme?  Senator Howard was correct in saying there was probably a combined charge of 10 per cent; if anything, I suspect he is understating the amount.</P>
      <P>My understanding &mdash; and it should not be an understanding, it should be a certainty but that is not my fault &mdash; is that some banks are charging up front charges of 12 per cent between the company and the investor.  That is an outrageous amount for an institution which is not lending money.  I refer specifically to the ICC, which is the Minister's responsibility.  In most cases ICC is charging 3 per cent to the investor, as Senator Howard said, but is then charging 9 per cent to the investee company. That is a total of 12 per cent.  It seems excessive and we have to ask why they can charge these excessive amounts.  The reason is twofold.</P>
      <P>The investee company is in a vulnerable position because it desperately needs the money.  It cannot argue with the bank about the rate they pay.  They just take it and run because it is cheaper than the bank, and sometimes they are in serious trouble.  The Minister touched on the second reason which is that the banks, as always, are not competing on charges.  They are running a cartel and they are all charging the same amount but they dress it up under different types of fees, including administration fees, management fees, investment fees and arrangement fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I specifically want the Minister to address the ICC because it is his <Col N="594" /> responsibility.  It is possibly the most profitable of all of them and it is putting investee companies in a difficult situation, taking money from them when they are at their most vulnerable.  I have the ICC BES prospectus here and what worries me is that the ICC does not tell anyone &mdash; that is a sin of serious dimensions &mdash; what it is charging the investee company.  It is very difficult for an investor to find out what the investee company is being charged and that is information to which the investor must be entitled.</P>
    <P>If one is putting £5,000 or £25,000 into a company to be decided by the ICC one is entitled to know that if the ICC is making an investment of £1 million, they are taking £90,000 off that investment immediately.  There is a direct conflict of interest for all these banks and designated funds because they are going in, investing the money and immediately devaluing the investment by up to 9 per cent.  That is not in the interest of the investee company and it is certainly not in the interest of the investor.  What is so seriously wrong is that nobody, and it is not just in the ICC, is told what charges are being made against their investment by the promoter.</P>
    <P>This is an area in which we must call for transparency if we are to protect the investors and the scheme.  I have a few more questions for the Minister but I ask him to address that initially.</P>

      <P>I compliment Senator Ross for bringing this to my attention.  I must confess I was not as aware of it as he clearly is.  That is probably an admission I do not read his column every Sunday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross has brought something to my notice which requires attention but let us put it in context.  An investor in a BES is, presumably, someone with considerable spare resources and a certain degree of wisdom, and marketplace rules, such as <Col N="595" /><i>caveat emptor</i>, must apply.  If we were to become overprotective, the first people to scream about the &ldquo;nanny&rdquo; state and the interference of the Department of Finance would be the good Senator's journalistic colleagues in the same newspaper.</P>
      <P>That said, transparency and accurate information are prerequisites in any market.  The Senator is clearly saying the associated hidden costs of these designated funds &mdash; about which we are exclusively speaking &mdash; are not immediately apparent, or not apparent at all. Since the designated funds were, in a way, designed for small investors without a great deal of business experience, who were attracted by the fixed assets and minimal risk nature of the underwriting of these funds, perhaps there is a good case for this to be made transparent. I am not sure under which legislation that should be done but I will look at it.  However, the scale of the charges and costs seems very substantial.</P>
      <P>We had a BES review group which looked at changes in the BES and I have just asked my officials if the question of charges was looked at in any great detail.  I understand that was not the case.  However, I can give the Senator and the House an undertaking that I will look at this closely.  There are clearly costs associated with the administration of any service, including the provision of finance.  However, if what the Senator says is true &mdash; and he gave that caveat himself because we have not been able to get the information &mdash; and there is evidence of a cartel or some kind of rigging, we will take whatever appropriate action is open to us.  The consumer credit legislation may be part and parcel of that but I suspect it does not impact on this.  I do not want to give an answer off the top of my head in relation to what we can do, but we should look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will find it is accurate, within 0.5 per cent.  I thank the Minister; that is very helpful. <Col N="596" /> On a very general level, is the Minister happy with the number of &ldquo;jobs&rdquo; created by the BES over the years? Given the £200 million lost to the Exchequer as a result of this &mdash; which is the estimate of his Department &mdash; does he feel it is a successful scheme?  I think the cost per job is £20,000, which is very high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The direct question was if I am satisfied.  I cannot say I am either satisfied or dissatisfied because the reasons for availing of BES capital vary from company to company.  It may be for consolidation, expansion or survival and jobs may be a secondary component of those three motivations.</P>
      <P>One would presume, in the normal course of events, that expansion, following consolidation, would lead to additional employment.  However, the correlation between increased activity and increased employment is not as strong and secure as it used to be. Through productivity gains and so on a company, to survive, could have to automate or get better machinery.  The consequence of that better machinery, which they would use the BES funds to finance, would be to reduce employment. However, if ten jobs out of the 15 which existed were secured and the viability of the company was consolidated, that would be positive in itself. Therefore, a strict jobs per BES pound invested, is a very narrow restriction.</P>
      <P>We have introduced, with the certification process through Forbairt, the criterion for larger investments.  It remains to be seen how well it will work but we will monitor it to see if it is effective.  It is appropriate to introduce that form of certification for that scale of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The BES was introduced by the present Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance in the early 1980s.  The idea travelled across the Atlantic and surfaced in its present form &mdash; if I recall the debate accurately &mdash; in the United Kingdom.  It was designed to address a problem which has historically plagued this economy, that is, the absence of risk capital.  That is a result of the nature of <Col N="597" /> our society, in contrast with countries such as Belgium or Italy where there was a history of a bourgeois capitalist formation with accumulated sums of money which could be lent within families or came down through families.  That has not been the Irish experience.  The BES was designed to make risk capital available for equity.  As the Senator said, it got off to a slow start.  For many people, the function of the BES is to have access to what are either effectively long-term loans through preferential shares or real equity.  Many companies do not want to release primary equity for other reasons, which also have their origins in our history.</P>
    <P>The review of the BES, which is reflected in the changes in this Bill, reflects the thinking of an expert group in consultation with many people involved in this process, including the designated funds.  It reflects the broad consensus on how best it can be focused. However, we will keep it under review and analyse whether it is achieving its objectives.  From the recipients' point of view, whatever about the investors' point of view, its primary function is to provide an alternative source of capital as distinct from borrowings from the banks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The certification process was presumably introduced to reassure investors the quality of the investment they were making had gone through some sort of procedure and was semi reputable.  However, it also has certain criteria, one of which is that it can provide &mdash; my wording might be incorrect &mdash; a reasonable chance of sustainable employment.  That is very subjective and loose.  My understanding is that since Forbairt became involved they had 20 applications this year and all 20 were passed by Forbairt.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if we have that information to hand but I will convey it to the Senator in due course. That information would come from Forbairt and my team here are from the Revenue Commissioners and the <Col N="598" /> Department of Finance.  The certification process is not a guarantee the entire project is a sound one for the purposes of investment.  The <i>caveat emptor</i> rule operates in regard to any would-be investor.  The fact that a particular project has certification from Forbairt simply means Forbairt has looked at the proposal and is satisfied it has a job creation element &mdash; no more, no less. We can get information in relation to that.</P>
      <P>I have just been handed a note to answer the Senator's second question. There are 24 applications with Forbairt of which 20 are already passed.  It could be that the other four are also due to be passed.  The substance of the Senator's question, in relation to his comments last night, was there is no critical evaluation and they were all passed on the nod.  He did not use that phrase but that was his inference.  We will talk to them about it.  It is a fair point because someone might say that if a State agency signed it off it must be sound.  That does not follow and now that the Senator has brought it to my attention we had better make it clear that certification from Forbairt is not a guarantee of a sound investment.  Many people do not realise that BES investments are risk investments, generously financed by taxation.</P>

    <P>Members can see the text of the message from the Dáil outlining its decision on the amendments made by the Seanad to the Harbours Bill, 1995.  On 22 December 1995 the Seanad returned the Bill to the Dáil with 28 amendments to which the agreement of Dáil Éireann was sought.  The Dáil considered those <Col N="603" /> amendments and accepted 26 of them, but did not agree to amendments Nos. 19 and 24, and made amendments in lieu of these two amendments.</P>
    <P>The Seanad has now to decide whether or not it wishes to insist on amendments Nos. 19 and 24 and, if not, if it agrees to the amendments made by the Dáil in lieu of them.  In each of the instances I referred to, I will call on the Leader to move a motion suggesting the action to be taken by the Seanad.  I will then call on the Minister of State to explain the decision taken by the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will recall that in response to amendments which were tabled by Senator Fitzgerald in the Seanad, I moved amendments Nos. 19 and 24 to the Harbours Bill.  This split section 52(1) (a) into two separate paragraphs.  The first empowers the harbour master to refuse entry into the harbour of dangerous goods as classified in the IMDG code which in his or her opinion would be likely to endanger persons or property.</P>
      <P>The second statutorily requires the harbour master to refuse entry into the harbour of a ship, vehicle or other conveyance that is powered by or carrying nuclear material.  The amendments I introduced also provided for exemptions to be granted in respect of certain medical supplies and materials involving low background radiation levels.  The amendments as proposed by me were approved by the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following approval by the Seanad of Seanad amendments Nos. 19 and 24, two matters in particular were brought to my attention.  It was brought to my attention that the definition of nuclear material in the amendments as approved by the Seanad was confined, in effect, to uranium and plutonium <Col N="604" /> only.  Thus, the banning of all other radioactive materials would have been outside the terms of the amendment, their entry or otherwise being at the discretion of the harbour master.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the Radiological Protection Institute is the competent authority in regard to the movement in and out of our ports of radioactive material.  As a consequence it is essential that the power and authority of the harbour master are carried out in close consultation with and subject to the views of the institute.</P>
    <P>To avoid any ambiguity which might place the harbour master in an invidious position, I have decided therefore to amend the section to provide that the harbour master of a harbour may only permit the entry into the harbour of radioactive material with the consent of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  The amendments which I proposed in the Dáil, and which were accepted by the Dáil, are in line with the powers and functions of the RPII laid down in statute.</P>
    <P>The second matter that was brought to my attention was that the Seanad amendments, in so far as they related to the banning without exception from Irish harbours of all nuclear powered ships and ships carrying nuclear weapons, gave rise to constitutional problems. Under Article 29.4.1 of the Constitution, which relates to the conduct of foreign relations, the decision whether or not to ban a foreign state-owned ship from entering a harbour is one for the Government.  Accordingly, it is proposed to overcome this difficulty by the insertion of an amending subsection providing that the prohibitions will apply to a ship of the naval service of a foreign state only with the prior consent of the Government.</P>
    <P>I assure Senators that this amendment will not take away in practice from the outright ban of section 52 (3) and section 87A (3) or the present practice of not allowing such vessels to enter our harbours.</P>
    <P>The amendment is necessary only to legislatively preserve the competence of <Col N="605" /> the Executive as enshrined in the Constitution to regulate the conduct of our foreign relations, and to avoid a technical conflict with the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the amendment and it is fair to say that it strengthens the section dealing with this matter in the Bill.  I am glad we were part and parcel of getting this amendment into the Bill.  It is probably the first time in the history of both Houses of the Oireachtas that any move has been made to ban nuclear powered vessels and nuclear materials.  This would seem to be the wish of the majority of the people.  I only hope the day will come shortly when legislation will be introduced declaring all our waters as a nuclear free zone.</P>

He stated that the amending of the Seanad amendments strengthened the measure.  In fact, they extend it in relation to ships as well as extending the definitions. They also fireproof it against any question of constitutional issues being raised. It is a significant measure that was first debated here in the Seanad and has now been agreed.  For the first time we are enshrining in legislation a ban on nuclear materials and nuclear powered vessels entering our ports.  It is a significant measure.

      <P>In page 43, line 5, to delete &ldquo;1996&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1997&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the proposed changes in the resort scheme before it really gets under way.  The ground rules for the operation of this new scheme have been changed and this will be detrimental to the overall drive to make these resorts a success.  The scheme has been worthwhile and has made a contribution to the development of the areas involved, including Kilkee and Lahinch in my constituency of Clare.  The only problem they had was that sewerage and water facilities were not adequate to deal with the development which took place.  The reason I put forward these dates is to extend the scheme by another year as it is only getting started. I have a problem with changing the scheme before we see how it is working and with limiting it to April 1996 as opposed to April 1997.</P>

      <P>Anybody who is worried about the duration of this scheme should take comfort from the way in which the urban designated area scheme has functioned.  It is necessary to have a short time window because that concentrates the mind and forces people to make investment decisions.  If it is open-ended, we will not get the concentrated effect.  We must understand that we are not creating new investment but redirecting existing potential investment to particular sectors.  That is only effective from the point of view of market intervention if one has a short time frame.  If the scheme is working well and if people have a legitimate argument for its extension, that will be looked at in the future, as has been the case in the past.  People have a certain number of years to get their act together or else this tide will pass.  That has worked elsewhere and we are applying the same principle here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards changes in the rules, approximately 11 categories of investment are covered by the seaside resort scheme.  It was in respect of two of these &mdash; holiday cottages and apartments &mdash; that a tax regressive, legally constructed tax plan was presented to us in respect of a number of developments.  This was way in excess of what was the convention and of what we had intended.  We intervened to correct not what was a loophole but a much more liberal interpretation of the tax allowances.  They were interpreted legally, cleverly and creatively by the people who presented the schemes and who received a much wider and more substantial tax allowance. As the jargon would put it, it was a fair cop for those lucky enough to get <Col N="611" /> it.  We have now reverted the system to meet the intention originally provided for it in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Time should not be a problem and anybody who is worried about it should take comfort from this.  People should enter the system now if they want to benefit from any time extensions which there might be.  I am not giving any undertaking that there will be any such extensions but nobody will be penalised by virtue of the fact that they started before the time elapsed.  However, we will not leave the situation open-ended. It must be concentrated for cost purposes. The constraints in respect of cottages and apartments were necessary to bring them back into line with the normal kind of tax incentives which prevailed.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 72, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Section 51 (as amended by the Finance Act, 1995) of the Finance Act, 1988, is hereby amended in subsection (1) by the addition of the following:</P>
      <P>`(e)  machinery or plant or an industrial building provided by a company for use for the purpose of trading operations carried on by it in the IDA Business Park, Dangan, Galway.'.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to include machinery or plant or industrial buildings provided by a company for use for the purpose of trading operations carried on by it in the IDA Business Park, Dangan, County Galway. I am advised that the Finance Act, 1988, and subsequent Finance Acts phased out accelerated capital allowances. In general, such accelerated allowances are now only available in respect of certified trading operations in the International Financial Services Centre and in the Shannon Airport region.  It, therefore, would not be appropriate to reopen that closed chapter. Even if it were appropriate, it would not be possible to single out one specific location or entity such as the park in Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>If this proposal is not possible in this situation, where could it be considered?  In view of the success of the IFSC and other sectors of the international services industry &mdash; I refer only to international services so described in the relevant IDA documentation &mdash; it would be worthwhile to consider a further location for such services, perhaps with specific types in mind.  Ireland deals with only approximately 0.2 per cent of international reinsurance, which <Col N="614" /> is a major industry confined to the major financial capitals of the world, such as London, Paris and New York. There is significant potential to attract to this country some of the international companies which deal in insurance and reinsurance.  The fact that mail order companies can now operate in the Shannon region is significant.</P>
      <P>I appreciate it may not be possible, but other segments of the international service industry could be expanded and a new location for this expansion should be considered.  The IDA business park in Galway was opened almost nine years ago in a prestigious location on the outskirts of the city.  However, there is just one tenant in the park at present, an American firm in the service industry.  It is a fine site, in a prestigious location close to the university grounds.  It needs an impetus and I urge the Minister to consider designating this site in order to attract further international service companies to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Senator's concerns, but the 10 per cent corporation tax regime applies across the country for manufacturing and international traded services.  I understand firms engaged in either of these activities, such as international reinsurance, qualify, although the precise nature of a project must be examined by the relevant authorities.  Under European Union taxation law it is not possible to introduce zones which would qualify for additional specific tax relief. It was necessary to secure the agreement of the Commission to provide the IFSC and Shannon schemes because they are now deemed, and properly so, in effect a form of State aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under European competition law Ireland cannot engage in competitive disadvantage or advantage between one tax regime and another without the agreement of the Commission.  It is not exclusively within the remit of the Irish authorities to extend to Galway or anywhere else the regime which currently pervades within the IFSC or in Shannon. The agreement of the Commission <Col N="615" /> is required and it is not well disposed to providing such an extension at present. In common with the rest of the country, the business park at present enjoys a favourable tax regime, relative to international competition, and I fail to understand why it is not trading more successfully.  I am surprised there is only one tenant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one tenant, and the attraction of Shannon or the IFSC may be a factor.  Has it ever been put to the Commission that a further area should be designated?  I understand from industry sources that existing business in this sector and allied sectors is being lost to Ireland and Europe because other countries are offering significant advantages, such as those which can be enjoyed in the two designated areas.  For this reason a request to the European Commission for a third location in Ireland is merited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been put to the Commission that additional areas should be designated.  Shannon had such status historically and it was a tax free zone when Ireland joined the EU.  The IFSC was specifically negotiated in the context of the big bang and deregulation of financial markets and the attempt by the European Union to foster the growth of regional financial centres.  It was possible to argue successfully for this concession in the context of a once off window.  However, unlike the rest of the 10 per cent, it does not extend to the year 2010; it is confined to the year 2005.  I cannot give the Senator any comfort and I would mislead him if I did so.  In my time in office there will not be any approach to the Commission to designate further areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's existing tax regime is attractive in terms of inward investment and I will raise with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment the reason the business park does not appear to be developing as rapidly as it should.  I am familiar with the site because I pass by it relatively frequently and I am surprised <Col N="616" /> there is just one occupant.  It is a big capital investment which is not returning its cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that some years ago a successful grant scheme was introduced to enable Irish shipowners to invest in additional capacity for the Irish fleet.  The scheme was most successful in so far as it extended.  It was discontinued due to financial constraints, but a number of important developments occurred in the short time the scheme operated.  For example, Arklow Shipping, a successful Irish company which has been trading for many years, was in a position to put a sizeable number of additional ships to sea.  This increased the Irish tonnage and also the number of people employed in the shipping business.</P>
      <P>I am not sure of the Minister's view on this matter.  I am aware that he dislikes grant schemes; but given that so much of our trade depends on shipping and given that the Irish fleet is small and vulnerable, it is desirable to examine the possibility of reintroducing the shipping grants scheme to enable further ships to be put on the Irish register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the Senator's interest in this area and the contribution he made when he held that responsibility.  However, the proposed changes are in line with the requests made by the industry through the current Minister for the Marine; they generously meets its requirements as we understand them.  The certification process requires that the Minister for the Marine must be satisfied that a ship <Col N="617" /> which is the subject of a lease will result in the enhancement of the fleet and meet current safety and environmental standards as well as having potential positive economic and other benefits.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the certification process will allow ship leasing to be monitored and remedial action to be taken if necessary.  There are also requirements to ensure a maximisation of the Irish content so that it does not become a flag of convenience.  The proposals to relax the previous tight constraints will meet the current demands of the industry.  If its demands or needs change in due course, I and, I am sure, my successors will be as sympathetic as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The island is an important historical and monastic settlement which has been in foreign ownership &mdash; by Belgians &mdash; for many years.  Due to the initiative of the local Catholic canon a few years ago and the Kilrush Community Development Association, SFADCo and the county council, a successful arrangement was made whereby the island was put back into local ownership.  It is managed by the Kilrush Community Development Association, SFADCo, Clare County Council and Kilrush Urban Council.  The Office of Public Works proposes an important development in the form of landing facilities.  There are seven churches on the island and it contains one of the few round towers in Ireland.  It is, therefore, an important historical site which has not been touched for generations.  The first preservation order put on any historical site in Ireland was put on Scattery island by the British authorities. Some important items found on the island are currently in British museums.</P>
      <P>There is now a keen wish to undertake restoration and construction work on the island.  It would be beneficial if the island was included under the provisions contained in this section.  In addition, there are a number of old residences. I am sure the Minister is aware that nobody resides on the island any longer.  The intention would be to use this provision to enable reconstruction of some of the properties and to encourage some of the families who have left the island to return, even on a temporary basis.</P>
      <P>The island contains an important historical monastic settlement, one which will be further developed by the State in the future and by local authorities and local development associations.  It would benefit from concessions included under the provisions of this section.</P>

      <P>The Senator's advice does not address the issue for which this tax incentive is intended, however well intended his proposals.  They may qualify under different categories.  This proposal is designed to reinforce a fragile <Col N="620" /> economic infrastructure and to provide a limited form of tax incentive and support for permanent communities on islands around the coast.  They have been clearly defined and are open to statistical evaluation.</P>
      <P>Two islands were mentioned in the course of representations made by two Deputies in the other House &mdash; Coney island off Sligo and Gola island &mdash; which are in the process of being rehabilitated.  The role of the Minister for Finance with regard to this and to urban designated areas is to take the advice on location and designation from the relevant authority or line Department. With regard to urban areas, this comes from the Department of the Environment.  Nobody from the Department of Finance &mdash; neither officials nor the Minister &mdash; carves out areas on a map.  We take the advice because we are not competent to designate areas; our competency is in other areas.</P>
      <P>Likewise it is the Minister of State at the Department of Arts Culture and the Gaeltacht, who is responsible for the offshore islands who has given us this list, based in turn on the advice of Comhairle na hOileán.

If I were to accede to it I would have to accede to such uninhabited places as Inishvickillaune, where doubtless the residents are desperately in need of financial support, and other places.

      <P>I am glad to note there are no inhibitions on the part of the Minister in agreeing recommendation No. 17.  I hope he will strike a blow for democracy today in doing so.  Clifden is probably the outstanding resort in the country that has not been included in the qualifying list of resort areas under the designated areas.  In view of its peripheral geographical location, the town has not progressed in the same way as similar towns around the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister is familiar with the area and is always welcome there.  There is major dereliction in Clifden.  It is a town in west Connemara which has become very popular.  Inclusion in this scheme would have a major economic impact on the area.</P>
      <P>A few years ago, when I was Minister of State at the Department of Education, we gave a grant of £300,000 as part of the scheme for leisure facilities. The people of west Connemara were genuinely unable to come up with their 30 per cent contribution to draw down that grant.  As Minister of State I had to go to individuals in Dublin who took holidays in the area to get them to put up some money so that I did not have to withdraw the grant.  Such is the economic level of people in the area.  There is a lot of dereliction.  Announcements were made recently about significant developments in Clifden.  If the Minister includes Clifden, he would not only go down in history and bring me with him, but he would give a major impetus to development in west Connemara.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not booming.  We should go back to the origins of the seaside resort scheme, which was conceived when Deputy McCreevy was Minister for Tourism and Trade in the Fianna <Col N="622" /> Fáil/Labour Administration, with the assistance of the current chairman of Bord Fáilte, Mr. Padraig Ó hUiginn &mdash; a much respected retired mandarin from the Civil Service.  It was designed to address the particular problem of traditional seasonal seaside resorts around the coast which used to cater for families before package holidays brought them to Spain, Greece and Turkey and whose infrastructure was built up to sustain and support that market demand which was vibrant for 20 or 30 years. The advent of greater affluence, more sophistication and cheap package tours meant that these people left not only our coasts but those of the United Kingdom and other northern European centres for places like Torremolinos and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>It was considered at the time that a taxation scheme modelled on the urban designation scheme would regenerate the activities of those places.  A limited number of seaside resorts grew during the debate across the Cabinet table.  We have now confined the scheme to 15 resorts, some of which fit comfortably into that category, like Tramore, while others do not.  Kilrush and Kilkee in Senator Daly's constituency are classic examples of what I am talking about.</P>

      <P>And Achill Island.  The people whose parents took them on holidays to Kilkee or to Achill Island now go on their traditional family holiday with their children to places like Benidorm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was introduced to reinvigorate those traditional seaside resorts.  I only have the limited knowledge of a passing seasonal tourist, but I believe that Clifden does not fit into that category.  The construction of a large new hotel was recently announced in Clifden.  Large numbers of tourists visit the town during its short season, but it is not in the category of the seaside resorts for which the scheme was intended.  While I would like to accommodate the Senator and secure his place <Col N="623" /> in history, I cannot add one town without risking an avalanche of demands from all types of towns.  Every seaside town would then be so designated and this would mean no one would win.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, he is a seasonal tourist.  Clifden and west Connemara are bleak places for approximately eight months of the year. While I accept that the scheme was introduced for specific types of resorts, there is a need for future incentives for peripheral areas such as Clifden.  While the development to which he referred is welcome and will enhance the future of Clifden, small bed and breakfast operators are concerned that they will not be able to live up to the competition.  They will have to invest in the upgrading of their premises.  I am concerned about this and that is why I am disappointed with the Minister's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister about the extension of the resort scheme to Liscannor, which is part of Lahinch.  I am not sure if the Minister knows the location of Liscannor; it is the extension of the coastal area from Lahinch town. Liscannor and Lahinch are almost tied together and they form part of the economics of that region.  Lahinch has enjoyed success under the seaside resort scheme and I appreciate the Minister's work in that regard.  However, it has resulted in developments moving out towards Liscannor and Liscannor pier where private developers are interested in investing in leisure and amenity facilities at the harbour.  This would also facilitate Lahinch as it is part of the overall economy of the area.  I am glad Senator Howard is here because it seems we are fighting a losing battle. We do not want to develop a new town, but we want the existing designated area of Lahinch to be extended to the Liscannor area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other area I want to mention is the marina in Kilrush, which has been successful.  When it was being constructed the Government introduced <Col N="624" /> restrictions on the BES which tightened up the amount that could be raised. Initially, £2.5 million could have been raised to undertake BES schemes but that was reduced to £1 million.  This caught the developers at the half way stage and was the main reason the marina project came to a standstill.  Politicians, local community organisations and the urban council are keen to reactivate this project.</P>
    <P>The marina is beginning to be successful and some new developments have been approved there.  A new £1 million scheme is underway at present and private companies have also expanded.  This has meant that the marina, which is adjacent to Scattery island, is beginning to have an impact on the economics of the area, which was run down and neglected.  It would be a further incentive to invest in some of the old derelict buildings at the old harbour in Kilrush, which is now the Creek Marina, and where 600 or 700 boats operated before the carriage of goods and services by sea into the western areas was overtaken by developments.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to extend Lahinch by introducing a small technical amendment and to make some arrangement for the marina which would encourage much needed investment in an area which has been neglected.</P>

Major developments have taken place in Achill Island, Westport and Mulraney.  I would like other areas, such as Newport and Belmullet, to be included but I understand why this cannot happen.  We should monitor how urban areas, such as Westport and Salthill, have progressed in comparison to rural places like Achill Island.

      <P>While I am sympathetic to what Senator Daly has said, the initiative in designating the geographic location is in the first instance the responsibility of the local authorities. When the seaside proposals were announced the local authorities were invited to draw the lines on the maps. They submitted those to the Department of the Environment, who in turn submitted them to us.  The Department of Finance has neither the capability nor the aptitude to get involved in extending townland boundaries.  Even if we had that aptitude, I would not be inclined to exercise it.</P>
      <P>We have concentrated on areas that by general consensus are in need of rejuvenation.  There is a limited amount of investment capital available and we have made some projections about how much it is likely to be, based on previous experience.  The amount of investment capital, credit and other finances available at present is probably about enough, perhaps slightly less.  We want to get those areas developed.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly spoke about extensions to existing areas that have designation status and moving the line by about a few miles, if I understood him correctly.</P>

      <P>Let the potential investment in the localities involved take place.  If there is demand for additional investment activity when the existing areas have been completed, I am sure we will be sympathetic to considering an extension.  However, the scheme is only one year old and is scheduled to run for a minimum of three years.  It will probably be extended.  Let us concentrate on the areas that have been designated.  If we increased the number of resorts this year we would just add to the uncertainty and that would not be good for investor confidence.  They must know that the areas and the number of towns are fixed and that, if they want to do business in these places, the ground <Col N="626" /> rules upon which their investment decisions are made will not be shifted. While I will be happy to consider an extension in due course, if I have responsibility at that time, it would be misleading and counter-productive to change it now.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal that 100 per cent of construction expenditure will be allowed against tax.  I also welcome the application of that provision to the conversion of certain buildings.  Building on an island involves enormous transport costs because the goods must be taken to the island by boat.  Will the transport of cement blocks and other materials be included as part of the construction costs?  Development on the islands is badly needed.  There are seven islands off the coast of County Cork and many people live on them.  Incentives such as this will be of tremendous benefit.</P>

However, I am sure the contract price agreed between the contractor and the client would include transport of materials and labour to the site where construction is being undertaken. That is usually the case.  There is nothing to suggest that transportation costs, which are an integral part of a contract construction price, would not be included.  The site cost is excluded. It is presumed that the site cost would already be subsumed because the person would already own it.  Construction costs include all the associated costs.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for his generous comments.  The proposal was not born in the Department of Finance or in my own political group.  It was submitted to me by the industry, based on the experience of European car industries, including France and, I think, Denmark.  The scheme will expire at the end of this calendar year.  It has been a considerable success.  The representative for the Society of Irish Motor Industry, Mr. Cyril McHugh, proposed <Col N="630" /> it among other measures; his great concern being the large volume of second hand imports from the United Kingdom.  Approximately 13,000 units have benefitted from the scheme to date.  By completion, it will have run for 18 months &mdash; from July last year.  This small amendment is to adjust the practice of including a spouse, which had been incorporated effectively and sensibly by the Revenue Commissioners; the Senator is familiar with what is proposed. It is a good, win/win scheme because the Department's revenue from VRT and related income is very high. The silence from SIMI has attested to how well things are going.  Content can be measured by its silence and discontent by its noise.  There is such silence at present that it can be concluded there is great contentment.</P>

      <P>When, in history, has anything been rounded downwards &mdash; except when you are getting something from somebody else?  Excuse me, I am being facetious and I should not be.  It is rounded off to the nearest unit &mdash; if it is 71p it will be rounded down to 70p, if it is 73p, it will be rounded up to 75p. It is for unit convenience.  The Senator knows this is about avoiding the difficulty of cigarette stock machines having 2p and 1p wrapped as change, and causing <Col N="631" /> a shortage of coinage.  It is a classic anti-red tape measure which resulted in cigarette suppliers having to repack and get the coins, which was a nonsense.

      <P>I move recommendation No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 121, before section 120, but in part IV, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That owner occupied List 1 buildings within the designated areas shall be exempt from the operation of the property tax.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may be sympathetic to this on a personal level &mdash; he has a professional background as an architect.  He has been particularly sympathetic towards the redevelopment of the inner city, in particular the refurbishment of Georgian buildings.  However, there is <Col N="633" /> literally no incentive for people to restore houses in these areas.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I managed to persuade a previous occupier of the post, Deputy Reynolds, to include some sections in a budget which appeared to give marginal relief to people &mdash; I had the same qualifications; they had to be List 1 buildings, had to be occupied and within the designated areas.  This is because the Department of Finance, as guardian of the public purse, is necessarily rather penurious and guarded and afraid there will be a haemorrhaging of money from the Exchequer.  Therefore, I put very severe restrictions on it.</P>
    <P>I have asked on a number of occasions for information about the number of people who have taken up those provisions.  I do not believe that one single person has ever triggered them.  They are absolutely useless.  I can certainly say that nobody in North Great George's Street, Henrietta Street or Mountjoy Square has ever gained any benefit under them because they were so restricted.  It is time we looked at this situation again.</P>
    <P>I have had correspondence with the Minister.  It was indicated to me that one of the problems was political.  If the Government started chipping away at the residential property tax, it might disintegrate gradually; I think it will disintegrate rapidly.  I said on Second Stage that it looks very much as if there is so much rumbling and grumbling, not only from the Opposition which has a clear campaign to get rid of the residential property tax, but also substantial unease among the Minister's colleagues.  If one takes the probable scenario that there will be an election next November, this will hit with a nasty bite in October.  In the run up to an election, 70 per cent of the revenue is derived from the pre-key electoral constituencies in Dublin where the election will either be won or lost.  It would be very wise of the Government to take this bull by the horns, abolish the tax now and do itself some real political good without having the situation eroded.  My amendment is a narrower <Col N="634" /> version of this, so perhaps I should confine myself to it.</P>
    <P>In the 19th century, there was a campaign which was led with great fervour from the nationalist ranks with three platforms; fair rent, fixity of tenure and free sale.  There was a strong feeling about property ownership and the rights Irish people had to own, properly manage and reap the benefit from their property.  One of the other legacies of that campaign was an attack on what was seen as the rackrenting system.  If a tenant improved his or her property, the landlord sat idly by, watched the improving process and then, when the land had been improved, slapped an extra penal rent on top of it so the unfortunate tenant could never get out of the quagmire.  This is the equivalent of rackrenting.</P>
    <P>When somebody takes on the challenge of restoring an 18th century building, for example, with no assistance from the State &mdash; there are no grants available, unlike any other European capital city &mdash; and in doing the State's work for it in restoring its architectural heritage, its consequence, if successful, is that not only an individual house but, as in the case of North Great George's Street, and I hope, Henrietta Street, the entire area is raised, improved and made better socially, economically, architecturally and culturally.  However, as a result of this, not only does a person not get a grant, he is penalised for daring to improve his area because the market will follow in, the value of the property will rise and he is in the property net.</P>
    <P>I may seem be arguing for what may appear to be a selfish case.  It may appear that I am doing this just for myself, but I am not.</P>

      <P>I have never been a customer but I was in it.  There was a press statement during the last election about a politician being caught in a brothel; I was that soldier.  I went in to rescue that lady after an All-Ireland hurling final when an over-enthusiastic and too numerous congregation were attempting to avail of her services and they battered hell out of her door.  I was quite concerned for her well being so I went down with a shillelagh, which my mother took with her to central Africa to protect her virtue, and scattered them with a flood of bad language.  The door opened gingerly.  I was invited inside and was given a cup of tea.  I must say it was exactly what a brothel should be.  It was simply heavenly.  There was a knitted tea-cosy on the telephone and a pink plastic bath in the shape of a heart.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It is a spiritual brothel. I do not imagine that the existence of these two institutions, beloved as they may be by their adherents, would encourage family purchase of my establishment. I have written explaining this <Col N="636" /> to the Revenue Commissioners and they seem to have accepted it so I do not actually pay property tax, but some of my neighbours probably either must or will have to pay that tax.  It is extremely unfair and wrong to penalise people in this way for circumstances over which they have no control.</P>
      <P>People in good faith take the risk and buy these buildings, which are often in dilapidated condition, may have dry rot, etc., and invest huge amounts of personal effort and considerable amounts of cash in them.  I have neighbours, such as Ms Desiree Shortt, who painstakingly restored an enormous house &mdash; up on scaffold, picking away at the delicate plasterwork, restoring a Percy &mdash; and spend thousands of hours on this kind of stuff.  It then becomes a showpiece and the net result is that we must pay for the privilege of restoring the nation's heritage.

The point Senator Norris makes is relevant: people who put an enormous amount, not just of their money but also of their time and personal expertise, into the restoration of such buildings the values of which they see increase, find themselves within a short length of time owning <Col N="637" /> desirable properties which is all very well, but they still have the same income and may find themselves obliged to pay property tax.

Will the Minister consider extending this to second-hand houses because first-time buyers are usually young married couples setting out on life?  They may get a chance to buy a second-hand house cheaper, so I ask the Minister to consider extending this provision to second-hand houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the succinct case made by Senator Norris, there is, in fact, a much deeper and wider case which the Senator is equally capable of making.  While his proposed recommendation is flawed and, therefore, I cannot accept it, I accept the thrust of what he said.  I am examining currently a series of measures, which I hope will be included in next year's budget and Finance Bill, which will address the issue.</P>
      <P>There are some concerns and I would be happy to meet him and other groups, particularly pioneering people like himself who have taken the risk, task, dangers and associated worries upon themselves to see how we can maintain and sustain the cultural urban fabric of the country's heritage.</P>
      <P>There are some principles which must be clearly set out.  If we are to use or forgo taxpayers' money &mdash; which amounts essentially to the same thing &mdash; to enhance a cultural asset which remains permanently in the private ownership of individuals, some safeguards, offsets and counterbalances, either tangible of intangible, must be put in place.  There must be a cost-benefit analysis, the criteria for which are shared and agreed by all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Culture and tourism will be one of the biggest money earners for Europe in the next century, if it is not already.  For <Col N="638" /> example, Prague, one of the great jewels in the crown of European cities, attracts 15 million tourists a year and justifies that kind of attraction, and the population of the Czech Republic is 10 million. One can justify enhancing Dublin, for example, or, indeed, Cork or the Crescent in Limerick in a manner which reinforces the fabric of the town or city, its culture and its attraction to tourist because it generates so much business. North Great George's Street generates a fair bit of business &mdash; not the one to which the Senator referred &mdash; but the cost-benefit analysis would have to take all those factors into account.  There are historical shifts in terms of usage, urban settlement patterns and other matters which are changing the usage of Fitzwilliam Square and Merrion Square.  Then, of course, we must make sure we are not throwing apples into an orchard, that we are not giving money to people who have plenty of it anyway and are getting a windfall gain.</P>
    <P>Does the Senator accept there are offsetting considerations and that local authorities <i>per se</i> should categorise list one and two buildings?  There are 88 local authorities around the country and the criteria for listing buildings varies from one local authority to another, as, it should.  To use the European term, &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo;, what constitutes a list one building in County Donegal is not necessarily the same as what constitutes a list one building in County Meath or County Limerick, for example.  I would not for one moment wish to impose a nation planning standard in that regard, but for taxation purposes, one would need a national standard because the tax code will apply from County Donegal to Dublin.  Therefore, the use of an objective system of listing, and I know Senator Norris was using such a system, is, in itself flawed for that very reason. The Senator would probably accept that.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made. There are considerable dramatic patterns of use and reuse, not in streets such as Henrietta Street and North Great George's Street in Dublin.  I recall <Col N="639" /> from another time and another life that Georgian Dublin accounts for in the order of 1 per cent of this city.  If one takes account of the suburbs, it accounts for probably less of the city.  Therefore, we are talking about a very small component of the history and culture of the city.  The commercially viable part of it, which tended to be south of the river, is, in many respects, no longer commercially viable because the offices which were capable of sustaining this economic vitality and refurbishment are being moved out.  Look at the uses in many of the squares south of the river; they have changed dramatically.  There is an emerging problem and I intend to deal with it before it becomes a crisis.  I hope I have dealt with the concerns to which Senator Norris referred.  For various reasons I am not prepared to accept the recommendation as proposed. I intend to address this matter in a comprehensive way in next year's budget.</P>
    <P>I know what Senator Burke is trying to say.  That matter is fraught with difficulty. The first-time house buyers' who get the grant think the grant is intended for them; it is not.  It is intended for the building industry.  It was introduced to give a boost to the building industry.  To extend it to second-hand markets would be costly and would not have any employment effect.</P>
    <P>Some people would argue that the first-time buyers' grant is questionable from an economic point of view, but I do not propose to change it.  It exists because it is employment related.  A new house, by definition, must be built and entails recent employment whereas a second-hand house, by definition, has long since ceased to be an employment vehicle, and that is why there is the difference. Mortgage interest relief, etc., are obviously available anyway, but that is the situation with regard to the new house grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  I am very encouraged by what he has said and, for that reason, I have changed my <Col N="640" /> mind.  I had intended calling a vote on this but I will not do so now because it would be fractious and silly.  However, I would like to comment on one or two things the Minister said.</P>
      <P>It struck me when reading the Bill that there was no provision to encourage people in this area while there was considerable encouragement for people developing the islands, for example.  I am therefore very encouraged by the Minister's words.  If one is in a situation where one can give this kind of encouragement to people to develop, restore and build on the western seaboard, particularly the islands, parity would require that something should be done in the north inner city, which is an area of considerable deprivation.</P>
      <P>The influx of people restoring houses is good for the social texture.  People like myself tend to complain if there is loud noise, drunkenness, drug addiction or bad behaviour.  As professional people, we also have access to influence and that operates on behalf of all the residents in the area who may not have had access to such influence.  There is a positive social good.  I agree with the Minister that there must be some benefit to the State, but I urge him away from the traditional thinking in the Department of Finance which is that one must open the houses for 30 days of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is completely impractical.  It may very well work for a stately home but if one is living in a terraced townhouse in which one is renting apartments and so on, it is quite impractical.  It is also rather expensive and, in addition, one cannot get insurance to cover the tours. I have put on the record that I had a pair of valuable cufflinks pinched by a group of university graduates who were doing an architectural tour of my house. When I talked to the insurance company they told me I had invited them in so it was my own problem and I was not covered by insurance.  It is not fair to expect people in terraced 18th century townhouses to invite troops of people in who require supervision, which is <Col N="641" /> expensive, and causing wear and tear.  It is simply not practical.</P>
    <P>However, I welcome the Minister's encouraging comments and I look forward to taking him up on his suggestion that a representative group should have the opportunity to have discussions with him.  I hope this matter will be resolved in next year's budget and I am happy to withdraw the recommendation for the time being.</P>

I was not present when Senator Daly made his contribution yesterday, although I did catch some of it on the monitor.  Nor was he present when I replied.  The distinction I made, and the philosophical underpinning for the relaxation of CAT for family businesses including farms, is the weakness of the indigenous industrial sector in this country and the high failure rate of family businesses which move from one generation to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By extending the concession to 75 per cent and simultaneously extending the period from six years to ten years we have addressed the issue of ensuring that businesses which require working capital on the point of transfer from one generation to another, and who could not fund the cost of pay out associated with CAT, would not be penalised to the point of being endangered.  On the other hand if a member of the family or a beneficiary by way of inheritance wishes or insists upon cashing their chips on point of inheritance they should pay the full amount rather than <Col N="644" /> get the deferral.

      <P>There is no change in the basic relationship.  The old practice was that the total tax revenue from vehicle licensing was remitted in full to the Department of the Environment and transferred to the Revenue Commissioners. Each local authority would then bill the Department of the Environment for its administrative costs.  It was not so much a circular transfer as an unnecessary two way process.  With the local auditors' position fairly well established, it is now possible for us to ensure the local authority will deduct at source its associated administrative costs and remit the net amount which is then sent on to the Revenue Commissioners in the normal way.  It is a simplification rather than a devolution.</P>

      <P>I also welcome this section.  I know the bona fides of certain casual traders.  Casual trading was primarily set up by farmers who brought <Col N="647" /> their produce to the local market. However, that time has long passed, with the exception of some places in Dublin.  This practice has long ceased in many rural towns and there is now a new type of casual trader selling clothes and so on.  The section does not refer to the amount of the licence fee.  Will there be different charges for different casual trading licences?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with this issue because in my previous responsibility as Minister for Enterprise and Employment I introduced the Casual Trading Bill, although I did not see it through its final stages.  We had a debate at that time with the Department of Finance and it was interesting to move from one side of the debate to the other.</P>
      <P>We have a minimalist requirement to ensure that anybody who gets a casual trading licence from a local authority puts themselves into the system by giving this basic information.  The original position was they would be required to provide a tax clearance certificate which was manifestly not practical or feasible for some people.  This provision is in the Bill because, when the casual trading licence regulations were drawn up, it was brought to our attention by the Attorney General's Office that the requirement of a social welfare insurance number on the form was in some legal doubt, and unless it was underpinned by statutory legislation it could be contested by somebody refusing to give the information.  This provision is merely to underpin the licensing arrangements of the Casual Trading Act.  The question of fees and all other related issues are a matter for the local authorities under that Act.  I am not in a position to answer that.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Finance for coming into the House.  He spends a great deal of time here.  He has a marvellous knowledge of finance and has brought initiatives and new thinking to the Department.  I have no doubt we will see more initiatives from him over the next 12 months.  I congratulate the Minister.</P>

      <P>I wish to respond to those very generous tributes and comments which I do not believe I have earned.  In so far as I have earned them it is because I had the back-up of a wonderful staff, as Senator Daly said.  The number of officials can be intimidating but they are here as much to police me as to inform the Senators and to make sure I do not go AWOL on occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a sad occasion as a Revenue Commissioner, Mr. Frank Cassells, to whom I referred yesterday, is being buried today.  Prior to his job of integrating the Customs and Excise staff <Col N="649" /> with the Revenue Commissioners, he was responsible on the revenue side for drafting legislation and steering through a very complex exercise, from the day the budget is signed off to today.  There is a fixed statutory period in our Constitution in which these matters have to take place.  It is quite an onerous task which is done with consummate skill by dedicated people within the system to whom I pay unqualified tribute.  Mr. Cassells, now sadly deceased, was uniquely responsible for the introduction of the self-assessment system which has transformed taxation in this country. Like others, he made a contribution which we in this House seldom get the chance to pay tribute to.  I accept the tributes generously offered to me on the understanding that they are being offered to the system and the officials who work with me.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Closure of Portarlington Firm.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an issue of great concern to people in Portarlington and in the larger area of Laois-Offaly.  The closure of Butler's Engineering came as a devastating blow to Portarlington which has suffered more than most towns from job losses in recent years. The ESB station was closed down and the local workforce of Bord na Móna was substantially reduced as part of that company's rationalisation programme. Now Butler's Engineering has gone too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> The impact of the loss of 130 jobs in a town of approximately 3,500 people cannot be exaggerated.  Proportionately, it is a much bigger blow than the closure of Packard Electric in Tallaght.  The loss of jobs at Butler's Engineering must be seen in the context of the unemployment problem in County Laois where approximately 3,400 people are on the dole.  Some 1,300 of these are in the Portarlington area.</P>
    <P>The county simply cannot afford the loss of another major industry.  It is almost three months since Butler's Engineering went into receivership and it is three weeks since the last of the workers were let go.  The plant is now closed completely, but since the receivership was originally announced there has been little evidence of any attempt by the Government to come to grips with the problem.  There has been no initiative, no task force and no special measures to cope with the difficulties that will arise for the town of Portarlington and the surrounding area as a result of this closure.</P>
    <P>Butler's Engineering was in business for almost 30 years and over that period the company built up a well deserved reputation for excellence in the field of steel fabrication.  It won orders for many prestigious projects not just at home but also in the highly competitive British market and further afield.  The company built up a highly trained and skilled workforce.  It brought on stream a modern state-of-the-art fabrication plant which enabled it to compete with the best.  Now the workers from Butler's are idle and the plant is also.</P>
    <P>Surely we can see that both the plant and the workforce are valuable assets, and with some effort both could be got back to work again.  Every effort must be made to find a buyer for the plant so that production can recommence and as many of the workforce as possible can be re-engaged.  Portarlington should not be difficult to sell as an industrial location to potential investors.  The town has good road and rail links to the rest of the country and is within easy reach of the port of Dublin.  It is not too <Col N="651" /> far from the ports of Waterford and Rosslare.</P>
    <P>I realise the Government cannot create jobs, but it should do everything it can to ensure that the jobs which existed at Butler's until a couple of months ago are saved.  Have the Minister, his officials in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, or any of the State development agencies met with the receiver to discuss the future of the Portarlington plant?  Has IDA Ireland identified any foreign investors who might be interested in taking over the business, and are any discussions in progress on this front?  Has the Minister or the State agencies any proposals to find an alternative industry for Portarlington to replace the jobs lost at Butler's?</P>
    <P>Time is running out and the months are slipping by, yet the Government does not seem to be acting.  There is no Government Minister, senior or junior, in the constituency of Laois-Offaly, but the interests of Portarlington and other towns in the constituency must not be neglected on this account.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment should indicate what action he proposes to take in relation to Butler's Engineering and how he intends to deploy the resources of the State to alleviate the present problem. The former workforce at Butler's and the people of Portarlington and surrounding areas deserve no less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am answering on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment who is unable to attend.  I am happy to respond to Senator Honan who, understandably, has raised this issue as a constituency representative for Laois-Offaly. The matter was raised on 20 February in the Dáil by my colleague, Deputy Pat Gallagher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have every respect for the intellectual integrity of Senator Honan in her individual capacity representing, as she very ably does, the people of Laois-Offaly, everything she has said is <Col N="652" /> in total contradiction to the policy of the party of which she is currently a member. If Senator Honan's party had its way and was in Government, not only would there be no help for Butler's Engineering but it would have closed earlier because of the level of debt that it owed to, among others, one of the State agencies.  If Senator Honan's party had its way, that agency would not exist.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to be harsh on the Senator, who is clearly fighting a constituency battle, what she said was in total contradiction to the rhetoric of abuse that comes from her leader and from the party's financial spokesperson in the Dáil.  I will not allow that to colour the quality of my reply, although I wish to let it stand on the record.</P>
    <P>The Senator asked a specific question and I recognise that the employment needs of Portarlington are acutely difficult. I am informed that Mr. Ray Jackson of KPMG, who was appointed as receiver for this company on 16 February, recently informed the Department of Enterprise and Employment, through Forbairt &mdash; an agency which the Progressive Democrats would like to abolish &mdash; that he is fairly confident there will be a new taker for the company.  He is currently having discussions with a number of parties and, clearly, those discussions are taking much longer than had been anticipated.  I can assure the Senator that the State agency, Forbairt, is in regular contact with the receiver who knows the agency is available to assist in whatever way possible.</P>
    <P>To decode that, an increase in public expenditure &mdash; to which I know the Senator's party is totally opposed, although on this occasion she would probably make an exception &mdash; might possibly be made available from the &ldquo;spendthrift&rdquo; Labour Minister if a suitable buyer comes forward and if they meet Forbairt's criteria.</P>
    <P>I hope that will be the case.  If such a proposal comes to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment with a recommendation from Forbairt then it will receive the support of the Department of Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House that the overt filleting operation which took place on the previous Adjournment matter will not occur on this one, which will be much more subtle and convivial. I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter for the Adjournment; I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, and congratulate him on the work he is progressing so effectively in his Department, particularly for the western seaboard.</P>
      <P>The Kiltalown site in west Tallaght takes up 20 acres.  Most of the area has unemployment rates of 80 per cent, there are connected large-scale problems and the social amenities are minimal. For a considerable period the west Tallaght heritage group and other people in the community have looked for a heritage site within the area.  Tallaght is the size of Limerick &mdash; 97,000 people live there &mdash; and we want a heritage site because we recognise the importance of heritage to the local people.  It will give them a sense of belonging to the area and of achievement for the works completed locally.</P>
      <P>The Kiltalown site is most interesting and the Minister will be aware of two major archaeological finds there in the last year.  The first is a Pale ditch, 180 metres long, dating from the Act of Parliament in 1794.  It is an extensive archaeological find which was recorded and validated by the Office of Public Works in February.  The second was a standing stone, which is between 5,000 and 6,000 years old.  The inclination and axis of the stone point to 19 extensive monuments recently found on Tallaght Hill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We argue that this area has heritage and, consequently, tourism potential which we believe should be developed as part of a heritage park, not just for the people of west Tallaght but for the Dublin region.  South Dublin County Council currently has plans to develop a small number of houses on the site but <Col N="654" /> most people in the area are completely opposed to this.  We want the support of the Minister and the Government for preserving the heritage of west Tallaght through these new finds and ensuring that, if funds are made available, we can develop the site into an international heritage park.</P>
    <P>Community spirit in west Tallaght is second to none; the people have worked exceptionally hard with State and local agencies to develop the community. They are looking to the Government and the Minister to do everything in their power to develop this community-led initiative and ensure the heritage of the area is handed on to another generation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Hayes for raising this matter.  There are two archaeological sites at Kiltalown.  Tallaght, County Dublin which have recently come to the attention of the National Monuments Service.  The first is a linear earthwork in two sections which is similar in form to the sections of the Pale ditch identified at Balally and Ballyogan in South County Dublin.  It is characteristically located at the foot of the Dublin Mountains.  This accords with the account given by Ball.  There is a local tradition in Tallaght that the Pale ditch ran through the grounds of the Dominican Priory in the village.  It is probable that it continued further west as there was a castle at Jobstown in 1654 and Kiltalown House was built on the site of an early church.  The second item is a granite standing stone, just over one metre in height, which is located west of Kiltalown House in an area where there are a number of Bronze Age burials.  It is positioned similarly to the nearest standing stones at Boherboy, that is, on relatively level grassland at the base of the foothills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both sites have been added to the Sites and Monuments Record and will be included in the Record of Monuments and Places.  They were brought to the attention of the National Monuments <Col N="655" /> Service by the heritage awareness group in Tallaght.  The latter has presented a submission to South Dublin County Council outlining the history of the area and calling for the preservation of local features which include, <i>inter alia</i>, the Pale ditch and standing stone.</P>
    <P>I am aware of plans by South Dublin County Council to sell the lands to the north and west of the monuments to facilitate a private housing development. The local group is opposed to this and wants the lands preserved as a park. In the council's plans for housing there would be a green area which would preserve the standing stone but only part of the Pale ditch.  The other part of the ditch would be lost through the construction of the proposed new by-pass extension to the south although a route for this has not yet been definitively decided.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the National Monuments Services are due to meet the council on 10 May to discuss their proposals and informal on-site discussion has already taken place.  The <Col N="656" /> National Monuments Service is concerned to ensure that the two sites are protected.  It would prefer to see the route of the proposed by-pass extension moved further south, away from that portion of the Pale ditch which would be threatened.  If, for reasons connected with the alignment of the road, it cannot be moved, the National Monuments Service would insist on full excavation of that part of the ditch being removed.</P>
    <P>There are an estimated 150,000 archaeological sites and monuments in the State but only a select number can be presented to the public.  While the monuments in question are of importance, the National Monuments Service has no plans to develop a heritage park at this location.  It would, however, be supportive of any initiative which would preserve the monuments <i>in situ.</i>  I urge the Senator to prevail on South Dublin County Council and the heritage group to form a partnership for which aid might be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 15 May 1996.</P>
