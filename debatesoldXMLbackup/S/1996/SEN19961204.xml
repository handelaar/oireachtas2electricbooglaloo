      <P>I have notice from Senator McGowan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism and Trade to support the Bill before the United States Congress which will allow goods and products manufactured in Northern Ireland and certain counties in the Republic of Ireland free entry into the United States for a ten year period.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to review the level of remuneration payable to physiotherapists in view of the fact that 17 years have elapsed since the last review.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make a statement on the prevalence of MRSA in Irish hospitals.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to endorse the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the prosecution of rape as a war crime.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make a statement regarding the Government's position on water charges given his recent letter to Fingal County Council indicating that this issue would be addressed before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Kelly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to transfer the responsibility of lighting national roads, primary and secondary, to the National Roads Authority.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make a decision regarding the provision of a formal personal assistant service to enable people with disabilities to live independently; and if he will establish an independent living fund.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McDonagh of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to make a budget allocation in the 1997 Estimates for the urgently needed six room extension to Gort community school, County Galway.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mulcahy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to urgently consider the need to review and abolish residential property tax, given that this tax unduly discriminates against people living in Dublin and places a very heavy burden upon people who are already paying income tax.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators McGowan, Maloney, Finneran, Henry, McGennis, Kelly, Daly and McDonagh as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator McGowan's and Senator Maloney's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret that I had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Mulcahy as it involves advocacy of legislation. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2, 3, and 29, motion 23.  Item 1 will taken until it concludes, which I hope will not be later than 1.30 p.m.  There will be a sos between 1.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. and item 2 will be taken from 2.30 p.m. to 6 p.m.  Given that it is a complex and important issue and that the debate will not conclude today, I suggest 30 minutes for each speaker.  Item 29, motion 23, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and item 3, Report Stage of the Control of Horses Bill, will then be taken.  I thank the Opposition for agreeing to take this item which arrived late on the Order Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with my party Leader's call at the weekend and that of the Taoiseach at the end of the debate last night, will the Leader of the House use his good offices to have the Government ensure that the Price Waterhouse report is published?  It is necessary to do so to clear the cloud which is hanging over all of us on all sides of the political divide.</P>
      <P>In view of the comments made by the new Minister, Deputy Dukes, that he intends to review all decisions relating to his Department, is the Leader happy to conclude item 1 which is at Report Stage today?  The new Minister may have a different view on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a similar issue, not to open a debate on it but because there should be cool reflection on the events of the last week and we need to find out way through it.  Public opinion on the issue is very clear.  I ask the Leader to ensure a way is found to make the Price Waterhouse report publicly available.  If that is not done it will reflect on all politicians.  I take the view as an Independent Member that all of us who represent the public have been tainted in some way by the events of the last week and there is outstanding business which needs to be cleared up.  I am not laying blame in any direction but people want information more than anything else. They need to know what is happening and what is being done about it.  This is a view I support.</P>
      <P>I rarely mention a comment made in the Lower House.  However, it was outrageous for a speaker in the other House to make the point that the Attorney General was tainted in some way by having represented principals in this discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it is out of order. However, the Attorney General deserves the confidence of this House.  That comment went too far and I reject it.</P>
      <P>There is need for a debate on the interconnection between the church, State and religion.  I have raised this issue with the Leader many times and he has given me a commitment to have a debate.  Now the need for such a debate is crucial.  This is not just a church and State matter; it takes in the White Paper on Education and how the involvement of politicians, the people and the church are related and how they can help to serve us.  I would like that examined. I am prepared to table a motion on the matter.  It would not be a motion criticising the Government but one on which we could all offer our points of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senators Wright and O'Toole in asking for the Price Waterhouse <Col N="852" /> report on Dunnes Stores to be published in full. We cannot remain detached in this House from the events in the other House and nationally.  It is important for us to discuss these matters, either by way of statements or the House being asked to pass its judgment on the appointment of Deputy Dukes, whom I congratulate, as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
      <P>I also join with Senator Wright in wondering if it is appropriate for us to take item 1, the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, today when there are indications it might be reviewed.  What would be the point of concluding the Bill in the Seanad if its whole basis was reviewed and changed?  There are very serious outstanding questions about the sale of the 20 per cent stake in Telecom, the price we got and the fact that the money will be reinvested in the company.  For those reasons I wonder how appropriate it is to deal with item 1 today when we have a new Minister who is in a position to examine the matter and change the direction which has been taken to date.</P>
      <P>There are many items on the Order Paper which could be debated instead, particularly item 7 &mdash; the Milk (Regulation of Supply) (Amendment) Bill &mdash; which is not controversial and could be disposed of this morning.  I ask the Leader to reconsider the ordering of item 1.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators asked last week about the Credit Union Bill and the Leader indicated he would have information this week.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Kelly who wished to raise on the Adjournment the fact that the ratepayers of County Kildare have to pay £60,000 per year for lighting the motorway which benefits people coming to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls for the publication of the Price Waterhouse report.  The conduct of public affairs should not be based on rumour and innuendo.  It would be better if everything were in the open and we knew what we were dealing with.  It may lead to as many questions being asked about the business world as about politics and that may be a good development.</P>
      <P>I support the request for information on the Credit Union Bill.  Senator Quinn and others have asked in the past about the White Paper on science and technology and I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on that and related matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former member of Government I support the calls for the publication of the Price Waterhouse report.  My colleagues who are also former members of Government and I feel strongly about this issue. The cloud that hangs over us is unacceptable.  The Leader should convey to the Government in the strongest possible terms our determination to have the report published so the public may be <Col N="853" /> reassured on the standards by which we in public life live.</P>
      <P>The queries raised as to whether we should be asked to deal with the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, are valid, particularly in the light of recent experiences concerning the Minister for Justice.  The House found that it was debating the establishment of a non-statutory body to deal with courts and prisons while the Government had changed its position on the matter.  I would not wish a similar fate to befall this Bill.</P>
      <P>Arising from the disturbing reports yesterday on a second outbreak of BSE in one herd of cattle and the increasing number of cases, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should implement an immediate slaughter policy so there can be no question of transmissibility from one animal to another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did.  The Leader should convey to the Minister the need for an immediate and effective slaughter policy where outbreaks, or suspected outbreaks, occur.  It is a grave matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for the publication of the Price Waterhouse report which has given rise to concern.  I and the public are surprised that only one section of the report could be revealed by a journalist.  There should not be a delay in publishing this report.</P>
      <P>Last week I asked the Leader to provide time for a debate on the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  I received a copy of that report in the past few days, so I again ask the Leader to provide time for this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to urge the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to make an immediate statement explaining why a second case of BSE was found in a herd which was not slaughtered after the first outbreak.  It has been suggested that the slaughter of animals is voluntary; in other words, the farmer must agree to it.  If that is true, the Minister must give an immediate explanation because the Irish beef industry will be severely damaged if consumer confidence is lost.  The Irish beef industry was able to maintain its position in the market because of our slaughter policy.  However, it now appears it was a voluntary slaughter policy.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the new Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes.  I am delighted he will re-examine the Luas project. It is great that traffic has moved freely in Dublin over the past few days.  The Luas Bill suggests that bicycles may be banned from the centre of the city.  The Minister should consider this and try to achieve the best results from the Luas Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange time for a discussion on rural Ireland, particularly the <Col N="854" /> withdrawal of essential services?  I raise this matter because of the recent closure of a bank in Ballydehob in west Cork.  Peripheral areas are getting a raw deal in relation to such services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted Senator Calnan mentioned the decline of rural Ireland.  I join with my party leader and with Senator Dardis in expressing concern about developments in the past few days as they relate to the Order of Business and specifically to Report and Final Stages of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill ordered for today.  I ask the Leader to consider seriously not taking Final Stage today in light of the public comments by the newly appointed Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes.  I join with all sides of the House in congratulating the Minister on his appointment. In the circumstances it might be more prudent for this House not to conclude the discussion of the Bill today to allow the Minister time to consider its provisions.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht the overwhelming enthusiasm with which those in the artistic world have received the news of the bequest by the Mahon family of five 17th century masterpieces which will be displayed in the National Gallery of Ireland.  These paintings are worth millions of pounds to this country and it is appropriate that they should be given to the National Gallery of Ireland, which attracted over 1.5 million visitors last year.  I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to convey to the Mahon family the nation's sincere thanks for its generous contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the BSE cases, having listened to one of the vets concerned on the radio this morning, it would be wrong of us to cause alarm by suggesting there has been any change of policy.  The vet said the first case was being investigated and we are all aware of the Government's policy which is implemented by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. In such cases, the entire herd is taken out so none of the slaughtered animals enters the food chain. It is regrettable, however, that the number of BSE cases are increasing.</P>
      <P>As regards the Price Waterhouse report, two weeks ago there was much comment both here and in the Dáil about an investigation running into the sand.  It strikes me that this particular investigation, which was carried out by the Perry Masons of this world, also ran into the sand very quickly.  Will the Leader inform us whether it was quicksand?</P>
      <P>Following a discussion in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at which questions were raised some years ago, will the Leader inform us who is entitled to use the facilities of the Oireachtas Library?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the call for an immediate statement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry regarding the disturbing news about slaughter procedures for BSE-infected herds.  It is in the public interest that an immediate statement should be made by the Minister.  I was under the impression that farmers with infected herds did not have an alternative option to slaughter.  If that is not the case, it certainly should be.  The Minister should intervene straight away to reassure the public on this matter.</P>
      <P>I also want to raise the intervention by a new health insurance company in this country.  From information available to me, it appears the new health insurance company has a procedure that allows it to cherry pick to the detriment of the elderly.  Will the Leader bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Health?  When the relevant legislation went through the House I posed this question and the Minister gave categorical assurances that cherry picking could not take place.  It now seems, however, that this new health insurance company has found a way around the procedures as laid down in the regulations.  We do not want health insurers in this country that discriminate against the elderly and other weaker sections of society who need more health cover than others.  I ask the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Minister for Health who should reassure the House that he will take steps to deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just returned from abroad and it is immensely reassuring to find the new Cathaoirleach presiding with such dignity and efficiency.  On the plane I read the words of our President, Mary Robinson, who suggested that politicians should moderate their language in attacking each other.  I am glad to see that appears to be the case here and that there have not been, as far as I know, any undignified attacks upon a Minister who resigned in the last few days.</P>
      <P>Since the debate on Luas was initiated in this House and we have had a series of well informed debates on the matter since then, will the Leader send these documents to the new Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, with our congratulations?  He should be impartial in his examination of them to see if there is a case for Luas going underground at the junction of the two canals.  Being a fair minded man, he will find much to make him think again in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> Who is running the country?  I am reassured to discover the Cathaoirleach in the Chair. However, I was concerned to read a statement made by a jumped up little person from a PR agency to the effect that the new Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, could not make a decision to run Luas underground because the individual in question had been given an undertaking by which the Government is bound.  This person is not an elected representative but his job is paid for out of public money.</P>

      <P>As the Leader is aware, the Book of Estimates is being finalised for publication on Monday next.  People with disabilities have been campaigning for some time for the establishment of the independent living fund.

      <P>Will the Leader make time available before Christmas for a debate on the funding of local authorities?  I intend no disrespect to the Cathaoirleach or the Leader but I believe I am wasting my time because this matter does not seem to be very important to the Government, which does not recognise the confusion in local authorities.  People in rural and urban areas are now obliged to pay a levy in respect of rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise I am harping on this issue, but local authorities do not know where they stand because there are rumours that water charges will be abolished.  Will the Leader inform me whether that is the case?  If we cannot debate this issue, will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment to indicate to local authorities that water charges, introduced by the then Minister in 1983, are to be abolished?  The Minister must put an end to these rumours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support calls for the publication of the Price Waterhouse report. <Col N="857" /> There will be much disquiet until its contents are published.  Will the Leader inform the House of the Government's intentions regarding Deputy Lowry's dealings with Mr. Ben Dunne, which were reported in the media?  Has the Government decided on a timeframe within which it will allow Deputy Lowry deal with his taxation affairs?  Extensive advertisements have appeared in the media about social welfare fraud and some of my constituents have raised questions about the Houses of the Oireachtas' intentions regarding possible tax evasion and avoidance.  Has the Government given Deputy Lowry a timescale within which to produce his reply?</P>
      <P>I support Senator Sherlock's call for a debate on the report of the Commission for People with Disabilities.  This has been debated in the media and in this House but the other House has not yet done so.  I also support Senator McGowan's request for a debate on local authority funding.  I had a motion on the Adjournment to this effect but it has not been accepted.  Local authorities must adopt a rate within the next couple of days. My colleague on South Dublin County Council has told me that they failed to adopt a rate last night.  There is great interest in this subject in this House as a number of Senators hold dual mandates as local authority members.  It is imperative that the Minister for the Environment makes a statement this evening on the Government's intentions in relation to local authority funding and service charges in particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Price Waterhouse report should and must be published.  In the past few days we have seen an incredible amount of innuendo and character assassination on the basis of a report no one has seen.  Some of the most outrageous things are being said and it is in the public interest that this report is published as soon as possible.  Then, let the Heavens fall where they may.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators asked what this House might do about this report.  It is over a year since the Ethics in Public Office Act came into law.  I would be willing to include Senators' concerns about the Price Waterhouse report in a wider debate reviewing the efficacy of that Act.  This can be arranged before the end of this session.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Senator McGennis attempted to score a cheap shot.  The former Minister should be given time with his advisers to prepare his response.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, that was not my question.  It was not a cheap shot.  These questions are being asked by my constituents. There was a large advertisement in today's <i>star</i> about a clampdown on fraud in social welfare. Sixty per cent of my constituents are unemployed and they are asking me if the Government and politicians are mentioned in this report.  What is the timescale for Deputy Lowry to reach a conclusion in relation to his tax?  The Leader is now making a cheap shot.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) The Radio Plan shall include provision for the creation of a short wave radio station.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In proposing this amendment, I take the opportunity, in light of recent events, to sympathise with the plight of the former Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. Senators from all sides of the House will empathise with him as will the wider body politic. Somebody once said that victory and defeat are both sides of the same coin.  This is perhaps the most traumatic event any politician would have to go through and I wish Deputy Lowry and his wife and family well at this difficult time for them. I have known Deputy Lowry for many years.  I <Col N="860" /> made a very small contribution at a time when he and a number of other members of the Semple Stadium committee, of which he was chairman, were attempting to reduce their horrendous debt. Because of my experience in the music business he and I had a number of conversations with some of his colleagues in Tipperary.  My relationship with him goes back that far and I would not like to let the occasion pass without putting on record my personal sympathy with his situation.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to the regulator and the quality of telecommunications.  When I raised this matter on Committee Stage it was primarily to address the difficulty that the Irish diaspora in the UK has experienced for many years in obtaining the medium wave radio signal from this country.  Subsequent to that debate the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, arranged for me to meet technical people from his Department to clarify a number of the issues raised in the debate.  In light of those discussions, it seems that, in spite of the best efforts of RTÉ radio and technicians and the technical staff in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, due to the delicate balance which must be achieved between the countries of the European Union in arriving at an equitable share of transmission areas, even if there were to be a significant increase of 100 kW in the signal from the Tullamore transmitter, the current strength of which is limited to 500 kW, it is unlikely it would have a significant impact on the signal going into the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>This amendment affords me an opportunity to publicly acknowledge the excellent work carried out by RTÉ in the area of signal development, especially the work carried out under the direction of Mr. Wesley Body, the former head of news in RTÉ television who is now head of broadcasting development.  We are mainly concerned with the radio signal in this context, not only to the UK but right across the world.  I have been informed by Mr. Boyd that there have been significant developments in this area.  The primary concern of RTÉ in relation to improving the quality of signal is not to develop terrestrial but satellite links.  Many Members will be aware of the Astra satellite link.</P>
    <P>Another significant development is that because of the onward rush of technology, large cities in Britain are now being cabled for radio and television reception.  I have an apartment in South County Dublin and receive my television signal through Cablelink.  I have the facility, as do we all, to obtain an audio link as well.  This is the direction in which RTÉ is going and it is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>RTÉ is currently concluding negotiations with a number of major cable operators in large cities, including London and Birmingham.  It is hoped that over the next few years most of the major cities in the UK will have cable facilities capable of receiving the RTÉ signal.  Emigrants and others living in the UK who have an interest in Irish affairs should contact their local cable <Col N="861" /> operators and request them to negotiate with RTÉ for its radio signal.  If there is sufficient demand from subscribers in these cable areas the operators will respond.  They should be told that it is now technically possible to receive a top quality RTÉ radio signal through cable.  If this was pursued most of the UK would be covered.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the impressive technical innovations that RTÉ is pursuing, the question of short wave is a live issue and has gathered momentum.  In this respect I acknowledge the fine work undertaken by my friend and colleague from County Mayo, Michael Cummins.  He held a seminar there within the past 12 to 18 months at which he brought together the various technical experts in this area.</P>
    <P>If this service were to be proceeded with, RTÉ would be the main provider.  I have been informed by RTÉ that there are no technical objections to the signal or to the establishment of a short wave radio station.  The technical expertise available to me from the Department confirmed this view although I have also been advised that, in practical terms, technical advancements such as radio and satellite transmission have overtaken this dimension in radio broadcasting.  Nevertheless, short wave is still a viable option.</P>
    <P>If RTÉ is not prepared to initiate this process, which it is capable of doing, perhaps providers in the marketplace would see a commercial viability in establishing a short wave station in which they could sell air time.  A great attraction of short wave is that it provides global access, even though there are different frequencies.  Anybody who listens to the BBC World Service when abroad realises that a variety of frequencies are advertised.  In fairness to the BBC, it has several publications providing technical information and which are subscribed to by its worldwide listening audience.  It would not, therefore, be beyond a provider's capacity to publicise the same type of information for potential listeners.</P>
    <P>The argument for short wave radio has been well made and has not diminished because of opinions expressed to me since Committee Stage. Short wave radio will remain viable until such time as there is a blanket cable coverage.  It is one of the best options for use by the widespread Irish diaspora.</P>
    <P>RTÉ operates a short wave frequency in various parts of Africa and the Far East for specific programmes, such as the All Ireland Football and Hurling Finals.  They operate short wave frequencies when required, as they see fit. They do it already, it is capable of being done, and in the absence of an initiative from RTÉ &mdash; which has indicated it will be a costly exercise &mdash; an independent provider might be prepared to apply for the franchise.  As the Minister indicated, there would be no objections within his Department to an application from an independent operator.  However, that is not to say the applicant would succeed.  I have reintroduced this amendment on Report Stage because in the <Col N="862" /> period since Committee Stage, important technical information has become available to help us form this opinion.  The radio plan should include provision for the creation of a short wave radio station.</P>
    <P>I extend a warm welcome and congratulations to the newly appointed Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes.  My colleague, Senator Daly, and I have come to know, love and have great affection for him &mdash; if that is possible &mdash; over the last 12 to 18 months. He was &mdash; perhaps he still is, technically &mdash; Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and we benefited greatly from his erudition and elaboration on subjects in that area. The committee's loss is the nation's gain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Mooney's amendment.  On a personal basis I was deeply saddened by the events of last week.  I have known Deputy Lowry for a long time and admired his contribution to Semple Stadium.  I was associated with fund raising activities for the stadium through him.  I particularly applaud the great part Semple Stadium played during the centenary year of the GAA.  I extend to his wife and family our best wishes for the future.  Political life is tough and it is extremely lonely when something goes wrong, as it has now.  One has no one but one's family to fall back on so I wish them well for the future.  Politics is the business of survival.  I congratulate the new Minister, Deputy Dukes.  Kildare is now well represented in this Department &mdash; it has a full Minister as well as an experienced Minister of State.</P>
      <P>To return to the amendment, Senator Mooney has wide practical knowledge of this matter and the Minister should listen to his advice.  The Senator has deeply researched the proposal before us, has communicated with the technical experts in the Department and discussed the matter at length.  The amendment would allow an independent operator to take this on board and pursue it.  I heard the commentary on the All-Ireland Final replay on short wave radio in America, so I know it can be used to promote Ireland.  The results which can be achieved are mindboggling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Senator said, cable and satellite systems may have overtaken much of this technology but nevertheless there may be an advantage to be gained.  If the BBC and other short wave stations can be heard in Ireland, why can we not use short wave to transmit and broadcast into the UK, a market of 60 million people?  RTÉ is now broadcasting most of its major programmes through cable in the UK but short wave would be an ideal way to reach another portion of that market.  For instance, Irish entertainment is the in thing across Europe and America at present.  I have experience of the changes which are taking place in the German market, the third largest market in the commercial world.  It is mind boggling what could be achieved in the German market by the use of short wave radio.  If the <Col N="863" /> Department thinks this is not a financially viable proposition, an independent short wave operator could be appointed on a three to five year trial basis.  If it is viable, Irish producers will avail of it and there will be many advantages for the tourist industry.  Our music and song would be heard across the globe.  Irish music is the greatest ambassador to attract tourists.  Short wave radio is a wonderful suggestion and I would like the Minister of State to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was on a parliamentary delegation to Rome last week and while watching cable television I received a sound signal from RTÉ on one channel.  As I mentioned a number of times recently I fail to understand why a signal cannot be received 60 miles from Dublin or why RTÉ cannot provide a signal throughout the island.  Is it possible to send a cable television signal through radio?  Is it possible to take advantage of this signal commercially?  The success of &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; and what is has done for Ireland should not be forgotten.  The world is looking at this country.  I have been to many shows and &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; is one of the finest I have ever seen.  It is an all Irish production and has done a great deal to sell this country internationally.</P>
      <P>Seventy million people live within a 70 mile radius of Cologne and Dusseldorf.  A great deal of business could be done there, yet we are not prepared to promote Ireland.  For instance, how many people in Great Britain are aware that the signal from Ireland is better through a blank screen than it is through radio?</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney said that RTÉ is putting the emphasis on using cable television channels rather than radio.  A short wave signal can be received perfectly throughout Europe via television channels but it cannot be received in Great Britain, Ireland's biggest market.  Yet, 60 million people want to listen and are asking why they cannot receive the signal.  A signal cannot be received in Holyhead which is 55 miles from Dublin.</P>
      <P>This Bill should be taken by the Minister for the Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, not the Minister of State for Transport, Energy and Communications.  Telecommunications should be the responsibility of one Department only.  We cannot debate this Bill because the relevant Minister is not here.  A telecommunications Bill is being put through this House, but the issue of a short wave signal is not the responsibility of the Minister.  I do not see the logic in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it possible to receive a signal through the radio?  There is a fantastic signal through cable television.  Admittedly if the Minister of State wants to hear a good signal, he should go to Ballydehob, turn off the radio and turn on the television.  Everybody wants to listen to radio and Irish people want to hear Irish programmes.  It baffles me that people can go to a cable company and receive Irish programmes but they cannot do <Col N="864" /> so through RTÉ.  Will the relevant Minister be asked for an explanation?</P>

      <P>I spent much of this year among what are termed &ldquo;the diaspora&rdquo; and was staggered by its desire for closer contact and for access to our broadcasting in America and Britain.  There is potential there and we are only tapping the surface.  I support the general thrust of the arguments being presented to the Minister of State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would go farther than Senator Cregan in regard to the Departments of Transport, Energy and Communications and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  One Department does not know what the other is doing.  Recently I got in touch with both Departments and tried to establish who was responsible for what in regard to communications.  There is a necessity for ministerial rationalisation in that regard.</P>
      <P>I wish the new Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, well.  He was Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and he is an able politician.  I am sure that, with the assistance of the Minister of State, the communications and energy needs of Kildare will be adequately attended to.  I regret the departure of Deputy Lowry.  He had a difficult time during his tenure but he worked hard and diligently.  It is regrettable that his term in office should terminate so soon.  Nevertheless, I am sure he realises, as many of us have, that there is life after being a Minister and that he will continue to represent his constituents adequately as he has done in the past.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment because I have been impressed during my travels abroad by the BBC World Service.  The amendment envisages a similar service being provided through a short wave radio signal which could be easily picked up anywhere in the world without the need for a satellite dish or cable.  I support the idea because it would provide an inexpensive, efficient and valuable short wave service to the Irish overseas and would also promote Ireland abroad.</P>
      <P>This is important because it has been demonstrated by those involved in promoting Ireland internationally, such as the IDA, that there is a very limited knowledge of the country overseas.  International business people, who have found it important and profitable to locate operations here, say their friends in business overseas have little knowledge of Ireland and how its economy functions.  It is important, therefore, to have an Irish short wave service and I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister of State outline the reason such a service was not established in the past?  I am aware there has been considerable discussion about it in the last 20 years.  Is it due to cost or the lack of expertise to put the system in place? It is an obvious move, given the informative and <Col N="865" /> valuable service provided internationally by the BBC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I already welcomed the appointment of Deputy Dukes as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  I endorse Senator Daly's comments about two Ministers from the same county in the one Department.  We can at least expect that the Eircell blackspot at the bottom of the hill in Kilcullen will be sorted out.  They can start there and move forward.</P>
      <P>I am technically illiterate regarding radio signals but in the era of global communications we should be as competitive as other countries in terms of getting our message across to the world. The large emigrant population is interested in what is going on at home and the wider world should be exposed to what we have to say.  This is why I support the amendment.</P>
      <P>Members referred to the BBC World Service but I understand it has been considerably reduced in recent years.  In broadcasting terms it is not as significant as it was in the past.  I do not have doubts about the creation of an Irish signal but about its reception.  Most radio is now broadcast almost exclusively on FM and some stations are not available on the medium wave band.  It can be difficult to receive a signal as a result of the inadequacy of the equipment.  If an Irish short wave service was created, would there be adequate equipment to receive the signal?</P>
      <P>I spent Monday in a motorcar in the west of England.  In the past it was possible to receive RTÉ on medium wave on the west coast of England and in Wales but now radios almost exclusively search for the nearest FM station. One spends the entire day listening to local radio. This is useful from a driving point of view because one knows where there are traffic jams but it does not have much to recommend it to people other than those living in the immediate area.  It provides a useful service to them, as does Irish local radio.  I am concerned that major investment would be required in reception equipment if an Irish short wave service existed.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> The amendment affects section 3 in general and subsections (5) to (9), inclusive, in particular. The subsections deal with the transfer of the Minister's current regulatory powers in relation to frequency spectrum management to the director of telecommunications regulation.  These functions, in so far as they relate to broadcasting services, are confined solely to the assignment of the appropriate radio frequencies at the appropriate locations within the State for the transmission of the broadcast services concerned. Responsibility for broadcasting policy and content rests entirely with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  While I agree with the point about rationalisation, I am sure my colleague in that Department would not be happy if I said I wanted to check that part of his brief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Senator.  Senator Mooney first raised this issue on Second Stage when I told him that I sympathised with him; that is still the case.  An Irish short wave radio station is a good and sound idea.  At that time I wrote to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, raising and supporting the Senator's views. Ultimately, my Department is not in the business of setting broadcasting policy; the director will not be involved in this area either.  It is a matter for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Senator will agree there is a need for drive and commitment in the setting up of any broadcasting station.  This includes a commitment to financial resources and professional broadcasting expertise.  These issues are a matter for RTÉ or a third party in the first instance.  In the context of broadcasting policy, it would then be a matter for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  It would only be on the finalisation of such a decision that the director of telecommunications regulation would become involved from the point of view of licensing frequency usage for such a service.  The amendment presupposes the policy and commercial decisions to establish a short wave radio station.  It is not proper or appropriate to provide for it in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Cregan asked why one could receive a clear signal through cable but not from the air. The reason is the signal going through the cable is uninterrupted but the signal in the air travels through a packed area which contains interruptions that cannot be avoided.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State.  It is obvious that the sentiment if not the <Col N="867" /> practicality of implementing this proposal is in my favour.  I appreciate, as Senator Daly said, that the Minister is constrained to an extraordinary degree.  Because of the overlap between the technical aspects and policy dimensions of broadcasting, we are falling between two stools. In effect, while the Minister has sympathy with the proposal, he is not in a position to implement it.  He can only make representations arising from the debate, I urge him to make specific representations to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to open up the discussion on the provision of a short wave radio station service from Ireland.  As the Minister responsible for policy, it is incumbent on him, given this discussion and the comments of his colleagues in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, to have a public debate.  That debate should be initiated by the Minister and he should set up a forum where the pros and cons of this proposal could be aired and its commercial viability explored.  I fully appreciate that, while it is all very well to call for the setting up of a service, one has to pay for it and the costings must be researched before it can be placed before those who might be interested, not just RTÉ.</P>
      <P>The Bill cannot do a great deal to facilitate this amendment but, at least, the subject has been adequately aired.  I still believe we should have a short wave radio station.  The amendment states &ldquo;The Radio Plan shall include provision for the creation of a short wave radio station&rdquo; and I will hold my line on the matter as I believe this should be implemented.

This amendment affords me an opportunity to once again compliment the ongoing good work on the establishment of a stronger radio signal to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I request the Irish negotiators at the upcoming regular review of international frequencies to attempt, despite the information conveyed to me that even a significant increase in the power of the Tullamore transmitter would not have a great impact, to get it increased.  If the RTÉ Tullamore transmitter's strength is 600 kilowatts and the international limit placed on RTÉ is 500 kilowatts, I do not see why we should not push for the extra 100 kilowatts.  I appreciate, from the technical advice provided to me by the Minister of State, that the impact would be minimal. However, we are talking about minimalist dimensions &mdash; the difference between someone receiving the medium wave signal in the south or south east of England clearly or unclearly.</P>
    <P>As a broadcaster, I receive letters from Irish people and others in the United Kingdom, some of whom go to extraordinary lengths to receive the RTÉ signal.  I can cite the example of a Welshman who has no contact with this country other than an association with the Brendan Shine band, a very successful Irish band from Athlone. He was a member of the Welsh agricultural society and 20 years ago he was charged with obtaining a suitable dance band for a function in Llandildes in north Wales, which is a mountainous region.  As a result of this he came in contact with members of the Irish music industry.  Consequently, a part of Ireland now beats very strongly in north Wales.</P>
    <P>As a result of his interest in Ireland he started to listen to RTÉ radio.  He had some difficulty picking up the signal so he would drive to the top of the nearest mountain &mdash; there are plenty of small mountains in north Wales as well as large ones in Snowdonia &mdash; and put his aerial outside his car so he could listen to late night radio from Dublin.</P>

      <P>That is just one example I could cite of people with no Irish blood who drive to the exact place in their area where they can pick up the strongest signal because they cannot receive it in their houses.  They go to extraordinary lengths to hear Irish radio programmes.  We should, therefore, make every effort to even minimally improve that signal. Consequently, despite the technical difficulties, I strongly urge the Government's negotiators in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications when dealing with their opposite numbers in the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent in Germany, to ask that the power of the Tullamore transmitter be increased to its maximum strength.</P>

      <P>The problems with the quality of signal received in the United Kingdom centre primarily in London and the south east.  The signal can be received fairly strongly on medium wave by those west of the Pennines and the spine of England but it starts to deteriorate east of that line.  There are over one million people who are Irish born or of Irish descent in London and the south east, which is a very significant market, but it is extremely difficult or impossible to receive the signal there.  I know from my regular visits to England and from my colleagues on all sides of the House that there is extreme difficulty in receiving a clear signal as it comes and goes.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State pointed out, one of the reasons for this is the nature of the medium wave band and the topography involved.  The signals bounce all over the place because of the physical characteristics of the land.  Also, there is a station almost everywhere on the cluttered medium wave band.</P>
      <P>A German station is being received on the RTÉ 567 medium wave signal in London and the south east.  I understand the Germans cannot do a great deal about this because it results from a unique technical phenomenon which happens at night where the medium wave signal bounces across the sky.  That is why far off medium wave signals can be received much more strongly at night than during the day.  One would have hoped that RTÉ's signal would be equally strengthened. Strangely enough it is but not consistently &mdash; it is strengthened in pockets.  For example, it can be received in Portugal, on the west coast of the Iberian peninsula, and in some parts of northern Spain.  It can also be received in the north of Europe, in the Nordic countries, because the signal comes across the North Sea.  I urge the Minister of State to reach agreement with our EU partners to increase the signal from the Tullamore transmitter to its maximum, which I understand is 600 kw.  That may help to improve the signal for the Irish abroad and those non-Irish who wish to know more about Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Daly's point on the last amendment was well made.  There is great ignorance about this country, even among our closest neighbours. We like to think we are well known internationally but we are not.  The images and impressions of Ireland diffused by the British based media tend to distort and misinterpret the country to our detriment.  The damage extends <Col N="870" /> beyond music, for example, and affects the sale of Irish products and the development of the pro-Irish view in Europe which is somewhat absent in the UK.  The question of the quality of the radio signal is bound up with wider macroeconomic arguments.</P>
    <P>Irish producers, many of whom export to the UK, use RTÉ radio to market their products on an all Ireland basis.  The corporate sector is not partitionist when it places advertising with RTÉ because it knows that the signal is widely available in Ireland and also in significant areas of Scotland, Wales and north-west England.  The commercial aspect of this issue should not be lost in the technical details.  The underlying motive is not altruistic but is based on the view that the corporate sector should be given every possible marketing opportunity.  As Senator Cregan has pointed out on a number of occasions, there is a market available which is ready and willing to have more information about Ireland via our radio network.</P>
    <P>There is an unused extra national FM frequency which Ireland had been granted under international arrangements.  This frequency is separate from that allocated to Radio Ireland and would have an impact on the current breakdown of the use of the FM band.  Raidió na Gaeltachta shares a frequency with FM3, a classical music station.  Ireland should have a national classical music station because such stations have proved commercially successful in the UK.  Because of the limited nature of its transmissions FM3 only appeals to a small minority.  If there was a full scale, commercially oriented classical music station, it would be successful.  In addition, freeing up the FM channel would provide more airtime for Raidió na Gaeltachta and might provide a facility for other broadcasts.</P>
    <P>A significant proportion of the population is unable to receive Teilifís na Gaeilge.  The chief executive of Teilifís na Gaeilge, Mr. Cathal Goan &mdash; a man for whom I have the greatest respect &mdash; said that he had underestimated the ability of viewers to receive the signal.  The station was born in controversy but has been executed to date with the greatest professionalism.  One can only admire its technological innovations and presentational style.  However, only a minute portion of the population can receive the signal. The Government and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications must address this matter.  If a national television station is to be provided at a large cost to taxpayers the least they can expect is to able to receive it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.  Senator Mooney has a wide knowledge in this field and I congratulate him on his enlightened contribution. There has been a major cock-up with Teilfís na Gaeilge and if the signal must be changed then so be it.  It is absurd that so few people can receive it.  The professionalism and expertise of the young people employed there is fabulous.  The chief executive of the station was on Pat Kenny's radio <Col N="871" /> show yesterday and explained that people need the most up to date televisions to receive the signal.  Surely that is to hold a gun to the viewers' heads, so to speak.  If those involved believe they will be able to educate people in respect of the technical details they will go out of business.  The station should be relaunched and it should be made more easily available.  People change their televisions every ten or 15 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Mooney's call to increase the signal from the Tullamore transmitter.  There are vast markets available in the UK.  If the signal can be received in Manchester and Liverpool it should be easy to make it available in Birmingham.  In north London the signal can be received in Cricklewood but not in Kilburn, an area that could provide a huge extra audience.  That is what a one mile radius in London means.  The London market is the most difficult to penetrate because of the enormous costs involved.  If one wanted to advertise during &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo;, it would cost £70,000 for a half a minute.  It is extremely difficult to promote Irish products and artists but this is an ideal opportunity to address that problem.  Senator Cregan said that perhaps this matter should be dealt with by a different Minister.  I have confidence in the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, and I am sure he will bring our concerns to the attention of the appropriate Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not concur with Senator Mooney's views about the classical music station FM3, which has a popular rating of 2 per cent.  Country music is the most popular in the western world.  Places like Drumlish and Strokestown produce Irish artists who employ a number of people but who do not ask for money from the State.  These artists are not supported by RTÉ, 98FM or 104FM, which have been given licences under the legislation passed in this House.  This is an abuse of the airwaves which the Minister should not allow to continue.  Producers, presenters and everyone associated with RTÉ television deserve praise for the support they give Irish artists.  However, RTÉ radio only gives them 25 per cent air time which is appalling.  This is of no use to an industry which wants to increase employment.  The airwaves are the music industry's most important asset. However, they are being abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cregan mentioned &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo;.  Five or six years ago Irish dancing was not seen as cool or modern.  However, it is now highly fashionable among young people because of the success of &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo;.  Standing ovations of 15 and 20 minutes have been given throughout the world for the best performance ever seen on stage.  If that can bring tourists into Ireland and generate developments in our capital city, surely we could do even more if we set up a wave band which <Col N="872" /> could be received in Germany, Australia, America and Canada.  This would be a great asset for the Government and it would help to create employment.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister accepts this amendment.</P>

      <P>I have been an admirer of Senator Mooney for many years, even when I did not know him.  I admire him even more today for his skill, expertise and knowledge of this subject. However, I criticise his amendment, which states that the &ldquo;Minister shall have regard to the quality of reception of radio frequencies allocated under international conventions&rdquo;, because it is too mild.</P>
      <P>I was not aware until recently of the huge opportunities presented by radio.  We know how Ireland benefited during the past couple of years from the Eurovision Song Contest.  For the first time, people heard Irish music and saw what was happening on their televisions and they then decided to visit this country.  We lose out if we do not pursue the opportunity to advertise Ireland across Europe and further afield.  I was not aware of the opportunity presented by the 600 kilowatt station in Tullamore.  We have markets for food and other exports, but we also have a market for tourism.  It is not necessarily RTÉ's job to promote this market.  I got the impression from the Minister that there would not be any opposition if someone wanted to invest in this field.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Mooney's comments.  I admire his ability to send a message from Ireland to many of our emigrants, particularly in Britain. He has done so over the past number of years.  It is a shame that people who should hear that message are unable to do so.  It is also a shame that we cannot send that message to those who are not from Ireland.  I urge the Minister to take this into account and ensure that the message is heard.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister can give me some information about the new broadcasting Bill because some of the issues we are discussing may be covered in it.  He already said it was being discussed in different Departments.  My understanding was that this Bill would be before the House before the end of this year.  If that is not true, perhaps the Minister could tell us when it will be introduced because we have important issues to raise with the Departments, such as the funding of local radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Teilifís na Gaeilge reminds me of the words of Richie Kavanagh's song &mdash;&ldquo;aon focal, dhá focal, trí focal eile, and I not knowing no focal at all&rdquo;.  Many people are anxious to tune into Teilifís na Gaeilge but no one can find it.  A person from County Clare telephoned Raidió na Gaeltachta a few days ago to say he had attached his aerial to a nail in the attic and he was getting excellent reception from Teilifís na Gaeilge.  The Minister or the authorities in Teilifís na Gaeilge must conduct a national information campaign to <Col N="873" /> tell people how to tune into Teilifís na Gaeilge. People with expensive equipment have endeavoured to find it without success and special aerials are needed in some cases.  There is widespread lack of knowledge about how to tune into the station.  This must be rectified because many people would tune into Teilifís na Gaeilge if they could find it.</P>
    <P>In supporting Senator Mooney's amendment, I question the availability of radio frequencies in Northern Ireland.  About a year ago, we had a fairly long discussion about the difficulty receiving signals from here in Northern Ireland. At the time it was partly seen as a political problem.  My understanding is that, arising from the discussions that took place, not only in the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs but also at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in Dublin Castle, some advance was made on the political problems in Northern Ireland about getting access to the signals from here.  Perhaps the Minister of State can enlighten us as to whether there has been any improvement since the matter was raised a year ago.</P>
    <P>The second matter I want to raise concerns the internal reception of signals on medium wave and FM.  In the early days of radio there was a transmitter in Athlone which could be picked up on 567 metres.  There is now an urgent necessity for RTÉ or the Minister to identify signals more with regions and particular towns.  When I travel from west Clare to Dublin I have to change wavelengths three times from 88.8 to 88.9 and 89.1.  It is most confusing, and I venture to suggest that people endeavouring to change car radio bands are a traffic hazard.  This is happening everywhere.</P>
    <P>If you try to get a radio signal in the southeast you do not know where to tune.  Local radio stations are on the FM band and advertise their wavebands locally but the national bands needs to be identified with regions rather than wavelengths.  It would be far easier for people to receive signals if the radio frequency was identified with Athlone, Tullamore, Cork or west Clare.  The Minister of State should examine this matter which might be easy to resolve.</P>
    <P>The <i>RTÉ Guide</i> could help by printing a map which would make it easier for listeners than reading technical terminology such as kilowatts and other wavebands.  That is not a major issue, however.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Daly mentioned the different frequencies of radio programmes.  When I travel from Cork to Dublin I have to change the frequency by the time I get to Watergrasshill which is only 11 miles from Cork.  At Fermoy I have to change the frequency again but beyond Fermoy I have to go back to the frequency I used in Watergrasshill.  If that problem exists within an 11 mile radius of Cork city, what must the problem be in trying to broadcast such signals to Britain when we cannot sort out our own difficulties?  I place the blame totally on the RTÉ <Col N="874" /> Authority which is responsible and must provide answers.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Cassidy, I was listening to &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; concerning the reception of Teilifís na Gaeilge in Connemara.  I cannot believe that six weeks ago I was listening to something being discussed in terms of such commitment.  They said there would be no problem getting the programmes out to people who wanted to see them.  There are some excellent programmes on Teilifís na Gaeilge.  I support the Irish language and like to think I could learn from it but, unfortunately, I cannot receive it on any of my three television sets.  Can the Minister of State make it clear who is responsible for this?  The Minister has given a commitment on these amendments and he is keen to enhance RTÉ and the promotion of Irish generally.  Senator Cassidy is right to ask when will we tell the RTÉ Authority that it has a responsibility to promote Ireland and Irish culture, yet nobody is answerable.</P>
      <P>We have spent in the region of £16 million on Teilifís na Gaeilge which will cost £10 million per year to run, yet nobody can explain why no one can receive the signal.  Two months ago when Teilifís na Gaeilge was first promoted I was under the impression it had no problem with sponsorship, but yesterday the person in charge readily admitted there is a massive problem because it is not getting sponsorship.  If that can happen within a short two month period, is anybody really answerable for the taxpayers' money?</P>
      <P>Can anyone say why RTÉ radio can be received in parts of London and Cork but not in other areas?  Are we so sophisticated as regards high technology that one does not have to answer these questions?  People who suggest that we should look at blank television screens just to hear a voice are not living in the real world.</P>
      <P>I am talking about promoting Ireland and, as other Senators have said, the opportunities are there.  We have heard much about the 44 million people of Irish descent in America but we do not have to go that far.  We only have to look across 55 miles of water to see the opportunities in Britain where people want to listen to Irish programmes.  We are situated a short distance from Donnybrook but nobody is answerable.  We have a right to answers from the Authority if we give RTÉ the licence fees every year.  At present someone can come to your door to demand whether you have paid your television licence, even if you cannot receive a proper signal.</P>
      <P>Someone must answer for what is happening in Connemara.  We were told to erect different aerials but that is not easy because planning permission is required.  I do not want to see the country covered in aerials once more while we grant licences to supply cable television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people can receive Teilifís na Gaeilge using only a nail while others cannot receive it using the best television sets.  Perhaps they forgot to tell everybody they need new TV sets because <Col N="875" /> the old ones will not work.  We have spent £16 million setting up Teilifís na Gaeilge plus £10 million a year to run it, but it will probably cost £15 million a year if there are no new sponsors. It is going nowhere.  It is farce and I am not prepared to accept that.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of this debate we had better leave the question of planning permission to one side because it could lead us into controversy.  We have covered much ground which is related in some ways to the amendment. I have been provoked to intervene by my good friend, Senator Cassidy, who referred to classical music.  It will come as no surprise that, as someone who comes from a minority party, I will spring to the defence of minorities.  Even if its audience is only 2 per cent, FM3 is an excellent station and does a good job.  There is an audience for such material and I think that audience should be catered for.</P>

People in France would laugh if the national radio could not be heard in Bordeaux or Strasbourg.  The same argument applies to Germany.  Therefore, It is incomprehensible that we do not have adequate coverage in Ireland.  What Senator Daly says about the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is correct.  When parity of esteem was discussed, it was suggested that, if it were to operate properly, people in Northern Ireland who wished to receive signals from RTÉ should be able to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I will first deal with the amendment before dealing with the points raised.  Senator Mooney tabled this amendment on Committee Stage and I understand his concern involves the Irish diaspora.  He referred to the Irish in Britain and Northern Ireland, in particular.  The proposed amendment is to section 3 of the Bill and would insert a new subsection to the effect that &ldquo;The Minister shall have regard to the quality of reception of radio frequencies allocated under international conventions.&rdquo;.  With respect to the Senator's proposal, a Minister, in negotiating for a share of the radio spectrum at international fora, would be unlikely to do other than &ldquo;have regard to the quality of reception&rdquo;, apart from the other technical considerations for which he or she must cater.</P>
      <P>The central purpose of international agreements relating to the frequency is to optimise the use of a scarce resource, minimise interference and maximise reception quality for all signatories and members.  These three points, among others, constitute basic good frequency management principles.  Section 3(9) already states that the Minister must have regard to good frequency management in giving directions to the director.</P>
      <P>In the event that Senators are concerned about anecdotal instances of foreign stations being received in Ireland, RTÉ is not easily heard abroad.  Other European countries are more heavily populated and have more highly developed networks.  This means that the potential for overspill of an Irish frequency into these countries is reduced because of local use and signal strength.  The same is not true in Ireland because we do not have the same requirement for capacity.  The proposed amendment appears to duplicate subsection (9) and is, therefore, unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cassidy and others raised the issue of Teilifís na Gaelige.  Like Senator Cregan, I have a daughter who is a whizz kid with electronics but <Col N="877" /> we cannot receive the Teilifís na Gaeilge signal in my house.  I contacted the people from whom we receive our television signal to no avail.  I take on board the concerns expressed and I will convey the message of this House to the RTÉ Authority, which is responsible for the quality of reception. I will deal with the matter on foot of this debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly inquired about the broadcasting Bill which has been circulated to Departments for observations.  As a former Minister, he is aware of the circuit it must follow.  The Bill, with the observations and a response to them from the Departments, will be placed before the Government for decision.  It will then be published and proceed through Parliament.  The Government and Opposition Whips will decide on the speed of that process.  I am not in a position to provide a timetable in this regard but the procedure outlined must be followed.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised the issue of radio bands and the necessity to retune one's car radio when travelling throughout the country.  I drive a relatively modest car, for which I have almost paid, that has a radio with an automatic tuning system.</P>

This has been successful and will continue in the future.  The Department of Foreign Affairs deals with the political aspect and I am not in a position to comment in that regard.  I hope I have responded to the main points raised by Senators.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for addressing the points raised.  I also thank Senator Quinn for his gracious remarks which are deeply appreciated.  Companies such as that presided over by the Senator spend significant sums of money as part of their annual sales budget attempting to advertise their products to the wider public.  I am sure that, because of significantly increased travel between Britain and Ireland, it is in the interest of companies such as Senator Quinn's, which are national players, to obtain access to a strong radio signal to get their message across to the Irish community in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> I am glad the Minister of State clarified the position about varying signal strengths, to which Senator Cregan referred.  I am impressed that the Minister of State has access to a radio with an automatic tuning system.  Such systems form part of the ongoing technological developments to which I referred.  I believe this type of radio system will be standard in all new cars in the near future.  Most people listen to radio stations on the FM band because it provides a clearer and less cluttered signal than medium wave and, for that reason, the best way to listen to music is on the FM band, not the medium wave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Senator's point.  I concur with Senator Daly's well measured contribution.  I suggest that, when the Minister of State conveys our remarks to the RTÉ Authority, he might also include Senator Daly's proposal that the <i>RTÉ Guide</i> should contain a frequency map rather than the current nondescript column that provides details of frequencies and megahertz.  I will not try to explain these frequencies because I do not fully understand them.</P>
      <P>The <i>RTÉ Guide</i> should adopt the same policy as Eircell and include a map outlining the parameters of transmission regions.  The Minister should raise this matter with the RTÉ Authority and ask it to be more user friendly.  If this were done Senator Cregan and others would know where the signal was strongest.  I hope all of us in this House will end up with a search button on our radios as the Minister has, it is becoming the norm.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point about the ability of people to tune into Teilifís na Gaeilge.  How many Senators get the numbers 8888 flashing continuously when they switch on their video recorders?  This means that the recorder is not tuned.  Most adults do not know how to tune their video recorders and usually ask their children to do it.  No one should feel embarrassed about this, it is quite a technical operation and children are better at it because they are more computer literate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a serious underestimation by the planners in Teilifís na Gaeilge when they assumed that people would have no difficulty tuning in.  They believed that all they had to do was put an advertisement in the newspaper saying &ldquo;you can pick us up on channel 65&rdquo;.  People did not understand the advertisement because they did not have 65 channels.  In fact, channel 65 is a technical term for the signal.  Teilifís na Gaeilge needs to get its act together.  It has to get back to basics and give people detailed advice on how to receive the signal.  It is extraordinary that with the amount of money being spent on the service they seriously underestimated this basic fact.  They assumed that because people were watching existing channels it would be a simple matter for them to tune in an additional channel.  It is an unmitigated public relations disaster for Teilifís <Col N="879" /> na Gaeilge and I am sad about this because it is an excellent station.  Teilifís na Gaeilge needs to move quickly on this issue because it will be overwhelmed by the new cable and satellite channels.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is in correspondence with the RTÉ Authority would he request that the station accelerates its conversion programme of the existing transmission network?  For example, the Truskmore transmitter in County Sligo cannot transmit the Teilifís na Gaeilge signal because it is on VHF.  The signal in the midlands comes from the UHF transmitter at Cairnhill, County Longford.  According to the Minister's technical staff, RTÉ is currently embarking on a conversion programme for all its transmitters but this programme is progressing at a snail's pace.  It could be years before the entire network is converted and capable of transmitting Teilifís na Gaeilge's UHF signal.</P>
    <P>RTÉ should be encouraged to purchase equity in existing local radio stations in the UK.  This would allow it to retransmit many of the its current programmes.  RTÉ is in negotiations with an Irishman based in London who has applied for one of the last remaining FM signals being tendered for.  RTÉ has taken equity in this company which stands an excellent chance of being granted the licence.  They are up against strong competition from people such as Richard Branson.  This is RTÉ's first initiative of this kind in radio.  It is an equity shareholder in the new Tara TV which is currently transmitting Irish television programmes via a number of cable companies throughout the UK.  Hopefully this will rapidly expand and Irish people living in Britain should contact their cable operators and inform them that they can receive Irish television programmes by buying into the Tara TV network. I urge people to do so.</P>
    <P>As a matter of policy, the Government should encourage RTÉ to continue down the road of acquiring equity in local radio stations in the UK. This is not an unusual development.  It is already happening with Radio Ireland whose equity base has changed since the licence was granted six months ago.  Scottish Radio, one of the unsuccessful tenderers, now has a significant equity holding in Radio Ireland.  Senators will be aware of the ongoing difficulties experienced by TV3, the independent national television channel. Ulster Television took a significant equity in TV3 but sadly they have withdrawn.  This was a bitter blow to the station.  Cross-fertilisation between broadcasters, particularly in the private sector, is not new.  As the State owned broadcasting company, RTÉ should be encouraged to take equity in local UK radio stations as a means of transmitting Irish programmes to Irish audiences living there.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan's point about the variation in signal quality raises the point that RTÉ Radio 1 has been losing significant numbers of listeners <Col N="880" /> over the last two to three years.  This is a cause for concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>People are fed up changing the frequency every half hour as they are travelling around the country.  They find it much easier to leave their radio fixed on a local station.  Because of the topography of this country, most local radio stations can be picked up across a wide area.  Highland Radio is, sadly, one of the few excellent local radio stations that cannot be heard to an appreciable degree outside its franchise area.  We cannot pick it up in County Leitrim. Conversely, I can receive Radio 3 and the Dublin stations.  This is because the terrain is flat and any stations transmitting into it can be picked up across the country, beyond their franchise areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his correspondence with the RTÉ Authority, might ask them to seriously address this question of FM access because of the possible loss of listeners.  Perhaps I have gone into more detail than I originally intended but this is one of the final opportunities I will have to discuss these technical matters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of competition and the desirability of promoted competition in telecommunications services was raised by Senator Quinn on Committee Stage.  I believe that other areas, in particular the transposition of EU directives into <Col N="881" /> national law, will address this matter.  However, if this is not so and the issue remains unaddressed, my Department is already looking at other possible ways of remedying any possible gap in what will be the functions or the responsibilities of the director after this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>One such possibility is to make an order under this Bill, after it has been enacted, to transfer a function to the director in relation to competition. Such an order might oblige the director to favour more rather than less competition wherever that is possible.  Of course he could only do so where it was also in compliance with EU directives, national law and Government policy in this area.</P>

      <P>I have a message to read to the Seanad.  I am directed by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to relay the following message to Seanad Éireann:</P>
      <P>To allow the enactment of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, as a matter of Government policy. The Minister fully supports this policy and wishes to see all Stages taken to a conclusion today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised on the Order of Business.  Concern was expressed because of remarks attributed to the newly appointed Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications as regards the main subject matter of this Bill, the strategic alliance.  There was an inference that he might look at this legislation.  The Opposition felt that some space was needed to clarify the position and the Leader of the House was amenable to that point of view.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State indicated at the outset of the debate that he was awaiting a letter of clarification which Senator Cregan read.  This short paragraph, which effectively confirms a Minister's responsibility in the collective responsibility context, is technically correct.  It is interesting that it was signed by the Secretary of the Department rather than by the Minister, which may be convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about this matter.  I am uncertain whether we should proceed with Final Stage until the Minister comes into the House.  I do not intend any disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, who also took this debate in the other House.  He has been magnaminous, co-operative and responsive but a new Minister has been appointed.  The former Minister, Deputy Lowry, was closely identified with this legislation, specifically the establishment of a strategic alliance which will have medium to long-term effects on our telecommunications industry. Irrespective of the collective responsibility <Col N="882" /> enjoyed at Cabinet in relation to Government policy, if a Minister brings their own ethos to a Department and its implementation of policy, perhaps this House and this country might be better served.  This Bill might be strengthened if the Minister comes into the House and makes a statement on the issue.</P>

That was why there was discussion as to whether we would take Final Stage today.  The final decision on the Bill is made after Report Stage.  Having heard the letter from the Minister which Senator Cregan read out, it seems that matter is not of concern any more.  The Minister appears to support this Bill.  If we are to speak about this matter we should do so on Final Stage, which should be taken now.  We may vote against it but it should be taken now.</P>

      <Col N="883" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>My point has already been made by Senator Mooney.  I refer to what occurred on the Order of Business this morning.  The contention from this side is that there was some question as to whether the incoming Minister was committed in the same way as his predecessor to the sale of a 20 per cent stake in Telecom to KPN-Telia.  We wanted a delay between Report and Final Stages of the Bill to clear up that confusion.  What Senator Cregan has said to us has cleared up the confusion as to the Government's commitment to the issue.</P>
      <P>There is, however, an outstanding matter which arises from the Order of Business.  Senator Manning affirmed on the Order of Business that the Government was committed to the Bill.  When he was asked about Luas he said we could debate the matter.  The inference is that the Government's commitment to Luas is not the same as the Government's commitment to this Bill.  There is a certain inconsistency in the replies given to us this morning.  I took it that if we could debate Luas it was not Government policy but that it was Government policy to proceed with all stages of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Dukes, has a different emphasis on the question of Luas.  The question arose as to whether he had a different emphasis on this matter as well.  I am prepared to accept that this is a Government decision and that it is determined to see this Bill through.  That does not necessarily mean that we agree with the Bill or will vote for its passage when we are asked to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to record my appreciation to the Minister for his commitment to introduce legislation at a later stage to cover one of the areas about which I was concerned.  My concerns in two of the amendments I tabled on Committee Stage have been answered in a manner which I am happy to accept.  They deal with the need for the regulator, or the director, to be proactive and to seek out competitors.  We had not included the customer in this Bill and I am concerned about that.</P>
      <P>I was not concerned about the main thrust of the director's functions which were to ensure fairness between the various parties and competitors.  I understood that point and had no problem with it.  This Bill ensures fairness between the various competitors in the market place.  However, it did not encourage the director to seek more competition in the interests of the customer.  The Minister has read out a statement which answers my concern in that regard.  I gather that he intends to introduce provisions to this effect either by way of order or perhaps at a later stage in omnibus legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> This Bill covers one aspect of what is required but many other aspects are required.  The Department spoke about these as early as last January and we were promised omnibus legislation in 1996 but it has not yet appeared.  We are taking the Government on trust when it says that this is only part of omnibus legislation.  It is very important that we use this opportunity and do not to sit back and wait for that legislation. The various regulators that will come into being, forced on us less by an enthusiastic Government than by the European Commission which is working towards fewer monopolies and more competition, will require omnibus legislation.  I ask the Minister to make sure it happens soon. The Minister's statement puts my mind at rest in regard to one area.</P>
    <P>I have concerns about other areas and I look forward to debating them, particularly that of the uniform tariff and the universal service obligation under which everybody in the telecommunications industry will be placed.  We must see these issues not as threats to Telecom Éireann but as opportunities for its customers and those of the other bodies that will compete with Telecom Éireann in the years ahead.  I thank the Minister and look forward to even more action in the future.</P>

In fairness to the Minister, he said he was in sympathy with much of the sentiment behind the amendments.

      <P>I heard the interview that gave rise to the newspaper speculation as to the content of the interview with Deputy Dukes.  If the interview had been published there would be no controversy at all; the interpretations of the interview in the newspaper gave rise to disquiet. We have been in contact with the Minister and his statement is absolutely clear.  He supports the Bill.  The Bill is Government policy.  Commercial decisions have been taken and this Bill is needed to implement them.  We are talking about £500 <Col N="885" /> million of people's money in one form or another. It is very important that we do this business in the way we agreed.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their interest in and debate of the many crucial policy questions which underpinned the legislation.  The Government's view is that to build a first class telecommunications economy we must also aim to construct a first class national operator by providing a legislative foundation for the Telecom Éireann strategic alliance.  The Bill is a vital step in that direction.</P>
      <P>The alliance is fundamentally about strategic benefits which will in turn create a real opportunity for Telecom Éireann to develop and prosper in a competitive market.  In KPN/Telia, Telecom Éireann has found a consortium with a genuine long-term commitment to the Irish market.  These companies have the strategic and financial resources and the wealth of experience required to bring major benefits to all Irish telecommunications customers.</P>
      <P>No developments in the alliance can be achieved without all parties being prepared to change.  The Bill has addressed the changes required in a realistic manner and has done so in a way which is sensitive to the interests of all parties.  I am especially pleased that it has been possible to address the key issues involved in restructuring the board of the company with full regard to the views of Deputies and Senators, as well those of the semi-State employees and worker directors.</P>
      <P>The Bill's provisions relating to the establishment of the office of Director of Telecommunications Regulation and for the transfer to the director of the functions of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications relating to the regulations of telecommunications, radio communications and cable television sectors are also of far reaching significance to the Irish economy.  These provisions reflect the fact that the Bill marks the beginning, and not the end, of a process by which the telecommunications sector in Ireland shapes up to meet the new competitive environment head on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw attention again to my response to the amendments put forward by Senator Quinn. These themes will be treated comprehensively in forthcoming legislation on multi-sectoral regulation and on telecommunications.  On enactment of the Bill, the Government will move speedily to put in place arrangements for effective regulation of the sector.  These include physical arrangements relating to the establishment of the office, as well as practical issues such as the appointment of a first director. In enacting this Bill, by paving the way for the conclusion of the strategic alliance and by putting in place the necessary steps for the establishment of independent regulatory arrangements, the Oireachtas will demonstrate its commitment to getting on with the job of moving Irish <Col N="886" /> telecommunications into the 21st century with confidence.</P>
    <P>I thank the parliamentary draftsman and officials of the Office of the Attorney General who provided expert assistance in all aspects of the drafting of the Bill.

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address this House on the subject of Economic and Monetary Union. As today marks the first Seanad debate on this subject in recent times I will begin by briefly setting out the background to economic and monetary union, what it involves, the stages in it, the criteria for economic and monetary union and Ireland's performance against them, and the institutional aspects of economic and monetary union.  I will then outline the opportunities and challenges that economic and monetary union will present for Ireland and give a short summary of the recent ESRI report, <i>Economic Implications for Ireland of EMU</i>, before turning to the preparations we need to make for it and the transition to the single currency, which will be called the Euro.  I apologise in advance for the relative length of this speech but I have decided to treat the Seanad with the respect and seniority it deserves.  I will outline for the House the work on economic and monetary union which has been going on under the Irish Presidency at the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers of the European Union or ECOFIN and the prospects for next week's special ECOFIN meeting and the Summit of EU Heads of State and Government in Dublin on 13 and 14 December.</P>
      <P>To begin, economic and monetary union is not a new idea&mdash;it goes back to at least 1970.  While its fortunes have varied since, the Community has never lost sight of it as a goal.  The European Monetary System and its exchange rate mechanism, which were set up in 1979, were intended to be a move towards economic and monetary union and the single market programme of the late 1980s gave fresh impetus to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Delors committee report of 1989, together with the European Commission report <i>One Market, One Money</i> of 1990, laid the foundations for the provisions on economic and monetary union that are set out in Articles 102a to 109m of the Treaty on European Union, otherwise known as the Maastricht Treaty.  The treaty received widespread support in Ireland and the leaders of the four main political parties issued a joint statement urging a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum on it held in June 1992.  The treaty was endorsed <Col N="888" /> by a substantial majority; just under 70 per cent of those who voted were in favour of it.</P>
    <P>EMU essentially involves three inter-related elements: the establishment of a single currency among participating member states; the creation of a single monetary policy implemented by an independent European Central Bank; and closer co-ordination of the economic and budgetary policies of participating member states.</P>
    <P>The treaty envisages economic and monetary union being approached in three stages.  Stage one involved the completion of the single market and closer co-ordination of the economic and monetary policies of member states.  Stage two began on 1 January 1994 and involves intensifying the co-ordination of member states' economic and monetary policies.  This is based on multilateral surveillance of policies within the context of broad guidelines laid down by the Council of Ministers.  Most importantly, stage two brought into being the excessive deficit procedure under Article 104c of the treaty.  This requires an annual examination of each member state's budgetary performance to see if it meets the deficit rules laid down in the treaty, with the Council making a recommendation for ending the excessive deficit of any member state which does not meet them.  An important aspect of stage two is the setting up of the European Monetary Institute or EMI.  The EMI is the forerunner of the European Central Bank or ECB and has, <i>inter alia</i>, the task of indicating, by the end of 1996, the regulatory, organisational and logistical framework for the ECB to perform its tasks.</P>
    <P>Stage three is the final stage of economic and monetary union.  The Madrid European Council in December 1995 confirmed that stage three would begin on 1 January 1999, which is the latest date envisaged in the treaty.  The ECB will have been established before then.  On that date, the exchange rates of the currencies of participating member states will be irrevocably locked, the single currency, the Euro, will come into being and the ECB will begin operation of the single monetary policy in respect of it.</P>
    <P>In early 1998, the European Council will decide which member states meet the criteria for moving to stage three.  In fact, the treaty requires that there be such an examination by the end of this year but I will deal with this later.  Before the European Council makes its decision in 1998, the Commission and the EMI must report to the ECOFIN Council on the performance of each member state against various criteria.  The emphasis in the reports will be on the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence.  ECOFIN will then assess whether each member state fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency and will recommend its findings to the European Council.  The European Parliament will be consulted and will forward its opinion to the European Council also.</P>
    <P>The criteria for economic and monetary union relate, first, to the avoidance of an excessive <Col N="889" /> budget deficit, meaning that the general Government deficit must not exceed 3 per cent of GDP unless it has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level close to 3 per cent, or unless the excess over 3 per cent is small, exceptional and temporary and, second, the ratio of general Government debt to GDP must be below 60 per cent or, if above, must be sufficiently diminishing and approaching 60 per cent at a satisfactory pace.</P>
    <P>There are also criteria in relation to inflation, interest rates and currency stability.  These are as follows: average inflation must not exceed by over 1.5 per cent that of the three best performing member states; the average nominal long-term interest rate must not exceed by more than 2 per cent that of the three best performing member states in terms of price stability; the member state's currency must, without severe tensions, have respected the normal fluctuation margins of the ERM for two years before the examination and its central rate must not have been devalued on the member state's initiative against any other member state's currency in that period.  The phrase &ldquo;normal fluctuation margins&rdquo; has not been defined since the widening of the ERM bands in August 1993.  The Commission and EMI are required to report on other matters too. These include the compatibility between central bank legislation and the treaty obligation that the central banks of economic and monetary union members be independent, and the situation and development of the balance of payments on current account.</P>
    <P>Ireland's performance on the convergence criteria is excellent and the Government is determined to maintain that record which has been shared by a number of Governments to which I pay tribute.  The Irish pound trades comfortably in the ERM, our rate of inflation has been consistently low and our average nominal long-term interest rate is within the required ceiling.</P>
    <P>As regards the fiscal criteria, our performance is among the very best in the EU.  Our general Government deficit has been below 3 per cent of GDP every year since and including 1989, while our debt to GDP ratio has fallen from over 116 per cent in 1987 to around 81 per cent at the end of last year and is expected to be around 75 per cent at the end of 1996.  Accordingly, though the ratio is above the treaty reference value of 60 per cent, it is nevertheless &ldquo;sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace&rdquo;.  On the basis of our performance on the fiscal criteria, the European Commission has judged that we do not have an excessive deficit as defined in Article 104(c) of the treaty.</P>
    <P>The excessive deficit procedure in the treaty was implemented in 1994 for the first time, and this judgment was made in respect of Ireland in 1994, 1995 and 1996.  Ireland is one of only two member states &mdash; the other is Luxembourg &mdash; which has never been judged to have an excessive <Col N="890" /> deficit.  The Government's programme contains a clear commitment to keep our general Government deficit comfortably below 3 per cent of GDP, an objective which, given continued growth, will ensure that our debt to GDP ratio continues to decline.  Accordingly, we should continue to escape censure under the excessive deficit procedure.  Our performance in 1997 will be particularly important, since 1997 outturns will be used in arriving at the European Council decision in early 1998 on which member states qualify for economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Keeping to the Maastricht criteria is vital from an economic and monetary union point of view, but in fact they make good sense in economic terms also.  High Government borrowing has not proved to be a sound foundation for growth and jobs in the past and it would not provide a sound foundation for them in the future either.  In the Irish case particularly, we have seen the negative effects of high borrowing, and it is no mere coincidence that we are achieving both high economic growth and high employment growth at a time when we have successfully demonstrated our ability to keep our deficit low and our debt ratio falling.</P>
    <P>Ireland's position otherwise in relation to economic and monetary union is also favourable. We have growth levels much higher than the EU average, a balance of payments surplus and significant employment growth.  In addition, the productive capacity of our economy is being strengthened significantly by investments being made under the Community support framework in particular, a factor which should further enhance our prospects.  Furthermore, the age profile of our population is significantly more favourable than that in some of the other member states, and this should prove an advantage to us in the budgetary sphere over the coming years.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that I do not propose to go into detail about the performance and prospects of other member states.  It is common knowledge that the majority of member states meet the inflation and interest rate criteria and that it is the debt and deficit criteria which have been causing the greatest difficulty. However, I would point out that as economic and monetary union draws nearer, recent times have seen very determined efforts by member states to bring their public finances into line, particularly as regards their 1997 budgets, and this shows the depth of their commitment to the economic and monetary union project.  It has also helped to reinforce the conviction, generated by the Madrid European Council and sustained by developments at EU level since, that economic and monetary union will happen, on time, on 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of sound public finances, the House will be aware that late last Autumn, Germany tabled proposals aimed at further ensuring that budgetary stability is maintained after the formation of economic and monetary union.  Their rationale is that, in <Col N="891" /> favourable times, member states should aim for budget deficits considerably below 3 per cent in order to ensure that they can reliably keep under the 3 per cent ceiling over the course of a normal economic cycle.  I will set out later the current state of the discussions in this area.</P>
    <P>I have described the foundation of price stability and fiscal responsibility on which the economic and monetary union project rests; we should now look at the building which will be erected on these foundations.  Economic and monetary union essentially involves three elements: the establishment of the single currency; the creation of a single monetary policy implemented by an independent European central bank, the ECB; and closer co-ordination of member states' economic and budgetary policies.  I will take these three elements in turn.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the single currency, the Euro, will take place on 1 January 1999.  Under Article 109L4 of the treaty, at that date the Council will adopt the conversion rates at which the currencies of the member states participating in economic and monetary union will be irrevocably fixed against each other and against the Euro, and it will become a currency in its own right.  Euro notes and coins will be introduced into circulation by 1 January 2002 at the latest, and national currencies will have been completely withdrawn from circulation by 1 July 2002 at the latest.</P>
    <P>Article 4(a) of the Maastricht treaty provides for the establishment of a European system of central banks (ESCB) and a European central bank (ECB) to operate the single monetary policy of the single currency.  They will be set up in 1998 after the Council decision on which member states qualify for economic and monetary union.  The primary objective of the ESCB, which will comprise the ECB and the central banks of the member states, will be to maintain price stability.  Without prejudice to this objective, the ESCB will support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the Community's objectives.  Briefly, these are to promote sustainable and non inflationary growth, a high level of employment and social protection, and economic and social cohesion and solidarity among the member states.</P>
    <P>Article 109 of the treaty gives the Council of Ministers a clear role in the setting of exchange rate policy.  It provides that the Council may, acting unanimously on a recommendation from the ECB or from the Commission, conclude formal agreements on an exchange rate system for the Euro in relation to non-Community currencies, having first consulted the ECB in an endeavour to reach a consensus consistent with the objective of price stability, and having also consulted the European Parliament.  In the absence of such an exchange rate system in relation to one or more non-Community currencies, the Council, acting by a qualified <Col N="892" /> majority, either on a recommendation from the Commission and after consulting the ECB or an a recommendation from the ECB, may formulate general orientations for exchange rate policy in relation to these currencies.  These general orientations shall be without prejudice to the primary objective of the ESCB to maintain price stability.</P>
    <P>The President of the Council of Ministers and a member of the European Commission may participate at meetings of the governing council of the ECB, although they will not have the right to vote, and the President of the Council may submit a motion for deliberation to the governing council.  There will also be a role for the president of the ECB in relation to meetings of the Council of Ministers &mdash; ECOFIN &mdash; in that he or she will be invited to participate in such meetings when the Council is discussing matters relating to the ECB's tasks and objectives.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for accountability of the ECB.  It must present an annual report on the activities of the ESCB to the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission as well as to the European Council.  The report must cover the monetary policy of both the previous and the current year. The ECB's president will present this report to the Council and to the European Parliament, which may hold a general debate on it.</P>
    <P>The ECB president and the other members of the executive board may be heard by the competent committees of the European Parliament, either on their own initiative or at Parliament's request.  The ECB and the ESCB will be independent in implementing their tasks within these arrangements.  Article 107 provides that neither the ECB nor a national central bank shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies or from the Government of any member state.  Overall, these arrangements are very similar to those currently operating in Ireland where the Central Bank is independent but must operate within a framework for exchange rate policy set down by the Minister for Finance and present an annual report to the Oireachtas.  The current governor agreed to initiate the practice of appearing before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  Tragically, that was not the case in the past.</P>
    <P>The last element of full economic and monetary union is closer co-ordination of the economic and budgetary policies of the member states.  Apart from the ongoing process of multilateral surveillance of the consistency of member states' economic policies with the broad economic guidelines of the Union, the key point here concerns the excessive deficit procedure. The treaty provides that from the start of stage three, the procedure will be considerably strengthened.</P>
    <P>In stage three, if a member state participating in economic and monetary union has an excessive deficit and persists in failing to put into practice <Col N="893" /> the Council's recommendations, the Council may decide to give notice to it to take, within a specified time limit, measures for deficit reduction which the Council judges necessary to remedy the excessive deficit.  Members may wish to consider that aspect carefully because it is a slow and deliberate procedure.  If the member state fails to comply with such a Council decision, the Council may decide to apply sanctions.  It may require the member state to publish specific additional information before issuing bonds and securities.  It may invite the European Investment Bank to reconsider its lending policy towards the member state.  It may require the member state to make a non-interest bearing deposit of an appropriate size with the Community until the excessive deficit has, in the Council's view, been corrected or it may impose fines of an appropriate size.  An important point is that in making the various decisions referred to above, the vote of the member state whose deficit is at issue shall not be counted.  This is to ensure the even handed application of the procedure.</P>
    <P>I have described the process of moving towards economic and monetary union and the elements of economic and monetary union itself and it is appropriate to set out the reasons the European Union and member states set themselves the objective of achieving economic and monetary union.  The main objectives are as follows: the elimination of transaction costs and exchange rate risk for trade, tourism and investment among participating member states; final completion of the Internal Market; low and fairly uniform interest rates among participating member states; promotion of price stability, sound public finances and sustained low inflation growth in participating member states; increased attractiveness of participating member states to foreign investment and a voice in decisions about the single monetary policy of the Union.  We do not have this voice at present.  For example, when the Bundestag Council meets and decides to move its monetary policy, it quickly affects monetary and interest rate policy across the Union.</P>
    <P>Like most things in life which confer benefits, however, economic and monetary union is not without potential disadvantages.  The obvious one is that participating member states cannot devalue their currencies for any reason.  In addition, a single monetary policy will involve some pooling of sovereignty among participating member states.  This disadvantage will be felt more keenly in the larger member states.  The discretion about monetary policy enjoyed by smaller member states is considerably less.  It might be argued that the restrictions on budgetary freedom, especially the exposure to possible sanctions if an excessive deficit is not corrected in accordance with a Council notice to that end, are a disadvantage of economic and monetary union participation.  However, a number of points are important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> First, the obligation to avoid an excessive deficit, as defined in the treaty, applies from the start of stage three, irrespective of economic and monetary union participation.  Only the sanctions will be new and, in any case, failure to abide by a Council notice to correct an excessive deficit would already expose us to a suspension of Cohesion Fund aid.  Second, while nonparticipation would exclude the possibility of formal economic and monetary union sanctions for an excessive deficit, there is no doubt that financial markets would impose a penalty in the form of higher interest rates.  Third, avoiding an excessive deficit would be in our interest.  Our experience in recent years shows that keeping the deficit within the treaty parameters is in no way inimical to sustained growth in output and employment.  Indeed, keeping our deficit within the 3 per cent threshold has not precluded improvement in public services and significant progress on tax reform combined with increased employment to which I referred.</P>
    <P>The move to economic and monetary union will necessarily involve transition costs for business, public administrations and the financial institutions which may be significant in some cases.  In considering these, it is important to bear in mind that they are an investment which will yield long-term benefits for the whole economy. In the case of financial institutions there will also be an ongoing loss arising from the elimination of transaction costs and exchange rate differentials between participants.  However, this ongoing loss of revenue to the financial institutions will be an ongoing gain to traders and business and should help them to improve their performance. Healthier companies will, in turn, be of benefit to all the financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have stated that Ireland's policy is to be eligible to participate in economic and monetary union from the outset. The current Government endorses that position. Ireland has always supported the process of European integration and economic and monetary union will mark a substantial stage in that process.  Economic and monetary union will have substantial implications for Ireland.  In dealing with these, I wish to make two general points because it is vital that we do not ascribe to economic and monetary union effects that will arise anyway.</P>
    <P>First, the global economic environment is changing fast.  This process will continue and would continue even if economic and monetary union had never been considered.  It involves greater globalisation of activity, increasing intensification of competition among all countries and increasing technological change.  Second, the formation of economic and monetary union will mark a substantial change in the economic environment of the Union as a whole.  This is true for all member states, regardless of whether they join the single currency; continuation of the <i>status quo</i> is not an option for any member state. <Col N="895" /> Economic and monetary union will change things even for member states which decide not to join.</P>
    <P>From the Irish point of view, we were concerned about the implications for Ireland of economic and monetary union.  In order to get an independent view of the implications, earlier this year I commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to carry out an in-depth study of the likely economic implications of economic and monetary union for Ireland, with particular reference to employment, including different sectoral levels, in the context of various membership scenarios.  The ESRI published its report at the end of July and it has been widely circulated, including to all Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The report runs to 350 pages so there is no need to go into it in detail, especially since the report itself contains a summary chapter.  However, the ESRI said that its quantification &ldquo;indicates that Ireland can expect to benefit modestly in terms of income and employment through membership of economic and monetary union.  This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the unquantified benefits are also likely to favour economic and monetary union entry&rdquo;.  There is no doubt that economic and monetary union will involve a very significant change for Ireland in removing our ability to adjust our exchange rate, as a last resort, in the face of an economic shock.  Many people, not unnaturally, speculate on this arising in the context of a substantial depreciation of sterling.  Chapter 5 of the ESRI report considers the potential impact on Ireland of a 20 per cent fall in the value of sterling in two scenarios &mdash; with both Ireland and the UK outside economic and monetary union, and with Ireland in but the UK out.  In both cases such a fall in sterling would present problems for Ireland.  The ESRI estimates that with both countries out there would be a loss of some 16,000 jobs in Ireland while with Ireland in economic and monetary union and the UK out, the loss would rise to 28,000 jobs, a net difference of 12,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>Clearly in either case such a sterling depreciation would be unwelcome, but it is worth noting that not being in economic and monetary union would not give us total protection from a sterling fall.  Furthermore, the ESRI itself points out that it considers a 20 per cent fall to be an exceptionally large shock, chosen not because it seems at all likely but because it provided a useful test of the model used by the ESRI.  Finally, it should be borne in mind that economic and monetary union should, as a general rule, remove the interest rate problem which created such difficulties for Irish industry during the currency crisis of 1992-93.</P>
    <P>Most people think of sterling when they think of the exchange rate exposure involved in Ireland's joining the single currency and it would obviously be appropriate to say something here <Col N="896" /> about the position of the United Kingdom in relation to economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the UK has an opt out from the Maastricht Treaty provisions on economic and monetary union.  The UK Government has not yet said whether it will exercise this opt out.  It has said, however, that it would not join economic and monetary union if economic and monetary union were to be formed in 1997.  As we know, the Madrid European Council confirmed 1 January 1999 as the commencement date for economic and monetary union.  The UK has not said it will not join economic and monetary union in 1999 only that it will decide closer to the date.  Also, the UK &mdash; and Prime Minister, John Major &mdash; in particular, has never said it will never join economic and monetary union, which should be borne in mind. In short, the UK position is unclear and speculating about it on this side of the Irish Sea will not make it any clearer.  The clear priority for Ireland is to ensure that whatever happens, Ireland qualifies for economic and monetary union membership.</P>
    <P>It is time now to turn to how we should prepare for economic and monetary union.  I would emphasise, of course, that change in the Irish economy will be necessary anyway.  As I have said before, competition is intensifying throughout the world market and no country can escape from it. This would be so even if economic and monetary union had never been thought of.</P>
    <P>First, we need to make sure we continue to meet the Maastricht criteria.  In particular, we must go on keeping our general Government deficit comfortably below 3 per cent of GDP and ensuring that our debt ratio keeps falling.  This is of the first importance anyway for our own economic benefit &mdash; servicing our debt is using up resources which we could put to much better use elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Second, we also need to meet the other criteria. We are already keeping inflation low, but there is no room for complacency and a great deal of room for improvement.  The inflation criterion in the treaty is a relative one and some member states have brought their inflation to quite low levels.  Low deficits, moderate wage increases in the successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and increased competition throughout our economy will all help us to do so.  This will also, of course, help us to meet the criterion for exchange rate stability and also that for the long-term interest rate.</P>
    <P>Third, we need to improve as much as possible the working of our economy in terms of competitiveness and efficiency.  This means not just the Government; employers and employees also need to look at every aspect of their operation to see how they could be improved. Continuous improvement needs to be at the top of everyone's agenda.</P>
    <P>Finally, an aspect of our economy that will become even more important as we move towards economic and monetary union is to <Col N="897" /> improve flexibility throughout the system.  In economic and monetary union we will have to respond to shocks by means other than the traditional adjustment of the exchange rate.  We need to develop those means &mdash; essentially, this means increased flexibility on everyone's part, which I stress.</P>
    <P>We also need to make preparations at a practical level.  In the public service we have already taken a number of steps in this area.  In June 1995 my Department circulated copies of the European Commission's Green Paper on the practical preparations for the introduction of the single currency to all Departments.  In turn, each Department then made copies of the Green Paper available to the public sector agencies and bodies under its aegis.  The scenario for transition to the Euro agreed at the Madrid European Council in December last was also circulated to all Departments.</P>
    <P>Arising from this exercise, a single currency officer team &mdash; SCOT &mdash; consisting of one officer from each Department was set up in autumn 1995.  The SCOT also includes representatives from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Statistics Office and the National Treasury Management Agency.  The purpose of SCOT is to see what preparations are necessary for the introduction of the single currency and to plan for them.</P>
    <P>We have also set up an informal group representative of relevant interest groups in the private sector to advise on technical issues in the run up to the 1998 Council decision on which member states qualify for economic and monetary union.  It is expected that this group will form the nucleus of a more formal structure, like the Decimal Currency Board which oversaw the decimalisation of the Irish pound in 1971, which would need to be set up in due course to oversee the practical arrangements needed to manage transition to the single currency.</P>
    <P>Finally, next week will see the launch of a Government public information programme about economic and monetary union and the changeover to the Euro.  This will include a business awareness campaign, which will be run by Forfás in co-operation with the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the Department of Tourism and Trade and my Department.  The campaign will aim at increasing awareness of economic and monetary union and the changeover to the Euro in the business sector, especially among small and medium sized enterprises, and at helping businesses prepare themselves for it.</P>
    <P>As part of helping the public to familiarise itself with the idea of changing over to a new currency, I have arranged that next week will be a Euro Week when, for one week, supermarkets and pubs will display both euro and Irish pound prices on selected items.  The conversion rate for the Euro has not yet been fixed, of course, so the <Col N="898" /> Euro prices displayed next week will be based on a notional rate of one Euro equalling 80p. Naturally this carries no implication for what the final figure will be &mdash; it is just an average figure which, more importantly, is fairly easy to calculate.</P>
    <P>In addition, as part of our publicity campaign, we will unveil, in concert with a simultaneous unveiling in Frankfurt, the winning design for the Euro notes.  The Governor of the Central Bank on the afternoon of Friday, 13 December &mdash; I hope the connotations of that date do not apply &mdash; will unveil in the Central Bank the winning design which was selected independently and separately by the governors of the board of the European Monetary Institute, which is, as I said earlier, the forerunner of the European Central Bank.  That Friday will be the first day of the two day Heads of Government Summit meeting in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I promised to end by outlining for the House the work that has been going on in relation to economic and monetary union under the Irish Presidency.  The focus has been on three areas which were highlighted as priorities by the Madrid European Council last December.  The objective we set as Presidency was that ECOFIN would be able to present conclusions showing substantive progress to the European Council in Dublin which, as I said, will take place the week after next.  Even in advance of ECOFIN's final meeting on 12 December I can say that considerable progress has been made on the objective we set last July.</P>
    <P>The first area highlighted by Madrid concerns the monetary relationship there is to be between member states which adopt the Euro from the outset and those which do not &mdash; the question of the ins and pre-ins.  The second area concerns strengthening budgetary discipline among member states in economic and monetary union or, as I described it earlier, the &ldquo;stability pact&rdquo;. All member states now recognise the importance of such a pact or agreement for the success of the single currency.  The final area is the legal framework for the Euro.  This framework is needed to enable market participants to plan effectively for the changeover to the Euro, although certain elements are more urgent than others.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made on all three areas during our Presidency.  In Dublin in September I hosted an informal meeting of EU Finance Ministers and central bank governors to review progress and to chart the course to the December European Council.  That informal meeting was very satisfactory and the momentum it provided enabled the Commission to adopt in mid-October legislative proposals on the stability pact and the legal framework for the Euro, as well as a draft communication to Council on the relationship between participating and nonparticipating member states.</P>
    <P>As regards the latter issue, the report from ECOFIN to the Dublin European Council will <Col N="899" /> address the new exchange rate mechanism to be put in place on the formation of the single currency.  The main features of this are already known, in particular the fact that the central rates of participating currencies will be set against the Euro only, because of its anchor role and because of the goal of convergence to the Euro area. Work on the details will be put in hand after the Dublin summit, although these cannot be finalised until the European central bank is set up in 1998.</P>
    <P>ECOFIN's report to the Dublin summit will also address the arrangements for enhanced surveillance of economic policies with a view to ensuring they are conducive to the convergence essential to monetary stability.  On the budgetary discipline question, the ECOFIN Ministers have made considerable progress towards formulating the key elements of the stability pact.  There is already a consensus on many of its features.  We have agreed that member states in economic and monetary union will be obliged to submit stability programmes demonstrating a commitment to medium term objectives that will keep their deficit below the treaty reference value of 3 per cent of GDP over the course of a normal economic cycle.  There is also agreement that there should be an early warning system to help prevent excessive deficits arising.  Member states not in economic and monetary union will submit convergence programmes demonstrating their commitment to convergence oriented policies.</P>
    <P>Work has been advancing on the question of how to clarify and speed up the excessive deficit procedure in the treaty, including its enforcement aspects.  It had already been agreed that when sanctions are first imposed they will include a non-interest bearing deposit.  This would be converted into a fine after two years if the excessive deficit persisted.</P>
    <P>At the ECOFIN meeting on 2 December we agreed on the detailed specification of the sanctions.  The amount of the deposit will be made up of a fixed component equal to 0.2 per cent of GDP and a variable component equal to one tenth of the excess of the deficit over the 3 per cent reference value.  There will be an upper limit of 0.5 per cent of GDP for the annual amount of deposits.  Sanctions are aimed more at deterring excessive deficits than at punishing them and the objective is to ensure, as far as possible, that member states avoid excessive deficits altogether, thus providing a strong foundation for the Euro and creating the conditions in which low interest rates can be consistent with price stability.</P>
    <P>ECOFIN has agreed to meet again at my request on 12 December, in advance of the European Council meeting the next day, to try to resolve the few remaining issues, notably the question of the definition of when the excess of a Government deficit over the treaty reference value is to be considered &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo;.  This will not be an easy matter to resolve but I am <Col N="900" /> cautiously optimistic that it may be possible to settle it, if not at the ECOFIN meeting then at the Dublin European Council.  The basic principles of the stability pact and how it would operate would then be in place.  This would enable work to begin after the Dublin summit on enshrining the pact in secondary legislation under the treaty.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable progress on the legal framework for the Euro.  The European Commission produced two regulations in mid-October, one based on treaty Article 235 which contains the urgent provisions and the other based on Article 109L4 which contains the remaining provisions.  This latter regulation cannot be finally adopted until the member states participating in economic and monetary union have been decided.  The Irish Presidency has chaired several meetings of a Council working group on these two regulations and by dint of sheer hard work and with excellent co-operation from our partners, we have brought the Article 235 regulation to agreement and the Article 109L4 regulation very close to agreement.  The opinions of the European Parliament and the EMI on the two regulations have recently been received and these will now be examined at working group level.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier, there is a treaty procedure under which the European Council must decide before 31 December 1996 whether a majority of member states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency, whether it is appropriate for the Community to enter the third stage of economic and monetary union and, if so, to set the date for the beginning of the third stage.</P>
    <P>The European Council has already decided, in Madrid and Florence, that 1 January 1999 will be the starting date for economic and monetary union, so the outcome of this procedure is already clear.  The procedure must nevertheless be carried out.  Our aim is that the Dublin European Council will reaffirm the 1 January, 1999 commencement date for economic and monetary union and, thus, further reinforce the message that the progress to economic and monetary union is irreversible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive statement.  He has traced the development towards European integration and indicated that Ireland has always supported the process of European integration, a support respected by our partners in the EU.  The Minister also pointed out the various stages which have led to our being on the point of the successful launch of economic and monetary union with the Euro as the single currency. Fianna Fáil endorses fully the related conditions and disciplines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil was involved at every stage of the history the Minister has outlined.  I was in Government in 1972 when Ireland applied for membership of the EEC and when, despite the <Col N="901" /> opposition of the Labour Party, that application received the endorsement of the people.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for giving us the benefit of his comprehensive address.  I regret that he does not wish to further acknowledge the role of the Seanad by staying to listen to what Senators have to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will hear my contribution so that he may respond.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has led Ireland's commitment to Europe and the original drive in this regard was launched by Seán Lemass.  Fianna Fáil did so despite the vigorous opposition of the Labour Party at each stage.  Due to Fianna Fáil's consistent position and its management of the economy, particularly since 1987, Ireland is now in the position of having fulfilled the criteria for membership of economic and monetary union.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1977, I was involved in the negotiations leading to the European Monetary System.  We did that despite the opposition of the Labour Party.  When we negotiated the EMS package in Bremen in 1979, which was the foundation stone for what is now being done, there was vigorous opposition from the Labour Party &mdash; some Deputies were not in the party at that time &mdash; and the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, and myself were attacked for what we had done.  However, we earned the confidence of our partners in Europe and that is why Ireland's European involvement has been so successful.</P>
      <P>After the launch of the EMS in 1979, it was not surprising that the vigour we had always demonstrated was not shown by the Government in which the Tánaiste had his first responsibility. The Minister acknowledged that the next significant step after the launch of the EMS in 1979 was the Single Market programme of the late 1980s and, particularly, the Delors committee report of 1989.  When Fianna Fáil, who launched us into Europe and into the European Monetary System, assumed the Presidency of the European Community, it launched us into a new dimension with the preparations for the Maastricht Treaty, the Delors committee report of 1989 and the Single Market programme which followed that.  I was happy to be associated with almost all those events.  Fianna Fáil established the respect and confidence which have been so important for Ireland's success in Europe and which helped to create prospects for our young people which are now greater than they were before we launched this great European adventure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One theme in the Minister's detailed speech about the conditions, regulations, restrictions and sanctions is that we should be able to demonstrate that partners are entitled to feel <Col N="902" /> total confidence in their capacity to fulfil not only the obligations of the economic and monetary union, but to avail of its opportunities as full and vigorous partners.  One word for this is &ldquo;confidence&rdquo;.  Perhaps another phrase is &ldquo;mutual respect&rdquo; which we spent time building up with our EU partners.</P>
    <P>When we came back to power in 1987, public expenditure was out of control.  We made a decision to reduce the level of current expenditure, our budget deficit, GNP deficit ratio and inflation to create the foundation for membership of the economic and monetary union.  The Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and the Labour Party opposed us every step of the way in that disciplined adventure.  During our preparations to meet the criteria the Minister for Finance is now setting out, we were called names for reducing public expenditure and the numbers in the public service and for making many difficult decisions.  One of my colleagues, Deputy O'Hanlon, for whom I have the greatest respect and who was our front man on these occasions, was referred to as Dr. Death.  He is one of the finest men I know in public life.</P>

      <P>We were lambasted every day by the Labour Party for doing what was necessary to meet these qualifications and win our partners' confidence.  There are cycles in life and particularly in politics where those who demand the opposite now claim responsibility for good performance.  This Government is trying its best to undermine the respect and confidence we spent years building up with our partners in Europe.  If we do not enjoy that respect and confidence, the adventure, which has been exciting and successful, will be totally frustrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday in the Dáil the Tánaiste outlined not just to the Irish people but also to the European people the social and economic criteria we must meet.  He said: &ldquo;Anyone who wishes to compare the social and economic trends of the 1989-92 period with those of the past four years will realise that we have turned the direction of the country around&rdquo;.  He relied on the capacity of the Government to achieve economic control.  He continued: &ldquo;We intend to continue to shape the direction of the country for a long time yet&rdquo;.  We, including my party, want to enjoy the confidence, trust and respect of our partners in Europe. However, the Tánaiste and President of the Council of Foreign Ministers said he wanted to keep the &ldquo;chancers in Fianna Fáil on the benches <Col N="903" /> where they belong&rdquo;.  He has a primary responsibility to generate confidence and respect among our EU partners so this European adventure will continue to be successful.  He claims the management of the economy is safe in the Government's hands and that it could not be trusted to the &ldquo;chancers in Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  That is slander at a crucial time when our country requires the confidence and respect of our partners in Europe.  It was said in the context of our management of the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, the economic criteria we must satisfy before we become full members of the economic and monetary union were established by the &ldquo;chancers in Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  We will almost certainly be involved in the Government which will implement these criteria.  The Minister, who has a major role to play in European negotiations, has told our partners that the &ldquo;chancers in Fianna Fáil&rdquo; should not be allowed to undermine and destroy what has been achieved.  In the same context he also said: &ldquo;If any of them have a shred of political honesty they will all recognise the huge and historic changes that we have made since we came into Government&rdquo;.  That is a quote from the Tánaiste at this point of our Presidency.  What a specious claim, and I am being kind.  What an untrue statement.  What a distorted presentation to our partners who, as we speak, are in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Those who have had good reason to respect our performance at each stage of the step ladder leading to where we are now, are being told, not by German, French or Dutch bankers and ministers but by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, not to trust those &ldquo;chancers&rdquo; to guide this venture.  I am privileged to have been in that category described by the Tánaiste because I regard his definition of chancer as the greatest tribute that has ever been paid to me.  I and others were involved in the European adventure at every stage, but I resent the implication.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste will be negotiating the penultimate stage of economic and monetary union.  The ultimate stages will fall to be negotiated by us.  I suggest to the Minister of State, who is representing the Tánaiste, that he should formally withdraw the allegations, not just for our sake because we do not care about the Tánaiste's allegations and imputations, but for the sake of our credibility in Europe.  I know of no case in Europe where that charge has been made publicly in respect of any Government and allowed to stand.  It is one of the most disgraceful allegations to make and it has not been sustained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have more than a shred of political honesty.  Some of us have spent a lot longer in <Col N="904" /> public life than the Tánaiste.  I have been privileged to be here since June 1965 which is some time before the Tánaiste.  I have been privileged to serve with people of the utmost integrity in my party and in Government and that is how I also regard the Cathaoirleach and his family.</P>
    <P>This allegation will do considerable damage to the Tánaiste's authority in Europe and to Ireland's standing.  I find it strange coming from someone who has cost this country millions of pounds which may yet pose problems for us in meeting the Maastricht criteria.  I recall too clearly that the same gentleman who is now the Tánaiste, when calling for the beef tribunal, demanded it should have power to send for persons and papers.</P>

      <P>When the total cost of that tribunal is added up it will be a major burden on the taxpayer.  It will certainly be well in excess of any figure now being mentioned and could be the difference between our qualifying for membership of the economic and monetary union or not.  I worry greatly about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing our capacity for economic management.  The Tánaiste insisted then that the tribunal would have the power to send for persons and papers.  This man talks about honesty but when he was called before the tribunal he claimed privilege.  He claimed that he should not have to disclose his sources or produce papers.  He did not care about the people whom he had just burdened with a bill for £100 million.  If we qualify for economic and monetary union membership it will not be thanks to the Labour Party nor to the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring.</P>
      <P>If anyone can talk about having a shred of honesty, we are entitled to ask those questions. Where is the honesty and consistency in the claim that they have brought us to the point of qualifying for the full rigours and discipline of economic and monetary union membership?  Let the people judge, and they will judge sooner rather than later.  The &ldquo;chancers&rdquo; in Fianna Fáil, who are respected as being the most committed Europeans and the most successful promoters of enterprise anywhere in Europe, will bring this adventure to a successful conclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave that contribution aside.  I welcome this debate which a number of us have been seeking for a considerable time. Now that the opportunity has arrived I hope we will avail of it to comment on the single currency and economic and monetary union.  I appreciate the Minister's extensive and comprehensive statement to the House.  I acknowledge the depth and content of that statement and the fact that he attempted to indicate to us the course that needs to be taken to implement that policy.</P>
      <P>I want to raise a related issue with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan.  I am concerned about what has happened in recent days and weeks in the currency markets.  To what extent do the developments there represent a fundamental change of policy on the part of the Central Bank where management of the exchange rate mechanism is concerned?  The signals coming from the apparent decision by the Central Bank to follow an appreciating pound sterling are confusing to business and industry, particularly exporters.  For years the policy was generally accepted to be that the Central Bank, in so far as it was within its power, tracked the deutschmark. It did so even when it meant that the Irish pound appreciated against sterling to the extent that Irish industry required financial subsidies to servive in the UK market.  Has that policy been changed and, if so, why?  In recent weeks it would appear to be following sterling upwards which has the effect of leaving a growing gap between the Irish pound and the basket of currencies, including the deutschmark, that it is presumed will constitute the core group within the single currency.  At present, this is causing enormous difficulties for Irish companies exporting to Europe.  These are almost as acute as the problems faced by exporters to the UK a number of years ago and were recently highlighted by the chairperson of the Irish Exporters Association, Mr. Colum MacDonnell.</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need for a clear statement regarding the current policy of the Central Bank. Do recent events relating to the currency exchange rate represent a fundamental change of policy?  If so, this will have implications for the subject under discussion.  What does it signal with regard to the future of economic and monetary union?  In light of recent political decisions, which were confirmed by the Minister, what has happened to the Government's determination that the Irish punt should become part of the single currency from the outset?  Confusion is being created which is not helping Irish industry and business prepare for the single currency and the cohesion of the Single Market.  I regard this as an important issue and, while I recognise that the Central Bank retains a substantial degree of independence where currency markets are concerned, it operates, nevertheless, within a broad exchange rate policy decided upon by the Minister for Finance.  When replying to the debate, I hope the Minister will provide the necessary response in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> I do not propose to enter a debate on whether Ireland should join the single currency or remain outside.  The second question in that regard is whether our participation or otherwise should be dependent on the United Kingdom.  I accept that valid arguments can be made in respect of both matters.  However, time has moved on, political decisions have been taken with regard to the establishment of the single currency and target dates have been set.  Ireland's position is clear on this issue.  Any debate on the single currency must be based on the certainty that Ireland will participate from the outset.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to consider the level of preparation being made by Government, business and industry in anticipation of future developments.  In two years time a core group of European countries will adopt the single currency.  These will represent a large trading bloc within the Union.  As the Minister indicated, countries, irrespective of whether they join the single currency or remain outside, who wish to trade with others will have to contend with the existence of the single currency from 1 January 1999.  It is the Government's intention to participate in the single currency from the outset and the performance of the economy indicates that this objective is within reach.  However, the success of that participation will depend on the thoroughness of our preparations.</P>
    <P>The major question for Irish business, industry, services and agriculture is how effectively they are preparing for the inevitable.  The time for speculating as to whether it will be on target is past.  The Minister referred to important questions regarding our trade with the United Kingdom.  The reality is that we may have to contend with these situations and we can only do so by putting in place the necessary arrangements in anticipation of one or other developing.  I do not believe that uncertainty regarding the UK's involvement in the single currency, at the outset or later, should be used as an excuse by interests in this country to delay preparation.</P>
    <P>It is likely that, from 1 January 1999, the Euro will be the currency in which goods and services will be traded.  This is likely to apply to the largest trading bloc within the Union.  Organisations representing trade and business and many professional bodies accept the inevitability of the single currency and also accept the reality that the target dates will be adhered to.  However, many are concerned at the lack of actual or planned preparation on the part of small and medium enterprise.  A number of these organisations carried out surveys among their members, some of which have shown an alarming level of complacency, particularly among small and medium enterprises.</P>
    <P>The first such survey was carried out by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland in November 1996.  It begins by stating:</P>
    <P>In a little over two years from now, on 1 January 1999, the Euro as the single currency for economic and monetary union members <Col N="907" /> will be a reality.  From that date on Irish Companies and their economic and monetary union business partners will be able to open Euro bank accounts and settle transactions in the new currency.</P>
    <P>. . . . .</P>
    <P>The clear implication is that planning for the introduction of the single currency needs to be placed at the top of the business agenda.  If not handled properly it could have serious negative implications for Irish companies trading with Europe.</P>
    <P>. . . . .</P>
    <P>There is a need for a major campaign to alert senior management and other employees within business and consumers as to full extent of change that his involved.</P>
    <P>The survey makes many other pertinent comments on the issue but I do not have time to refer them.</P>
    <P>The second survey to which I will refer was carried out by IBEC and its findings were as follows:</P>
    <P>An overwhelming majority of companies (91%) favour Ireland joining economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Of those companies which favoured Ireland joining economic and monetary union, the majority (75%) believed that Ireland should be in from the start.</P>
    <P>The impact of the Single Currency on business is largely seen as positive.</P>
    <P>A substantial majority of the companies (61%) representing 67% of employment believed Ireland should join economic and monetary union even if the UK stay out.  Only 11% said Ireland should stay out with the UK.</P>
    <P>Over half the companies surveyed representing 67% of employment believed their Sector and investment prospects would deteriorate, if Ireland stayed out of the Single Currency with the UK, and only 10% thought they would improve.</P>
    <P>. . . . .</P>
    <P>Clearly, in the event of a UK opt out, Irish business believes that joining economic and monetary union without the UK will have the least negative impact.</P>
    <P>. . . . .</P>
    <P>Over 50% of the companies believe they have sufficient in-house software expertise to effect the changeover of systems to the Single Currency but only 28% believed they have the legal expertise.  [If 50 per cent of the companies believe they have sufficient in-house software expertise, the implication is that the other 50 per cent do not.]</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> Of the 30% of the companies which expressed a view on when their companies would make the physical changeover of their systems to the Euro, two thirds of them said that they would make the change in 1999.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a third survey carried out by The Chamber of Commerce of Ireland in November 1996 entitled <i>Economic and Monetary Union.</i>  This survey highlights a number of major issues for the Irish business community.  The foreword reads:</P>
    <P>It shows that an overwhelming majority of Irish firms now believe that Ireland will be in the first group of countries.  It shows that Irish business supports the introduction of the Euro, viewing it as beneficial to Ireland in general, and to their firms in particular.  However, it also shows that few Irish companies are well prepared, few believe they know enough to begin preparations for the single currency, and few believe the Government is consulting enough with business.</P>
    <P>The Chamber of Commerce survey also confirms what emerged in the other two surveys I mentioned.  The survey results are as follows:</P>
    <P>An overwhelming majority (89%) thinks Ireland will be part of the first grouping in the single currency.  This is a significant increase from 60% in last year's survey.</P>
    <P>Only 4% think that Ireland will not be part of the first grouping, which is down considerably on last year's results (in 1995, 33% believed Ireland would not be in the first group).</P>
    <P>Six in every ten still believe that Ireland should enter, even if the UK remains out.</P>
    <P>. . . . .</P>
    <P>86% of respondents thought that a single currency will be either beneficial (72%) or essential (14%) to Irish competitiveness.</P>
    <P>. . . . .</P>
    <P>54% do not believe that they know enough to start planning for economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The vast majority (85%) of respondents have not assessed the cost on their business of the transition to the single currency.</P>
    <P>Also, while 31% believe they know enough to begin preparations for the Euro, only 11% have made an attempt at assessing the impact and cost on their firms.</P>
    <P>These findings show confidence among Irish businesses that we will be participating in economic and monetary union from the beginning and a growing acknowledgment that within many Irish firms, and the small and medium sector in particular, there is a serious lack of preparation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> In a paper entitled <i>EMU and the Single Currency</i> presented to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs on 19 September 1996, the Irish Exporters' Association, which has strongly commented in recent days on the problems for exporters caused by the present exchange rate fluctuations, stated:</P>
    <P>Some mechanism must be found to protect against competitive devaluations by countries outside the economic and monetary union &mdash; in our case the UK specifically.</P>
    <P>We must make sure that we are not priced in to economic and monetary union at the wrong point in the economic cycle.</P>
    <P>Government must attack the cost base if we have to live with a fixed value currency &mdash; payroll taxes and services provided by State monopolies are blunting our ability to compete.</P>
    <P>Government needs to communicate better and to listen more to the legitimate concerns of exporters &mdash; an appropriate mechanism needs to be established.</P>
    <P>As well as developing European markets we must refocus on the UK which is where labour intensive exporting industry is concentrated.</P>
    <P>What emerges from this paper is that trade and business organisations and professional bodies are conscious of the need to prepare for the inevitable.  However, for some reason this does not appear to be happening on the ground. While I welcome the Minister's comments in relation to the Scott committee, it is dealing with administrative preparations between Departments.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that a business awareness campaign would be launched next week aimed particularly at small and medium enterprises. May I suggest that there is an urgent need to go further and to establish a body to co-ordinate the efforts of Government, industry, business and consumers to ensure that the maximum advantage is gained from the preparations which appear to be taking place in a limited and diverse climate?</P>
    <P>Lack of preparatory action is not being helped by economic commentators and others who are suggesting that the single currency may not happen, or will not happen, within the timescale proposed.  These comments have a negative effect and are delaying the preparations which should already be under way.  What is certain is that Irish business will have to contend with the reality of the single currency in two years' time.  Nineteen ninety seven should be used to prepare for that.</P>
    <P>Adaptation is necessary in several areas where Irish business is concerned.  The first adaptation has to take place in the mindset of those involved in business and industry.  The matter of the technical adaptation is a serious one.  To adjust to the single currency and the requirement for dual pricing which will be part of the arrangement, every <Col N="910" /> piece of equipment from the simple cash register to vending machines and advanced computers will require conversion.  Staff will also have to be trained and this will be time consuming. Consumers will have to be educated in preparation for the single currency.  This must be a shared responsibility between Government, business and consumer organisations.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined the various events that will take place during 1998 &mdash; the appointment of an executive board for the &ldquo;Eurobank&rdquo;, the decision on the participating member states, the irrevocable fixing of conversion rates and the commencement of production of the Euro notes and coins.</P>
    <P>There is a need to start preparations and there should be a greater sense of urgency, particularly among the SMEs in industry, business, services and agriculture.  Planning for change requires direction, leadership and co-ordination.  The Government, professional organisations, business organisations, trade associations, financial institutions and consumer interests must be involved.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to totally ignore the importance of the UK position.  There are some difficulties and the answer may rest on the outcome of the next UK election.  If opinion polls continue as they are, this time next year the UK position may be a matter of history.  I also understand there are definite changes taking place in the attitude of Denmark, another country which appeared to be prepared to exercise the opt out clause.</P>
    <P>While the physical presence of Euro notes and coins are some distance down the road, I hope the community and organisations charged with implementing the single currency, considering the known capacity of European institutions for bureaucratic complication, will not make the changeover any more confusing or complicated than it needs to be.  Ireland has experience of the changeover to decimalisation.  Although technology would not constitute as complicating a factor then as it would now, we could give valuable advice.  Decimalisation involved an overnight changeover.  We removed six coins and one note from circulation, introduced three new coins and changed the value of two coins and six notes.  There were 18 changes in all.  There was very little difficulty with consumers and I think the same would apply now.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that computer technology and the training of staff is a more substantial issue now.  Germany had a currency adjustment within the past six years.  There is experience there to guide the bodies who will have responsibility for the changeover.  I question whether we require a period as lengthy as that which has been prescribed to effect an orderly and satisfactory changeover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. F. Quinn Mr. F. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this matter.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Mr. Durkan, to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> The Minister said that the reason we are so concerned about economic and monetary union is that the convergence criteria are in our favour and we have behaved ourselves.  He was generous in not claiming all the credit, which he said was due to a number of Governments.  The performance of our economy in the last ten years has given us the opportunity to discuss this matter today knowing we are in the front line of those who have reached the criteria for entry to economic and monetary union.  It is interesting to note this because ten years ago we would not have been considered.</P>
    <P>I took note of some of the initials used in the debate so far and even Senator Howard dropped them without the slightest bother.  I noted the use of ECU, EMU, EMS, ERM, ECB, ESC, ECOFIN, ESRI, <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and GDP.  The new one which upset me was SCOT, which at least is pronouncable.  It stands for Single Currency Officer Team and was mentioned in the Minister's speech.  The use of all these initials reminds us of how aware we have to be of what is happening in economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>I called for a debate on this matter.  Some people may think this was because I am opposed to Ireland entering economic and monetary union.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I am very much in favour of Ireland joining economic and monetary union at the earliest opportunity but I am concerned that the lack of debate on this issue, a point also made by Senator Howard, will leave us badly prepared for this momentous step in our economic as well as overall history.  We must be pro-active in our approach to membership of economic and monetary union.  Unless we are fully and properly prepared, we will not only fail to make the most of this development but we will risk being damaged by it.  I believe we need a national task force as a matter of urgency to oversee our preparations.</P>
    <P>The Minister described such an entity and Senator Howard also called for it.  The Minister referred to &ldquo;an informal group representative of relevant interest groups&rdquo;.  This does not have the bite, magic or urgency which gives the sense of doing something.  The Minister also referred to the Decimal Currency Board of 1971, which had a greater sense of urgency.  I use the term &ldquo;task force&rdquo; to create that sense of urgency to make sure we begin to move, and move urgently towards that end.</P>
    <P>Three things are clear.  First, Ireland will qualify for entry to economic and monetary union in the first phase.  That is not a foregone conclusion although as long as we are reasonably careful, I believe we will qualify.  Second, as mentioned by Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Howard, the odds are very much against the UK deciding to join the economic and monetary union at the beginning, regardless of what Government is in power when the time for that <Col N="912" /> decision comes.  This is changing even today as the British Parliament debates economic and monetary union.  If the UK does join, all the better.  The prudent thing is for Ireland to plan on the assumption that the UK will not go enter economic and monetary union.  Third, even without the UK, the balance of long-term advantage for Ireland is clearly in favour of us joining economic and monetary union from the beginning.  There may be short-term advantages in going with whatever the UK decide to do, but the long-term disadvantages would be disastrous for our economy and our country.  While all three of these points are worth debating and will be fully debated here this afternoon, I will not dwell on them and I do not want us to do so.</P>
    <P>The next step involves the implications for Ireland in joining economic and monetary union at the beginning, and in particular the implications of us joining when the UK stays out. When will this happen?  The most important priority is that the economic and monetary union is a success.  If it starts and then fails, it will have horrendous consequences for the future of Europe.  Ireland's national policy should be aimed at ensuring economic and monetary union will be a success.</P>
    <P>There is virtually a conspiracy throughout Europe to shut our minds totally against the possibility that economic and monetary union might not start according to the original schedule. Insisting on that schedule immediately raises a dilemma for the Union.  The economic and monetary union could begin on time with a very small number of core countries and most countries not participating.  That has been spoken about day after day in the financial papers and is being actively pursued.  Some countries would stay outside because they do not want to join or because they could not meet the criteria.  The second possibility is where membership of economic and monetary union is broadened by lowering the criteria to let in countries which otherwise would not qualify.  We have seen enough of that in the last few weeks.  I am thinking of one country in particular which has decided to use the pension fund from its telecommunications industry to get it in.</P>
    <P>To choose either horn of that dilemma will put the success of economic and monetary union at risk.  If we start with too small a core of countries we will divide Europe and create very strong conflicts of interest between that small bloc and the large bloc which remains outside economic and monetary union.  We will also keep economic and monetary union out of Europe's mainstream and that will make it more difficult for the Euro to be widely recognised as the main European currency in the future.  If we lower the entry criteria to allow more member states in at the beginning, the credibility and stability of the entire economic and monetary union project is at risk and we would be increasing the chances of failure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> If our top priority is to have a successful economic and monetary union, perhaps we should open our minds to delay the schedule.  I know that is not the right thing to say and we are all saying we should not even consider a delay, but economic and monetary union needs a critical mass at the start if it is to be a success.  It must be a critical mass of properly qualified countries who can work together to keep the European currency strong in the years ahead.  I do not suggest that we should not aim for the target date but we should not lower the standards in order to reach the target date.  We should keep an option on that.  I hope we keep the target date.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the tasks that face us internally; Senator Howard spoke about them today.  When the economic and monetary union starts we will need a national task force.  Three groups in particular face challenges from economic and monetary union.  The first are the exporters, particularly those who depend heavily on doing business with the UK; the second group is the financial institutions, such as the banks, and the third group is made up of those businesses, including my own, retailers, who handle the bulk of money that circulates through our economy.</P>
    <P>Exporters to Britain face an obvious threat if we join economic and monetary union and Britain stays out.  We should not be misled by the present strength of sterling.  The long-term trend of sterling is downwards.  It has depreciated at an average of 1 per cent to 2 per cent every year for the last 25 years.  Britain has been paying its way through devaluation.  This has become a part of the British way of life and will not change.  If Britain has behaved in a certain manner for 25 years and has used devaluation subtly and slowly year after year, that will not change and we have to recognise that.  This means that our exporters who depend on the British export market must face a constant permanent chipping away at our competitiveness.  This will be more serious than has been the case over the last few years.</P>
    <P>At the moment the effects of swings in sterling are dampened for us by our freedom to move from the top to the bottom of the ERM band.  We can absorb swings of up to 5 per cent while still keeping the rate against sterling virtually unchanged.  When we join economic and monetary union, that safety cushion will be permanently removed.  All fluctuations in sterling will be felt daily in our exchange rate.  It will be like taking the shock absorbers off a car and having to face the bumps of a journey as we go over a potholed road.  We need to accept this and we urgently need to develop a strategy to deal with it.  We must find out what we need to do to make sure joining economic and monetary union works.  It will be too late to act when economic and monetary union arrives.  Our best chance of preserving jobs in the businesses affected is to put in place now a strategy to help those businesses prepare for this when this happens.  Next year or the year after will be too late.  We need to begin that strategic action now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> Having an exchange rate which constantly appreciates against sterling is not all bad news.  It presents immediate difficulties for exporters but other countries have thrived on appreciation in the past.  The deutschmark and the yen have appreciated greatly but those economies have benefited.  We too can benefit since most of our imports that contribute to the cost of living index come from the UK and an appreciating Irish currency makes those goods cheaper.  My business imports a lot of food and there have been practically no price increases on British based goods in the last couple of years.  We notice immediately when it goes the other way but we do not tend to notice that prices of British imports have not changed.  This keeps our inflation in check and allows us to keep our costs down.  That is just as well because we will need all the help we can get in the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>The second group of businesses that need to act fast are the banks and other financial institutions. Banks all over Europe are only now beginning to realise that bringing in economic and monetary union will be much more difficult than was anticipated.  I do not think they realised this and it is just beginning to hit them.  They also realise that they are less prepared than they thought they were.  It is vital that our banks do not lag behind in their preparations for economic and monetary union.  It is not enough to assume that they will prepare adequately without some sort of external monitoring and encouragement and we will have to provide that.  One of the big cost savings of a single currency will be at the expense of the banks.  They will see much foreign exchange business cease overnight.  If they have relied on foreign exchange business for some of their profit they will have to adjust to that profit disappearing.</P>
    <P>Businesses that handle money also have to prepare for economic and monetary union.  That group includes almost every business.  Some are in the front line because of the high proportion of circulating cash they handle.  The run up to decimalisation was very carefully and thoroughly prepared; I remember the date, 15 February 1971, very well.  This is an even larger step and it is very close to us, yet no proper research has been done into finding out what will be the practical difficulties.  No proper work, as far as I know, has gone into preparing a national plan for the changeover.  The Minister announced today that we are getting somewhere.  If so, we have to do this urgently.</P>
    <P>Retailers across Europe are very concerned about this issue.  I am a member of a European group called &ldquo;Eurocommerce&rdquo; which represents retailing in Europe and that group has done some calculations.  It is not sure how accurate the figures are but they are frightening.  The present plan is that when the Euro is introduced for cash transactions in the year 2002, there will be a transaction period.  The Minister described this today, and Senator Howard mentioned it as well. During that six month transition period, the old <Col N="915" /> national currencies and the new Euro will circulate side by side.  This is a recipe for absolute disaster.  It will gravely increase the cost of the transition and could perhaps put many small concerns out of business.</P>
    <P>The idea of a transition period is based on the false premise that it smoothes the impact.  It will not work like this.  Experience shows that if the old and new are put together people will only change when the crutch of the old is removed. For example, Ireland moved rapidly and successfully from the use of Fahrenheit to centigrade approximately 25 years ago.  By contrast, both figures continue to be provided in Britain and nobody has moved from Fahrenheit. Similarly, while we moved to decimalisation overnight we decided to move slowly to the use of metrification.  In consequence, we have still not made the full transition 25 years later.  My business has prepared advertisements for price quotations in the existing currency and in Euros in honour of the Dublin Summit next week. However, we will be effectively advertising commodities in four prices because we price our goods in kilos and lbs.</P>
    <P>Five years ago I swore, uniquely as far as I am aware, that I would never use the old measurements.  I am 165 cm tall and am down to 78 kilos in weight.  However, my 18 year old son, who is a keen golfer and has been attending school for the last 13 years, uses inches, feet and yards because we stretched the transition period when it came to the use of metrification.</P>
    <P>We must rethink the proposed six month transition to the use of the Euro.  It must be done immediately.  The transition to metrification has not worked because most people still think in lbs. and ozs. when buying goods.  This experience should alert us to the danger of a transition period for the Euro.  We should go for an overnight &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; approach because this will have to happen in any event at the end of the transition period.  This is what happened with decimalisation.  It worked and we all put up with it after a couple of days.</P>
    <P>We must stop thinking of economic and monetary union as something that may or may not happen in the distant future.  We must work on it immediately and we can best do this by establishing a national task force to spearhead the preparations.  The Minister announced that a committee will be established in this regard. There should be a greater urgency and sense of direction about this.</P>
    <P>The proposed task force should set out a national strategy under the guidance of Government policy and should create an action plan across the spectrum of business that will be affected.  Most importantly, it should monitor progress and act as a national watchdog to ensure that we as a nation are fully prepared to take this momentous and exciting step.  Ireland's future is with economic and monetary union and that future is virtually upon us.  The time for action is now.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was very interesting.  He referred to the disadvantages, including the loss <Col N="916" /> of some control, and outlined the sanctions that will follow if member states misbehave.  However, the benefits he outlined override everything else. I have often travelled throughout the USA but was unaware until a few years ago that the original 13 States which formed the Union in 1782 had their own currencies, but ensured that these became one.  If, for example, Pennsylvania had decided to stay out of the monetary union, what chance would it have had of holding onto its currency, never mind influencing what happened beyond its boundaries?</P>
    <P>Ireland does not have an option in the case of economic and monetary union.  There has been talk of us being a tiger in Europe.  Whatever the truth of that, we must behave ourselves to ensure that we can join economic and monetary union at the outset so that we are in a position to influence European monetary policy in the future.</P>
    <P>This is a welcome debate.  I welcome the Minister's speech and the sense of movement we have created.  I now call for a sense of even greater urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, to the House.  I also welcome the speech by the Minister for Finance.  I was interested in Senator Quinn's comments on abbreviations.  It might be wise to establish a dictionary of initials.  For example, the term &ldquo;EMU&rdquo; causes confusion given that people equate it with &ldquo;European Monetary Union&rdquo;. However, the correct term is &ldquo;Economic and Monetary Union&rdquo;.  In addition, the EMI refers to the European Monetary Institute.  Similarly, I am cautious about the double display of prices. Goods which sell for £1 will sell for Euro 1.25, which will lead people to conclude that prices are being increased.</P>
      <P>However, I welcome this debate.  The concept of economic and monetary union must be explained to people, including children.  A good education programme is required.  Even at present, terms such as the EU, the EU Council of Minister, EU Summits, EU Commissioners and the EU Commission are confusing.  While many are aware that the currency is to be changed, they do not know what economic and monetary union is about.  Therefore, a policy of education is of extreme importance.  I compliment the Minister for Finance, the first Labour Party Minister for Finance in the history of the State, for his excellent handling of the Department.  No doubt it is due to his good work that our GDP-debt ratio is well in line with the economic and monetary union criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference will play a big part in the shaping of the future of Europe and economic and monetary union is an intrinsic part of the changes taking place.  Conferences of this nature have been held since the 1950s to set up the European Coal and Steel Community, the EEC, as it was then known, and Euratom.  Later came the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty.  In a few years as a result of the Intergovernmental Conference, changes will be made to Maastricht to provide for a future Europe which may be joined by countries from <Col N="917" /> the east.  I deviated from the main topic to speak about the Intergovernmental Conference because it is important to note that the not all the countries now within the EU will join economic and monetary union; and we must also remember that by the time the Euro note or coin is in circulation in the next century, it is possible that some eastern European countries will be part of the EU so their currencies must be taken into account.  These points are of extreme importance.</P>
    <P>Currencies have created great difficulty for Europeans over the years.  One's currency is part of one's national identity.  Banks in Britain used to refuse to take Irish pounds but that will no longer happen when economic and monetary union is in full swing because the same currency will apply in both countries.  To the present day many British banks charge exorbitant amounts for exchanging Irish currency, which is an insult to our nation.</P>
    <P>When there were 12 EU member states, it was calculated that if one travelled from Dublin around all the European capitals with £100 one would only return with £47 &mdash; not having spent any money but through exchanging it; three more countries have joined since then so it is possible that one would only be left with £30; and if many more countries joined one would have a negative amount of money.  These points must also be borne in mind.  This is an extra expense for the public travelling abroad.  One gets nothing in return for the exchange rates charged by the banks.  Some people in other countries take advantages of incoming travellers.  Also, people on holiday do not closely watch their money, they spend extra cash but also throw away money exchanging it.  I can see great benefit for tourists in economic and monetary union as it will get rid of the system of buying at one rate, selling at another and paying commission for exchanging.</P>
    <P>It will also greatly benefit business people.  A common currency means they will not have to worry about sending Irish cheques abroad, receiving foreign cheques and everything which might arise in between.  Those transactions can eliminate much of the profit.  Business people currently operate an exchange; if they buy something in Britain they pay for it with something they bring over there.  That will be done away with and it will be better for the industrialist, the manufacturer, the exporter and the tourist.</P>
    <P>Small countries will also do well.  They are often at the mercy of financiers.  When the currency crisis arose a number of financial whiz-kids targeted a certain country for their own financial gain.  Is it possible that, before economic and monetary union comes into effect in 1999, financial wizards could derail a country's economy, as was done in the past?  We must examine this point.</P>
    <P>In his reply, perhaps the Minister could indicate what currency rating we will take at entry to economic and monetary union.  Will the Punt be £1.01 against sterling if Britain joins or will we <Col N="918" /> be higher or lower against other European currencies?  How will the fixed figure be set?  As far as I can gather, when economic and monetary union comes into force the participating countries will be required to surrender irrevocably national exchange rates as instruments of economic management.  The figure will be fixed and I want to know what it will be.  Will it be an average over a period of years or will it be whatever the rate is on 1 January 1999?  That could be dangerous for some countries which might become the targets of financial whiz kids trying to make money off the backs of others.</P>
    <P>The formation of a single European currency will result in a fundamental change in Irish society, even greater than the move to decimalisation in the early 1970s.  Until recently it appeared there was a great deal of consensus on this issue but that has broken down of late, not necessarily among parties in the Oireachtas but among professional economists who wonder about our intentions when those of the British Government are less than clear.  It must be great to be an economist.  For years they have lectured us politicians about economic management, prior to the implementation of the Single European Act they informed us of the benefit of the Single Market and single currency, but now that we face the final hurdle they have become brides with itchy feet, unsure whether we should walk down the aisle.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, they are correct to take the issue seriously.  I have already stated that the single currency has common support inside the House but, unfortunately, the issues giving rise to concern about our participation fall outside our powers.  The issue is not so much about our attitude to the single currency as about our attitude to the British Government's stance on the single currency.</P>
    <P>This is further complicated by two related issues.  First, the British Government is deeply split on this issue.  While current thinking is that Britain will not participate in the first wave of economic and monetary union, anyone who has witnessed the performance of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Ken Clarke, MP, an apparent supporter of Britain's participation, would hesitate to rule out the possibility that he will get his way.</P>
    <P>The second issue is equally confusing.  The British Government which will decide about participating in economic and monetary union is not the current Government but its successor following elections early next year.  It is widely expected that the British Labour Party under the leadership of Mr. Tony Blair, MP, will win the election.  His views on economic and monetary union are unclear, although Labour is devoid of the virulent anti-Europeanism which haunts the Conservatives.  Mr. Blair has promised a referendum should Britain seek to join economic and monetary union in the first wave but it is far from clear what will be the preferred outcome of his Government.  To complicate the matter <Col N="919" /> further, it appears his Shadow Chancellor, Mr. Gordon Brown, MP, is well disposed to economic and monetary union but his Shadow Foreign Secretary, Mr. Robin Cook, MP, is not so keen. In this scenario, it is no wonder our economists are confused.</P>
    <P>However, our Government's position is clear. It feels &mdash; as do I &mdash; that we should participate in the first wave of economic and monetary union regardless of the intentions of the British Government.  I have a number of reasons for feeling that way.  First, the economic discipline imposed on the Irish economy since our agreement to the Maastricht Treaty has been extremely beneficial &mdash; the figures for the strength of our economic performance indicate that.  There is a debate in Britain on that country's inability to devalue its currency should it sign up for economic and monetary union.  This strikes me as a ludicrous and self defeating manner in which to discuss a country's economic management.  If devaluation was a successful tool of economic management, Great Britain would be among the world's leading economic powers; it is not.</P>
    <P>Second, a great deal of concern in Ireland and in many other potential single currency states centres around the possible loss of competitiveness against Great Britain should it devalue against the single currency.  However, I am confident it can be resolved.  At present, Irish companies have to adjust to foreign exchange shocks.  When the Irish pound depreciates against sterling a section of exporters complain that their trade is being endangered.  When it appreciates against a continental basket of currencies, exporters to those countries voice their concerns. If one group is doing well, the other is not. However we only hear when they are doing badly.  If we were to stay outside the single currency we would continue to be susceptible to shocks, possibly more than if we were included. The Minister for Finance and his European counterparts are working on a solution to that problem which I hope will include the imposition of some disciplines on the British Government which may allay fears in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Third, the Government's position has been endorsed by the ESRI report commissioned by the Minister for Finance.  I am not an economist, but I would not like to see Ireland being separated from the main engine of European economic development and our failure to participate in economic and monetary union would be perceived in this fashion by the external investors on whom Ireland relies so much for employment.  Even if the ESRI suggested that the impact of a single currency would be neutral, my instinct would be to go ahead with it.</P>
    <P>Culturally, our membership of the EU has been hugely beneficial.  It has, in effect, given us the confidence to play a new role in the world and the Irish public is proud that a small country such as this is capable of having its voice heard. <Col N="920" /> Reports from Europe state that the Presidency has been handled excellently by Ireland as it was before.  Europe has allowed Ireland to put its relationship with Great Britain into perspective also.  Our outlook is broader and more progressive as a result and I would like to that see it continue.  I would also like to see more information being given to the general public and to children in our schools so that they will know that economic and monetary union is the economic and monetary system, not some bird from Australia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been an interesting debate.  It is extraordinary to think that this is the first debate on economic and monetary union in the Oireachtas.  When the founding fathers of the European Communities came together in Messina they relaunched Europe at an intergovernmental conference and drafted what was to become the Treaties of Rome.  It was never intended that the new adventure would stop with a simple customs union.  It was intended, first, to achieve a common market and, thereafter, to achieve progressively closer economic co-operation and integration between the member states.  The next phase was always to achieve an economic union, followed by a monetary union and, finally, European political union.</P>
      <P>In spite of all this, there was little consciousness of the ultimate aims of Europe when Ireland joined the European Communities.  The objectives set out in the 1950s are not only achievable but are welcome, and Ireland should be enthusiastically committed to them.  The alternative was a divided Europe, a Europe that was at war with itself, a Europe that did not achieve its full economic potential, a Europe where there had been starvation and deprivation.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht Treaty, one of the most impenetrable jargon ridden documents ever launched on the unsuspecting public set out, nonetheless, to give a further impetus to this process and it achieved a number of things.  It firmly established the European Union, replacing the European Communities.  It also charted the course ahead for member states and, in effect, rededicated the Community to progress along a set of parallel roads aimed at achieving ever closer integration.  The treaty in its own impenetrable diplomatic jargon spoke of itself being based on three pillars: amendment of the existing treaties, common foreign and security policy and further co-operation in a variety of areas not touched on in earlier treaties, such as justice and home affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treaty has seven different titles; the first deals with what needs to be done on an institutional basis; the next three titles deal successively with amendments to the EEC Treaty, the ECSC Treaty and to the Euratom Treaty; the fifth title deals with common foreign and security policy, a debate on which is needed in this House; the sixth title deals with justice and home affairs and the seventh deals with the final <Col N="921" /> provisions.  Tucked in among all of these are the treaty's provisions and hopes for economic and monetary union.  The targets set by the Maastricht Treaty for economic and monetary union are, to say the least, ambitious.  The treaty provides that economic and monetary union is to be achieved in three stages by 1999 at the latest.  It identifies three separate but interlinked stages in regard to the achievement of economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The first stage in the process of economic and monetary union was the Single European Act, 1990, which preceded the treaty.  It began in July 1990 and completes the Single Market bringing about greater convergence between the economies of the member states and is aimed at accomplishing closer co-operation and co-ordination of member states' economic and monetary policies.  While the intention of the Treaty came into effect in the first stage, many of the key provisions relating to this co-ordination were not operative immediately but were to come into effect throughout the second and third stages of economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Much of what was intended in the first stage has been achieved and a great deal has also been achieved in the second stage.  The objectives of this stage &mdash; the Maastricht Treaty &mdash; began on 1 January 1994.  This is the transitional stage, the one in which we find ourselves at present.  During this stage the process of policy co-ordination in economic and monetary fields is to be intensified. Much of this work is done by ECOFIN. Economic policy co-operation based on multilateral surveillance of member state policies within the context of broad guidelines for member states laid down by the Council of Ministers after discussion with the European Council were to be the hallmark of this second stage &mdash; the Maastricht criteria.  This process is intended to be supplemented by treaty constraints on budget deficits of member states and on the manner in which they are financed. Within the treaty member states are allowed to retain a certain degree of responsibility for their own policies within this overall framework.</P>
    <P>The EMI is established in the second stage with the aim of closer co-ordination of monetary policies for members states and also of preparing the monetary aspects of the third stage.  The EMI is a very important transitional institution aimed at putting in place the various building blocks to achieve the third stage.</P>
    <P>The third stage, the major breakthrough, begins on 1 January 1999 at the latest; or the treaty optimistically allows for an earlier date for the start of that stage if all the relevant conditions have been met; and we all know the relevant conditions will not be met.  When the third stage starts the European system of central banks consisting of the ECB, and the central banks of the member states, will come fully into operation. Another major revolutionary step will be the introduction of the European currency unit, the Euro, which is a dreadfully unadventurous title. <Col N="922" /> The single currency will mark a major breakthrough &mdash; a revolution in many ways.  The Euro will become a currency in its own right and the rates at which member states relate to it will be irrevocably fixed through the Council.</P>
    <P>The European Central Bank will be an independent body along the lines of the Irish Central Bank, but perhaps more closely modelled on the Bundesbank.  It will have exclusive responsibility for the formulation and implementation of single monetary policy throughout Europe.  At the start of the third stage the Council will adopt the other measures necessary to introduce the Euro as a single currency and set the date for its implementation.</P>
    <P>It is worth reminding ourselves of the intention of the Maastricht Treaty.  By any standard, these are monumental undertakings.  In terms of the economies of the member states, they represent a revolution which will fuse the individual economies in a single pan-European economy. They are very adventurous and other speakers pointed out that it is important to understand the significance of what will happen.  The arrival of a single currency will bring it irrevocably home to people that we exist in a new form of entity and that we are not in a broad customs union or common market to which we have some reference but which does not have much impact on our lives.</P>
    <P>Our daily lives will be different from the moment the European currency comes into effect and the ECB takes over and starts to run monetary policy.  Member governments will have surrendered a vast amount of sovereignty in these moves, particularly overall responsibility for monetary policy and a significant amount of sovereign rights with regard to individual economic policy.  The frightening aspect is that while the second stage of the process is well advanced, there has been little informed public debate and much less public education on what this all means in terms of the implications for business, jobs and the people.</P>
    <P>It is particularly reprehensible that so little time has been spent debating economic and monetary union in either House of the Oireachtas.  This is the first full debate in either House, which is an extraordinary state of affairs. There have been a number of discussions on economic and monetary union in two Oireachtas committees but when I sought the reports earlier in the Library, I was informed that their deliberations have not yet been published.  This is extraordinary because it means there is no attempt to channel and develop a public debate on the ramifications of economic and monetary union.  It is disconcerting to realise that less effort has been invested in this process than on decimalisation or even metrification.  More money was put into educating the public about those devices than economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>It is worth reminding ourselves that time has passed and nothing has happened.  The Maastricht Treaty was signed on behalf of the <Col N="923" /> people in February 1992 and the referendum was put to the people and passed in June 1992.  It appears that public debate on the matter ended at that stage, apart from the excellent series of debate conducted by the Institute of European Affairs and the excellent document produced by the ESRI.  Other than those, there has been no publicly initiated debate on economic and monetary union in the State.</P>
    <P>Some blame for this reprehensible silence lies with all the major political parties that have participated in Government over the last four and a half years.  In that time, there have been major changes in the personalities holding ministerial office with one exception, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In the past, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister led the way in terms of creating public awareness and acceptance of all major EU initiatives, such as the post-entry negotiations period in 1973, the preparations for the Single European Act and various other occasions when Europe was an issue.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has a specific responsibility which was always recognised in the past.  However, that was when the Minister was resident in the country and not in some form of semi permanent orbit between the world's major hot spots, telling their populations how to do what we so conspicuously cannot do among ourselves on this island. Perhaps that debate is for another day.</P>
    <P>It appears to suit Government to ignore the complexities of the economic and monetary union debate.  Some members of the Government are enthusiastic about economic and monetary union and I do not doubt the enthusiasm and energy that the Minister for Finance is willing to put into the matter.  It is a complex and potentially divisive debate and perhaps it is better for some people that it should be swept under the carpet and resurrected after the next election rather than expose us to differences and various nuances which evidently exist in Cabinet.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his contribution, which was the most comprehensive statement relating to Ireland's entry into economic and monetary union to date.  However, a plethora of areas remain to be addressed in public debate; many of these were missed in the Minister's contribution.  The most obvious is a matter on which Senator Quinn touched.  Will enough member states be in a position to meet the Maastricht criteria in time?  It is extremely ambitious at this stage to suggest that they will be in such a position.  As Senator Quinn said, what happens if only a small number of member states meet the criteria?  This issue has not been addressed.  Where will the balance of our national interest lie then?  This aspect has not been addressed either.</P>
    <P>What will we do if only one or two major states are ready to meet the criteria in addition to Ireland and Luxembourg?  The Minister is correct that these two countries technically meet the <Col N="924" /> criteria at this stage.  Will we join economic and monetary union or remain outside?  Will Ireland's entry into economic and monetary union be contingent on British adherence?  What are the implications if confusion across the Irish Sea hardens into outright opposition?  While we should not make our decisions on the basis of their decisions, we should give more thought to the implications of the confusion in which they find themselves.  It is the Government's responsibility to lead the debate on this matter. It should not be left to individual economic think tanks or chambers of commerce.  The Government's responsibility has not been fulfilled to date, despite the Minister's excellent contribution to this debate.</P>
    <P>There is wide acceptance that high average rates of unemployment will be aggravated further by efforts to meet the qualifying criteria. Members referred to the creative accounting in a number of member states to artificially meet the criteria.  There is an awareness in Europe of the need for a major joint initiative to combat the jobs crisis, particularly long-term unemployment. However, can such a policy be consistent with the drive towards economic and monetary union? The trade off between the two policies needs open and honest debate.  We are enthusiastic about economic and monetary union but we must realise and ensure we are truthful with the people about the consequences.  One of these may be that Government and pan-European initiatives to address the jobs crisis must be mooted.  If that is a cost of economic and monetary union, we should say so and identify the extent of it.</P>
    <P>We must accept that not all 15 member states will be ready for economic and monetary union by 1999.  What happens to their currencies is another issue.  Will they be allowed to float freely or will they be restrained in an additional broad band of currencies?  If so, how will such a mechanism work?  What institutional arrangements will be required to put such a procedure into operation?</P>
    <P>It is clear that the European Monetary Institute or the European Central Bank would not be the appropriate institution.  If there has to be some transitional stage for a number of European states, we should start thinking about the institutional arrangements which will achieve that.  Neither in Ireland's Presidency nor in any other part of the European debate has any attention been given to the institutional arrangements which will be needed to meet the inevitable fact that all 15 member states will not be ready at the same time.</P>
    <P>What will happen if Britain does not join and sterling is allowed to float freely outside the system?  What protection can we introduce for ourselves?  Thankfully, we are far less dependent now on the British market than we were.  The days when a discreet telephone call on policy always had to be made from Merrion Square to the Treasury are thankfully gone, although it is not too many years since that was the case. <Col N="925" /> However, despite all that has been achieved, Britain is still our major trading partner across the economic spectrum and in a series of vital areas.  What will happen if Euro-scepticism wins out in Britain and it stays out of the economic and monetary union, either initially or completely?</P>
    <P>In the Minister's excellent and technical speech, which was helpful to commentators and students of economic and monetary union, he dealt only very briefly with the situation of the United Kingdom.  If there was any major weakness in his speech it was that section.  He concluded that the UK position is unclear and that speculating about it will not make it any clearer, which is true.  He was also right that the clear priority is to ensure that, whatever happens, Ireland qualifies for economic and monetary union.  However, there is also a responsibility on the Government and the Minister to ensure we are prepared for the contingency that our single most important trading partner will take an alternative course of action, at least initially.</P>
    <P>I have been looking at press cuttings and it is interesting to note that as recently as July the Tánaiste, whose contributions on this would be very welcome, expressed doubts that Britain would be among the first wave of countries in the single currency.  Notwithstanding the extraordinary contribution made by Mr. Clarke yesterday, it seems there is every reason to fear it will stay out.  There is no sign in what the Minister said here or in anything the partners in Government have said that there is contingency planning in hand for these issues.</P>
    <P>Contingency planning does not solve every problem but it has benefits, not least of which is the fact that it forces us to think of all the possible good and bad scenarios.  Excellent though the Minister's speech was, there was no indication in it that any contingency planning in relation to Britain is being done in the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs or anywhere else. Ireland holds the Presidency at a critical time. There should be national contingency planning for this eventuality and at European level.  It is disturbing there has been no public utterance on this matter or no sign that such planning is in hand.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to suggest it will be all right on the night.  If that is the attitude we are adopting, we are playing a very dangerous game. We are gambling with the livelihoods and well being of tens of thousands of citizens in this State and throughout Europe.  There is a responsibility on the Government to make contingency plans from the Irish people's point of view.  The Irish Presidency also has a responsibility in this regard at European level.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his speech that Ireland's record on the convergence criteria is excellent, which is correct.  Our pound trades very comfortably, as he noted, within the ERM. Inflation is very low and our interest rates, particularly the strategically important long-term <Col N="926" /> rates, are well within the required ceilings.  It is, perhaps, a pity the Minister's speech contained no reference to the hard work of his three immediate predecessors whose courage presented this Minister with a portfolio and economy in rude good health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. F. Quinn Mr. F. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <P>However, political generosity does not seem to be in vogue with the Minister's party at the moment, particularly when it involves any credit being given to the &ldquo;chancers&rdquo; in Fianna Fáil.  However, there are quite a few chancers in the current Administration too.  In spite of the recent departures, we still have signs that public expenditure is growing dramatically out of hand.</P>
      <P>It was surprising that such a superbly crafted speech did not have enough to say about public expenditure, which is growing like a beef bullock on an exclusive diet of angel dust.  The reality is that we happen to have a very healthy economy and we can tolerate the level of expansion in public expenditure at the moment.  However, what will happen to our economy if Britain does not join the economic and monetary union?  What will happen when we are faced with a different rate for sterling?  What will happen if that has a knock-on effect on jobs?  What will happen if unemployment starts to grow?  We will be back into deficit, not through any fault of this Minister but, I suspect, because of faults of some of his Cabinet colleagues who seem to think we can spend without making any effort to tighten the reins.</P>
      <P>I have generously acknowledged the Minister's speech.  However, there are danger signals that in the year ahead public expenditure will once again get ahead of where it should be.  There is reason at this stage to pay attention not just to public expenditure from the point of view of our internal budgetary criteria but also at the impact which dramatically accelerating public expenditure will have on our capacity to meet the convergence criteria.</P>
      <P>As I said, it struck me that during the course of the Minister's comprehensive speech he did not really touch on the issue of public expenditure.  I do not believe that was an oversight.  Could it be that the Minister has some concerns which he has not expressed here or that he has no concerns in this regard?  I have never known a Minister for Finance who did not have concerns about public expenditure.</P>
      <P>In terms of European integration, economic and monetary union is the next great adventure. In spite of the potential dangers and problems which have been outlined or ignored today, we, as a nation, have little option but to commit ourselves fully to economic and monetary union. We have gone so far down the European road that it would be a devastating mistake to try to turn back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we might be convinced of this direction. I remind the Minister and all public <Col N="927" /> representatives that a huge amount of public education on economic and monetary union is required.  The last speaker rightly made the point that when one talks to some people about economic and monetary union they think of a flightless bird.  We have a responsibility to lead public debate in this most important area and to ensure there is a comprehensive appreciation of all the positives and negatives associated with economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The Government has a particular responsibility as Governments have to lead public debate.  So far, we have seen very little leadership in this area.  I hope todays's excellent debate and the considerable contribution of the Minister will be the beginning of something better.  I believe that we, as a people, will come out of this new adventure at the far end and will benefit by it. However, we have a public responsibility, which is not being met at the moment, to ensure the people know in full all the positives and negatives of economic and monetary union and all the challenges which face this small, open economy in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>It would be churlish not to compliment the Minister on an excellent speech.  However, I encourage him and his fellow Ministers to take the debate out of these Houses and into the street because there is a dangerous gulf in public appreciation of what all this implies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as I understand the core of the Government's policy that we should be eligible for membership of the first wave of economic and monetary union on 1 January 1999, it is the correct one.  I support being ready to enter economic and monetary union on that date, whatever I might think of economic and monetary union itself.  However, I am still divided in my own mind on whether I wish that date to be achieved.  That said, there seems to be a deal of undue complacency in the Minister's speech and the queries in that regard from Senator Quinn and Senator Roche are well taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of my hobby horses are peculiar to me. In particular, I have a weakness for language considerations.  The Minister referred to an &ldquo;independent&rdquo; European central bank.  I love the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; because what it means in this context is a central bank which is, in effect, independent of any democratically based political influence.  That may be good; it is often said that bankers ought not to be the victims of political interference.  An independent European central bank which consists of people who have no mandate from any democratic authority, apart from their initial appointment, is too complacent a way to describe the handing over the formulation of monetary policy, particularly in a period when fiscal policy will be extremely restricted.  It may be the right course of action but its implications should be more clearly explained rather than being subsumed in the term <Col N="928" />&ldquo;independent&rdquo; which tends to have positive connotations.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to &ldquo;closer co-ordination of the economic and budgetary policies of participating member states&rdquo;.  Co-ordination is another lovely idea to which very few can be opposed.  Do we co-ordinate Germany's economic and budgetary policy in the same way as Germany co-ordinates ours?  The implication that there are 15 equal member states co-ordinating one another's policies strikes me as highly imaginative.  I would rather the Minister had not referred to the theory of what might have happened after 1 January 1994 when stage two began, but what has happened so far in terms of the &ldquo;multilateral surveillance of policies&rdquo;.  I do not know if that is as attractive a phrase as &ldquo;co-ordination&rdquo; or if it is regarded as good, but it would be nice to know what has happened and what tendencies have been established.</P>
    <P>In large measure, We have been spared the multilateral surveillance given that our finances are in a reasonably healthy condition and that we are conforming broadly to the Maastricht criteria by a combination of luck and good policy. However, we are conforming at a convenient time from our point of view.  This saves us from having to interrogate many of the assumptions underlying economic and monetary union and the appropriateness of the criteria adopted because we happen to be satisfying them.  If we were not satisfying them for reasons which might be no more to our discredit than they are to our credit, we might have a more exploratory and interrogative approach to the criteria.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the emphasis in the reports on economic and monetary union will be on the achievement of a &ldquo;high degree of sustainable convergence&rdquo;.  What does &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; mean?  How does one determine in advance what is sustainable?  How does one determine what is its timeframe?  How can one determine in advance what is a &ldquo;high degree of sustainable convergence&rdquo; as distinct from unsustainable convergence?</P>
    <P>We may say that various member states, those deplorable creatures on mainland Europe, are fiddling their books in various ways and that that is not sustainable but they may be able to get over a rough passage and achieve sustainability after that.  How does one determine &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo;?  It is like the IDA criteria for jobs some years ago when we changed from &ldquo;job targets&rdquo;, which it transpired were rarely achieved, to the creation of &ldquo;sustainable jobs&rdquo;.  However, we provided figures for sustainability five years in advance rather than five years retrospectively.  There are many statistics about sustainable job creation provided in advance of the sustainability being tested in practice.  I suspect a certain amount of sustainable convergence in EU terms is based on the same criterion.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>ECOFIN will then assess whether each member state fulfils the necessary conditions <Col N="929" /> for the adoption of a single currency and will recommend its findings to the European Council.  The European Parliament will be consulted and will forward its opinion to the European Council also.</P>
    <P>If the two opinions are different, which wise men or women will decide which is the correct opinion?  I am sure there are legal criteria but it would be interesting to know what mechanisms will be in place for reconciling conflicting opinions in this context.  The 3 per cent deficit criterion can only be overcome if it is &ldquo;small, exceptional and temporary&rdquo;.  How will that be defined in advance?  If it could be defined in advance the deficit situation might never have arisen.</P>
    <P>One is intrigued with the exit routes and the loopholes; I am not necessarily opposed to them. The instruction not to enter box unless the exit is clear is not one which Finance Ministers can always pursue.  However, one might be more up-front with what is happening in the real world if such phraseology, which elides the challenge of decision making, had been confronted in a more forthright way.  The Minister said that &ldquo;given continued growth&rdquo; we are on course to satisfy the criteria.  We hope the growth will be sustained through to the relevant dates.  It is an interesting qualification on the general complacency of the presentation.</P>
    <P>When the Euro is introduced, if an exchange crisis arises, what is the decision making mechanism for coping with it?  Perhaps the Euro will be such a strong currency or so immune from wider currency transactions or turbulence in global markets that the issue will not arise. However, in relation to the establishment of the initial exchange rates the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Article 109 of the Treaty gives the Council of Ministers a clear role in the setting of exchange rate policy.  It provides that the Council may, acting unanimously on a recommendation from the ECB or from the Commission [I do not know what the status of recommendations from the ECB versus the Commission may be] conclude formal agreements on an exchange rate system for the Euro in relation to non-Community currencies, having first consulted the ECB in an endeavour to reach a consensus consistent with the objective of price stability and having also consulted the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>That is not an overnight decision making process. I do not know if it would apply to changes in subsequent exchange rates between the Euro and other currencies or what decision making mechanism is envisaged if such a situation should arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that on 1 January 1999 the Council will adopt the conversion rates at which the currencies of the member states participating in economic and monetary union will be irrevocably fixed against each other and <Col N="930" /> against the Euro.  Do we have a policy on what we would like our rate to be?  At present we are at the top of our band in the ERM.  Do we want to be at a higher or lower rate in relation to the other currencies and the Euro?</P>
    <P>The Minister said &ldquo;The primary objective of the ESCB, which will comprise the ECB and the central banks of the member states, will be to maintain price stability&rdquo;.  Without prejudice to this objective, it will also have several other objectives, some of which have traditionally been regarded as incompatible, at least in a rigorous sense, with price stability.  I would like to know the relative weightings of those objectives.  I know there can be no answer but I would like to see the gyrations involved in evading an answer, although it may not be a fair question.</P>
    <P>The section on accountability of the ECB is one of the blandest ever presented to this or the other House.  The Minister said accountability of the ECB is also provided for &mdash; it must present a report to the Council and the Parliament, which may hold a debate on it.  However, this does not matter because none of the bodies which will hold debates have the authority to impose any type of alternative policy on the ECB.  The Minister also said that these arrangements are similar to those operating in Ireland, where the Central Bank is independent but must operate within a framework for exchange rate policy set down by the Minister for Finance and must present an annual report to the Oireachtas, while its Governor appears before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs of Dáil Éireann. I am sure the President of the Governing Council of the ECB must be quaking in his shoes at the prospect of such an obstacle course.  The last part of that statement &mdash; I am not sure the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Currie, will appreciate the analogy &mdash; almost reminds me of Archbishop McQuaid who, after coming back from the Second Vatican Council, said people should not be concerned that the tranquility of their lives &mdash; in this case financial lives &mdash; would change because nothing will really change.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of potential in the ECB if it works according to the letter, although one always hopes that politics will get between the letter of economic and financial policy and the real world in order to put a human face on it.  If it works strictly according to statute, we could face an almighty shock.  This section needs to be tightened if one is to accurately inform the people of the implications of membership of economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about member states' economic and budgetary policies, the possible stability pact, sanctions for Governments which fail to abide by the criteria on budget deficits and so on.  These criteria are probably sensible in most circumstances.  However, one would not apply sanctions in most circumstances but in exceptional circumstances.  What will be the likely effect on people's attitudes towards the European <Col N="931" /> Union if they find that their Government must pay fines or accept sanctions from Brussels because it failed to comply with these criteria, although it agreed to the criteria in advance?  I suspect it can only result in a weakening of public commitment to the European Union.  That may not matter at that stage because one assumes integration will have proceeded so far that there is no going back.  However, if I was anxious to ensure optimum public support for further integration, I would not litter the discussion so liberally with talk of sanctions, fines and penalties for transgressing the criteria laid down.  I would try to find a more positive phraseology to dress up in appropriate swaddling clothes those particular mechanisms for ensuring financial responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about low and fairly uniform interest rates among participating member states.  One can probably ensure fairly uniform, though not identical, interest rates through mechanisms.  We do not have the power to dictate low interest rates in advance.  Although we may say they will be lower than they would otherwise be in the circumstances which may prevail at the time in the absence of economic and monetary union, it is beyond our capacity to guarantee low in an absolute sense in advance. We are giving a misleading impression to the public about the guaranteed low interest rates under economic and monetary union, if that is what we mean by it.</P>
    <P>As far as increased attractiveness of participating member states to foreign investment is concerned, perhaps there will be but what concerns us is our relative attractiveness to foreign investment.  We are more heavily dependent on foreign investment than any other member state in terms of the ratio of total industrial employment and of industrial exports. We need a clinical assessment of the implications of economic and monetary union for foreign investment in Ireland, although I am not saying it would necessarily be negative.  A global statement on the effect of increased attractiveness of participating member states to foreign investment is meaningless unless we know how it will affect us specifically.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to a voice in decisions about the single monetary policy of the Union.  That raises a number of interesting questions about our power within the ECB and the place of the Central Bank <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Department of Finance in policy making in Ireland.  As I understand it, and I am prepared to be told I am wrong, interest rates, which are probably the single most important issue, are to be determined by a straight vote in the European Central Bank.  There is no weighting of the votes of member states.  I find it inconceivable that a German vote will count the same as a Greek vote or an Irish vote on such a matter and there is a German core which extends beyond Germany. However, it appears that an Irish representative <Col N="932" /> there, the Governor of the Central Bank, will have a significant potential influence on European interest rate policy.</P>
    <P>The fact that the potential of fiscal policy will be severely constrained under economic and monetary union suggests that a power shift could occur &mdash; it will probably depend on the terms of the stability pact &mdash; between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank in terms of relative influence on Irish economic policy.  If one were to push a stability pact to the outer reaches of what the Germans would like, one might almost suggest that the Minister for Finance, in a great sacrificial gesture to Euro unity, is coming close to abolishing the position of Minister for Finance or Secretary of the Department of Finance in the future.  I am sure that will not happen but there are interesting implications for the relative balance of decision-making power between monetary and fiscal authorities in the State, given the shifting balance between the roles of monetary and fiscal authority in Europe.  I would love to see those probed further by the Minister and in further public discussion.</P>
    <P>I want to take up the issue of what the economists call, with classic attention to attractive phraseology, asymmetric shocks.  We all know what asymmetric shocks mean so I will not labour the definition.  However, there is little in the paper under the implications for Ireland of economic and monetary union about what specific provisions are being made in the current negotiations for shocks to this country which may arise from circumstances beyond our control, such as fluctuations in sterling.  The implications of that are being explored &mdash; I do not envisage a doomsday scenario &mdash; and Senator Calnan had an excellent section in this regard.  There are potential shocks from movements in sterling which are beyond our control.  We are heavily reliant on foreign investment, we have an exceptional agriculture sector and there are the potential implications of changes in CAP in a few years' time.  We have a labour market which is uncommonly influenced by movements in neighbouring labour markets.  Our negotiators should spell out now and not leave it for future discussions and negotiations what provision is envisaged for Ireland suffering, for reasons beyond its control, from the impact of one or more of these shocks.  We should not depend on goodwill or on our legendary capacity for getting it right on the night.  Senator Roche is right both in general European terms and in specific Irish terms, to ask what is contingency planning and what are the specific contingency provisions for shocks that may occur, not because of some wild hysterical leaps of the imagination but because they could be foreseen in Ireland's case.  I would like to be confident that the Government has taken every possible step to ensure that provision is made in advance to respond to such shocks. This is not a begging bowl mentality nor is it asking for special treatment because we are somehow globally backward; it simply recognises <Col N="933" /> the reality of circumstances pertaining to the economy currently and what responses are envisaged for a negative impact on those circumstances as a result of our agreeing with or being enthusiastic for economic and monetary union.  We are entitled to ask for adequate compensation in the event of things going wrong.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned that under the heading &ldquo;Preparations needed&rdquo;, the main policy of the Government appears to be flexibility &mdash; I am back to vocabulary here, &ldquo;independence&rdquo;, &ldquo;coordination&rdquo;, &ldquo;sustainable growth&rdquo; and &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo;.  What does &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; mean? Flexibility means <i>de facto</i> that somebody else bears the burden of the change.  Flexibility in wage levels means either lower wages or lower increases than would be obtained by screwing up bargaining power in the short-term.  On the whole, flexibility is a triumph of hope or faith over the evidence of how people behave in difficult circumstances.  Flexibility is basically a substitute for policy rather than a policy as such. It would be wonderful if it could happen but in the real world one does not get anything like the degree of flexibility one would envisage.</P>
    <P>If I were a member of a political party representing workers and I read that part of the requirements of progress towards this wonderful new State we will be in are moderate wage increases in the successor to the <i>Programme</i> for <i>Competitiveness and Work</i>, I would ask how it is that progress always seems to mean moderate wage increases.  For many people progress means the highest wage increases they can get.  I happen to agree with the objective from a national point of view but I would not if I were reflecting this sector.</P>
    <P>In terms of practical preparations, I watched Senator Quinn raise the Superquinn poster for next week.  It is admirable that the Government should strive to educate the public on the implications of the Euro replacing the punt but there is a problem.  While I cannot say I am a representative shopper, when I looked at the poster I saw the price is higher in Euros than in punts.  I venture to suggest that many people will not have the time to absorb the complexities of economic theory on the Euro.  Their first reaction will be that the Euro means paying more for everything in the shops.  That is guaranteed to evince a negative response in a substantial number of people.  An education campaign is required to explain, as far as one can, that these apparently higher prices are really not higher at all; they are just figures on a poster.  I wish the Government luck in getting that message across on programmes hosted by Gay Byrne, Pat Kenny and Marion Finucane.  It should be done as emphatically as possible.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Senator Calnan talking about the cultural impact on our psyches of EU membership.  That dimension is missing from the Minister's speech.  As Senator Roche said, the speech was beautifully crafted but there should be a paragraph in the conclusions to mention the <Col N="934" /> broader political dimension and the implications for where Europe goes either with or without economic and monetary union.  It should mention the issue Senator Quinn raised about an inner and outer Europe as well as what problems of division economic and monetary union may bring if only a small number of member states sign up in the first instance.  What is the potential for divisiveness?  How does one try to ensure that, for those of us who are Europeans, the European enterprise continues at the fastest possible rate in the light of the potential creaking in the ship with people navigating at different speeds and possibly in different directions?  Neither the political dimension nor the psychological and cultural ones should be entirely ignored.  I realise that the Minister has not ignored them in other contexts. This is not meant to be a cheap shot but, in trying to explain to people where we want to go in economic and monetary union and where we want economic and monetary union to go, more attention should be paid to the fuller perspectives of European integration.</P>
    <P>With those few qualifications, I heartily endorse the Government's policy on our intended membership of economic and monetary union.</P>

Notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the time limits are as follows: speech of the Minister of State, 15 minutes; speech of proposer of the motion, 12 minutes; speeches of other Senators, eight minutes and there will be five minutes for the proposer, or another person nominated by him, to reply.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for agriculture, Food and Forestry to honour his commitment to obtain changes in the method of calculation of the ewe premium payments which will end the discrimination against Irish sheep farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  This debate is important for many farmers involved in sheep production, the agriculture sector and the economy as a whole.  Sheep farmers are not happy and are anxious that the Minister honour his commitment to obtain changes in the method of calculation of ewe premium payments.  Such changes would end the discrimination against Irish sheep farmers who are extremely disappointed that the Minister appears to be allowing the EU Presidency slip by without tackling the policy problems that relate to sheep production.  He should be more proactive in an <Col N="935" /> area where there have been serious difficulties, particularly in view of the fact that Ireland currently holds the Presidency of the EU.</P>
    <P>In 1980, Ireland gained access to the French market and the ewe premium was introduced. This was paid on each ewe in Ireland and in the UK it was paid in respect of lambs.  At public meetings, the Minister referred to the fact that a policy mistake may have been made when we sought the premium on ewes rather than lambs. It is important to point out that, at that time, there were only 1.5 million ewes in the country. Many of these were located in disadvantaged areas and did not attain the lamb ratings now available as a result of improved husbandry and breeding practices.  It was clear that, if we were to build a sheep industry in Ireland, the provision of the ewe premium was manifested in the accelerator which allowed for an increased breeding flock.</P>
    <P>Throughout the 1980s there was a major expansion in the breeding flock and the herd increased to 4.6 million by 1994.  Much work was done in the processing sector to develop the infrastructure which would allow us to provide the type of carcass lamb and carcass sheep meat to give Ireland increased market share in Europe. The majority of this work was carried out with the assistance of FEOGA grant aid.</P>
    <P>Since 1991, the CAP has been reformed in respect of sheep and a quota régime introduced. With the full support of everyone concerned, a ewe premium calculated across the European Union rather than on an island only basis, where each member state would carry out its own calculations, was also introduced in the belief that Irish prices would rise to meet French prices.  In other words, there would be convergence in relation to prices and the ewe premium would be the support mechanism uniformly applied at every level throughout the EU.  Experience has shown that theory does not work as far as Irish sheep producers are concerned.</P>
    <P>In 1992 there was a collapse in lamb prices; in 1993 and 1994 they remained static and in 1995 they decreased to the tune of 9 per cent.  Prices have increased during the current year but the consensus is that this might not obtain in the future.  The BSE crisis is probably a factor because people began purchasing lamb as a substitute for beef.  That is changing, however, and the position might be reversed.  Lamb skins cost much more this year with prices rising by as much as £10 per skin.  That is not sustainable.</P>
    <P>I stated on previous occasions that the Minister and the Government are indifferent to the problems of sheep farmers and the sheep industry.  Proof of this emerged last December when the Minister announced an alleged package for sheep farmers in disadvantaged areas to critical acclaim.  His declared promise that a £2 per head increase in headage for ewe hoggets in disadvantaged areas and a £1 per head for mountain ewes in the most disadvantaged areas <Col N="936" /> would be paid was not honoured until November. It is a disgrace that the Minister did not fulfil his promise by paying these increases immediately. The increases were to be paid last December but this did not happen until last month and they might not have been paid at all had the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Agriculture, Deputy Cowen, not pressured the Minister into doing so.</P>
    <P>The Minister's action in delaying such payments is unprecedented and scandalous.  He should be held to the promise he made in November 1995 that there will be a full review of the EU sheep policy during the Irish Presidency. During Private Members' business in the Dáil on 7 November 1995, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>My difficulty is &mdash; obviously that of someone who has the responsibility of negotiating this package; it is not one of the Opposition because they do not have that responsibility that to change the method of calculation requires the Commission to propose it and be accepted by a qualified majority.</P>
    <P>In respect of European Union voting procedures he stated:</P>
    <P>I do not want to mislead anybody on this issue but, frankly, no other member state of the European Union will vote with Ireland on the issue of changing the method of calculation</P>
    <P>....  We have three votes.  Leaving aside the fact that the Commission will not propose a change in the method of calculation, I can say that, if there is any prospect that I can use our Presidency in 1996 &mdash; as part of the review referred to which may be carried out in the first half of 1996 &mdash; I will seek to have it as my absolute top priority so that it will incorporate the points made on price convergence.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now in the winter of his term as President of the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers and what action has he taken?  I do not wish to reflect on the character of the Minister of State, but why is the Minister not present to provide answers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not provoke the interruption.  What has the Minister done?  He has dodged the issue and ignored the plight of sheep farmers.  The present system of calculating ewe premium payments discriminates against Irish sheep farmers who are facing a reduction of over £5 in such payments this year; this will dent their incomes severely.  This has occurred because prices throughout Europe have increased.  Such a reduction will cost the Irish sheep sector £23.5 million, a loss of £500 for every flock owner.  That is a great amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> As President of the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers, the Minister had a unique opportunity to push for much needed changes in the ewe premium and the abolition of the stabiliser mechanism.  He gave a clear commitment to sheep farmers last November that he would use his Presidency to carry out a full review of the sheep sector.  Sheep farmers and Fianna Fáil will be insisting on full delivery of this commitment before the end of the year.  The Minister has very little time because there are only a few more weeks left in 1996.  Will the Minister of State convey this to the Minister and ask him to take action?</P>
    <P>It is important that a top up ewe premium be paid to producers in any EU state where the average annual price is more than the specified percentage below the average EU price in a particular year.  This premium would amount to the difference between the average EU premium and full income loss compensation in the member state concerned.  For Irish sheep farmers this proposal would add an extra £3.47 per ewe premium payments in 1996.</P>
    <P>It is also essential that the 7 per cent stabiliser mechanism be abolished.  With ewe premiums throughout the EU on the decline and the strict production quotas in place since 1992, the 7 per cent stabiliser mechanism serves no purpose other than to deny producers their full ewe premium entitlement.  This policy change would add a further £4.68 per ewe to the EU premium.</P>
    <P>Policy changes are also necessary in other areas, such as the permanent extension of the rural wool premium to lowland producers, earlier ewe premium application dates, a strict ceiling on EU lamb imports and an extensification premium for sheep.  I appeal to the Minister of State to convey to the Government that sheep farmers in Ireland are not happy with what the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is doing for them. The Minister promised a review of the system and I appeal to him to do so immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt they are if the stabiliser clause is as effective there as it is in my part of the country.  Senator Kiely has outlined everything very well.  The stabiliser clause was introduced when the EU was trying to introduce quotas.  The quota is now well established and there is no need for the stabiliser clause which militated against farmers because for every 1 per cent they were over the quota they suffered a cut by 3 per cent &mdash; in reality this worked out at 7½ per cent &mdash; and it is still in place.  A farmer with 100 ewes is losing £425 per year.  That is a lot of money to a small hill farmer.  The Minister gave <Col N="938" /> a commitment to abolish this clause when he took over the EU Presidency.  We are now in the last few weeks of his term and it has not even been discussed.  If the Minister had this clause abolished he would go down in history as having done something positive for sheep farmers so that they would get their full subsidy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann supports the actions of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, in his efforts on behalf of Irish sheep farmers in regard to his efforts to secure changes to the Ewe Premium System.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh on achieving such high office.  I wish you well, I have no doubt you will carry on the great tradition of your family.  I welcome the Minister.  Every time we see him things are getting better and, as far as the sheep industry in concerned, things are considerably better.</P>
      <P>I welcome this debate.  Never in the history of the State has there been so much optimism in the sheep industry.  I have no doubt that the efforts of the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department in the past two years have brought about this situation.</P>
      <P>Not all of the problems of the sheep meat industry are caused by external factors.  There are weaknesses in the industry which we need to remedy.  A greater effort needs to be made to achieve more consistent quality.  For this reason the Minister requested An Bord Bia to carry out an in-depth analysis of the different aspects of the Irish sheep industry.  This report is now available and should be the basis for formulating a strategy for the period ahead.</P>
      <P>However, a number of things are already clear. Irish producers are most vulnerable when it comes to the quality and consistency of our product.  The French market, on which we are so dependent, will penalise us for a poor quality product.  If we do not produce exactly what the market demands there are many competitors who will step in, as they have done before, and take our market share.  With a predominantly export trade and a difficult market, quality becomes all important.  Quality, convenience and value for money are what the consumer wants.</P>
      <P>For too long too much of our throughout has consisted of over fat meat because producers get better prices for a larger lamb.  This is detrimental to the industry.  Optimum quality must be the primary objective of all those involved in the industry.  Dry hoggets are not in the interest of the Irish sheep industry especially when they come on the market close to Easter and depress the price of spring lamb.  This happened in the 1994 season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A working classification system which rewards the producer for quality is crucial for achieving higher standards in Irish lamb production.  The <Col N="939" /> critical point is that such a system is workable and effective.  A voluntary system stands a better chance of being effective.  I understand progress is being made on this issue.  The intention is that carcass classification will become standard practice.  The logic of this system is that processors pay for lamb on the basis of quality, otherwise producers will not have an adequate incentive to produce the right quality lamb.  The reverse will also apply and poor quality lamb will have to be penalised.  I am well aware of the ability of Irish farmers to recognise that it pays to produce quality products and it is clear that this change will deliver effective results.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that prices have increased considerably in the last six months.  Since May 1996 prices have increased by an average of 20 to 25 per cent more than the corresponding period in 1995 and 40 per cent higher than in 1994.  This means that some producers have done reasonably well this year.  The improvement in prices has made it more difficult to negotiate a special deal for our producers because other Ministers in the Council will be faced with the difficulty of explaining to their producers why special measures should be introduced for Ireland, particularly at a time when we are doing so well as far as prices are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that Senator Rory Kiely said £2 would make such a difference in a herd of 100 ewes.  It would make a difference of approximately £425.  Currently a farmer with 100 ewes should produce approximately 150 lambs for sale He is getting £20 more per lamb than he got in 1995, which will give him a gross increase of approximately £3,000 for his lambs.  Nobody can dispute those figures.</P>
    <P>This is not the time to go to Brussels to make a case on behalf of the Irish farmer.  A case can be made only when matters are in extreme difficulty.  I am prepared to accept that sheep farmers in 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994 had a difficult period.  However, this has levelled out. The Minister must keep the pressure on to maintain quality.  We depend on the French market.  There are so many prepared to take our market and produce good quality lambs.  New Zealand, American and Australian lamb is not good quality but the English can produce a very good quality lamb.  In the present difficult period as regards beef, lamb is fulfilling an important role.  I am glad sheep farmers are reaping the benefits.</P>
    <P>The motion before us does not fairly or accurately reflect the efforts or the progress which both the Minister and the Department have made in the course of the past year.  In response to the difficulties being experienced by the sheep meat sector, the approach has been proactive and energetic.  The efforts made have been successful in introducing measures which have restored stability and confidence to the market during 1996.  I commend the amendment <Col N="940" /> to the motion to the House as it is a true and accurate reflection of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I also congratulate you.  This is the first time I have been in the House since you were elected.  If you are as successful as Cathaoirleach as you were as Chief Whip for a minority Government, we should have a smooth time in the Seanad until the next election.</P>
      <P>The sheep industry is more important than ever in Irish agriculture.  Whatever changes in the form of payment of the ewe premium scheme or headage payment are sought or made by the Minister, will he take into account the recommendations of the Environmental Protection Agency in its excellent report, <i>Water Quality in Ireland 1991-1994</i> regarding the need to recognise the serious effects of overgrazing on the quality of water in Ireland?</P>
      <P>Section 2 (28) of the report states:</P>
      <P>A relatively recent phenomenon causing grave concern is the severe environmental degradation resulting from overgrazing by unsustainable populations of sheep in the west of Ireland.  Considerable areas of upland commonage have been denuded of vegetation and the ensuing peat and soil erosion has led to siltation of lakes and rivers, the development of peat and algal complexes on river beds and increased peat staining and turbidity of waters. The loss of vegetation and subsequent erosion of peat cover profoundly alter hydrologic characteristics of mountain boglands by reducing their capacity to retain and slowly release water.  Rivers and streams then become more prone to drying out and to flooding, and as a consequence, to scouring, siltation and substratum instability.  The ensuing environmental disruption causes a loss of biodiversity, damages salmonid productivity, reduces amenity value and jeopardises tourism.</P>
      <P>Senator Kiely mentioned the huge increase in the national flock in the last number of years, especially in disadvantaged areas.  I have a great deal of sympathy for farmers in those areas who are trying to make the best use of their land. However, the impact of overgrazing on aquatic environment has been pointed out since the early 1990s.  In recognition of the seriousness of this overgrazing problem, amendments to the Rural Environmental Protection Schemes aimed at reducing stock density in badly affected areas were introduced in 1995.  I am not sure how effective these have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To prevent further damage, the Environmental Protection Agency proposes that Government and EU incentive schemes such as headage payments be urgently re-examined in the context of their adherence to the principles of sustainability and that alternative schemes be urgently introduced in the sheep sector.  Senator D'Arcy's point as regards quality as opposed to quantity is important, especially when one is <Col N="941" /> aiming at the continental market.  The Environmental Protection Agency also recommended that effective interdepartmental and interinstitutional channels of communication should be established at EU and national levels in order to prevent a recurrence of such environmental degradation.</P>
    <P>While the safety of drinking water is not affected, the quality has deteriorated by 5 per cent in the last couple of years.  The taste and odour of water is seriously affected and in some areas is so bad it is undrinkable, particularly in some villages in the west of Ireland.  While I have great sympathy with sheep farmers as regards their current problems, we must aim at quality rather than quantity.  We must make every effort to ensure that overgrazing does not lead to further problems in the quality of Irish water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I join with previous speakers in congratulating you on your election to high office.  I compliment you on your great achievement and I recognise you are following in the long and noble tradition of your father and grandfather who made important contributions to the development of this country and in establishing a democracy.  I am sure you will have a successful term as Cathaoirleach.  Hopefully it will lead to a future successful term in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>In order to fully understand the position in relation to the motion before the House it is necessary to provide some background information on the operation of the ewe premium system.</P>
      <P>EU Regulation 3013/89 aims to provide for the full establishment of a single market in sheepmeat, involving compensation by means of an annual premium for loss of income.  The EU legislation bases the calculation of the premium on the gap between the average EU sheepmeat price and the EU basic price for sheepmeat. Despite the operation of the common organisation of the sheepmeat regime since 1992, market prices within the EU have failed to converge, to any appreciable extent, though some narrowing of the divergence has occurred.  Prices in the majority of member states are relatively close but there are three or perhaps four countries, including Ireland, in which prices significantly deviate from the average.  That said, it has to be accepted that the premium increases when market prices Community-wide are low and that it provides important income support for sheep producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is fully aware of the complaint of producers in Ireland that the single EU-wide premium provides inadequate compensation in countries with low market prices, as compared with the situation in member states where substantially better prices are available.  This argument seems conclusive on the face of it but if the relative profitability of lamb production <Col N="942" /> between countries or the returns per unit of production are compared, the Irish systems come out comparatively well.  The ewe premium system was never intended to fully compensate for poor market prices but rather was to ease the burden of losses while still allowing scope for the market to reward supply of high quality and excellent standards.  At the end of the day an agricultural production system will be secure only if orientated towards market demand and if it is open to market reward rather than cushioned from reality by a full price compensation support system.</P>
    <P>The real necessity for a premium system is evident when demand diminishes and prices slump.  Last year was a very difficult year for the sheepmeat sector during which the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry sought and secured exclusive arrangements for Ireland.  A special supplementary premium was paid to producers in the non-disadvantaged areas and a top-up of headage payments was paid to producers elsewhere.  By any standards considerable effort was devoted to securing this special arrangement which provided a very welcome boost to the incomes of producers who had experienced poor market returns.  It is worth nothing that the rate of premium in 1995 reflected the poorer market and was 19 per cent higher than in the previous year.  At that time, in view of the fact that the European Commission was obliged to provide a report on the operation of the sheepmeat quota regime, Ireland saw a window of opportunity to secure a wider review of the sheepmeat regime &mdash; an opportunity which has been pursued vigorously.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year a detailed memorandum was sent to Commissioner Fischler suggesting the areas which need to be examined in the context of the review to ensure that the sheepmeat régime was more responsive to different conditions in the Union.  Among the proposals which were put to the Commission was that there should be an automatic top-up of the premium in any member state where prices dropped by a predetermined percentage below the EU average price or, alternatively, that the rural world premium should be paid to all producers in member states where there was unusual market failure.  Despite a considerable correspondence and several meetings in the last 18 months, the Commission has not put forward proposals to adjust the premium mechanism to compensate individual member states for low market prices.</P>
    <P>The principal objection of the Commission against the introduction of change at this juncture is the increased burden on the EU budget which improved compensation for sheep producers would involve.  Up to this year the expenditure on support for this sector is higher per kilo of sheepmeat produced than for any other meat. There has been severe criticism from the EU Court of Auditors about the cost of this support régime.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" /> Another difficulty which the Commission perceives with individual countries or regional compensation is that producers now operate in a Single Market but differing levels of compensation might create an incentive to processors to allow market prices to float downwards, thereby giving them a competitive advantage, in the knowledge that the producers would be compensated from a central EU fund. The Commission has also referred to the fact that although market prices in Ireland may be below the EU average in terms of the price per kilo, the returns per lamb for Irish producers are substantially more favourable because of heavier carcase weight than, say, those received by southern European producers where light lambs are produced.  They have also pointed to the fact that Irish producers benefit from a relatively low-cost grass based system which may allow better relative profitability than a cursory glance at prices might suggest.</P>
    <P>Another objection raised by the Commission to possible change is that change now would upset the delicate balance of the compromise agreement reached in 1989 and again in 1992 on the sheepmeat régime.  A compromise agreement by its nature will involve some issues which run against the interests of parties to that agreement. Many member states are dissatisfied with certain aspects of the régime and all would use the opportunity of a revision of the regime to seek to suit their own producers.  In such a compromise, it would be inevitable that some changes unfavourable to Ireland would be included in any new package.  By and large, the existing market support regime has operated to the benefit of Ireland.  We hold over 5 million quota rights, about 9 per cent of EU sheep production, and the annual support amounts to £120 million for 48,000 producers.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the so-called response by sheep farmers to poor market condition in 1995 in that the numbers involved in sheep farming have diminished.  Let us look at the facts. In 1982 there were 48,700 farmers in sheep rearing who held 3.97 million ewes with an average flock size of 81 ewes.  Unlike the milk sector where the quota system was imposed almost without warning, the sheep sector was given several years advance warning of the likely introduction of quotas, so the sector held an opportunity to build up sheep numbers before quotas were introduced.  In this period many producers very sensibly moved into sheep, having learned from the experience of milk producers of the closed shop effect of the quota system once established.</P>
    <P>As a result of this opportunity, by the time quotas were introduced in 1992 there were 53,560 producers in the country who owned just over 5 million ewes.  The latest figures available for this year show that just over 48,000 producers have obtained ewe premium in respect of 4.67 million ewes.  This indicates that the number of producers <Col N="944" /> is back to where it was before the artificial buildup to the quota regime but that there has been a significant improvement in scale with average flock sizes increasing by 19 per cent from 81 to 96 in the period in question.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons, other than a response to markets, the number of farmers has returned to the pre-quota level.  For example, new producers found sheep production demanding and requiring a long-term commitment which sectors such as tillage for example may not have involved.  In addition, some farmers found that they were above the stocking density limits for the purpose of application for extensification payments.  These are, of course, only two of the several other factors involved.  Looking at the structure of the sheepmeat sector it is undeniable that up to this year there has been a small but steady movement out of sheep.  However, these quota rights are not lying idle or lost but are changing hands and, by and large, are being taken up by existing sheep producers or by young entrants to the sheep sector.  This is the behaviour of a healthy developing agricultural system.</P>
    <P>Regrettable as it may be to see older and smaller producers moving out of sheep, I am pleased to say that there is at the same time a build up of more viable sheep production systems and a steady demand for quota rights from the national reserve from young farmers who see a future in efficient sheep production.  Like any other agriculture sector, if the Irish sheepmeat industry intends to rely solely on outside support and market management alone, it will have no secure future.  We must, therefore, strive to get the basics right and produce a product which accords to market demands, achieves standards of excellence and pays adequate attention to the need to be price competitive in an increasingly demanding market.</P>
    <P>There are weaknesses in the industry and we need to remedy them.  Not all the problems are caused by external factors.  A greater effort needs to be made to achieve quality on a more consistent basis.  The French market on which we are so dependent will penalise for poor quality product.  If we do not produce exactly what the market demands many of our competitors are fully prepared to take over our market share.  In view of the importance of quality standards, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has promoted the introduction of a lamb carcase classification scheme to be implemented in all export processing plants from this year.</P>
    <P>A working and effective carcase classification system which acts as a transparent basis on which the producer is rewarded for quality of his product is crucial to the improvement of the standards of lamb production.  Up to this, the pricing system paid a producer to produce heavy lambs which are often over-fat and well beyond market readiness.  By linking payment to quality rather than weight the producer will quickly respond by producing quality rather than heavy lamb.  Unfortunately, there has been some <Col N="945" /> resistance to the concept of a standard carcase classification.  The Department was given the task of overcoming this resistance and I am pleased to say that good progress has been made.  All export plants are now either operating a classification system or have firm plans to introduce classification in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Senators on the other side of the House would have you believe that securing amendments to the sheepmeat régime is a relatively simple matter.  The reality is very different.  Amending the sheepmeat regime would require the support of a majority of member states, most of whom would either derive no benefit or would lose out in such a reform.  Apart from Ireland there is no demand for a fundamental change to the régime. There is a misunderstanding that the EU Presidency proposes and disposes of business.  It is the EU Commission which must propose change, perhaps at the instigation of one or more member states.  When making such proposals it must be aware that they must be adopted by a majority of member states.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of timing.  In stark contrast to 1995, this has been an especially favourable year for sheepmeat, with record prices for most of the year.  Prices this year have been, on average, 18 per cent above last year's level and in the peak selling period prices were between 20 per cent and 36 per cent higher than in 1995.  At present there is even a risk that they will overheat; the very high prices being paid for breeding stock indicates that producers are confident about the future.</P>
    <P>That is the context in which this issue is being considered.  A period of relatively favourable market conditions and high prices is rarely a suitable time for reviewing a regime with a view to providing more effective support for producers' incomes in difficult market conditions. Nevertheless, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry intends to use the opportunity provided by the EU Commission's report on the ewe premium quota system to seek to persuade the Commission to conduct a more thorough review of the premium system itself, with a view to removing some of the inequities from the system to make it more responsive to low prices in certain member states such as Ireland.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Minister and the Department are fully alive to the situation in the sheep sector.  No favourable opportunity will be bypassed to secure changes to the regime which would be of benefit to Ireland.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Henry's question on overgrazing, the provisions under the REP scheme are proving to be effective when put into operation.  There is good compensation and attractive terms for destocking.  This measure is especially effective in areas such as Brandon, where I have a personal interest, where approximately 80 farmers are now joining the scheme.  It is also especially useful with regard to the overgrazing of commonages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> I thank the Fianna Fáil Senators for raising this matter.  A discussion on the sheepmeat industry is timely.  The problems with BSE have diverted attention away from this sector.  However, we made a number of proposals to the EU Commission, which is slow to move for reasons I have already outlined.  The Minister will keep on the pressure to ensure that the interests of the sector are protected.</P>
    <P>A few years ago there were scenes outside Agriculture House when the sheepmeat sector was under considerable pressure.  Thankfully those days are gone and the sector is now performing much better in terms of income and otherwise.  I hope we can build on that strength for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important debate and it is a pity that amendment No. 1 was moved.  The motion is non-political.  The Government parties could have accepted it because there is nothing in it that is objectionable.  It states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to honour his commitment to obtain changes in the method of calculation of the ewe premium payments which will end the discrimination against Irish sheep farmers.</P>
      <P>How could somebody oppose this while expressing concern for sheep farmers?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that, apart from Ireland, there was no demand for change in the EU.  This is normal as Europe is largely industrialised.  However, in Ireland, a large number of farmers, including small hill farmers, depend on the sheep industry.</P>
      <P>No Minister would have a problem establishing the fact that the sheep industry is unique to us. We export sheepmeat all over Europe.  France and England are important markets, and we are aware of the grading system.  Given this, we should not apologise for stating the value of the industry to Ireland.  If we do not do so we are failing in our responsibility and will have missed an opportunity.  That is what is expressed in the motion.  I am sorry that the amendment was moved because to divide on this issue gives an impression to Europe that our motive in proposing the motion is to embarrass the Government.  That is not the case.</P>
      <P>I am interested in those who depend on the sheep industry and in ensuring the survival of hillside farmers in several locations throughout a third of my county.  This is why I am obliged to speak on this issue.  I am not interested in attendant publicity, be it on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; or whatever, but I must speak in support of those who depend on the sheep industry for their livelihoods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no good grounds for opposing the motion because not enough has been done to support the sheep industry.  The Minister of State says there are approximately 4.5 million ewes in <Col N="947" /> Ireland.  However, the total flock of all grades and type of sheep is almost nine million.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to detect any kind of aggressive campaign on behalf of sheep producers.  When one can buy a leg of Australian lamb in Strabane and sheep producers with favoured status import from New Zealand into the Commonwealth, we should not apologise to Europe for seeking support.  It is infinitesimal by comparison with the money pumped into industries, such as the computer industry.  We should not apologise for our efforts in sustaining sheep farmers.</P>
    <P>Many farmers in rural Ireland largely depend on the sheep industry and we are not doing enough to secure it.  Is the Government not surprised that, despite the fact that there are approximately 9 million sheep in Ireland, no value is obtained from their wool?  At one time there were seven woollen mills in this country. Now, we have almost 9 million sheep but we do not have a woollen industry.  That is the kind of support we are giving sheep producers.  The fact that we do not have woollen mills and are selling our wool at a price only slightly higher than what it costs to clip the sheep is not highlighted.  Every thread of wool in garments, blankets, etc. is imported into Ireland but the Government is not concerned.  This industry should be sustained.</P>
    <P>Those who say that we are over-grazing or are overstocked are speaking from the comforts of city life, they have not spent long enough on the side of a mountain.  I get angry when I hear that. The root cause of the decline in our population is that those who legislate are far removed from the important industries we are talking about.  All too often those people have a deciding voice.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty identifying the failure to promote the sheep industry.  I do not say this to the Minister in a nasty way but he and his Department should be doing more.  I ask him to accept our motion because it has been put down for sincere reasons, not out of one-upmanship or to score a point because that would be a shallow achievement.  Our remarks are genuine.  The Government side will press to a vote its amendment to praise the Minister but what will have been achieved?  The amendment does not show sincere support for the sheep industry or those who depend on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, to the House and I suspect he will be with us later for the Control of Horses Bill.  The Progressive Democrats support the Fianna Fáil motion.  Like Senator McGowan I wonder about the necessity for the amendment; it supports the actions of the Minister &ldquo;in his efforts on behalf of Irish sheep farmers and in regard to his efforts to secure changes in the ewe premium system&rdquo;, yet the Minister gave a catalogue of reasons for not securing those changes.  There appears to be an inconsistency <Col N="948" /> between the Minister's contribution and the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested that we, on this side of the House, regard changing the EU sheepmeat policy as a simple matter but that is far from the case.  No one suggests this is a simple matter, it is difficult to change policies but that is not to say that it should not be attempted.  It is also wrong to suggest that the Presidency does not have an influence or function in this respect.  The Commission has a role but I suspect that if the Presidency of the Council wanted something tabled for discussion at a Council meeting, it would be able to secure that by virtue of consulting with the other member states.</P>
      <P>This would not be such a serious matter had the Minister not explicitly stated on the Dáil record that it would be his &ldquo;absolute top priority&rdquo; to have a full review of the sheep sector during the Presidency.  In those circumstances there is an obligation to deliver on that promise, which was made in the context of severe difficulties for the sheep sector debated at length in both Houses. It was quite understandable in the face of those difficulties that the Minister would make such a commitment &mdash; it has been mentioned that reviews tend to take place in unfavourable circumstances &mdash; but now that things are better no one is absolved from the commitment made.</P>
      <P>Before I came to the House I heard a statement that this Minister had done much more for Ireland than anyone before.  That is carrying things a bit far.  I do not say the Minister has not done good things for Ireland.  Every Minister that I can recall acted in the country's best interests. For instance, someone should tell the former Minister, Mr. Mark Clinton, that this Minister did more than anyone else.  Many Ministers have done just as much as the current Minister and we should not believe self-promoting hype.</P>
      <P>A solemn commitment was made which is on the record of the Dáil and there should be no question of doing things with mirrors or bi-location. It is a question of making a genuine effort to deliver on that commitment.  It is not simple but it must be done.  The consequences of a £5 cut in the ewe premium for the 48,000 farmers involved are severe.  The Teagasc figures on income from sheep farming show that more than 100 per cent of a farmer's income derives from EU moneys &mdash; in other words, the profit is coming from the premium, therefore every effort must be made to ensure the premium is at its maximum and is not eroded by the stabiliser mechanism.  Reference was made to our failure to achieve convergence within the EU which we hoped would occur.  If such convergence does not occur and Irish prices are significantly below the EU average, an effort must be made to make up the difference.  The fact that we have quotas means there should be no necessity for the stabiliser and it should be possible to get rid of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of marketing Irish lamb, in the Seanad debate on agriculture on 1 February, at a time when the environment was difficult for <Col N="949" /> sheep production, the Minister, Deputy Yates, said:</P>
    <P>Over the last 15 years our sheep production has been standing still.  [That is in marked contrast to what we heard this evening.]  Our national average for lamb output is 1.1 lambs per ewe; our quality has not improved and our breeding has remained broadly static.  We must address these issues.</P>
    <P>What has been done in the meantime to &ldquo;address these issues&rdquo;?  The Minister also mentioned the report of An Bord Bia, which was published last January.  We have had a long time to consider that and do something about it.  He also mentioned the lamb classification scheme at that time:</P>
    <P>The lamb classification scheme, which is not a statutory scheme and will not involve a huge bureaucracy or levy, is now being put in place. [We now hope to have it in operation for the coming year.]  We will target a number of initiatives with An Bord Bia to move towards more ready cuts, more labelling, racks of lamb and legs of lamb as opposed to just dumping the carcase on the Rungis market at a low price.</P>
    <P>I applaud the initiative but in the context of the difficulties which have confronted the beef industry as a result of BSE, has An Bord Bia's eye been taken off the ball in the lamb market? It must not be because funds should not be diverted from lamb into beef, granting all the difficulties in the beef sector and that An Bord Bia has a difficult task in promoting beef.  We have a huge opportunity to exploit the resource of natural lamb, which is free of additives and hormones and comes off grass.  Tourists coming to Ireland will eat lamb, as a matter of preference, in restaurants in the west because of the surroundings from which the lamb comes.  That is our best marketing tool.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator McGowan on the question of over-grazing, criticism does not only come from people sitting in comfort in Dublin who know nothing about farming but also from me as a farmer.  I fish on the River Erriff in County Mayo and what has been done on the mountains above the river is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>The EU system has promoted a production cycle which means that all one has to do is to put as many sheep as possible on an area of ground to secure a premium.  Any system which does that is wrong.  It must support the income of the people living in the area, but not at the expense of the environment.  I know from climbing the mountains around Lough Currane that the heather at the top is gone as a result of overgrazing.</P>

Ireland is competitive in terms of income per lamb but it does not have enough lambs per acre or per ewe.  There are lies, damn lies and statistics and that is one statistic that points us in a questionable direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the motion was that the Minister would honour his commitment to change the system of calculating ewe premiums.  I quoted from a speech by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in the Dáil on 7 November 1995 and asked what the Minister has done since; he has done nothing.  The Minister of State said that, despite considerable correspondence and several meetings in the last 18 months, the Commission has not put forward proposals to adjust the premium mechanism to compensate individual member states for low market prices.  That is a disgrace.  In his Dáil speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I can say that, if there is any prospect that I can use our Presidency in 1996 as part of the review referred to which may be carried out in the first half of 1996 &mdash; I will seek to have it as my absolute top priority so that it will incorporate the points made on price convergence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the Minister's top priority?  He came into this House on one occasion and accused me of encouraging the spread of BSE and would not apologise afterwards.  This Minister is a disgrace. He has let sheep farmers down.  This change is needed, especially as we are an island nation.  The principal objection of the Commission to the introduction of the change is the increased burden on the EU budget which would involve <Col N="951" /> improved compensation for sheep producers, but they deserve it.</P>
    <P>The price of lamb is good at present because of the BSE crisis and the price of lambskin.  These prices are not sustainable and sheep farmers will be in dire financial straits again.  Another difficulty with the Commission is that producers operate in a single market but when it comes to milk quotas other countries are getting preferential treatment. Why should Ireland, a peripheral country, not get preferential treatment too?  This is an island country with a green image producing the best lamb under extreme conditions.</P>
    <P>Sheep farmers will not forgive the Minister and they will let him know at the next general election that they do not appreciate what he is doing.  It is no reflection on the Minister of State but I am disappointed that the Minister is not here.  He is our representative in Europe and is doing <Col N="952" /> nothing.  He gave a commitment that during the EU Presidency this would be his top priority.</P>

      <Col N="953" /> Amendment No. a1, in the name of Senator Dardis, is on the additional amendments circulated this afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. a1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 7, after &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;either singly or jointly with one or more adjoining local authorities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I apologise for the fact that this amendment was circulated quite late.  It arises from a commitment given by the Minister on Committee Stage to consider an amendment before Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I can envisage circumstances where some local authorities would not have many horses which would require licensing and the exercise of the Bill might not be very onerous on them.  It would make eminent sense to have several local authorities co-operate to appoint the authorised person under section 3.  Under the Abattoirs Act some local authorities have appointed veterinary inspectors to monitor the implementation of that Act but others have not done so.  There is a good case for such co-operation which would save the Exchequer money.  It would mean that rather than having one person in a single local authority jurisdiction deal with this on a part-time basis it would be his or her sole remit.  That would be particularly desirable in the Dublin metropolitan area, which is one of the areas at which the Bill is primarily targeted.</P>
      <P>I retabled the amendment because the Minister said he would look at it before Report Stage.  It was suggested there was no precedent for such an arrangement but that is not so.  I moved an amendment to the Heritage Council Bill whereby a regional authority rather than just a county council would have the right to hold certain property.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht accepted that amendment.  I am now making a similar proposal to the Minister of State.  I commend the amendment to him and the House because it makes excellent economic and practical sense and is a desirable feature which should be included in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.  It makes a great deal of sense.  As Senator Dardis said, the Bill will primarily be of use to the Dublin local authorities.  In my local authority area of Fingal we could do with any assistance we can get from authorised personnel in our adjoining local authority area.  Blanchardstown is on the border of Fingal County Council and Meath County Council.  Fingal County Council will have a substantial amount of work to do in relation to this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Dardis said, local authorities regularly have reciprocal arrangements.  For example, Fingal County Council recently sanctioned an arrangement to increase the amount of water we supply to Meath County <Col N="954" /> Council.  Similar arrangements exist between Dublin Corporation, South Dublin County Council and Fingal County Council in relation to sewage.  Until a few months ago South Dublin County Council looked after the refuse arrangements for Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>To ensure the legislation is effective we need to have as much assistance and co-operation as possible.  There are expectations that when this Bill is enacted the problems of stray horses experienced by householders in the Dublin suburbs will be alleviated.  This is a sensible amendment.  It would increase the manpower available to local authorities experiencing problems with wandering horses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

      <P>Section 3(2)(b) makes it clear that a local authority can take on the functions of another local authority if there is an agreement between the two local authorities.  Senator Dardis's proposal, therefore, is already contained in the Bill.  Section 9(b) and section 20(10) also make provision for joint arrangements.</P>
      <P>When I introduced this provision in the Dáil it was for the same reasons that Senators have put forward on this amendment.  Provision is already made in the Bill and local authorities can appoint an authorised person who can take over the role in another local authority with the agreement of the two local authorities.  I agree with the Senator Dardis's point that there might not be enough work for one authorised officer in one area and the officer could supervise the implementation of the Bill's provisions in other areas.</P>

      <P>As a result of consultation with the local authorities I have decided to reduce the stated period from two weeks to one week in the belief that a shorter period will be of greater assistance to the local authorities.  Senators will appreciate that the provision, even after this amendment, will afford the local authorities the facility to change the period in the light of experience of operating the Bill.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, Senator Dardis and Senator Mulcahy stressed that two weeks might be too long a period to allow a person to get a licence for a horse if they had bought a horse and kept it some distance from where they live.  The amendment is designed to facilitate the effectiveness of the Bill.  It arises from feedback from the local authorities and the Committee Stage contributions of Senators.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The Minister may, where he or she considers it necessary or expendient to do so, <Col N="956" /> by order revoke any bye-law made by a local authority under this section.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis can take some credit for this amendment.  On Committee Stage amendment No. 27 empowered the Minister to revoke by-laws made by the local authority under section 19 dealing with exemptions from the licensing requirements.  Senators expressed strong reservations about this and I undertook to consider their views.  I examined the matter and amendment No. 27 should be deleted.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their valuable contributions to the Bill on this matter.  Local authorities may have been concerned because it could have eroded some of their powers and entrusted too much power to the Minister.  In case there would be any question about the devolution of powers to local authorities in the Bill I decided to delete the amendment.  It might have added to the effectiveness of the Bill but its withdrawal will not limit it.</P>

      <P>My purpose in tabling amendment No. 9 is to afford the local authorities more detailed information about the movement and transfer of horses.  If this amendment is accepted, it will not be sufficient for a horse owner merely to state the fact of disposal.  He must also state how the horse was disposed of, whether by sale, gift or destruction.</P>
      <P>As regards amendment No. 10, having given further thought to the words &ldquo;(where known)&rdquo;, I now believe the inclusion of such a formulation could be unhelpful to the local authorities in their efforts to keep track of horse ownership and transfers.  I want the local authorities to have express powers to require the former owner of a horse to state the name and address of the new owner.</P>
      <P>As regards amendment No. 11, as a result of consultation with the local authorities, I have decided to make provision for notification where a licensed horse dies other than by destruction. As regards amendment No. 12, I have given further consideration to section 25(2).  I now consider it prudent to allow some flexibility in the defence for the benefit of an accused.

      <P>I come from an urban area where we have had many problems with wandering horses over the past few years.  Recently an arrangement was agreed between the Garda and the contractor so that animals wandering on public roads or trespassing on council property would be collected and taken to the pound. Amendment No. 15 states that &ldquo;a local authority or a Superintendent or a person referred to in subsection (3) may refuse to release any animal detained under section 36 where it or he or she, as the case may be &mdash; (a) is not satisfied that adequate accommodation and sustenance, or if detained under section 36(2) adequate veterinary attention, will be provided for the horse&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to clarify what that means.  The pound in my area is 20 miles away from the town. Is the superintendent responsible for the town or the district and who is the designated person in the local authority?  We need to clarify this because there is no point introducing legislation which cannot be implemented.</P>

Subsection (7) states: &ldquo;Where a local authority decides to destroy, or has entered into arrangements under subsection (3) for the destruction of, a horse detained under section 36 it shall endeavour to ensure that the horse is humanely destroyed&rdquo;.  Should we not insist that the wording is changed to &ldquo;it shall ensure that the horse is humanely destroyed&rdquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision is included in the 1985 pounds regulations.  We are including this provision to keep the Bill in line with those regulations.  Local authorities pointed this out to us during our consultations with them.  If a superintendent or an authorised person is satisfied that the person who had the horse in the first case is not prepared to look after it properly or could abuse it, they can refuse to release the horse.  We were fortunate to have some time between Committee and Report Stages so that we could send the Bill to all local authorities for their advice.  This provision strengthens the Bill.</P>
      <P>To answer Senator McGennis's point, that was as a result of Senator Mulcahy who, to give him credit, raised the matter of disposing of horses in a humane fashion.  I have inserted the reference &ldquo;it shall endeavour to ensure that the horse is humanely destroyed&rdquo; to satisfy his question. While we must allow some flexibility in the wording, it is considerably stronger than the way it was previously structured.  It directs local authorities to destroy a horse in a humane way. The wording is a considerable improvement on what was there before and it will have the desired effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It points out quite clearly that the onus will be on the local authority to ensure that a horse is humanely destroyed.  The wording is important because while there are times when a local authority may not be in a position to do so, it should endeavour to.  The subsection was inserted following consultation with county councils and also because of Senator Mulcahy's amendment on Committee Stage.  He was concerned about it and I took his concerns on board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage, Senator Mulcahy moved an amendment providing that &ldquo;in every case, having the horse destroyed shall be the last option to be considered&rdquo;.  I accept that what the Minister has done tries to meet Senator Mulcahy's concern that the destruction should be humane.</P>
      <P>I have some difficulties with subsection (6) of amendment No. 15 which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> Where a horse is to be disposed of ... by way of sale or auction, the local authority or the Superintendent concerned shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the horse is not sold to the owner or keeper of the horse [I can understand that] at the time it was seized under section 36 or any person acting on his or her behalf.</P>
    <P>In a sale or auction it is quite difficult to establish that somebody is acting on behalf of the owner or keeper of the horse.  It will present certain practical difficulties and I am not sure how they can be addressed.  However, it might be preferable to have it by way of &ldquo;a person in good standing&rdquo; to give wide discretion as to whom the horse will be sold and to ensure it could not be a person acting on behalf of the owner or keeper.</P>
    <P>What penalty is there under law to prevent someone attending an auction and acting on behalf of the owner or keeper of the horse to buy it back for a small fee and then return it to them? In addition, how will it be possible to identify someone acting on behalf of the owner or keeper?  It is almost like a business arrangement at arm's length, but what does that mean?  I have a slight problem with that aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the Bill, a local authority selling a horse must take reasonable measures to prevent an unsuitable owner or keeper from buying back, or using somebody else to buy back, a horse seized from him or her.  It is as far as we can go in this instance.  It is important to spell out to local authorities that they should ensure that owners who would be considered unsuitable because of their history in dealing with and caring for horses should, as far as possible, be prevented from buying back the horse.  We inserted this provision following our trawl of local authorities.  As it stands, the wording is as far as we can go.  It does not make it an offence but the measure is strong enough to ensure that it is implemented.  I ask Senators to accept the amendment.</P>

Horses are wandering because they belong to travellers who have been rehoused or are living in a settlement.  They have no land or accommodation but they keep the horses under reasonable control where a local authority makes an effort.  Will the Minister of State clarify what is meant by adequate accommodation?  If they do not own property on which they can keep horses and if they have not leased land for that purpose, <Col N="963" /> which is what is required, does it mean that when this legislation is in force, all horses wandering in public places or on private property without authorisation will be collected and brought to pounds?  When the section is applied it means they will not be released.  While I do not wish to labour the point, it requires clarification.</P>

      <P>I understand Senator Sherlock's point.  One of the reasons we removed the word &ldquo;stabled&rdquo; in amendment No. 5 was to meet that concern.  We substituted &ldquo;maintained in a proper fashion&rdquo; instead.  The Senator referred to the travelling community.  Provided the authorised officer is satisfied the horse will be maintained in a proper fashion by whoever that person may be, the horse will be released.  By their nature, travellers may not have access to a stable but they may be able to maintain a horse in ordinary circumstances.</P>

Accordingly, I consider it prudent to widen the connotation of &ldquo;sale&rdquo; to include &ldquo;forms for transfer of ownership for value not involving money&rdquo;, in other words, barter, etc. This provision originated in a Scottish Act relating to deer.  We have engaged in wide considerations with regard to this legislation which prevents people circumventing the concept of selling because they could use barter, exchange or other forms of transaction.

      <P>Members are aware that straying horses are creating problems in many towns and cities, causing damage to property, traffic accidents and injury to persons, particularly children.  Indeed, roads add to the topicality of the issue given the construction of a major motorway on the perimeter of Dublin city in the area where there is a high concentration of horses.  Encounters between unattended horses and vehicles travelling at speed create the potential for major accidents.</P>
      <P>I accept that horse ownership is part of the traditional fabric of city life and that it has the support and participation of a broad cross-section of people in urban communities.  Horses have long been and remain a fact of economic life for many urban dwellers, including jarveys and carters.  Securing a responsible, welfare-friendly maintenance and ownership of horses is therefore a prime consideration for me.  I believe the Bill has been drafted and amended to care for the interests of both the public, especially motorists and those living in urban areas, and horse owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The many positive contributions from Members have greatly assisted in the preparation <Col N="965" /> of this important legislation and have forged a balanced approach to responsible horse ownership coupled with the protection of the public.  I reiterate that this legislation will provide a more secure and stable environment within which those who are prepared to properly maintain and control their animals, with due regard to the interests of their neighbours and other members of the community, can derive full use and enjoyment from them.  There is nothing in the Bill which need impede or obstruct anyone who wishes to put in place arrangements for the enjoyment of horses by young people which are based on proper maintenance and control of the animals.  In addition, this legislation substantially strengthens the framework of legal protection of horses throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank the many groups and individuals who gave me the benefit of their ideas and insights when drafting this Bill. At long last we have a piece of legislation which, when enacted, will devolve power to local authorities to tackle a problem which has bedevilled urban life in the past and which has greatly increased in recent years.  I also wish to thank the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals which deserve special merit and praise for their work in this area and their dedication to the welfare of animals in this city.  Without their efforts, hundreds of animals would have suffered and indeed perished.  For many years, the ISPCA and the DSPCA requested the introduction of legislation to address the particular problems associated with horse ownership in urban areas.  I assure those who supported the Bill that I will do my utmost to secure vigorous enforcement on enactment.</P>
    <P>I thank my officials for their work on the Bill. As I explained on the last occasion, in March 1995 we sat around a table with a blank piece of paper with no model on which to base the Bill. However, we have produced comprehensive legislation thanks to the input of councils, interests groups, Deputies and Senators.  I thank Members for their invaluable contributions.</P>

      <P>In my Second Stage contribution, I stated that no other legislation will have the same a direct impact on the lives of people in the area I represent as the Bill before the House.  This legislation, which the Minister of State steered through both Houses and which is a credit to him, will finally deal with the problem of horses wandering through urban areas damaging property and hurting people.  The style and manner in which the Minister of State introduced this legislation &mdash; he was always open to ideas and change as illustrated by the emergence in the Bill of amendments proposed by Senators Dardis and Mulcahy &mdash; are the hallmarks of someone who has shown great skill and dedication to this task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> A number of months ago, the Minister of State and I attended a meeting in Tallaght where he addressed a hostile crowd who outlined the severity of this problem in our community.  He took on board their suggestions, although there was a great deal of scepticism about whether the legislation could change the problem in our area in a positive manner.  With the enactment of the legislation and the speedy enforcement of its provisions by local authorities, the Minister of State will have reinforced the message that we are serious about resolving this problem once and for all.  He deserves credit for his skill and determination.  I pay special tribute to his officials for their work on this complex legislation which is probably the most worthwhile to the community I represent to be enacted during the life of this Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I also thank the Minister of State and his officials.  The Minister of State is to be commended for the way he handled this matter in terms of his grasp of the detail of the Bill.  On many occasions he did not have to refer to his officials and he was able to answer complicated questions in an effective and direct manner.  He also displayed a refreshing openness to consider and take on board ideas emanating from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Another notable characteristic of deliberations on the Bill is that the Minister of State and his officials stayed with it to the end.  It has been my experience that, when a Bill passes Committee Stage, it is no longer subject to further scrutiny. It is obvious that they have continued to scrutinise the Bill right up to the end to ensure that any deficiencies were rectified.  I share the sentiments expressed by Senator Hayes and I hope the Bill will have the desired effect.  It will only be as good as the will to enforce it and I hope the local authorities will be proactive in creating the by-laws, issuing the licences and enforcing the measures contained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage we proposed that support be provided to help train young people in horsemanship and the care of horses.  I hope these projects will be developed and will receive assistance from the Department and the Government.  The Seanad has done a good day's work.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this legislation.  Unfortunately, I did not get an opportunity to speak on any of the earlier Stages. I had the opportunity to meet the Minister a year ago with a deputation from the local authorities and I found him very helpful.  He assured us that he would bring this legislation forward as quickly as possible.  At that time he said he hoped we would be helpful to him, and I think we have been.  It is good to see a Minister come into the House with an open mind prepared to take on board the suggestions of Senators or members of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" /> Since 1985 a number of Bills attempted to deal with this problem.  I think the Minister will admit that none succeeded.  I hope this legislation will be effective and will achieve the objective that we have envisaged for it.</P>
    <P>Wandering horses kill people.  Some people have suggested that this legislation attempts to deprive young people of the enjoyment of horses. The Minister stated that there is nothing in this Bill which need impede anyone who wishes to put in place arrangements for young people to enjoy horses so long as the proper maintenance and control of these animals can be assured.  That was the fine line we all wanted to achieve in this legislation.  We need to ensure that horses are controlled, that they are not a danger to lives, that they do not kill people and we need to ensure that children in urban areas still have an opportunity to enjoy animals.</P>
    <P>The Minister has assured all who supported the Bill that he will do his utmost to secure vigorous enforcement of its provisions.  Mention is made in the Bill that he may grant some financial assistance to local authorities.  This commitment needs to be stronger.  It will cost local authorities a lot of money to enforce.</P>
    <P>In my local authority area there has been widespread intimidation of those who have been rounding up horses to the extent that members of staff have been told by young people that they knew where the officers live.  They have visited these officers' homes, threatened them and, in some cases, assaulted them.  We need to ensure that the finance and Garda support are available or else this good legislation will have been done a disservice and the work of the local authorities will be derided in the communities.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for this legislation.  It has been 20 years awaiting and I hope it is successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and his officials on this legislation.  They have closed all the loopholes and have made it as tight as possible.  The Minister trawled through Scottish law and spoke to local authorities.  They know how smart the owners of horses are at finding ways around legislation.  I was elected to my local council when the 1985 Animals Act was passed. At the time we hoped it might work in urban areas.  However, the owners of these horses found a way around that Act.  The combined expertise that the Minister has amassed should ensure that we got it right this time.</P>
      <P>I support Senator McGennis's point about the need for adequate finance.  The Minister said on Second Stage that he hoped to secure a little funding for local authorities.  I hope that money will materialise.  I also hope the legislation will be enacted soon.  This has been mentioned to many Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who represent areas where uncontrolled horses are a problem accept that there is a tradition of horses in urban areas. <Col N="968" /> However, when it comes to the balance of rights, public safety and animal welfare must be the two main considerations.  Anyone who does not respect that should not own a horse or keep one in an urban area.</P>

      <P>I also welcome this Bill which has many sections; this indicates how important it is.  I thank the Minister for steering it through the House.</P>
      <P>Section 13 which refers to local authorities is very important.  It requires the local authorities to draw up their own by-laws.  This is an area where the Minister could play a leading role.  Having seen the legislation signed into law he could ensure that the local authorities adopt those by-laws. This will be the first step in giving effect to this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Tourism and Trade to the House.  I appreciate him taking the motion as he could have sent a Minister of State.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will accept the sincerity of the motion, which is not a political one.  It has the widespread consensus of all the political parties in the north west of Ireland.  I ask the Minister to give his support to the Bill currently before the United States Congress &mdash; Reference 104, 6 June, 1996 (HR 3599) &mdash; sponsored by Congressmen Manton, King, Gilman, Walsh and Kennedy, which will allow goods produced and manufactured in Northern Ireland and certain counties in the Republic of Ireland free entry to the United States for a ten year period, a trade measure which will help to create jobs here in areas of high unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Minister represents an area with all the difficulties I believe are covered in this motion. He could not be a successful public representative in the west if his knowledge was not equal, if not better, than that of a representative from the Border counties.  Last June I travelled to the US with a group of people.  Having lobbied the Congressmen mentioned and a number of others, I believe there is a favourable climate in the US for the introduction of this legislation.  That is why the US Congressmen have taken the initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the canvassing and contact with the Congressmen, we received a strong indication we were on the right course.  Many of them indicated that the assistance the United States will give in <Col N="969" /> the future may not always be financial.  Many of the Congressmen, including Congressman Joe Kennedy, believe foreign aid from the United States will have to be restricted.  He sees there are many areas of high deprivation in need of financial support within the US.  He believes we are on the right track and that the proposal will have widespread support in the US.  The legislation went to the House Ways and Means Committee in Congress, was adopted and is currently with Congress.  When the House sits in January, it will be brought before it again.  It has also been introduced in the Senate.  We hope that the legislation, as proposed in both Congress and the Senate, will be passed.  We also hope the Minister will give it his strong support in Ireland.</P>
    <P>However much I respect them, the people who write the Minister's response may encourage him to refuse the proposal and point out the different problems and the reasons we could not accept it. I do not believe any of those reasons is valid.  A free trade relationship between the US, Northern Ireland and parts of the Republic of Ireland would mean that goods manufactured and all crops grown, including finished food products, would enter the US duty free.  Any concern that this legislation would flood Ireland or the EU with US goods is incorrect.  The legislation would be bilateral in so far as the goods would only have an advantage to the Irish producer.</P>
    <P>There will be opposition from some sections in Europe but we must understand there are various forms of trade and favoured status in Europe. The Minister is aware of all the different areas where there are trade advantages.  The free trade relationship would be modelled on the Gaza/West Bank Free Trade Act that was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton in October.  This bill expanded an already existing free trade relationship between Israel and the US. We are not breaking new ground by requesting that the Minister support this proposal.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in the Dáil, Deputy O'Hanlon asked a parliamentary question on this matter.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, replied:</P>
    <P>Despite the best efforts of the IDA, the Border counties, with the exception of County Louth, have not attracted new IDA assisted investment in recent years.  Any recent new jobs created in overseas companies in Counties Cavan and Monaghan are as a result of developments in existing companies which have increased employment levels.</P>
    <P>Those of us who represent Border counties and the west are obliged to be seen to be making a case.  We are approaching crisis point.  I am certain the Minister and those of us who represent the Border counties and the west will find a common ground when it is proposed to take Ireland out of Objective 1; I am certain the <Col N="970" /> Minister agrees the west and the Border counties are not ready for that.  The standard of living in those areas is not as high as in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Statements are made in Europe every day that our economy is terrific and that we are about to be taken out of Objective 1.  This will present a problem.  The Minister will be seen to be taking the case on behalf of the west, and we will be working on behalf of the north-west.  There is no conflict here.  I ask the Minister to support this legislation.  His support will be a tremendous help and encouragement.  Whether we meet opposition from the British Government or certain sections in Europe, I believe we will be able to tell those who oppose the legislation that certain areas in the Border counties have already been identified as deserving INTERREG or peace and reconciliation funding.  The areas marked out for special funding have been already agreed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is fully aware that there is not sufficient funding or investment in tourism in the west and in the Border counties.  He knows there are small numbers of big players who are developing the tourism industry and small operators must compete against them and against the funding that is available across the Border. The economy of the west and the Border counties should be treated seriously by every Government.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to support this legislation. This is not a political issue and his support for the legislation would be of tremendous value.  I am confident the Minister understands the need for it.</P>

Arising from the unfortunate and tragic loss of the previous Cathaoirleach, Senator Liam Naughten, you are to be commended for the high honour for which you have been chosen.  I am sure you will fulfil your role with integrity and honour in keeping with your family's contribution to politics over almost a century.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator McGowan for raising this matter.  I have no difficulty in replying to the matter.  As regards the Senator's comments in respect of tourism development facilities, I will send him details of investment in this area on the southern side of the Border from the various funds, including the European Regional Development Fund programme and the soft loan scheme being made available from the European Union for the development of such facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of matters concerning the issue before us that need to be clarified.  As I have made clear on previous occasions, I fully understand the good intentions behind this proposal to eliminate or substantially reduce the duty applied to exports to the United States from <Col N="971" /> Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  It is further evidence of the enormous goodwill which exists towards Ireland in US political circles and I am happy to place on the record my appreciation for their interest in and concern for economic development in the Border counties. However, it is important to clarify a number of critical points relating to this proposal.</P>
    <P>First, I understand that the relevant Bills which were introduced in the US Senate and the House of Representatives earlier this year have lapsed as a result of the ending of that Session of Congress prior to the recent elections.  They may or may not be reintroduced.  I also understand that this initiative does not, as yet, have the backing of President Clinton or his Administration.  Moreover, the establishment of this proposed free trade zone is not simply a matter of Bills being passed by the US Congress.</P>
    <P>Ireland and the United States are both bound by international agreements governing the regulation of trade.  The adoption of this proposal would require additional preferential access arrangements for Irish exports over and above the current GATT agreements.  Ultimately, any special tariff arrangements would also require approval by both the European Union and the World Trade Organisation.  It would be more than optimistic to assume EU agreement to preferential tariff arrangements for one region of Ireland in the context of a European Union committed to the Single Market and a level playing field for all member states.  That is why we are attending the first ministerial conference on the World Trade Organisation in Singapore.  We are holding the line, in a political sense, for liberalisation of the market, further global trade and the reduction of tariffs, as adopted by the EU.  One could reasonably expect many of our EU partners, particularly in countries which are poorer than Ireland, to argue that there are other European regions with even greater economic development needs.</P>
    <P>The creation of a free-trade zone would also require the introduction of a separate customs territory and customs border within this jurisdiction.  This would be required to ensure that goods produced in other parts of this State were excluded from the proposed preferential tariff treatment at a time when our emphasis is on dismantling barriers within this island.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that those proposing this idea are motivated by a sincere desire to contribute to the economic well-being of the Border counties. Furthermore, the United States is an important economic partner and we all support the strengthening and deepening of our economic links.  While it would be unusual for a Minister in one country to indicate support or otherwise for proposals under consideration in the legislature of another country, the Senator will understand from my remarks that I can foresee serious obstacles to the progress of this proposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> I have no doubt that the Border counties have suffered economically because of the impact of violence in Northern Ireland.  Indeed, it is as a direct result of their situation that the Border counties receive special assistance and attention through the International Fund for Ireland and the special EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation together with funding provided under wider EU programmes such as INTERREG.  In addition, the US Administration has specifically recognised the needs of the Border counties in the context of its economic activities in support of the peace process.</P>
    <P>This programme of economic co-operation with the US began with the appointment by President Clinton in December 1994 of Senator George Mitchell as his special economic advisor on Ireland.  This was followed by the White House conference on trade and investment in May 1995 which was a major and very welcome demonstration of US engagement at the highest level.  The conference provided an opportunity for one-to-one networking by Irish and US business people and for exploring avenues for potential co-operation such as joint ventures and other commercial link-ups.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity of attending the Pittsburgh conference on trade and investment in Northern Ireland and the Border counties in October.  This was a follow-up to the White House conference on trade and investment with the aim of developing further the areas of potential economic co-operation identified at last year's conference.  Some 50 Irish companies from Northern Ireland and the Border counties attended and participated in at least 400 matchmaking meetings with representatives from 125 US companies.  A number of these companies agreed contracts with their US counterparts and others are and will be following up closely on opportunities identified at the conference in the weeks ahead.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the attention being given by the US Department of Commerce and by President Clinton's Administration to developing trade and investment ties with the Border counties will lead to significant economic benefits for the region.  I assure the House that my Department and the agencies for which I have responsibility, including An Bord Tráchtála and Bord Fáilte, will continue to co-operate closely with the Department of Commerce in facilitating this important work.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator McGowan for raising this matter out of a genuine concern and understanding for the development of this region but I am sure he appreciates the difficulties and obstacles that would be placed in the way of such development.  One must wait and see whether these Bills are reintroduced in Congress and the House of Representatives and if so what level of support they will attract there.</P>
    <P>I would be happy to liaise with Senator McGowan and the Seanad at any time to keep <Col N="973" /> them updated on general economic development within the Border areas or specifically in relation to other questions arising from this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, for taking this Adjournment on behalf of the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>I have received many representations on pay conditions from people working in the area of physiotherapy.  They are seeking parity with other health grade professionals.  Physiotherapists must complete a B.Sc. or B.A. degree, which represents a high standard of attainment.  Despite this, there are considerable differences in pay compared with other graduate health professionals.  The top basic rate of pay for physiotherapists is £18,558 per annum, a level that is only achieved after ten years after graduation.  By comparison, a social worker can earn £20,592 per annum after eight years.  The top salary scale for a senior physiotherapist is £20,096 per annum, which approximates to the salary for Senators.  By comparison, pharmacists can earn £24,701 after nine years, while a senior pharmacist can earn £27,854 at the top of the scale.</P>
      <P>If one was cynical a factor which could be considered in explaining the difference in pay between the health professionals is the fact that the staff members of the physiotherapy profession are predominantly female.  In my experience of working in the health services, females tend to earn a little less than their male counterparts.  In addition, it has been 17 years since the last pay review for physiotherapists.  If this were happening in any other profession there would be a revolt.</P>
      <P>The job role of physiotherapists has changed greatly in the past number of years.  They are now more specialised and there is a greater emphasis on technology.  They play a vital role in modern health and community care and have a wide range of skills and specialisms.  Doubtless in his days as a football player the Minister of State experienced their skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> Two-thirds of the physiotherapists trained in Ireland in 1994 are currently working in the US or England.  This is primarily because the pay and conditions are very poor in Ireland.  Irish hospitals are finding it difficult to recruit physiotherapy staff.  This is especially the case for County Donegal.  The North-Western Health Board, which covers Counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim, has only approximately 35 physiotherapists to cover the three counties.</P>
    <P>Pay negotiations with the Department of Health under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> have been ongoing for two years but little progress has been made.  Will the Minister intervene to achieve genuine progress?  The work of the physiotherapists is recognised as an integral part of health care.  I hope the situation will be recognised by the Department and the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health.  I thank Senator Maloney for giving me this opportunity to respond to the issue he has raised on the pay claim by physiotherapists.</P>
      <P>I owe a debt of gratitude to many physiotherapists who worked on my various injuries when I played football; they succeeded in extending my football career by at least five years.  I am also fortunate to have no aches and pains today.  I received several injuries at the hands of tough Dublin and Cork men but because of treatment by professional physiotherapists I am now free of injury.</P>
      <P>Physiotherapists are highly professional people, providing a very important service that is becoming increasingly recognised and needed. Increasing numbers of people realise that treatment from qualified physiotherapists helps in the restoration of health and recovery from injury.  There is now a greater appreciation of the value of physiotherapy than in the past.</P>
      <P>I presume that the review referred to by the Senator is that of the 1978 working party established to examine the grading structure for physiotherapists in hospitals.  The report of the working party was circulated in 1979, however, it was not a pay review.</P>
      <P>Similar to all other paramedical professions, physiotherapists have benefited in full from all standard and special pay awards under the various national pay programmes.  The relative position of physiotherapists, in terms of remuneration, has been maintained with those of their colleagues in other paramedical disciplines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IMPACT is currently pursuing a claim under Clause 2(iii), Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, on behalf of physiotherapists.  These negotiations are complex and are ongoing under the auspices of the Health <Col N="975" /> Services Employers Agency with a view to arriving at a mutually satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible.  In these circumstances I am sure Senator Maloney will appreciate that any further comment would not be appropriate or helpful. However, I will convey his sentiments to the Minister for Health tomorrow.</P>
