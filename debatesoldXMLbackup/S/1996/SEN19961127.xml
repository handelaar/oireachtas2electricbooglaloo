      <P>I have notice from Senator Fitzgerald that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to carry out an investigation into the new sewage treatment plant in Dingle, County Kerry, which he approved and financed, as it is failing to treat the waste from the fish processing plants in the area.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Sullivan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to review the conditions for qualifying for carer's allowance so that an adult daughter or son who cares for a parent on a full-time basis can more easily qualify.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make a statement on the prevalence of MRSA in Irish hospitals.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to give a commitment for the construction of phase 2 of Castleknock community college.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGowan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism and Trade to support the Bill currently before the United States Congress, sponsored by Congressmen Manton, King, Gilman, Walsh and Kennedy, which will allow goods and products manufactured in Northern Ireland and certain counties in the Republic of Ireland free entry into the United States for a ten year period, a trade measure which will help to create jobs in areas of high unemployment in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> I have also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to review the level of remuneration payable to physiotherapists in view of the fact that 17 years have elapsed since the last review.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Sherlock of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to intervene immediately with the Mercy Order, which has decided to close St. Mary's secondary school, Buttevant, County Cork.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to approve a grant for the provision of facilities for victims of violence in Ennis in accordance with the plans of Clare Haven House project.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Fitzgerald's and Senator O'Sullivan's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7.  Items 1,2,3 and 4 will be taken from the end of the Order of Business to conclude by 12 noon.  The four motions may be debated together.</P>
      <P>Item 5 &mdash; Election of Cathaoirleach &mdash; will take place at 12 o'clock.  Under Standing Order 4 &mdash; Election of Cathaoirleach &mdash; the Chair will be taken by Senator McGowan, who has the longest continuous period of service in the Seanad.  If a question must be put to bring the debate to a conclusion, the Chair will be vacated and the Clerk will make a decision and declare the result.</P>
      <P>Item 6 will be taken from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. However, if the election of Cathaoirleach has not concluded by 2 p.m. the debate will continue until it concludes and item 6 will then be taken.  Item 7 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Leader for outlining the procedure for the election of Cathaoirleach.  If there is an equality of votes, I suggest that the House should adjourn for a half <Col N="727" /> an hour and then deal with the matter again. Parliamentary precedents dictate that issues which cannot be resolved should be taken again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope the Labour Party survives its difficult Private Members' time this evening. Much as we appreciate the opportunity to discuss Zairean matters, which are important, and while it is prudent to be cautious, caution can be overdone and a little risk keeps everybody on their toes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that might be the greatest recommendation as to why he should be in the Chair.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to welcome back my colleague, Senator Honan.  I am some what concerned about the number of matters on the Adjournment.  It appears to increase in direct proportion to the proximity of an election.  Last week I asked the Leader the same question voiced by Senator Wright regarding the credit union legislation.  The Leader indicated that he hoped to have an answer this week.</P>
      <P>My other question has been raised on a number of occasions and relates to economic and monetary union, European enlargement and the single currency.  Could the Leader indicate when the House will be given an opportunity to discuss that issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House indicate when it is intended to resume the debate on the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, which commenced last week?  Will he also assure us that when the debate is resumed the House will not be misled as it was during that debate?  Last week I raised the issue of the role and responsibility of the Minister for Justice in respect of the prison service and administration of the courts.  The House is entitled to have proper order but the Minister of State gave no indication during the <Col N="728" /> debate that he or the Government had changed their position.  That fact was deliberately kept from us and it demonstrates contempt for this House.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister for Justice had not told the Minister of State about the change.  Perhaps nobody in that Government tells anybody about the decisions that are taken.  I want an assurance from the Leader of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We raised this matter last week and the Government side sat back and hoped nothing would come of it.  This House was deliberately misled and I want to be assured by the Leader that when discussion of the Bill resumes we will not be abused and misled again. The Minister should come before the House and deliver a full statement on what this confused Government plans to do in relation to prisons and courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Perry Mason of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister for Justice come to the Seanad to give us an update on the Refugee Bill?  I sought such a visit a few weeks ago in the context of a number of Cuban refugees and an Algerian citizen who appear to have been harshly treated in this regard.  However, a former Mexican President who is under serious investigation appears to be receiving favourable treatment.  We must examine how Carlos Salinas de Gortari is being treated in comparison with the treatment of more vulnerable and less well known refugees.</P>
      <P>Would it be possible to have a debate on transport, in light of the impact of the French transport strike on Irish hauliers?  We should also discuss the information revealed on the radio this morning where it was shown that everybody involved in the road haulage industry maintains it is impossible to make a profit and obey the law with regard to tachographs.  That matter and the large number of road accidents must cause concern, particularly at Christmas.  The Seanad met last week in sad conclave to pay tribute to the former Cathaoirleach, Senator Naughten.  We must be very careful in considering road transport, especially in light of our recent experience.</P>
      <P>I serve notice that when the new Cathaoirleach is elected today I will seek an Adjournment debate on another matter.  Many Senators, when paying tribute to Senator Naughten, said the pressures put on public servants were extreme and were a contributory factor in his death.  Is the Leader aware that the Chief State Pathologist, Dr. John Harbison, is also under considerable pressure and that in the last few days he was injured in an accident?  Will it be possible to raise this on the Adjournment to try to get additional resources so that this valuable civil servant's life is not also placed in jeopardy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>On previous occasions I called on the Leader to organise a debate on the milk quota system; I am surprised other Senators from rural areas are not doing the same.  A review of the milk quota system is supposed to take place in the year 2000 when it could even be abolished. While some progressive farmers would like to see it abolished, that would bring financial ruin to many others.</P>
      <P>All the indications are that consumers are paying too much for milk.  Milk producers are paying 50p a gallon for the privilege of producing it, while milk from Northern Ireland is being retailed more cheaply than milk produced locally. A debate on a serious matter like this, which affects consumers, farmers and factory workers, would be in sharp contrast to some of the matters which are being debated daily in the Lower House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate when we might have a debate on the funding of local authorities?  I have continually been asking for such a debate.  Most local authorities have by now held their estimates meetings and there are rumours that service charges will be withdrawn. Potential candidates preparing for the next election have indicated privately that service charges will be withdrawn.  All of us would welcome that; they should never have been introduced in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>They should have been abolished by the Senator's Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into hostilities.  I could give an answer but I will not. The Leader should look at this as an urgent matter.  Local authorities deserve that.  Senators are also local authority representatives.  We have a responsibility to get clarification on this important matter which should be treated more urgently than any other before the House.  Local authorities must know where they stand financially.  Even if the Minister is not available, we should still be told whether service charges will be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>When will we have a debate on the National Roads Authority?  When the Leader of the House was in Opposition he called for such a debate several times but a few years have passed and we still have not had one.  I know he supports my call.  We would not need a Minister in the House when we express our views on this serious matter. I urge the Leader to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards references to the State Pathologist's Office, an office for the Assistant State Pathologist, Dr. Margaret Bolster, should be established in Cork.  Will the Leader bear that in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>A very good idea.  I support that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on press libel cases?  Could an ombudsman be <Col N="730" /> appointed to deal with such cases rather than having expensive legal arguments?  It is obvious that poor people who are the subject of libel cannot oppose the media.  There should be some system whereby these people could avail of the services of an ombudsman or another officer of the State in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>What has that to do with the price of dog food?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>When first elected to the Seanad I represented the Irish Road Hauliers' Association, many of whose members are feeling the pinch, through no fault of their own, because they are stranded in France.  It is time the Minister for Foreign Affairs intervened to help those people. Why should Irish hauliers, who are the lifeblood of industry in Ireland, be affected by an internal feud in France?</P>
      <P>On a radio programme this morning, a priest living in Connemara stated that he is involved in the operation of a co-operative.  He indicated that drivers working for the co-operative can travel to and from France without breaking the law. However, even using two drivers, it cannot transport goods to Cork without breaking the law.  I suggest that the House debate the issue of hauliers who are trying to compete for business and make a living.  Perhaps the Department of the Environment could appoint inspectors to travel on haulage trucks to see the situation firsthand. It is easy for bureaucrats in cosy offices to make decisions but they must be made aware of the hardship endured by hauliers in transporting produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health to intervene urgently to avert the proposed nurses' strike, which is due to take place early next year?  I accept that the Government has done much to meet the demands of nurses but there seems to be a number of outstanding matters which, according to P.J. Madden of the INO, could be solved by the allocation of an additional £5 million.  In view of the hardship that will be faced by patients and the public if the health services come to a standstill in the new year, I ask the Minister to intervene as a matter of urgency to resolve this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader consider making time available for a debate on Northern Ireland? We avoided this issue before the summer recess and, when all hell broke loose, there was a rush of debates in both Houses.  The Seanad rightly shows extreme concern for problems in other countries, whether these involve refugees or otherwise.  However, we should not be allowed to forget Irish prisoners in English jails and the conditions they must endure.  Mr. Major made a number of statements on Northern Ireland in recent days and this is a worrying time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House has had the privilege of hearing the voices of the late Senator Wilson and Senators <Col N="731" /> McAughtry and Haughey in connection with Northern Irish affairs.  It is important that the House be made aware of what is occurring in Northern Ireland.  If possible, I call for a debate to be held before Christmas on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Maloney's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Honan's call for intervention by the Minister for Health in the nurses' dispute.  It would be unfortunate if a nurses' strike took place and we must avert fears on the part of members of the public, patients and the families of people in hospital in this regard.  While the Minister has gone quite far, he should go one step further and resolve the matter without the need for an industrial dispute.  It would be unfortunate if nurses were obliged to picket hospitals after Christmas and I call on the Leader to inform the Minister that he should try to resolve this matter.</P>
      <P>I join in the calls for the Government to intervene at EU level, particularly with the French Government, regarding the hauliers' strike in France.  The position is of grave importance and is causing great hardship and it will have a major financial impact on Irish exporters to Europe.  If we are to be partners in Europe then the free flow of produce must be allowed to take place.  This is not happening at the moment.  People exporting to France are having their businesses undermined and a Government initiative is necessary.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Maloney in calling for a debate on Northern Ireland.  We are all a little worried by the perceived developments, or lack of developments, in the last 12 to 24 hours.  I appreciate that the Tánaiste has spoken and has indicated that there is no change.  However, people are worried and a constructive debate in this House would be helpful.  I know Senators will be responsible as they always have been in the past.  Would the Leader consider such a debate if not immediately then sometime before Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Sherlock's comments about the division of responsibility between the State pathologist and his deputy.  It makes sense that the country be divided to allow for a more efficient service.</P>
      <P>I support Senator McGowan's call for a debate on the National Roads Authority but I would include in such a debate some of the comments made by Senator Farrell in relation to trucks.  I have some sympathy for the truck drivers. However, these juggernauts pass one out on the Naas Road travelling at 70 and 80 miles per hour. They are massive trucks and there is no hope of stopping quickly in an emergency.  They break the law every day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a ridiculous and unfair comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a grossly unfair comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>How can it be unfair?  Senator O'Toole should not be such a hypocrite.  The evidence is there.  If one gets behind a truck and breaks the law at 75 miles per hour these trucks can still pass one out.  The situation is ridiculous and should be included in any debate on transportation or on the National Roads Authority.</P>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Finneran.  The French always seem to opt in and out of the EU at their convenience.  This is a case where the Treaty of Rome is being flouted.  The free movement of goods and services is being prohibited and the French fold their arms and do nothing.  This is not only causing immense damage economically but, as we saw in this morning's newspapers, drivers are getting involved in fisticuffs.  The French simply shrug their shoulders in a Gallic fashion and say &ldquo;what can we do&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Finneran's and Senator Maloney's call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  We are at a very delicate and difficult stage and, while one must always be mindful not to get into a debate which would be unhelpful, if we had a debate and heard the views of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and those concerned it would be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know Senators have talked and read about BSE.  However, it is alarming that recent revelations anticipate that in five to ten year's time a large number of people in England will show symptoms of CJD because they have been eating hamburgers since the early 1980s.  Salesyards on the northern side of the Border have increased their business threefold in the past three months. In Northern Ireland animals suffering from BSE are reported to have a market value of £3,000 per head for re-import into the Republic illegally; this <Col N="733" /> must be dealt with.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to look at this matter?  We have laws in this regard.  Although the Minister is doing much at present, this serious situation needs attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate if we are to have a debate on transport?  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications should come to the House to discuss the impact of European regulations which prohibit drivers driving after a certain number of hours per day and which will result in hauliers going out of business.  Will the Leader convey our thanks to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry for his efforts in securing the price of beef which has increased by 12p per pound in the past month and a half.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to an issue raised on the air waves &mdash; the treatment of young people by bouncers at certain venues.  Some bouncers are taking the law into their own hands. Senator Farrelly was to raise the issue with the Minister for Justice.  What progress has he made in this regard?  Did he arrange a meeting with the Minister for Justice as easily as he got through to the radio station?  It is disturbing, particularly for country people coming to Dublin, to see bouncers take the law into their own hands and almost beat people to death.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Finneran's request for Government action on the threatened nurses dispute which will lead to chaos in hospitals and institutions.  Thousands of people awaiting serious medical treatment will be further delayed.  It is unacceptable that the Minister for Health is not taking action to deal with this developing crisis. Will the Leader arrange for the Minister to come to the House to outline the state of play in relation to the dispute between the Department and the nursing profession and what action he proposes to take to avert a crisis?</P>

    <P>I support Senator McGowan's call for a debate on local charges and the need for the Minister for the Environment to clarify the situation.  New rates have been struck in some towns for the coming year.  There has been an increase of approximately 45 per cent in Ennis which puts severe pressure on commercial people who are funding local authorities to an ever-increasing level.  This matter should be dealt with urgently but the Minister for the Environment is not doing so, if anything he is avoiding the matter.  Will the <Col N="734" /> Leader ask the Minister to clarify what he proposes to do about local funding?</P>

      <P>Senator Wright asked about the Credit Union Bill about which I hope to have precise information today or tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked what would happen in the event of an equality of votes in the election of a new Cathaoirleach.  He raised this issue with me before and I now have the information. Although it is the item after next on the Order of Business, I will answer it now.  A vote is taken separately on each candidate if there is a contest so there would be no equality between the two candidates.  If there is an equality of votes on the first vote, the Clerk will then decide the issue in the negative.  She does not have freedom of action in the matter.  A vote then takes place on the second candidate.  If there is an equality, a decision is again taken in the negative by the Clerk.  That is the procedure and I trust it clarifies the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis asked about the debate on economic and monetary union which will be on Wednesday, 4 December.</P>
      <P>I do not have the resumption date for the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, about which Senator O'Kennedy asked but I expect it to resume within two weeks.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris asked about the Refugee Bill, 1996.  I have detailed information from the Minister for Foreign Affairs about its implementation which I will make available to anyone who wants it.</P>
      <P>A number of people raised the issue of transport.  I have no difficulty with a debate on transport in the near future.  I do not think the Government can do much by intervening to resolve the French dispute which is bitter and nasty.  It is possible that outside intervention, apart from being ineffectual, might make things worse.  I was heartened to hear Irish officials in the Embassy in Paris being praised for the help they are giving to people who are caught up in a quarrel which is not of their making, which is doing terrible harm to Irish industry and which is a disgrace to the way the French carry out their public business.  It is sad that the innocent people are affected but I was pleased to hear the Embassy staff praised for its efforts.</P>
      <P>Senator Townsend asked for a milk quota debate.  Item 12 on today's Order Paper will be taken shortly and should provide plenty of opportunity for Senator Townsend and others to ask questions.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan asked for a debate on local authority funding.  That will take place and I will try to have a date for him today.  I expect it to take place within two to three weeks and before the Christmas recess.  His request for a discussion on the National Roads Authority would come under a transport debate.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Protection of Employment Order, 1996,</P>

      <P>This is the first time I have been in the Seanad since the death of the Cathaoirleach, Senator Liam Naughten.  I extend my sympathy to his family and the Seanad on their loss.  He was a man of great dignity and kindness and was well respected by everyone.  The Seanad has suffered much loss with the deaths of two other well respected and well liked Senators, Seán Fallon and Gordon Wilson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion now introduced seeks the approval of Seanad Éireann for three sets of draft regulations which I propose to make under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996.  The Act, which was passed by both Houses and signed into law by the President last June, revises and extends the legislation relating to the protection of children and young people in employment.  It repeals the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977, and also gives effect to the EU Council Directive on the Protection of Young People at Work.  This <Col N="736" /> legislation repeals and re-enacts existing provisions and consolidates them in one Act.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to bring the Act into operation by way of a commencement order as soon as these regulations, which are necessary to give the legislation full effect, are approved.  The first set of regulations, being made under section 8(1) of the Act, modify the application of the Act to young persons employed in the fishing or shipping sectors.  It is proposed that the provisions relating to working hours and night work will not apply to such young persons.  These sectors were exempted from those provisions in the 1977 Act and the EU Directive, Articles 8(5) and 9(2), also allows a derogation for these sectors from those provisions where there are objective grounds for doing so.  The employment of such workers is usually intermittent and seasonal and may entail long spells on and off duty.  For these reasons, compliance with those provisions would be impractical.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that young workers are covered by other provisions including minimum age. Furthermore, any young person assigned to night work must have equivalent compensatory rest time.  Under regulations I propose to make under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, a young person will be entitled to a free assessment of his or her capabilities before assignment to night work and at regular intervals thereafter.</P>
    <P>The second set of regulations, proposed under section 9 of the Act, exclude close relatives from certain provisions of the Act.  These provisions are those on the prohibition of employment of children, duties of employer, working hours and time spent on vocational training.  These regulations will replace similar regulations made under the 1977 legislation.  Close relatives are family members &mdash; spouse, father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, stepfather, stepmother, brother, sister, half-brother or half-sister &mdash; who are employed in the private dwelling house or on a farm where both employer and employee reside or in a family undertaking. These regulations will facilitate young people who wish to work on a family farm or in a family business.</P>
    <P>The third set of regulations being made under section 28 of the Act prescribe the abstract of the Act which is required to be displayed by every employer of young people at the premises where the young people work.  An employer who does not display the prescribed abstract of the Act shall be guilty of an offence and may, on summary conviction, be fined up to £1,500 and a further £250 per day in the case of a continuing offence.  The abstract summarises in simple language the main rules on employing people under 18 and will be available, free of charge, in both poster and leaflet from from the information unit of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The poster is attractive and will be eye-catching to young people, unlike the usual boring regulations posters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> Senator O'Toole will be interested to know that, as promised on Report Stage, I also propose to make regulations under the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994, whereby the employer will be required to give a copy of the abstract to every employee under 18 within one month of the employee starting work.  I have an abstract to show the Senator.</P>
    <P>It is important that young people know their rights and entitlements under the legislation and an information campaign about the Act will be launched as soon as the commencement order is made.  It will involve contacting schools, organisations representing young people and employers of young people.</P>
    <P>I commend the regulations to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this issue again.  It has been discussed in depth and the Minister is aware of my views on particular aspects of it.  We are succumbing to an EU directive to the nth degree. Everything is based on a European model and there is nothing left of the Irish model; this worries me a great deal.  However, the provisions concerning close relatives should be excluded from the Act.  One could not possibly apply the rules of a normal business to a family business.  I have no difficulty with that because in a family business relations are employed.  There are many other areas, such as the shipping and racing industries, where it would be difficult to regulate and enforce the provisions of the Act.  I raised this matter with regard to service industries which do not operate from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and do not have a normal working routine as I felt they were excluded.  The type of work coming on stream is totally different.  The nine to five job is gone; people work flexi-hours.  How will these provisions be enforced?  Will an inspector from the Department Enterprise and Employment be involved?  If so, what will be his or her brief in terms of doing a spot check on a business, such as walking into a bar at 11 o'clock in the evening to check if someone under the age of 16 is working?  This is a difficult area to monitor.</P>
      <P>I agree with the thrust of this debate on protecting young people in employment but it has become too concerned with legalities.  It should be left to the school authority and parents to decide whether a 15 year old child can work. They should be allowed to work if they can cope. Age and maturity cannot be described in the one vein because one 14 year old could act like a seven year old and another could act like a 20 year old.  One cannot impose a chronological limit on them.  More flexibility would allow school authorities to have an input.  They have been excluded except in regard to work experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education is of primary importance for young people.  However, education and the workplace cannot be separated.  It is crazy to suggest that a transition year student, who would not have much homework, cannot work in the local supermarket <Col N="738" /> for two or three hours in the afternoon or evening because it would endanger their health and their studies.</P>
    <P>These provisions will be difficult to enforce. Many young people would take up employment tomorrow morning if it were available.  They would not stay in school until the age of 18 years, rather they would leave at 15 or 16 years if they could get a job or an apprenticeship.  We should be more flexible and have greater consideration for Irish rather than European concerns.</P>
    <P>These regulations, which are welcome, deal with close relatives, the fishing industry and the display of information.  Schools, employers and the public should have information on the Act. Many people do not know what the legislation or the regulations are about.  Some of my colleagues could not believe that young people who at present can work while in their transition year at school will no longer be able to do so.</P>
    <P>At a discussion in another forum the view expressed was that the provisions should be much more flexible and that there should have been more consultation with the educational institutions and the employers.  We must forge greater links between schools and employers.  The future of employment lies in the preparation for work through education.  However, it is not right to so limit the number of hours per week that children may work.</P>
    <P>However, I endorse the regulations covering close relatives, the fishing industry, the racing industry and the display of information on the Act.  We must ensure such information is made available in user friendly language so that young people will know their rights.  I often have difficulty understanding the jargon in Acts and regulations.  This is important legislation which will have a great effect on young people.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is a constant cause for concern and I do not think this legislation will be helpful in that regard.  Employers will not employ people because of the extent of regulation and bureaucracy.  There should be more flexibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister of State for her expression of sympathy on the death of the Cathaoirleach, the late Senator Naughten.  A nice tribute was paid to him on &ldquo;A Week in Politics&rdquo; on RTÉ and it brought home to me that he will no longer be with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be much discussion about the regulations before the House but they will become law.  We have passed many regulations over the years.  Those relating to hauliers were referred to earlier.  Such regulations were conceived by bureaucrats and they cannot always be implemented properly on a day-to-day basis. The bureaucrats are trying to ensure that children are not abused, especially those who have the opportunity to go to school.  This legislation is to protect children who might otherwise be sent out to work full-time or almost full-time.  However, I do not know if these regulations will achieve that <Col N="739" /> objective but they will have a ripple effect on the employers and the young people themselves.</P>
    <P>We are deciding to exclude the fishing, shipping and racing industries.  Last night I spoke to someone involved in the mushroom industry about the employment hours and rules of that industry.  In the summer young people could start work at 5 a.m. or 5.30 a.m. until 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. That industry should have been mentioned in this House.  However, I would not have thought of it and I told him that nobody from his organisation had presented a case to any politician.  I told him that if they wanted to put their case, they should make it professionally as other organisations do. He said he would.  All parties should be aware of working hours, PRSI payments and other details of this part-time labour.  Huge numbers of people in this industry work unsocial hours.</P>
    <P>In my day one spent one's first four hours working on the farm everyday, including Saturday and Sunday.  In the evening one got time to do one's schoolwork.  There was not the same emphasis on education then as there is now and everybody had to do their bit.  My uncle lived nearby and there were five girls and one boy in that house.  In my house there were five boys and one girl but the five girls did the same work as the boys.  It is unrealistic to make rules and regulations for a family business, be it a farm or small shop.  Everybody likes to participate.</P>
    <P>These regulations finalise a long and worthwhile discussion we had on this legislation some months ago.  We cannot stop the clock but it would be interesting if, in 12 months' time, the Minister would give us an update on how these regulations are working.  What problems, if any, are they causing for employers or young people who want to work?  We have raised the age to 16 but all Members would agree there is no point passing the legislation and saying: &ldquo;There it is. We have informed all participants, employers and schools, and provided glossy brochures&rdquo;. However, it would be nice to know in 12 months' time what impact it is having on the ground.  We should not pass regulations, even if they are in response to EU Directives, and think they will stand forever.  We should review the matter.  I am sure the Minister would like a report on how the legislation is working and whether some aspects need to be changed.  I hope she takes that aspect on board.</P>
    <P>I welcome these regulations.  The next major legislation from this Minister concerns the number of hours people will be allowed to work.  I have been contacted by more people, particularly young people working in the service industry, about that Bill than about any other legislation proposed in these Houses.  There will be long and hard discussions about who should be exempt from the provisions of the Bill.  The number of service industry jobs has increased substantially in the last few years and most people in that sector work far longer than 48 hours a week.  We will have an interesting debate on that Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank and compliment the Minister on the open and co-operative way she consulted people when dealing with the legislation.  I raised issues with her Department and advisers who provided a good example of how to get the best from legislation.  This was a fair, honest and effective attempt to meet the needs of different sides of the argument.  I have no hesitation in supporting the draft regulations the Minister has put before us this morning.  The Minister correctly and properly anticipated my question, which related to the next regulation.  I accept her assurance that it will come onstream quickly.</P>
      <P>An information campaign is crucial.  I am glad the Minister has provided information in a creative way.  It will not be just another boring document from a Department, it will be a bright, attractive brochure which will attract interest.  I have a fundamental difference with Senator Farrelly as regards family businesses.  Had these regulations been in place when I was a teenager working for my mother and uncle, I would have rammed them down their throats and gone to the disco.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I was tied behind the counter.  Much as I support the legislation, many young people working for their parents, uncles or aunts probably wish it was not being introduced because there is nothing as bad as being tied down when your friends and colleagues are going out.</P>
      <P>I compliment the draughtspersons for their work on this legislation.  They have supported the Minister admirably in putting across complicated viewpoints.  We had many arguments in this House, especially on Committee Stage.  That was healthy.  It is good that we have been able to make progress.</P>
      <P>On one of my days off, I was marooned on Lough Ree &mdash; my boat had broken down and was far away &mdash; when the Minister rang to discuss an aspect of the legislation.  I was at a serious disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill aims to find a balance between the need to give young people experience of the workplace and to protect them from exploitation. I share many of Senator Ormonde's reservations. I raised the Order in Congress and other fora as well as in this House.  I was reluctant to move along these lines but sometimes one has to decide which is the worst kind of exploitation &mdash; someone doing nothing and being offered drugs or someone being overworked by an unscrupulous employer.  One should not have to make that choice.  The Minister has struck the right balance.  The regulations must be implemented.  It is important that they meet the needs of Congress.  I discussed them this morning with the relevant section of ICTU, which is <Col N="741" /> delighted that the matter is being dealt with in such a pro-active way.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased about the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) (Prescribed Abstract) Regulations, 1996, which provide for the display of the abstract in places of employment.  I specifically asked for this and I am glad the Minister acceded to my request during the discussion.  There is more to the legislation than a clampdown on unscrupulous employers.  It also involves informing people about what they should be doing.  The fact that the abstract must be displayed in every workplace means it will be read and even if people say it is ridiculous at least they will be aware of the law.  Senator Ormonde was correct to argue that no one knows about this legislation.  The same could have been said about the Employment Equality Act, 1977 &mdash; no one knew or cared about that Act either but when it began to impinge on some firms and a few headline cases emerged, people became aware of it.  Regrettably, attitudes sometimes change after legislation has been implemented rather than before.  That is how society works and it may happen on this occasion also.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for being open to suggestion.  In contrast to Senator Farrelly, I will be courageously on the Minister's side as far as the legislation on work hours is concerned and I will insist that her Government partners support her.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and, like Senator Ormonde, I will not go into much detail because we have already debated the legislation. I am glad the Minister responded so positively during the deliberations in the Seanad, especially to the points raised by Senator O'Toole.  It appears the information will be well displayed in the workplace and that employers will be obliged to inform young people.  I am glad the Minister intends to make regulations under the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994 in order to add to the availability of information and I look forward to the colourful posters which she promised.</P>
      <P>The main point made during the debate on the legislation concerned the primacy of education for young people and the importance of protecting them from anything which might divert them from it.  In that regard, it is most important that we have protective legislation. Senator Ormonde was concerned about transition year students; I thought they were covered by the provision allowing people aged 14 and over to work 40 hours a week if it counts as work experience or to work 35 hours a week during holidays.  I am sure the Minister will refer to this but that provision appears to cover the Senator's concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then they would be covered by this provision, which refers to those aged 14 and over.  It is my understanding that 16 year olds can work 40 hours per week but I am sure the Minister will clarify this.</P>
      <P>I was concerned when I heard Deputy Harney say in the Dáil that these regulations would restrict the pocket money young people can earn. We should restrict their pocket money and we should emphasise the importance of education. Deputy Harney also implied this would restrict employers who are trying to compete in international markets.  However, that is not the case because young people are doing service work.  There are only so many supermarket shelves to be stacked, glasses to be collected and newspapers to be delivered.</P>
      <P>It is important that young people do not take up work which could be done by people who are trying to make a living.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul published a report recently in which it expressed serious concern at the growing divide between the haves and the have nots.  We must realise there is only so much work to be done, although we can increase jobs through international trading.  Young people should not be allowed to work 17 or 18 hours a week when someone else has no work.  I support the Minister in this regard.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about family life and solving the problems in society we must look at the other side of the coin.  If a young person spends too much time working while trying to get an education, how much time will they have for sport, for helping in the home, for their grandparents and their younger brothers and sisters?  We must ensure there is a balance in young people's lives.  Young people love money and they will work all the hours they can get so they can buy the more expensive jeans or runners.  There is a social obligation on us to protect young people.  We often allow people to work long hours.  This means they may not have time to do their duties at home and the person who stays at home will have to care for elderly relatives or young dependent children.  We must introduce legislation if we want to improve society.</P>
      <P>I welcome these regulations and the availability of information.  I hope the regulations will be implemented and monitored by the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indifferent about these regulations because they should have been introduced with the legislation.  It is only a few months since we discussed the Bill and already we are introducing exclusions.  I dislike the idea of introducing legislation in May and, within the year, introducing regulations to provide certain exclusions.  That creates uncertainty as to whether we are serious about this matter.  It also allows a situation to develop where people who have already been excluded do not have to comply with these regulations.  It opens the floodgates and creates disrespect for the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> I recall discussing legislation on the employment of young people in these Houses 20 years ago and we do not seem to have advanced much.  It is difficult to legislate for everyday activities if they continue regardless of whether we have introduced legislation.  If we are serious about this issue, we should introduce a regulation so that young people would have to give an employer an identification card before they get work.  When this legislation is fully implemented, will a young person be able to give an employer a certificate which enables them to get work?  Will the employer be able to say they will not get employment if they do not have that certificate?</P>
    <P>How many more exclusions and regulations will be introduced under this legislation?  There are a number of provisions in the legislation for the making of regulations.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify when she will introduce them.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about exclusions relating to night work, especially for young people in the fishing industry.  Fishing is a dangerous business; night fishing is dangerous work.  I am not satisfied that it is wise to introduce exclusions in this area. Perhaps the Minister could clarify why she feels it is necessary to exclude young people from night fishing activities, probably the most dangerous activity in which any person could be employed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify what type of research is being done to ascertain how many young people are employed and the type of work they are doing.  Many young people are not concerned about pocket money, as Senator O'Sullivan said.  In my experience, a big percentage of the money earned by young people is used to take some of the pressure off their parents who are trying to keep children at school and to keep the family together.  Some of the money earned by young people is used to fund their further education.  The point was raised when we discussed this issue before that the work done by young people to provide the necessary funding to see them through college might be curtailed.  This is a good way to spend the money earned.  I am concerned about the number of young professional people who cannot find employment and the fact that the State has given them little assistance in doing so.</P>
    <P>We should introduce all legislation together rather than introducing a Bill in May, regulations in November and further regulations in the new year.  This creates a lack of confidence and suggests we are not serious about this issue.  In the long-term people will probably seek more exclusions and this will undermine the legislation. I do not oppose this, but it is unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for the debate which included some of the issues we discussed in May and raised others we will discuss in the future in relation to working time.  As a parent of teenagers, I strongly agree with Senator O'Sullivan about the <Col N="744" /> importance of young people having balance in their lives.  They must have time for school, school work and study, which is essential for careers, and for friends, sport and relatives.  Work should be kept in proportion.  Work experience is good for young people and it is permitted under the legislation.  However, it is important to keep a sense of balance.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly and Senator Ormonde asked about research.  Research shows that young people who leave school early, whether to take up dead end employment or to do nothing, are most likely to become tomorrow's long-term unemployed.  That is why under this Bill employment of young people is set firmly in the context that schooling comes first.  The best thing we can do for young people is to encourage them to complete their education.  There is a strong direct link between the age and stage of education at which a person leaves school and their potential to be long-term unemployed. Three-quarters of people who are long-term unemployed today left school with minimum or no qualifications.  That is why this legislation puts work for young people in a context where schooling comes first.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrelly displayed great confidence that I would have the same job in 12 months.  I hope it is not a lack of confidence that he will be in the same place.  However, if we are both in the Oireachtas I will be delighted to accept his invitation to return and report to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>There might be a slight misunderstanding about the regulations.  The racing industry is not included.  Senator Daly asked why we are introducing new regulations.  The legal position is that the 1977 Act is currently in force until the new law is implemented.  My predecessor, Deputy O'Rourke, in making what were relatively minor changes to comply with EU rules, decided to consolidate two existing Acts in the new legislation.  Most of what we are doing, therefore, is not new.  Existing regulations exempt work at sea and people in family businesses.  When the commencement order is made these regulations will basically continue an existing situation.  That is why they are being introduced late.  The parliamentary draftsman recommended that they be carried out by affirmative order &mdash; usually they are carried out by laying regulations before the House &mdash; and that is why they are being introduced at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The other regulations will consist of the commencement order, which is standard, and a regulation for licences regarding young people employed in the film industry.  It will look after the welfare of such children and put their employment in the context of schooling, the ability to sit examinations and having teachers or chaperones on site.  We have discussed this matter with the teachers' unions to ensure that we get the regulations right.  That is all that <Col N="745" /> remains to be done at this stage, even though there are broad powers under the legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde asked about monitoring and enforcement.  We have a new means under the legislation through which young people, their trade union or their parents can apply to the Rights Commissioner of the Labour Court if young people are being discriminated against.  In addition, if our inspectors find something wrong in a workplace they can take a case in that regard. I strongly believe in the value of education in this regard and in involving the employers of young people.  We have already written to them and we will be in touch with them again about their precise duties.  Good employers will want to conform with the law.</P>
      <P>I will forward Senator O'Toole's compliments to the draftsman, he has done a good job and the text is clear in its presentation.  Senator Daly raised the important issue of work at sea.  These provisions offer flexibility if a boat is at sea beyond the permitted number of hours and cannot return to land on time.  However, the young people concerned must be given compensatory rest.  I have done a great deal of work with the fishing organisations, the Health and Safety Authority and fishermen's wives in regard to safety at sea.  The sad aspect of deaths at sea is that so many of them occur because people are not wearing life jackets and protective equipment.  Last year was a terrible year for deaths at sea.  This year, as a result of greater awareness in the fishing community and much preventive work through involving fishermen in the advisory group of the Health and Safety Authority, the position is transformed and I hope that will continue.  The Senator's point was valid and important.  I will relay it to the Health and Safety Authority and advise it to pay particular attention to the safety of young people at sea.</P>
      <P>The emerging fashion in both Houses of the Oireachtas is for Members to adopt a UK Tory policy in relation to Europe and to take on board the propaganda that European regulations have gone mad and will inhibit competitiveness.  If one looks at the record, however, one will see that we created 93,000 jobs in the last three years.  That is a record level of job creation not seen since the foundation of the State.  Does this look like an economy that is sclerotic and throttled by European regulation?  We do a disservice to ourselves, our economy, to social solidarity and to basic standards of minimum decency as set down by the European Community, from which we are happy to take £1,000 million per year to help fund our economic growth, when we take such an attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I met a group of major multinational employers and they told me that more damaging than the rules or regulations we introduce to set down minimum standards which good employers already obey, is the black propaganda whereby we take on the role of the British Tories or the British CBI, which wants to take our jobs, and claim that regulations are throttling the Irish <Col N="746" /> economy.  This country is a good place in which to do business.  Our regulations and labour laws set minimum standards which good employers and unionised workforces already exceed.  I am more concerned about young people being offered £1.50 per hour than introducing regulations which state that young people are not to be exploited in their work and are not to be asked to work hours detrimental to their schooling.</P>
    <P>The additional European rules to the existing 1977 Act were minor and technical but I took the opportunity to strengthen our rules by raising the minimum age of work to 16 years, by putting work for under 16 years olds in the school context and by relaxing the rules to allow 17 and 18 year olds to work up to 11 p.m. when there is no school the next day.  We should look at the facts and not propagate the myths.</P>
    <P>I commend the regulations to the House.</P>

      <P>Tairgaim: &ldquo;Go dtóghtar an Seanadóir Liam MacCosgair mar Cathaoirleach den tSeanad.&rdquo;  I move: &ldquo;That Senator Liam Cosgrave be elected Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.&rdquo;  This is an election which all of us wish did not have to take place.  The standard set by the last two holders of the office of Cathaoirleach will be a shining example to the person we elect today.  I have the honour to propose Senator Liam Cosgrave for the Office of Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann.  I do so because I know, as does the House, that he has many of the qualities which distinguished the past two holders of the office and which contributed to their success as Cathaoirligh.</P>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave is committed to this House and to its traditions.  He respects the dignity of the House and appreciates the importance of its work.  He is fair minded, experienced, personable, approachable and has a sense of humour which is essential in any good Chairman, especially in this House.  In addition, he comes from a family tradition characterised by decades of public service and quite patriotism.  He would make an excellent Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>I have one other reason for asking the House to support Senator Cosgrave: it is the long and honourable tradition, almost a convention of this House, whereby the Cathaoirleach comes from the Government side and the Leas-Chathaoirleach from the Opposition side.  It is a good convention which has been broken with only once in almost 70 years.  It contributes greatly to the successful running of the House and to the good relations which characterise its work. I hope that tradition will be continued today with the election of Senator Cosgrave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could say much more about Senator Cosgrave but I do not think he would approve of me <Col N="748" /> making a long-winded speech.  Once again I have the honour to propose Senator Liam Cosgrave as Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <P>I have pleasure in seconding Senator Liam Cosgrave as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  It is a sad occasion for us to have to come together to elect a Cathaoirleach after the untimely death of Senator Liam Naughten.  He served the office of Cathaoirleach well and followed in the fine tradition of Senator Seán Fallon whose death was also untimely.</P>
      <P>There has been a fine tradition of conducting the business of this House with dignity and I am confident that Senator Cosgrave will follow in that tradition.  He has long experience in politics, particularly in this House.  His well refined skills are obvious, particularly in negotiating the affairs of the House and in his work in recent years as Government Chief Whip in a House without an overall Government majority.  As Senator Manning said, he has a good sense of humour along with the ability to be firm.  Those of us who are subject to his Whip are aware of the fact that he can use his sense of humour at the same time as being firm.  That is also in the tradition of his two immediate predecessors in the office of Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>The Cosgrave family has a long tradition in politics which is being carried on by Senator Cosgrave.  The Labour Party has strongly supported the concept of consensus and co-operation that has been in operation here.  It has been implemented through the practice of electing the Cathaoirleach from the Government side and the Leas-Chathaoirleach from the Opposition side.  We strongly support that and will continue to do so.  That spirit of co-operation has allowed us to carry on informed debates on Bills and other issues of importance.  We do not spend long hours in party political confrontation which sometimes occurs in the Lower House. This House has managed to deal with its business in a way that promotes co-operation and consensus.  It gives me great pleasure to second the nomination of Senator Liam Cosgrave as Cathaoirleach.</P>

Once again we are electing a Cathaoirleach following the untimely and tragic death of former Cathaoirleach, Liam Naughten.  His predecessor, Seán Fallon, also died in office.  On behalf of the Fianna Fáil group it is my pleasure to propose Senator Brian Mullooly who, since 1981, has served in this House with great distinction.  He has acted as the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on education as well as being assistant Chief Whip. When we were in office he became the <Col N="749" /> Government Chief Whip.  Senator Mullooly always fulfilled every role with great experience and distinction.  When the party had to replace Senator Seán Fallon it wisely chose Senator Mullooly who was then elected as Leas-Chathaoirleach. Over the last 18 months he has shown that he was an excellent choice.</P>
      <P>I mentioned his experience and anyone who has dealt with Senator Mullooly in any position he has held will know of his commitment to the House.  He has also been a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and has been totally committed to reform of the House. For those reasons it is my honour to propose Senator Brian Mullooly as Cathaoirleach.</P>

My own county has been to the forefront in bearing these losses and it has been a traumatic time for me.  It is with some irony that Senator Brian Mullooly, another Roscommon man, is being proposed by my party.  I formally second him for the position of Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>Senator Mullooly is known and respected by all Members of the House.  I have known him personally for many years and politically for close on 20 years.  Since 1979 I have worked with him on Roscommon County Council where he served as chairperson from 1985 to 1991.  This House honoured him by electing him Leas-Chathaoirleach a year and a half ago.  Senator Mullooly is ideally suited, and has the necessary skills, to carry out the duties of Cathaoirleach with dignity and impartiality.  It is my great pleasure to formally second the proposal of Senator Mullooly for the position of Cathaoirleach.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to repeat statements about the unfortunate accident which gave rise to this election.  Nonetheless, it is part of the business of the House and Members have a difficult choice to make as two people of the finest character have been nominated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have served in this House for ten years and, during that time, Senator Cosgrave has always been a friend and open to discussion with Members on all sides.  His loyalty to his party and his interest in the development of Members have always been apparent.  As minority Whip, Senator Cosgrave has played a most difficult role and <Col N="750" /> managed, with few arguments, to keep people onside. He responded to them in a way which displayed a great sense of honour, integrity and fair play.  He did so at times when he was under great stress and pressure to renege on agreements, etc.  He is honest, fair and of the highest integrity.  I am certain that whoever is elected will discharge the functions and duties of Cathaoirleach with honour and distinction.</P>
    <P>In 1982, before I was elected to this House, I recall trying to obtain support for my campaign at a meeting of INTO activists in a hotel in Tuam. I received very little support until one person stated that he wished to support me and would ensure that the organisation supported me.  That person was Senator Mullooly, with whom I have enjoyed a long relationship.  He is honourable, dependable and discharges his functions with great concern for those around him.  He has been the INTO's nominee to the Seanad on a number of occasions and I have proposed and supported his candidature on behalf of the ICTU, which he represented in the House during that period.  On the political scene, Senator Mullooly has discharged his functions in relation to the needs of the people he represents.  I was glad when he attained the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach.  He has discharged the duties of that office in an honourable and even handed manner.</P>
    <P>This is the most difficult decision I have been obliged to make during my time in this House. However, I will be casting my vote politically in a way which represents the organisations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure it is well tended.  Well deserved tributes were paid to the late Cathaoirleach, Senator Naughten, and I will not repeat them.  However, it will be very difficult for his successor to fill his shoes.  The late Senators Fallon and Naughten were excellent Cathaoirligh and conducted the business of the House in an even handed, efficient and courteous manner.</P>
      <P>This is a momentous occasion because we will be electing someone to the Chair of Seanad Éireann, which is one of the most important constitutional offices.  We must realise that we are electing a Member to the Council of State who will act in the place of the President when he or she is absent from the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> We are fortunate that two candidates of the calibre of Senators Cosgrave and Mullooly are standing for election.  I am deeply aware of Senator Cosgrave's long family tradition of public service to the State.  It is not an exaggeration to state that, but for the even-handedness of his grandfather, Ireland might be the democracy it is today and we must be conscious of that fact.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly has served in the Seanad since 1981 and has filled the office of Leas-Chathaoirleach with distinction.  He conducted the affairs of the House very well when he was in the Chair.  I would be happy to see either elected. However, we can only elect one and I am sure that the individual in question will do well.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the tradition whereby the Government side has always elected the Cathaoirleach.  However, this is an unusual and unprecedented situation in that the transfer of Government took place without a general election and changed the balance of the House. The normal rules do not apply in this case.  It would be easy for Opposition Members to want Senator Cosgrave to take the Chair, purely on the basis that voting strength on the Government side would be reduced.  In the event that he is elected, it will make the Government side's voting position more difficult.  We look forward to the debate on the Universities Bill to see how that minority performs.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have a history of adopting a reasonably independent line on these matters.  Members will recall that, when they first entered the House, the three Senators from my party, who were nominated by the then Taoiseach, abstained in the vote for the election of the Cathaoirleach because they did not regard him as the most suitable person for the job.  Our record stands comparison with others on that score.  The fact of the matter is that we are in Opposition and we will be supporting the candidacy of Senator Mullooly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>On previous occasions I made the point that there should be a contest and, in situations where there did not appear to be a contest on the horizon, I did everything possible to ensure that one took place by trying to nominate an Independent Member.  To choose someone from the Independent benches is a reasonable option in a House which is supposed, by and large, to be reflective and divorced from the ordinary hurly burly of party political life.  I believe this is a reasonable alternative which should be considered in most circumstances. However, I am aware that it is not always wise, and can be dangerous, to be troublesome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall a previous occasion when the Independent group discussed this matter and arranged to nominate former Senator John A. Murphy.  We proposed his name and spoke greatly in his favour but, wily hobgoblin of the political scene that he is, he jumped ship unannounced and stated that he wished to <Col N="752" /> disassociate himself from that futile political gesture.  I do not propose to place myself in that situation again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Manning stated, it is significant that the Cathaoirleach usually comes from the Government side.  We are lucky to have two such outstanding candidates as Senators Cosgrave and Mullooly.</P>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave has an extraordinary pedigree through his grandfather, his father and his own term of service in this House.  He knows the rules and procedure of the House, he is not an abrasive personality and he can conduct discussions and negotiations in a fair and even handed manner.  I will have little difficulty supporting him.</P>
      <P>It is a difficult choice.  I have served in this House with Senator Mullooly and there were other circumstances in which I would clearly have preferred him to have been his party's nomination for this post.  As Leas-Chathaoirleach he has graced the House with his civilised, calm, knowledgeable handling of affairs and it would, in other circumstances, have been a particular pleasure for me to vote for him.  I regret that on this occasion I will not be able to do so.  The reason is that in a balanced situation where we have two people of clearly significant talent one has to look at the political realities.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole says that he is voting politically and so am I.  I want to keep the Government in place.  It is important that we, on this side of the House, keep the Government's voting strength as weak as possible so that we on the Independent benches continue to hold the balance of power.  I remind the House that whoever receives this important position does so because it lies in the gift of the deciding group who are the Independent University Senators.  I hope this will be registered by the Government when we discuss issues such as the Universities Bill.  I wish the margin to be less to the advantage of the Government so that it will feel the lash of the University Senators should it proceed in an unwise way with the specific provisions which it appears intent on doing.  For that reason, I will be voting for the candidate from the Government's side.</P>
      <P>I am not a Member of the Opposition and so I do not have to take the position that Senator Dardis, quite appropriately, has taken.  He is a Member of the Opposition, I am an Independent and I underline that.  I have voted with this Government and against it.  I have been responsible for the defeat of the Government on a number of occasions and I am unrepentant and shall continue in the same independent mode. Please do not confuse me with any Member of the Opposition.</P>

The incoming Cathaoirleach, together with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, should look at the possibility of having the same arrangement as applies in the Lower House whereby the Cathaoirleach is re-elected unopposed at the next general election.  This might require a constitutional amendment but we are having so many of those that there should not be any difficulty in including this with the next group of them.  It would be fair and proper that this amendment should be considered.</P>

      <P>Every Member of this House has an extensive vocabulary and could speak at length on any subject.  From time to time we debate matters of international importance.  I know delegations go abroad but I have never seen any of them reporting back regardless of where they visited. It is important that Senators should report to the House.  I will be voting for Senator Cosgrave.</P>

      <P>I remind Senator Norris that the Government is far more anxious than he that it stays in power.  Like all elections, this one will be decided in the lobbies and I want to put on record that, given the unique position of the fall of one Government and the creation of another without an election, I had the opportunity, as Labour Whip, of working with the Whip and the Leader of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach is held in the highest esteem by my party and the Fine Gael Party.  I do not need to draw comparisons between Senator Cosgrave and Senator Mullooly.  They are both <Col N="754" /> equal.  However, despite the words of my colleague from Trinity, this is a political House and these things are decided in a political way.  It is no reflection on the characters or capabilities of one candidate or the other.  Nonetheless, I have had the pleasure of serving with both Senator Mullooly as Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party and Senator Cosgrave as Whip of the Fine Gael Party and there is nothing to choose between them for courtesy, co-operation and good humour.  I wish them both luck although, given that this is a political House, I will be voting for Senator Cosgrave.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole said that this is the most difficult decision he has had to make in ten years in this House.  I have been in this House for four years and I have been impressed by its working.  I have listened carefully to the discussion today and have heard words such as &ldquo;tradition&rdquo;, &ldquo;dignity&rdquo;, &ldquo;humour&rdquo; and &ldquo;firm hand&rdquo;.  All of these words play a part in both the characters of Senator Mullooly and Senator Cosgrave.</P>
      <P>One of the important decisions Senators have to make is how do we make this House work best?  I have been impressed by the two previous holders of this office, Sean Fallon and Liam Naughten.  They had all the abilities necessary to make this House work very well.  I listened to Senator Manning say that the tradition has always been to elect the Government candidate, but that is not necessarily so.  It has come about because the Government has always had a majority.  I do not think it has been a tradition to do so.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion, the Cathaoirleach was elected unopposed.  I have also looked at the other work undertaken by the office holder.  The Cathaoirleach has a position on the Council of State and a role in representing this House elsewhere.  The Cathaoirleach also has a role in the other House when there is a visiting Head of State.  I look to see how best this can be fulfilled and find both candidates would be very competent at doing so.  I had to look at experience.  I found I had learned more from the experience of Senator Mullooly than Senator Cosgrave, who I know is competent and capable of doing the job.  On the basis of experience, I will cast my vote in favour of Senator Mullooly.</P>

      <P>I thank my proposer, Senator Manning, and Seconder, Senator O'Sullivan, for nominating me and all those who supported me.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Mullooly, for the honourable way he conducted the campaign in recent days and look forward to working with him.  I truly wish things were not as they are and that my friend, Senator Liam Naughten, was still sitting in this Chair presiding over proceedings.</P>
      <P>The last 16 months have been traumatic for this House and its staff.  In Gordon Wilson we lost a truly courageous man who touched us all.  In Seán Fallon we lost not just a fine Cathaoirleach but a friend to all.  In Liam Naughten we again lost a fine Cathaoirleach and one of the most courteous men to ever grace this House.  It is now my duty and responsibility to ensure the fairness, courtesy and what I term open door policy of our two previous Cathaoirligh in this 19th Seanad is continued and upheld.  This is a responsibility which I intend to carry out to the utmost of my ability.</P>
      <P>The most important function of the Cathaoirleach is to exercise impartiality at all times and it is a fundamental right of each and every Member of the House to be treated fairly. I assure the House of my absolute belief in that right.  I also wish to assure Senators that any efforts to update and improve the functions of the House will have my full support.</P>
      <P>Co-operation has also been a feature of the operation of this House and I sincerely hope it continues.  In this regard, I thank everyone for their support for, tolerance of and understanding towards me as Whip over the last few years. Fortunately, only a few had to feel the full brunt.</P>
      <P>I thank the Clerk, the Clerk Assistant and Seanad Office staff for their help.  If I single out one person for mention for her total commitment and loyalty, it is Marie Burnell, my secretary.  I again thank everyone for their kind words and look forward to working in co-operation with them for the remainder of this Seanad.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate that one of Senator Liam Naughten's last acts as Cathaoirleach was to have the portraits of former Cathaoirligh hung in the Seanad corridor.  You have lost a great friend, but your portraits will be side by side.</P>

In my dealings with you as Chief Whip, you would sometimes lower your head and give me a glance which indicated things were not great.  One of your predecessors, Pat Joe Reynolds, once told me to sit down.  I told him I had yet to say something.  He said I looked as if I was out of order.

      <P>I join with colleagues in congratulating you on the distinction of being appointed Cathaoirleach. It would be a privilege for anyone to be elected, but in your case it has to be a particular privilege and achievement as you are the third generation of a family which has given distinguished public service.  Your election comes at a time when public service is not always rated as highly as it should be and politicians are not recognised as we would wish.  It is important that a generation of a family that has contributed so much in public service should be honoured by your election.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil was particularly fortunate in having a candidate of the calibre of Senator Mullooly to propose for the office.

      <P>I congratulate you.  I will miss you but I thank you for your co-operation over the past two years as Government Chief Whip.  I am not sure who will replace you but it will not be the same.  I was late in making my contribution because I thought we were adjourning for refreshments.  I offer you my heartiest congratulations.

      <P>I join with other Senators in wishing you health, happiness and success as Cathaoirleach.  The race between you and Senator Mullooly was similar to a race between Arkle and Mill House.  Your election is a tribute to you.  You had great training from your father; you learned a lot from the late Deputy Percy Dockrell and you also learned from your experience on Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council.  It is a great honour for you to be elected Cathaoirleach and I wish you success.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> I had a discussion with the late Senator Naughten recently about the possibility of the Cathaoirleach being automatically returned unopposed after a general election.  That possibility should be examined and agreed to.</P>

Each Cathaoirleach with whom I have served has brought great qualities to the office.  Séamus Dolan brought his good Cavan humour to the post.  One night I had no car to go home and the then Cathaoirleach, Pat Joe Reynolds, had his son, Senator Reynolds, who had just returned from the United States, drive me home.

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 42, 43, 44, 45, 48, 49, 50, 51, 53 and 55 relate to the export licensing part of the Bill and are mainly technical amendments of a drafting nature.  Amendment No. 47 allows the minimum age of paintings to be consistent with the provision that allows for variation in the ages set for documents and decorative art objects.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I accepted Senator Mooney's proposal that the export licence requirement in relation to documents should be specified as including estate records, parish and school registers and maps.  While I am satisfied that the phrase &ldquo;documents&rdquo; includes such material I am prepared to make this explicit and amendment No. 52 gives effect to this proposal.</P>
      <P>Senators Lee and O'Toole put down amendment No. 46:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(h) archival material in any form (including that defined in The National Archives Act, 1986. section 2) which is not less than 50 years old at the commencement of this Act shall also <Col N="764" /> be covered by the provisions governing restrictions on export.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I said the Minister of the day is being empowered by order to lower the age stipulation on documents which are covered in subsections (1)(a), (c) and (2) and include archival material.</P>
    <P>On the basis of experience gained as to the effect of reducing the current age limit of 100 years set out in the Documents and Pictures Act, 1945, to 70 years, I will consider a further reduction to 50 years.  This is the appropriate way to deal with this proposal.  Accordingly I do not accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for including this amendment because of the matters raised on Second and Committee Stages.  This means that such records will require an export licence before they can be removed from the country.  The Minister might explain how long he envisages that process will take from the point of identification of the documents to the application and granting of a licence.</P>

I asked whether materials such as autographed manuscripts, photographed diaries, letters, etc., were covered by the Bill.  This amendment might cover such material.  Could the Minister give an assurance to the House that this specific kind of handwritten material is protected by the Bill in some form?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On Senator Lee's point, the mechanism of the order is more flexible and inclusive.  We are at one in what we want to achieve.  Senator Norris's <Col N="765" /> point is reasonable.  The materials to which he refers would be construed as documents and would be covered in that section.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney asked whether documents were covered.  They are if they are of the age.  He also asked about the length of the process.  I will ensure the work is carried out as expeditiously and efficiently as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the discussion on general entry charges which arose on Committee Stage, I looked at the procedures set out in the Bill to see if they could be further strengthened. Resulting from this, amendment No. 14 proposes to add a subsection to section 14 of the Bill to the effect that no general charge in respect of entry to the museum, library or gallery can be introduced without the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Amendment No. 2 is a drafting amendment consequential on this, and meets the concerns of some Senators that, if there was a proposal, this is an issue of public policy which would merit discussion by the Oireachtas.  Section 14 (2) (d) provides that the board in question can make the proposal for entry charges but, for this to be implemented, the Minister's consent must be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This sub-paragraph seeks for the first time to provide some ground rules, a procedure in which real debate on the contentious issue of general entry charges can be conducted.  There is, at present, no specified procedure setting out a framework for <Col N="766" /> debate.  As of now, on behalf of the National Museum and National Library, I would be entitled, in theory, to introduce general charges and the National Gallery could do so without my consent.  I am satisfied the measures included in the Bill as initiated provide adequate democratic safeguards, not least the proposed consent role for the Minister, that being a guarantee of direct accountability to the Oireachtas.  As I said on Committee Stage, this provides an appropriate balance between the autonomy of the board and public policy considerations.  That I am prepared now to go further than what is, in my view, essential arises out of an innate sympathy with Senators' concerns on the issue and a desire to strengthen the democratic procedures involved to the maximum level appropriate to the issue in question.</P>
    <P>However, the amendment tabled by Senator Mooney and Senator Fitzgerald goes further again, proposing a statutory prohibition on general entry charges.  While I can understand the Senators' intent, I consider a statutory bar unnecessary and that my amendment provides sufficient safeguards to meet their concerns.  One would have to hear the opinions of both Houses of the Oireachtas, which surely is a way of establishing a change of public policy in the most democratic way.</P>
    <P>In setting out my view on the relative merits of the two proposals, my response cannot be brief, unfortunately, because the issue of access is by no means straightforward.  I do not warm to any suggestion that people's access to their heritage should be inhibited as this is a basic right of every citizen.  That is why the ethos of the Bill is infused with the philosophy of access and is the reason the provisions of the Bill state, among other things, that the duties of the respective boards of the National Museum and the National Library, as appropriate, include such provisions as are required for the dissemination of knowledge of the collections for the benefit of the public, the promotion of research and the integration of the institutions' activities as an integral part of the national culture.  To underwrite the basic philosophy, new provisions are being added creating advisory committees specifically geared to take on board the views of the public.  These committees will ensure that the public's views must be actively sought and taken account of by the governing boards.  All these measures underline that elitism does not and will not inform any part of the thinking behind this Bill.</P>
    <P>The issue of access involves many factors and the issue of general entry charges is but one of them, albeit an important one.  In taking a critical look at the proposal for a legislative ban on general entry charges, I must ask myself whether this would necessarily and in all circumstances, now and for the indefinite future, save by change of primary legislation, serve the interests of access.  I am not convinced that my reservations about general entry charges are so certain as to deny any possibility of a structure of general <Col N="767" /> charge being formulated that will enhance real access.  Is there anyone so prescient as to predict that only a negative impact on access is possible? What if a package of proposals were to be put forward showing that a general charging regime would be focused on the once-off visiting tourist rather than the citizen and the resultant new resources created would be utilised to establish new education and exhibition facilities, outreach programmes and permit exploitation of the apparently limitless potential of interactive media?  What if it could be shown that the new resources would be targeted at those who have never set foot in the National Museum, National Library or National Gallery or shown any interest in so doing even though the institutions have had free access for decades?  Are we to exclude forever one avenue through which the possibility of breaking intractable social barriers might, I put it no more strongly than that, be achievable?</P>
    <P>The issue of access is far more complex than the single issue of a general entry charge.  I am adamantly opposed to any policy of charging that would conflict with the objectives of the Bill but I stand firmly behind policies which would reasonably enhance the Bill's objectives and for legislation which does not unnecessarily close off all possibilities for progress.  On the entry charge issue, I cannot support an amendment which seeks to deny the creation in statute of a pragmatic procedural arrangement established securely within a democratic framework.  The approval of the Oireachtas would be necessary and, without predetermining the outcome, debate is warranted on the substantive issue at an appropriate stage in future years.  The effect of the Senators' amendment would be to deny the possibility of debating the issue.  The introduction of a blanket legislative ban does not, in my view, serve the interest of access to our national cultural institutions.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, having regard to no more than the Bill's objectives I have tried, in responding to this debate, to be as amenable as possible but I have concluded that my amendment is the preferable mechanism for progressing the issue of access rather than the amendment proposed by the Senators.  My amendment ensures that if a board were ever to make proposals in this area, the endorsement of both Houses of the Oireachtas would be required before they could be implemented.</P>

      <P>There is great potential in that regard.  With the right arrangement, melodic music and the flourishes of the Minister's style, which reaches highs and lows at the correct points in order to emphasise the &ldquo;no&rdquo;, there is no question but that it could be a Christmas hit.</P>
      <P>Equally, my response to the Minister is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. To put it in context, I fully appreciate everything he has said but to quote the words of the former Cathaoirleach, the late Seán Fallon, in another context, the Minister's reply is like Delaney's dog, it went a bit of the road with everyone.  The Minister went a certain distance with all the comments made on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  However, to reiterate what I said at that point, the gulf between us is the distance between enshrining it in legislation or leaving it to a board of management to decide.  The board will seek the consent of the Minister who, in turn, if it is agreed, will bring it before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In theory that sounds impressive, it is democracy in its purest form.  However, the cynical among us will point out that usually the Government of the day in which the Minister serves has a majority in both Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it usually does.  As a result, I am not sure that the checks and balances suggested by the Minister go any way towards achieving what I or my colleagues on the Independent benches set out to achieve.</P>
      <P>One would not have thought that the <i>Financial Times</i> would have strongly supported what it terms &ldquo;Victorian value&rdquo;.  However, its editorial on 11 November last states:</P>
      <P>When the great museums of the Victorian era were built and extended in the last decade of the 19th century, Britain's real income per head was roughly equivalent to that of present-day Uruguay.</P>
      <P>Yet in one respect the country was rich: in the vision which established these splendid monuments to culture and scholarship, intended to be open to the public as a means of raising the nation's intellectual and artistic consciousness.  Whatever may be thought of such lofty aspirations, they left a heritage which remains an important part of the nation's identity.</P>
      <P>One reason was the tradition of free access. It not only allowed anyone to visit museums and galleries, but conferred a sense that the treasures in them belonged to everyone &mdash; which, broadly, they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> Since those days, a progressive squeeze on costs has forced many great museums to start charging for entry.  [The editorial makes the valid point that currently only five national cultural institutions in the UK have resisted this trend.]</P>
    <P>This is a case in which the price mechanism will act perversely &mdash; to limit an activity which should only be encouraged.  And if the Victorians could afford to build great museums for the people, surely a much richer nation can afford to let them in.</P>
    <P>I was unable to put it better myself.</P>
    <P>There is an established trend among the great cultural institutions in Europe to charge an entry fee.  However, there are a number of variations in this regard.  For example, on one day each month the French authorities do not charge an entry fee into their cultural institutions while other countries operate a free hour or two at the end of a day for people who wish to visit the museums.</P>
    <P>However, in Denmark one basic philosophy underlying its legislation is that the state should encourage rather than direct or control.  In consequence, the legislation governing the activities of state art foundations and film subsidy authorities explicitly stipulates that all decisions on financial support in these respective spheres should be made exclusively by special committees or councils of experts.  Neither the Minister nor Parliament can influence or alter such decisions. These principles have gradually been transferred to other areas involving artistic decisions. Moreover, a second basic philosophy is that Danish cultural policies are aimed at involving as many people as possible in cultural activities.  This effort has no doubt been successful.  However, if we allowed this by-law to be passed, it would give <i>carte blanche</i> to the various committees.</P>
    <P>One final nail in what I hope will be the Minister's coffin in this regard is a quote from &ldquo;A Fundamental Review of the British Museum's Operations&rdquo; by Mr. Andrew Edwards with the help of a professional team, which was published on 8 October 1996.  He devotes a chapter to admission charges which states:</P>
    <P>Throughout its history, except for a short period in 1973, admission to the Museum has been free.  In the world outside, most national Museums and Galleries now charge for admission.  [This reinforces my argument in relation to our three cultural institutions.] Some notable exceptions are the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the National Museums of Scotland, and the Smithsonian Institute.  The Museum has traditionally been opposed in principle to admission charges on the grounds, in the words of a previous Director that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Museum should be available free to anybody to stretch their minds and stimulate their curiosity.  The Trustees hold the <Col N="770" /> collections in trust for the nation and for the world....  It is a sign of a civilised society to make these collections as available as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Others have argued more explicitly that:</P>
    <P>it is wrong in principle to deny access to people who cannot afford the entrance fee;</P>
    <P>admission charges would lead to some reduction in visitor numbers, thus deterring many people from enjoying a unique and marvellous experience;</P>
    <P>An article in <i>The Financial Times</i> on 16 November 1996 stated that the Director of the British Museum, Mr. Anderson&mdash;</P>
    <P>... is also dubious about the financial benefits of charging.  The Edwards report predicts that a £5 charge would bring in £8m a year and reduce visitor numbers by 27.5 per cent from today's 6.1m &mdash; the museum is the second most popular visitor attraction in the UK after Blackpool Pleasure Beach.</P>
    <P>That is an interesting juxtaposition of cultural and non-cultural activities.  Having soaked up the intellectual curiosity of the British Museum, people then get on a train to Blackpool.  The article continues:</P>
    <P>Mr. Anderson thinks that the decline in numbers would be greater [if a charge was imposed on the British Museum].  The Science Museum saw visits fall by 60 per cent in the year after it introduced charges.</P>
    <P>That means that if the National Gallery of Ireland, which currently attracts over 1 million people per year, decided to impose a charge, 600,000 people would not visit it.  There is no widespread research on the impact charges would have on such institutions.  When library book charges were introduced, it had a deteriorating effect on the reading habits of those who traditionally visited county libraries.</P>
    <P>We have talked in general terms about whether charges should be introduced but nobody has suggested what the charge might be.  My trawl through British and European cultural institutions over the past two days suggests that if a charge was introduced for the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Museum of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland, it would be a minimum charge of £5 per person per day.  It would not be economically viable to impose a smaller charge due to the huge costs of administering such a scheme.</P>
    <P>I am not sure it is in the best long-term interests of those three cultural institutions to impose or endorse such a charge.  Not only would a charge be imposed, but it would be increased on a regular basis depending on the financial difficulties of those cultural institutions.  If the Government granted an admission charge &mdash; I anticipate it would grant it notwithstanding the Minister's impressive statement about placing <Col N="771" /> orders before both Houses &mdash; it is highly unlikely there would be any objection to it.</P>
    <P>These are valid points in response to the Minister's passionate defence of the indefensible. I do not doubt his bona fides in this matter and it does not detract from his comments about the Bill's ethos.  There is only a gulf between us on this issue.  It is quite an achievement for the Minister to maintain the Bill's ethos over 68 sections but it will not be diminished by accepting this amendment.  Despite the <i>modus vivendi</i> between myself and the Minister on many other issues in this Bill, I am afraid I must go to the wire on this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <P>As I listened to Senator Mooney I wondered, if a charge was imposed on people who visited Blackpool pier would it result in an increase in the number of people visiting the British Museum?</P>
      <P>The idea of charging to get into a museum or other such institution is anathema to me.  I am happy the Minister shares this view.  If one looks at the number of school tours and people who annually visit the museums or the National Art Gallery or the Museum of Natural History, the idea of charging a fee would be utterly unacceptable culturally.  However, it is only culturally because, as Senator Mooney pointed out, throughout Europe people are charged entrance fees.  It is a major expense.  In Rome, for example, entrance is free only on the last Sunday of each month.  Senator Mooney gave other examples and I oppose taking a step in that direction.</P>
      <P>I had intended to support Senator Mooney's amendment but the Minister has put forward a substantial point and made two strong arguments in its favour.  Currently the museum authorities have <i>carte blanche</i> should they decide tomorrow morning to charge for entry.  There is no legislative means of controlling that and that has always been the case.  Senator Mooney proposes that there can never be an entry charge.  Without repeating the arguments made by the Minister, I can think of a variety of circumstances, for example, in the case of film companies, tourists and so forth, in which I would not object, although others might, to charging for entry.</P>
      <P>While I support the view put forward by Senator Mooney in opposing any attempt to charge at the doors of the National Museum, the National Art Gallery or the Museum of Natural History, the Minister has made it a requirement under the Bill that there be legislative accountability on this matter.  Until now the authorities could have decided to impose a charge at their own discretion.  Under the Bill that cannot happen without ministerial and parliamentary approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made a strong argument in favour of that position.  I cannot envisage a situation in the future where I would not oppose an admission charge into museums, libraries and <Col N="772" /> so forth.  On the other hand, situations that we have not contemplated might arise.  In addition, it would be a very brave Minister who would approve an entry charge.  He or she would have every national and post-primary school of every hue in the country, their teaching staff, parents and management boards against him or her for a start, because that is the first sector that would be affected by such a charge.  It would be, effectively, a surcharge on every parent whose child goes on a school tour.  For that reason I cannot see it happening.  However, there could be circumstances in which a general admission charge could be levied on a specific group without preventing the average citizen or young person accessing and celebrating the contents of our cultural institutions.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to inform Senator Mooney I have weakened on this point.  My commitment of support this morning is evaporating by the minute and I extend my apologies.</P>

      <P>Listening to the debate, one would think the Minister was legislating that these bodies must introduce admission charges immediately.  The contrary is true and the Minister's amendment has the contrary effect.  No suggestion should emanate from the House that even remote consideration is being given to levying admission charges to the National Museum or the National Library.</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposal is reasonable and commendable.  Let us deal with reality.  The current position is that the management of these institutions can impose charges if they wish.  The Minister is ensuring that this cannot be done in the future unless both Houses of the Oireachtas agree to such a proposal.  At present every Member of the House opposes the concept of levying charges and it is their agreed wish that it will not happen.  It is also the wish of the Minister, except in exceptional circumstances.  I am delighted the Minister has given specific direction about this issue in the Bill.  His proposal is commendable and I am delighted to support it.</P>

I deplore the fact that in a debate on cultural institutions we are following the hateful American practice of turning nouns into verbs.  It is a virus from computer terminology to talk about &ldquo;accessing&rdquo; things.  I have a strong distaste for this and I am distressed that Members of the House would talk about &ldquo;accessing&rdquo; anything, although I am aware it is part of computer phraseology.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>None whatever; it is misdirected. This debate is particularly important because, as Senator Lee reminded me, the boards of management of these institutions will peruse the report of the debate.  There is no doubt they will take it from the Minister's eloquent comments and from what every speaker has said that we are firm in our desire that there should be maximum possible access to our cultural heritage, and not one that is determined on financial wealth.</P>
      <P>Look at the people who created much of our cultural wealth.  Many of the painters were &ldquo;pulling the devil by the tail&rdquo;.  They did not have enough money to scrape together £5 to get into the National Gallery.  James Joyce, who used the wonderful facilities of the National Library, did so at a time when his family life, according to reliable testimony from family friends, was so poor that they had to chop down the bannisters and burn them to keep warm.  When somebody mentioned a cup of tea to one of Joyce's sisters, she responded: &ldquo;In our house it is a jam jar of tea&rdquo;.  Joyce might have been barred from the National Library if charges had been in effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of studies have been carried out on this issue, although I am not as conversant with them as Senator Mooney who has trawled widely throughout Europe for such information. However, a member of the staff of the House drew my attention to a survey carried out on a major British institution &mdash; I am not sure which one &mdash; which introduced an entrance charge.  It found its revenue dropped from £30 million to £18 million per annum.  That might have been because the income from ancillary products, such as cafeterias, reproduction services and so forth, suffered as a result of a catastrophic decline in attendance.  From a practical point of view, <Col N="774" /> therefore, one would have to be extremely careful in introducing such charges.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone a long distance in his amendment and, although I strongly sympathise with Senator Mooney's comments, it would be difficult to press the Minister to go further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I too admire, without qualification, the Minister's virtuoso performance in terms both of substance and delivery.  If this Minister was to remain as Minister <i>sine die</i> I would have no hesitation in accepting the reasoning and assumptions behind the amendment, but he will not.  By raising this matter I fear we are beginning to sow seeds in the minds of people who will take decisions later, even though we now say we are strongly opposed to the principle of charging.  Senator O'Toole said the institutions would have every parent in the country down on top of them &mdash; though not every school child &mdash; if they charged for entry.  One can envisage a situation, however, where boards could exclude particular categories and therefore the burden would be borne by those members of the public who are not in a position to express the same degree of indignation, resentment and voting power as other groups.</P>
      <P>There is a wider issue.  Where will these institutions get the money to finance all the extra responsibilities that this legislation imposes upon them?  It empowers them in principle but unless the money is there, much of what the legislation contains will be dead.</P>
      <P>The temptation of charging entry fees is bound to arise, particularly on boards with a business and market orientation, which in principle is a good idea.  It is part of what is happening now. They are bound to think in terms of entry fees as a fall back position at least when funding, which is so necessary to implement the admirable objectives of this legislation, is not forthcoming.  I fear that having raised the issue, if we do not take the strongest possible line, which is Senator Mooney's line, we will have launched a counterproductive discussion.  Though I accept and admire what the Minister has said, I am leaning towards Senator Mooney's amendment in the light of this point.</P>

      <P>Although Senator Norris has left the Chamber, I must say it is strange for a Joycean scholar to object to new forms of the English language.  Perhaps the Senator would accept that the computer is to the 1990s what Joyce was to the 1920s and 1930s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a major problem with amendment No. 13 tabled by Senator Mooney and Senator Fitzgerald.  It is not that I want to restrict access to museums, but it concerns the wording of the amendment which refers to &ldquo;the fixing of fees and charges in respect of entry to any part of the Museum or Library...&rdquo;.  This would be extremely restrictive because the boards of the museum and library could from time to time attempt to have some kind of fund-raising event, <Col N="775" /> like a wine evening or an exhibition.  That would not entail general access as it would be a specific event held in a part of the museum or the library to which one would have to charge an entry fee. Senator Mooney's amendment would rule out something like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">

      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment says: &ldquo;in respect of entry to any part of the Museum&rdquo;.  It can be read that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, that is not so.  The by-law states that all those matters can be proceeded with.  It specifically concerns the issue of entry charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, it could be rather restrictive.  Money is one barrier to access to our National Library and National Museum but there are far greater barriers.  These include a level of appreciation, understanding and knowledge of what such institutions contain.  While we may think that money is the only barrier to access, it is not.  We are doing a disservice to Members of the House by saying that in future Senators will agree to an astronomical £5 entry charge to the National Gallery, National Library or National Museum.  Senator Mooney has little faith in Members of this House.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that should an unreasonable proposal come before Members of the Oireachtas, common wisdom would prevail and it would be thrown out.  The Minister's proposal goes a long way towards ensuring free access to our cultural institutions for the foreseeable future while at the same time leaving the way open for special events that may occur from time to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Some issues do not divide us. First, we are all in favour of access and, second, we are not debating charges today.  We are debating what should be in the Bill that will become the Act, and that is important.  The issue is simple &mdash; whether in future we will close off this possibility forever in all circumstances.  That is the argument that is being validly made.  I accept that the intention of Senator Mooney's amendment is addressed to general charges and I do not want to misconstrue anything that has <Col N="776" /> been said but we are not debating the issue of charges.  At some stage in the future that debate will be possible if my amendment is approved by the Oireachtas.  If Senator Mooney's amendment is accepted, that debate will not be possible.  One would have to introduce specific legislation to make any kind of charge possible in any circumstances.</P>
      <P>While we are not debating charges I could find different examples from the evidence.  For example, Trinity College library's exhibition contains even greater numbers than the National Gallery.  I have great sympathy with what Senator Mooney described is happening in Britain.  Access to such institutions in the Victorian age was different to the present day.  However, I would be of the same mind as the Senator in looking at how charges in British institutions are blocking the citizenry's access to heritage institutions.  If one wants to have maximum flexibility and options in future a distinction must be made between the citizen's right of access to heritage and the many different refinements of curiosity by travellers, tourists and others who may be charged for entry.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised an important point. The position now is that the National Gallery could, if it wished, introduce a charge without consulting me.  The National Library and National Museum could prepare a scheme of charges and if they had my permission they could introduce them.  My own amendment says that no one can introduce charges unless such a motion has successfully been put before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The other amendment proposes we write into the legislation that never in any future circumstances shall any of these institutions impose charges.  If that arose in future specific legislation would be required.  I have sympathy for the second amendment.  I am against charges but my purpose in introducing this legislation is to give important cultural institutions good legislation, modern institutional structures, respect for their autonomy and to allow them flexibility.</P>
      <P>This constriction should not lie as heavily on them as Senator Mooney envisages.  If one had to seek the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas and lay an order before them, the Minister of the day would have to engage in much consultation if there were to be the remotest chance of success. For this reason I am attempting to achieve a balance between the autonomy at the core of the Bill which relates to cultural institutions.  I do not wish to remove the possibility for future discussion of that for which I, as the Minister of the day, have responsibility and of which those institutions might not approve.</P>
      <P>The balance relating to flexibility rests with my suggested amendment.  Members will agree that I have gone a great distance towards putting their fears to rest because I have curtailed the present situation by making the order necessary.</P>

      <P>In page 11, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(s)  to ensure that all archives created and received by the National Museum of Ireland in the course of its business shall be preserved, protected, arranged, listed and made available, in accordance with The National Archives Act, 1986 and the Approved Places of Deposit Order, 21 December 1990, to the public.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I raised questions relating to the place of archival material in this legislation and whether it was adequately covered by terms such as &ldquo;library material&rdquo;, etc.  I am particularly concerned with archival material relating to the institutions themselves.  It has come to my attention that this may not be fully incorporated into the objectives and functions listed in the Bill, particularly as the question of designating an institution as an approved place of deposit arises under previous legislation.  The amendments are designed to ensure that, if not adequately covered, the position relating to archival material created by the institutions in the discharge of their responsibilities, or material related by them in connection with those responsibilities, will be <Col N="779" /> copperfastened by being explicitly referred to in the legislation.  The Minister may be able to reassure me in this regard but the amendments from a request for information.  I hope he can inform me that the provision I seek is already in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my gratitude to Senator Lee for raising this matter and I welcome the opportunity to provide clarification.  These amendments were intended to ensure that the archival records of the museum and library, proper to the care of the National Archives, will continue to be governed by the provisions of the National Archives Act, 1986.  The substance of the amendments was raised on Committee Stage and I stated that I would examine the matter before Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Attorney General's Office that the provisions concerning the definitions of &ldquo;library material&rdquo; and &ldquo;museum heritage objects&rdquo; being introduced in this Bill do not affect existing obligations as set out in the 1986 Act. This is because the National Museum and National Library are already listed as institutions in the Schedule to the National Archives Act, 1986, and this Bill does not affect that recognition.  These institutions are already required, in relation to what are defined in the 1986 Act as &ldquo;departmental records&rdquo;, to act only in accordance with that Act's provisions.  I assure the Senator that these provisions include the requirement of the order referred to in the amendments he tabled.  Therefore, any amendments along these lines are not necessary.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his acknowledgement of the genuine concerns which had been expressed to me and to the Minister and his staff.  This amendment clarifies and enhances the status of genealogy and heraldry and removes any scintilla of doubt in the minds of those who may have misinterpreted what this Bill was about in relation to its genealogical and heraldic aspects.</P>
      <P>This amendment provides a statutory role for the Chief Herald and the Genealogical Office and sets up a committee to be known as the Committee on Genealogy and Heraldry.  It is now clear that this institution and all its functions have not only been preserved but are enhanced and are placed in statute law.  Let us have an end to the argument.  I congratulate the Minister.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his election and wish him well in his post.</P>
      <P>In the discussion on Committee Stage, Senators raised a number of issues relating to the disposal of material in the collection of the National Library which I undertook to examine before Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris was concerned that the phrase &ldquo;printed matter&rdquo; might include typed letters which should not be disposed of even if a photographic record could be made of them. While I consider such material would not be included in that phrase, I table amendment No. 16 to substitute for it the phrase &ldquo;is a document wholly in print&rdquo; to make it clear that signed letters, etc., would be excluded.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee considered that the reference to disposing of material where there were duplicates in the collection of another institution in the State should take account of whether such collections were readily accessible.  For example, a duplicate in Galway would be less accessible to a Dublin reader than a book in the National Library. Amendment No. 17 provides for the inclusion of a qualifying phrase &ldquo;to which members of the public have reasonable access&rdquo;.  The phrase &ldquo;members of the public&rdquo; embraces everyone.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee was also concerned that, in disposing of library material, the board would have regard to the need to support access to such material in areas outside Dublin.  Amendment No. 19 imposes an obligation on the board to have regard to the accessibility of such material to members of the public when disposing of material to other cultural institutions.  I trust these two amendments meet Senator Lee's concerns.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 18 is a drafting amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 17, to delete lines 1 to 5 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  Each member appointed to be a member of the Board of the Museum under subsection (3)(b) shall be nominated by the Royal Irish Academy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This matter arose on Committee Stage.  I regret raising it again but it marks one of the relatively few philosophical differences between the Minister and me in our understanding of how Irish cultural affairs ought to be encouraged and fostered by the State.  Citizens working in a voluntary capacity who have contributed over the years to the promotion of a cultural and heritage dimension to our life should be recognised as legitimate partners with the State in the furthering of a common objective.  In this Bill, the Minister will be authorised to make all appointments to the boards, 16 to the Board of the National Museum and 12 to the Board of the National Library.  He has reserved places for nominees of the Royal Dublin Society and the Royal Irish Academy but will make the selection from names nominated by them.  They will propose people who will then become members of the boards.  Where the State is so involved, the Minister must have authority to ensure the general direction of policy is consistent with the State's ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, since the foundation of the State, a great deal of cultural life has been promoted by the activity of individuals in a voluntary capacity. The State has, in many respects, grossly neglected its responsibilities in the areas of cultural institutions, research support, etc.  We do not have humanities or social science boards and they are only now being introduced.  Many people who <Col N="786" /> have returned to Ireland, perhaps sacrificing careers abroad, and people who remained in Ireland who could have gone abroad have depended on foreign universities and foreign support for a great deal of their research activity.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate for the State to recognise the essential role of voluntary institutions and of private commitment to the furthering of cultural activity in Ireland by allowing some members of boards, which will be dominated by ministerial appointments anyway, to directly represent the major institutions of voluntary activity.  I do not think society in this respect ought to be regarded as an appendage of the State.  No one can accuse me of being hostile to State activity or anti-State in general philosophical terms.  However, it is very unfortunate that the opportunity has not been taken, as it could have in this Bill, to allow a couple of places nominated by these institutions to go on merit rather than being submitted for what will be, in the end, a decision partly influenced at least by party political considerations.  It is unfortunate and unnecessary. It does not establish the right degree of cooperation and rapport between public and private and the State and the individual that ought to inform legislation of this type.  Although it may seem a minor matter, an issue of principle is involved which could easily have been resolved without subverting the general thrust of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I followed Senator Lee's argument on this matter on Committee Stage.  I agree with his sentiments and am aware of the concerns he has expressed.  If this section goes through without amendment, the RIA can only nominate a number of names for consideration by the Minister.  Senator Lee's amendments propose that the RIA have the right of nomination to the boards.</P>
      <P>Since a certain status is granted to the RIA in this legislation, I was a little surprised that the Minister, in light of the rather weighty arguments in favour of the change, did not accept this amendment.  I do not understand the difficulty in doing this.  We acknowledge the role of the RIA and the Minister is going halfway in accepting nominations from them.</P>
      <P>Looking at it in a political and pragmatic manner, no Minister wishes to be tied as regards who they should nominate or the quality of those nominated.  There is an anti-democratic element to Senator Lee's amendment in that it hands over the right of nomination to an outside self-electing body which does not require public transparency, accountability and openness.  I have long argued in this House that we should try to hold the line in terms of democratic openness.  There is nobody better than a Minister, who is an elected representative, to decide on the merits of nominees.  On the politically pragmatic side I am against the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the more emotional side, and in light of the fact that the RIA is given a certain status in the <Col N="787" /> Bill, it seemed to be a natural progression that the Minister would have not have been sent a list of names to pick from but would ask who was wanted on it.  I am sure the Minister will act in concert with the RIA and will not accept a list of names and then pick someone else.  I am interested in why the Minister decided this amendment was not acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lee and Senator O'Toole in amendments Nos. 20,21 and 23 are seeking to make a number of changes to the compositions of the boards.  They wish to see the nominees of the RDS and the RIA appointed directly to the boards without the facility for the Minister to select from a number of nominees. They wish to see a person nominated by the Irish Committee of Historical Sciences appointed to the board of the library.</P>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, the amendments proposed by Senator Lee and Senator O'Toole concerning the RIA and the RDS would be at variance with written agreements recently reached by me concerning their future roles in the museum and library.  This involved a long process of negotiation and there was a harmonious result.  These agreements amend earlier agreements of 1881 and 1890. Included as an integral part of these agreements are specific provisions in relation to the roles of the RIA and the RDS in the boards being created.  These aspects of the agreements are reflected in the arrangements now proposed to be enshrined in statute.  I am satisfied these arrangements are in the interests of all concerned and are consistent with my view, that as far as possible, all members of a board should be appointed by the Minister of the day and members should serve in a personal capacity.</P>
      <P>The Minister of the day is accountable to the Oireachtas for his or her appointments to a board.  Each member of a board is accountable for their actions as members of that board.  This is the most democratic arrangement which serves the public interest best.  Allowing the Minister to select from a number of nominees also allows for factors, such as regional balance, to be taken on board as well as balancing other factors across all board members to get an appropriate mixture of skills, a point made by Senators on previous Stages.  As I explained at length on Committee Stage, I do not favour writing nominating bodies into legislation.  The RIA and the RDS are exceptions because of the earlier legal agreements to which I referred.  Accordingly, I cannot accept these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In amendment No. 22, Senator Lee and Senator O'Toole would like the criteria relating to appointments to the boards to be confined to those with attainments in the fields relevant to the museum and library, without an option for involvement by those with an interest in those institutions' fields.  As I said on Committee Stage, it is not necessary or desirable that involvement <Col N="788" /> in a board's affairs needs to be confined to those with attainments only.  Those with an interest in museum and library matters would be in a position to make valuable contributions to the operations of the boards.  I would not like the composition of a board to be overly restricted, as it might be if this amendment was adopted. Therefore, I do not accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of issues raised could detain us all evening and I do not want to contribute to that detention.  On the Minister's final point, I regard interest as redundant.  The distinction between having an interest in an area without attainments in it is subtle.  It seems to be an extraordinary achievement to be interested in an area without having what is considered an attainment in it.  Liberally defined, I regard interest as being subsumed under attainment. This is perhaps a semantic distinction but there may be something of more substance to it.</P>
      <P>I raised the issue of principle where I differ from the Minister.  The relationship between what I will loosely call the voluntary sector and the State is very different in cultural life from what it is in most other areas of activity.  Much of the cultural life of this society has depended on the unremunerated and voluntary activity of a large number of people whose prime purpose has not been personal advancement and who have not entered into the public sphere in any way.  It would be appropriate if legislation of this type could acknowledge the value of that contribution. The State has greatly neglected many cultural areas to which it ought to have contributed over the years.  Without the contribution of individuals and institutions such as the RIA, the RDS and the Committee of Historical Sciences, which represents historians North and South, a great deal of activity would not have happened and we would not have the current cultural infrastructure.</P>
      <P>I do not see how it is anti-democratic to acknowledge the contribution of people who have been active in an area without any personal gain involved.  We acknowledge the contribution and competence of people in a range of areas without saying it is anti-democratic, unless we take everyone equally, including those who have no interest in or have made no contribution to an area.  I hope I am as democratic in principle as anyone here but I do not interpret democracy in that way.</P>

    <P>I also differ from Senator Mooney as regards self-elected outside bodies not being publicly accountable.  I do not advocate any institution of that type having an inside track.  It reflects a great deal of suspicion on these institutions that they cannot be trusted to nominate an individual who is competent to serve on these boards.  That is not intended, but the imputation one could take from it is that only with ministerial approbation can the calibre of an individual be authenticated even if they represent the institutions.  If one distrusts the calibre of people and the capacity of the <Col N="789" /> institutions to nominate an appropriate person in this regard one may as well say they are incompetent to discharge any responsibility in which they are engaged.</P>
    <P>I am further disappointed rather than reassured by the Minister's invocation of the question of regional and other balances.  Surely where the Minister already has the direct nomination of the vast majority, it should not be dependent on a couple of names from the RDS, the RIA and the ICHS to achieve those balances on the board.  A Minister genuinely committed to regional balance or to other balances, such as gender balance, would have ensured on the basis of his direct nominees that that balance was already attained rather than having a choice made between names coming from these organisations based on criteria other than the innate calibre of these individuals to discharge these responsibilities.  It is a tail wagging the dog type of approach.</P>
    <P>I fear that difference remains between the Minister and myself and I hope that, between now and the Bill's passage through the Dáil, he will fashion a way in which expression could be found in this legislation to acknowledge the contribution of the voluntary sector in this area. One sees it as a partnership much more than society being a client of the State in this way. Only the Minister can do so if he is so minded.  I am not hung up on individual institutions and I mentioned the ones in the Bill already, but there would be far greater acceptance of the ethos of this Bill and a far greater degree of commitment to the principles behind it in the cultural community if the members of that community felt they were deemed worthy, through these institutions, of the nomination of even a tiny minority of the members of the boards.</P>

I said that, while I shared his concern, the basic quorum levels should be appropriate given the importance of the decisions being made by the boards.  Neither did I wish to tie the hands of boards unnecessarily but I propose to increase the quorum in each case by one; to five in the case of the library and to six in the museum.  I hope that I have gone some way to meet the Senator's concerns.</P>

I am pleased to introduce this amendment which establishes two such advisory committees.  Each is designed to suit the needs of the general public as appropriate to the museum and the library.</P>
      <P>The committee for the library is designed for those wishing to avail of reading and research facilities and the one for the museum is designed for those who would be visiting to view exhibitions and for educational purposes.

They have done so since the reorganisation of local government usually without claiming expenses. Those elected members of local authorities who carry out functions as members of library committees do so from a genuine and committed interest to the enhancement of the library system in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am not making an argument for county councillors <i>per se.</i>  I suggest that the Minister would give consideration to not only appointing members of the general public but to availing of the experience of those county councillors who have served on county library committees.

There is just one version; it will vary from time to time from being one of repository and security to one involving greater access, different types of usage, and so on.  That was the thinking behind this amendment.  It is healthy for the institutions to interact with those who use <Col N="793" /> their services.  The regional spread will be of value in the context of the balance referred to in relation to the structure, access, opening hours, etc.</P>
      <P>As long as they are users, members of local authorities are not excluded, although Members of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament are excluded.

      <P>This amendment arises from the debate on Second and Committee Stages.  It is not intended to restrict the committee's ambit or the Minister's choice.  If the amendment were accepted section 23(2) would state:</P>
      <P>A committee established by a Board under this section may, if the Board thinks fit, include in its membership persons who are not members of the Board and give due regard to persons concerned with Genealogical Research, Heraldry and related matters including members of Genealogical Organisations.</P>

      <P>On this occasion I have to come down in favour of general principles rather than specific inclusion.  The general principle is inclusive of the skills and expertise to which the Senator refers but his amendment would require that the boards of the library and museum should have due regard to appointing people with genealogical experience to advisory committees. The section is designed to meet many circumstances in which an advisory committee might be needed.  It would not be appropriate to single out a particular area of expertise for special mention when the requirements would be so broad and would vary with the type of committee.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the general inclusion accommodates the principle but it would be contravened by the specific reference the Senator seeks.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The principle of the amendment may have been affected by the clarification I gave earlier.  Amendment No. 31 would seek to exclude archival material from the proposed transfer of property from the Minister to the boards of the museum and library.  Any archival material, such as departmental records which is not covered by the term &ldquo;library material&rdquo;, would be regarded as being transferred to and becoming the property of the boards of the museum and library.  Any departmental records generated once the boards are established would also become their property.  However, this transfer of records is not seen as affecting current and future obligations of the museum and library in relation to departmental records as currently set out in The National Archives Act, 1986.  Since other archival material including the term &ldquo;library material&rdquo; is already excluded from the transfer of property, it is not necessary to accept this amendment to achieve what the Bill does.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that clarification which I hope will allay the unease expressed about this.  So much of this relates to the National Archives Act, 1986, that it is very important that the incoming boards would be absolutely clear as to their responsibilities imposed by the due legislation and not simply take their responsibilities from this Act alone. From this perspective, the National Archives Act, 1986, becomes very important to these people and measures should be taken to ensure they are fully aware of that.  Otherwise very unfortunate oversights could occur.  I presume the Minister will ensure that happens.</P>

      <P>In page 26, line 43, after &ldquo;material,&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;archival material&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This comes back to what appears to be my obsession with archival material.  This is to ensure that, wherever there is a possible danger of archival material falling between two stools, the phraseology ensures it could not be overlooked. Maybe the National Archives Act, 1986, anticipates that and is adequate.  If so, I ask for assurance that the same procedure be followed <Col N="796" /> and that the incoming board be fully alerted to their responsibilities under that legislation as well as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give that administrative assurance.  I appreciate the intention but am happy that the definition of cultural object is sufficient.  The amendment would add archival material to the list of objects encompassed by the definition.  The Senator can be assured that the definition is wide enough to cover any sort of archival material appropriate to be exhibited by any of the bodies covered by the provisions. Accordingly it is not necessary to include the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 36 is designed to expand the concept of the Register of Cultural Objects to include library materials, museum heritage objects, etc.  As I said on amendment No. 32, the definition of cultural objects is broad enough to encompass the material referred to in the amendment.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the reason for defining such cultural objects was to avoid repetition of the different types of object that constituted different sections of the Bill.  To expand, the Register of Cultural Objects is designed primarily to cater for objects whose export or destruction would be a serious loss to the country.  The concept of the Register of Cultural Objects is particularly for single objects, such as centrally important archaeological objects of gold and silver, the valuable paintings in the Sir Hugh Lane Bequest, <i> The Taking of Christ</i> by Caravaggio or valuable manuscripts like the Book of Kells.</P>
      <P>The problems of using the definition in a much broader way would give rise to problems of practicality, such as the difficulty of identifying what is meant by a collection of material.  The real danger would be that the meaning would become so broad as to make the provision unworkable.  I appreciate the intention behind the amendments and the Senators can be assured that the definition is adequate.  The necessary support and administrative measures of clarification will be implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  I am more concerned here than in some other cases because not everybody might think of &ldquo;cultural objects&rdquo; as including archival material.  The Minister should reassure himself particularly that the interpretation is crystal clear as &ldquo;cultural object&rdquo; is defined in section 41 and it is not defined elsewhere.  The Bill states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;cultural object&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 41.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only definition, and archival material is not specifically mentioned.  The Minister and I would interpret it to mean that but not everybody would.  In this case it might be worth reconsidering whether it should be listed there to guard against that eventuality.  One cannot go on <Col N="797" /><i>ad nauseam</i> and break this down into smaller and smaller components but archival material is a wideranging concept, however uncertain we are about its precise frontiers.  I would be grateful if the Minister gave this further attention.</P>

      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to address points relating to minimum value thresholds on export licences for documents and paintings.  These amendments propose to permit the Minister to establish the value limits under which no licence would be required for the export of paintings or documents.  As the text is currently worded, a value limit is only required for objects relating to the decorative arts.  While no minimum limit is applied under the Documents and Pictures (Regulation of Export) Act, 1945, and this was reflected in the Bill as initiated, it does mean that a painting valued at £5, of little cultural heritage value and sold in a small shop to an American tourist, would be covered.  Equally, a painting by a member of a family which an individual might bring abroad when changing residences and which is only of sentimental value might be covered.  I understand that, in practice, no export licence is currently sought in many of these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In revising the export licence provisions and introducing penalties, I am anxious to ensure the provisions are effective and enforceable.  It has been represented to me that if the provisions were left as proposed they would place an undue burden on traders, particularly those outside Dublin who would not have the same speedy access to the National Gallery for the issue of licences.  They would also lead to a large volume of applications <Col N="799" /> and consequent administrative work, much of which would fall outside the core objective of protecting our cultural heritage.  Accordingly, I propose a provision whereby the Minister may by order set minimum value limits below which a licence would not be required.  While I do not anticipate the same difficulty in relation to documents, I am providing for a minimum limit in case similar difficulties arise.</P>
    <P>It is also being proposed in these amendments that any value limit set by the Minister may also be changed by ministerial order.  That is an important flexibility on matters that might arise from time to time.  The change will give reasonable flexibility in the administration of these licensing requirements without affecting the broad thrust of the main proposals.</P>

      <P>I welcome what the Minister has said, although it may not go as far as the Antique Dealers Association wishes.  Amendment No. 41 was certainly not drafted by the Minister because it is ungainly and tautologous.  It reads:</P>
      <P>In page 31, lines 35 to 37, to delete &ldquo;any paintings (other than paintings in the ownership of the person who painted them) not less than 25 years old of which are painted&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;any painting (other than a painting in the ownership of the person who painted it) not less than 25 years old of a value exceeding such amount (if any) as may be specified by order made by the Minister which is painted&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>How can one have a painting which is not painted?  Or is it the Minister who is painted?</P>
      <P>The 25 year rule is out of kilter with practice in the rest of Europe.  The Antique Dealers' Association wrote to me as follows:</P>
      <P>Our association is deeply concerned about part of the National Cultural Institutions Bill, 1996.  By applying a ruling that any painting over 25 years old will require a licence before exporting it will have a disastrous effect on our trade.  It will deter people from buying as this applies to paintings of any monetary value from one penny upwards.  Many sales are done on an instant decision to people outside Ireland and if they were told that an export licence was required they would not purchase.  Licences cannot be issued instantly and will take considerable time to issue.  The granting of a licence can be subject to a delay of up to a year in the proposed legislation, which is unacceptable.  We propose that the length should not be more than six months for articles of major historical importance.</P>
      <P>Section 49 (2) (c) of the Bill states:</P>
      <P>in any other case, the Minister shall grant the licence and any such licence may be subject to the condition that the object shall not be exported before the expiration of one year from the date of the application of the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> The Antique Dealers' Association proposes that the legislation should be the same as the EU legislation for the export of cultural goods, controlled by EC Regulation 3911/92, <i>Official Journal No. L395,</i> 31 December 1992.  This proposed legislation will not only apply to commercial activity but also to items removed out of the State in household removals.  In the opinion of the association, the legislation is unjust and unworkable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has addressed a certain amount of the association's concerns but he might go further.  I have not put down an amendment but the Minister will take the Bill to the Dáil where further arguments will be made.  I ask him to consider the time limit in particular.  In the UK, for example, there is both an EU licence and a UK licence.  I will not read the full regulations into the record but, as an example, the provisions which apply to drawings cover those more than 50 years old, executed entirely by hand on any medium and in any material &mdash; for the UK licence the value is £39,600 and for the EU licence it is £11,900; for original engravings, xerographs, lithographs and their respective plates and original posters &mdash; again more than 50 years old - the same considerable values apply for the UK and EU licences.  As to photographs, films and negatives thereof, more than 50 years old, the UK licence applies at £6,000 and the EU licence at £11,900 &mdash; the same time limit applies to these materials, which many people would regard as less significant.  As to the painted materials, for portraits and likenesses which are more than 50 years old of British historic persons, the qualification for a UK licence is a value of £6,000, for an EU licence it is £119,000; for paintings in oil or tempera over 50 years old, excluding portraits of British historic persons, the figure for both UK and EU licences is £119,000; for paintings over 50 years old in other media, excluding portraits of British historic persons, the figures are £39,600 for a UK licence and £119,000 for an EU licence.</P>
    <P>There are two principles and the Minister has gone some way to meet them; first, a 25 year limit includes work of comparatively modern, almost immediate production &mdash; it is a short time in the art world.  A period of 50 years is standard in Europe and applies in our closest neighbouring jurisdiction.  I have placed considerable detail on the record but I have not trespassed on the House by including too much parallel information; I mentioned what is directly relevant.  Second, these are items of some considerable value and, to be modest, the threshold must be at least £10,000.  Paintings worth less than that are in the world of commercial transaction and availability. I wondered whether the Bill should specify these values in terms of a cut-off period of 50 years and a specific and sizeable value.</P>
    <P>The Minister has addressed some of the principles involved; his argument is that in controlling it by ministerial order he retains flexibility in terms of market fluctuation so that <Col N="801" /> he can respond to immediate circumstances.  I would be happier if &ldquo;25 years&rdquo; could be changed to &ldquo;50 years&rdquo;, which is the practice in comparable jurisdictions, and if a specific and reasonably modest limit of £10,000 could be imposed, particularly when it is £30,000, £50,000 and £100,000 in the neighbouring island.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The time limit should be 50 years.  An antique of 25 years could only be considered a fledgling.  I understand the Minister reduced the time limit to 25 years because recent paintings by Yeats and other artists came on the market.  However, United Kingdom and EU legislation has adopted a time limit of 50 years. We want to be seen as modern people so our legislation should be in accord with the rest of Europe.  The EU and the UK adopted a value of £119,000.  I know the Minister has the power to do that in the legislation.  I congratulate him for tabling these amendments which go a long way towards addressing the problem.  However, he should give further consideration to these points.</P>
      <P>Many artists reside here because of our fiscal system.  We should be careful not to introduce legislation which would adversely affect that.  The export of good art and beautiful objects from this country enhances our image abroad.  We should not do anything to harm that image.  The United Kingdom has established itself as a great sales market.  People sell their objects of art at Christies and Sothebys and this generates much money in the UK.  This legislation will not affect that but if we legislate for more than the EU requirement, it will not convey the right image.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in this legislation about documents.  This means letters written by our grandmothers could be included in this category. A substantial value should be placed on documents.  The Minister has gone a step further than the EU requirement because he has put a time limit of 70 years on documents, whereas the EU time limit is 50 years.  Perhaps the Minister would consider changing it to 50 years.  We should also include furniture which is not less than 50 years old.</P>
      <P>The legislation does not clarify if paintings are crayon drawings, water-colours or oils.  EU and UK legislation outlines the difference in a Schedule to the Bill.  I hope the Minister takes these points on board.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris and I seem to have received the same correspondence.  The age of the paintings is particularly relevant because it means that paintings from 1970 onwards are covered by this legislation.  Having bought paintings before and since that time, I would be surprised if those from the 1960s were considered antiques and those from the 1970s were not.  Perhaps the Minister could ensure that the legislation is in line with European Union requirements.  I do not know many artists who are fortunate enough to <Col N="802" /> still have some of their earlier works in their collections, but they are only 30 years old.  It would be difficult for them if they could not sell these outside the country.  I realise how important it is to keep our national heritage, particularly the early works of our more famous painters who have gone abroad.  One must remember that as well as the antique dealers who are involved in this, there are also artists living here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with the issue of language and I have great sympathy with Senator Norris in this regard.  It is not the suggestion that the Minister is a painted Minister or the order is a painted order.  If the wording is inserted in the text of the Bill, it would mean painted entirely by hand or in any medium or material which contextualises, to use an unfortunate Americanism, a little better.</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to this discussion.  My Department officials had a meeting last Monday with the Irish Antique Dealers Association.  It was worried about different types of limits.  My officials pointed out that in making a ministerial order we would bear its views in mind.  Before I make the ministerial order on specific categories, I can take many of its arguments into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not as certain about valuation or age as those who buy and sell these objects.  I have a clear ministerial obligation in the legislation to protect such objects.  I do not have the power to refuse a licence except in the case of a listed cultural object.  The purpose is that in the interests of the people and the State one will at least have an idea of the flow.  We have to balance what is fair with what is practical.  As somebody looking from outside who has an interest in painting, I am not enormously moved by arguments about modernity.  We are commercially modern and in harmony with Europe.  However, a flat figure of £119,000, for example, would exclude many of the Jack Yeats paintings that have been sold.  I had to incorporate flexibility in the provision so I can adjudge the context of an object within its category of objects and its importance within the categories of culture that are important to people. It is possible that in practice I can move to meet <Col N="803" /> many of the points being made by the Irish Antique Dealers' Association but to do that I will need flexibility.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about specifying value limits in legislation because different categories will require different treatments.  I have undertaken to discuss appropriate limits with the Irish Antique Dealers' Association before introducing an order and I will do that across the categories of objects.  It is crude commercially to take a figure as the European standard in relation to my attitude to the mosaic that is the Europe in which I believe and which acknowledges cultural diversity.  I insist on the right of the Minister of the day to have a specificity that is adjudged within the cultural terms of this country.  In some countries, for example, the category of objects is different from others.</P>
    <P>If one has the discretion for which I have provided in the amendments, one has the flexibility to go up or down and to act quickly. Where, for example, something within a certain class of objects may not in value terms meet the criterion for protection but might be valuable otherwise, one can move to protect it.  That arises particularly in relation to furniture.</P>
    <P>Under amendment No. 47, the Minister can vary the age limit of 15, 25 and so forth.  Current legislation has no age limit.  The provision for 25 years improved the situation but the amendment permits that limit to be changed.  I have already discussed the age limit for documents in the context of Senator Lee's amendment.  I am reducing the age limit for documents from the current 100 years to 70 years.  However, I have the power to vary it to 50 years when I see how the reduction from 70 years to 50 years will work.</P>
    <P>There might have been a misunderstanding about the 12 months rule.  The power to defer a licence for 12 months applies only to category G items on the cultural register to allow time for the purchase of these significant items within the State.  An alert, as it were, is set up and there is a period in which to act in the public interest.  With regard to other licences, I have given an undertaking that they will continue to be done on a timely basis.</P>
    <P>I listened with great care to the points made. I do not want a system that is unworkable.  The discretions we are seeking in these amendments and the ability to vary time limits will be useful. People will see that rather than having a specified common European valuation we will be better able to protect all categories in different circumstances if we proceed on this basis.  Before I make ministerial orders I will meet the Irish Antique Dealers' Association and discuss limits within categories.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his valuable consideration and contribution on this matter.  I accept that he has discretion in this regard.  However, I appeal to him to start with a limit of 50 rather than 25 years to avoid setting <Col N="804" /> the wheels in motion and then having to reverse them.  Ireland is becoming a great centre for antique dealing.  A number of visitors come here seeking antiques and a number of antiques of Irish origin return to this country and are moved out again.  I do not wish the wrong message to be sent to these people if our legislation is tightly drawn in this respect.</P>
      <P>With regard to documents, we need more clarity.  There is not much point in introducing legislation that is unworkable, if something is not clear it will not work.  If every object which is 25 years old is covered by the legislation people will be coming out of the woodwork looking for licences and the legislation will not work.  I thank the Minister for his tolerance and ask him to think again about the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Between now and introducing the Bill in the Dáil I can look at what should be included in the orders.  I wish to make one point perfectly clear because Senator Haughey made a point that would be made by the Irish Antique Dealers' Association.  There are people who do not submit themselves to the discipline of an association such as the Irish Antique Dealers' Association and who are sending valuable material out of the country.  It is happening throughout the country.  I am familiar with cases of people who have, in some cases, stolen items. These items are gathered in yards and exported every day of the week.</P>
      <P>As Minister I must ensure there is a system that allows people to work but I am also motivated by the protection of heritage.  While we must strike the necessary balance, I wish I had greater and speedier power to clamp down on the irresponsible, who are well known.  I heard an argument from a professional association in Britain which suggested that legislation I introduce is so tough it might be a disincentive to certain people.  I am deeply committed to the concept of the people's heritage and I accept that disciplined associations such as the Irish Antique Dealers' Association are making reasonable suggestions.  I will bear them in mind but I also must bear in mind the bigger picture.  I wish we could move more quickly and come down like a ton of bricks on people who have no responsibility to anything except their personal greed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right.  The Irish Antique Dealers' Association have been important in alerting us to the fact that goods of unique Irish origin are being exported without any thought about the loss to the country.  I am glad the Minister has pointed out that we must <Col N="805" /> deal with two types of people, those who are reputable, have the interests of the country at heart and who wish to maintain what we can of our heritage, and those who are plundering our heritage and selling items where they wish with no thought for what it might mean for a locality and its history or for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the concern eloquently expressed by the Minister as well as by Senators Henry and Kelly.  There should be no mercy for the plundering mentality and the disallowed amendments Nos. 38 and 39 were not entirely unmotivated by that mentality.  There must be a system establishing institutional safeguards against that as well as education to raise local consciousness.  The relationship between national and local is one of the areas which is not as adequately treated in this legislation as one would ideally wish it to be.  The Minister cannot do everything simultaneously but relations between local authorities, curators' groups, the National Museum and the Department should be kept in mind.  I hope the Minister will proceed as fast as he can from where he has begun with this legislation.  It sounds ungrateful to ask him to continue when we have not completed this Bill but the Minister is going in the right direction.  I hope he will know from the Seanad that it is right to continue in that direction as quickly as possible.  However, it means elevating local matters to national level and incorporating the totality, otherwise there will be escape routes and exits from all the good intentions in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister and support his efforts to retain artefacts of great value to our heritage.  Something that is 25 years old cannot be considered as an antique.  I presume the Minister is referring to the great fireplaces and pieces of furniture that are being exported.  However, introducing legislation which makes it more difficult for people who wish to conform and who are sincere about protecting what we all wish to protect, will only be unhelpful.  Changing the period from 25 to 50 years will not make any difference in that respect. Any legislation that is not good may be enforced but it will not work.</P>

      <P>A two-pronged problem has arisen involving antiques and our cultural heritage.  Various values can be put on either but the fundamental principle of the Bill is the protection of our cultural heritage.  It is reasonable to place a limit of 25 years because some of our finest works have been created within that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Trading in antiques is a commercial and monetary issue but our cultural heritage goes far beyond that.  It is of value to us as a nation and as a people.  This Bill should have <Col N="806" /> been before the House 25 years ago because the amount of valuable cultural objects that have been cleaned out of the country during that period is a national scandal.  It is a shame that so much damage has been done in this way.  So much has been exported to the United States, Australia and to various parts of Europe.  With this legislation I am glad that now something will be done to stop the plundering of our assets.</P>
      <P>In rural areas some sort of blackguarding goes on every day.  In the dark of night some old house that has been closed up is broken into.  They rip out the fabulous antique fireplaces which disappear across the water before we know they are missing.  Old furniture and paintings are also stolen.  The amount of plundering that has happened is despicable and, unfortunately, it continues to happen.  In addition, some of our beautiful monastic ruins have been robbed of their arches and old stones which are exported illegally.</P>
      <P>The tighter the restrictions the better, and 25 years is too short a limit.  The Minister should make strong ministerial orders to convey a distinct message.  The powers of law and order should be used against those involved to stop this from happening.</P>

      <P>In a spirit of reasonableness, I deeply appreciate the support of Senators.  We are at one in relation to securing the heritage.  In response to Senator Haughey, when I come to look at the categories I can address many of the problems of the antique dealers' association.  For example, I am sure this association would have a different view as to whether material brought into the country and then sent out again would be caught in the restriction.  There is a difference between that and material produced 25 years ago by a significant Irish painter within a tradition. Therefore, looking at the categories we can seek that which we are protecting and be both flexible and reasonable about it.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn and others that we should have had better protection in years gone by.  It is upsetting to see holes and gaps where significant objects were.  There is a difference between an object that falls within the categories affected and something that is essential and crucial to the cultural history of the people. We will be able to discuss that under the flexibility of the amendment and we can have further talks with the association as well.</P>

      <P>This amendment arose from discussions on Committee Stage on the issue of archival material and the role of the Director of the National Archives.  I re-examined various provisions in the Bill, some of which were already discussed, and I consider it desirable to amend the power to delegate functions in respect of export licences to refer to &ldquo;documents&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;library material&rdquo; to be consistent with phraseology used in section 49.  I am also providing for the possibility that some functions in this area will be delegated to the Director of the National Archives rather than just the library, depending on the category of the document involved.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 59 clarifies that the Minister may not simply transfer all or none of his or her functions in relation to offences.  However, he or she could delegate functions in relation to some classes of offence while retaining and not delegating functions in relation to others.  Both amendments are designed to provide flexibility.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's response but I wish to highlight two points.  The first involves the relationship between the Director of the National Archives and the National Library.  This will be an issue of continuing relevance and any legislation introduced or decisions taken in respect of one should take cognisance of the implications for the other, at producer and customer levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point, which Senator Haughey raised in a different context, relates to the definition of &ldquo;document&rdquo;.  I am loath to repeat definitions <i>ad nauseam.</i>  However, the Minister correctly accepted an amendment tabled by Senator Mooney and under this section <Col N="810" />&ldquo;document&rdquo; includes estate records, etc.  The implication is that in other sections this is not the case.  I am not stating that this is correct but there are those who would argue along those lines.  It would be worthwhile considering this matter before Report Stage in the Dáil to see if the definition can be tightened without supplicating or choking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I signalled that, arising from representations made by interested parties, amendments to section 64 might be introduced on Report Stage to permit a more comprehensive deposit of material relating to Ireland in the National Library.  This is my attempt to respond to those representations and I believe it will recommend itself to Members.  I am now in a position to introduce amendments to section 64, which make significant changes in the scope of the requirement of mandatory deposit of library material by publishers in the National Library, for the purpose of strengthening the provisions.  This is to be <Col N="811" /> achieved by removing a provision which could permit a publisher to avoid the deposit requirements, ensuring that any material relating to Ireland distributed in the State, and not first published in the State, can be subject to deposit in the National Library and enhancing the prospect of developing new reciprocal arrangements with the United Kingdom regarding library material other than books.</P>
      <P>The changes are somewhat complex and are explained as follows.  The provision whereby library material of any sort must be first published in the State to be depositable is to be dropped.  The effect of this change will be that library material published in the State, whether or not published here first, must be deposited with the National Library.  Senators will be aware of the problems experienced by people who first published work abroad and then tried to publish it in the State.  Because we are dropping the concept of first published in the State we must consider a revised definition for &ldquo;published&rdquo; if everything distributed is not to be covered. Accordingly, a definition of &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; will replace that of &ldquo;publish&rdquo;.  Except as specifically set out, the word &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; will apply to persons who publish or cause to be published books or other library material in the State.</P>
      <P>A new requirement being introduced is that persons who do not publish in the State, but who distribute library material in the State which includes subject matter relating substantially to Ireland, will be required to make a deposit of one copy of such material in the National Library.  As the class of material that may be subject to become depositable in the library is wider than first envisaged, I also propose that the making of regulations by the board of the library, with the consent of the Minister, will be required before any classes of material are deposited.  As currently worded, regulations are not required before the various types of material must be lodged, unless a class has been excluded.</P>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; and the deletion of the requirement in relation to &ldquo;first published&rdquo; are also being applied to the mandatory deposit of books under the Copyright Act, 1963, for consistency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is comprehensive legislation on which the Minister is to be complimented.  The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht must now ensure adequate resourcing and funding of these important national cultural institutions.  With the help of the Minister we have passed a much strengthened Bill.  However, much of this good work will come to nothing unless there is a follow through commitment.</P>
      <P>I do not doubt for one moment the 100 per cent commitment of the Minister or his understanding of the difficulties faced by our three cultural institutions.  At the same time, I hope that a collective message will go out from this House that it is not sufficient to bring forward important legislation relating to these institutions if the noble aspirations contained in them and the weighty arguments advanced in support of them are overruled especially by the financial considerations of Governments who have traditionally placed culture on a much lower priority level than even the Minister would like. I am making a global request for a follow through commitment that those cultural institutions will be adequately financed to allow for their orderly development.</P>
      <P>There is a great need to bring the National Library and the National Museum into the modern era.  Much of what is contained in this Bill will address that in terms of the granting of licences and the ability to generate finance even though I was not in favour of this happening through entrance fees.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht should not be fighting this case alone.  It is vital that the Government collectively discharges its responsibility in the area of culture as it relates to the provisions contained in this Bill.  This view is shared by all the members of my party.</P>

      <P>I echo what Senator Mooney has said.  This Bill will lead to frustration if its objectives are not properly resourced.  It will be like the new obligations imposed on school principals in the White Paper on Education whereby it is assumed they can do more work without any additional resources to support them. The Minister will have to battle with the Minister for Finance and he has our support in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we establish the right relationship between national and local level. <Col N="814" /> There is much work to be done including meeting the concerns of the local authority curators group, the question of designated areas under the National Monuments Act and so on.  I know the Minister's heart is in the right place and I hope we can build on this and assist a much wider range of institutions, both public and private, at national level.  I congratulate the Minister. Gabhaim buíochas don Aire agus a Stáit Seirbhísí a thug tacaíocht dho.  Gúim rath ar an mBille seo.</P>

      <P>I echo the remarks made by Senator Mooney particularly on the Government's attitude towards protecting and enhancing our national heritage.  There are no incentives provided in the Bill for members of the public at home or abroad to make contributions towards our institutions.  If we want to enhance and enlarge our assets in this area it would have been helpful to do so.</P>
      <P>I did not get an opportunity to speak on section 49 but I would like the Minister to make a statement at an appropriate time on the level of efficiency we can expect from civil servants when applications are made for licences.  I am not suggesting that they are inefficient but one can imagine how much of a disincentive it would be for tourists to buy an artefact if they have to wait 12 months for a licence.  The Minister is shaking his said indicating this will not happen but I would like him to make a statement to that effect.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Senators for the thoroughness with which they approached this Bill.  It is true to say that the legislation is long overdue.  Some of the agreements we are discussing come from the last 20 years of the 19th century.  The Bill is very comprehensive and at times public attention was drawn to one or two sections of it.  This may have deflected attention away from other sections but on Committee Stage and Report Stage we have gone through it very thoroughly.</P>
      <P>The is a better Bill as a result of the interest Senators have taken in it.  In putting it through the Seanad I sought to respond as much as possible to the suggestions made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage we touched briefly on the point Senator Haughey made about financial incentives but the conclusion was that this is a matter for the Finance Bill.  While I have a positive view in relation to that matter, I must <Col N="815" /> negotiate with my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>When preparing the institutions for the 21st century I identified three areas of need.  First, legislation must be adequate and modern; second, we need flexible and accountable institutional arrangements which satisfy the professionals, the staff who work in the institutions and the public; and third, we must have adequate resources.  We cannot have one without the other.  The cultural institutions are underfunded.  I am not making a political point because it was made by both sides of the House.  I am pleased the Seanad supports attempts to provide the cultural institutions with more resources.  We have progressed further and the House has put its imprint on legislation which will be followed by good institutional arrangements.  We will fight for adequate resources.</P>
    <P>As regards the Bill's implementation, I hope there will be no tardiness as regards any outcome of the legislation.  I have great confidence in the staff of the institutions and I would like to express my gratitude to them.  Over the years they have had to look up while those with political responsibility should have taken greater care and appreciated the importance of the institutions.  Tá mé thar a bheith buíoch don obair a chuir an Seanad isteach, do na leasuithe agus don díospóireacht agus níl aon amhras orm ach go bhfuil an Bille i fhad níos fearr dá bharr.</P>

It is unprecedented, certainly in my ten years in the House, that a Bill initiated here should be so amended not only by Government but by the Opposition.  Amendments were accepted by the Minister graciously and a good spirit permeated the mood of the debate.  I wish him well with this Bill.</P>
      <P>I thank those outside the House, especially the Dún Laoghaire Genealogical Society, the CIGO and individuals who adopted a positive approach. The Minister and I made valid criticisms of media distortions on aspects of the Bill.  However, it is only fair that I single out the Dún Laoghaire Genealogical Society as an exception in that it was extremely positive at all times.  Its newsletters testify to that fact among its 300 plus membership.</P>
      <P>I express my sincere thanks and that of my party for the manner in which this debate was progressed and on the way the amendments were accepted.  I hope the Minister will not have to spend as long in the other House as he has done here; that it would be a tribute to the activities of Members of this House.</P>

    <Title>Great Lakes Region of Africa: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I would like to begin this important debate on the situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa. When the seriousness of the crisis facing Zaire and Rwanda emerged, many people believed it would be on the same scale as the disaster which hit Rwanda two years ago.  We should be grateful that this did not result in widespread loss of life and that many Rwandan nationals were able to return to their homes.  Although the crisis has subsided, it does not mean that the problems which beset the continent have been solved.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate my Labour Party colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burton, who headed the EU Troika of Development Ministers on a visit to Rwanda and Zaire. Following the visit of the Minister, who is currently President of the EU Council of Ministers on Development, she told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs of the need for the rapid deployment of a UN Force to protect a large scale humanitarian operation which would, in effect, be the key to saving hundreds of thousands of lives.</P>
      <P>The humanitarian situation in the Great Lakes region is at a critical phase.  The large scale population movement in the region has caused serious problems and it is imperative that these problems are addressed by the international community.  As the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in the Dáil today, since 15 November 1996 an estimated 500,000 Rwandans have returned to Rwanda from camps in eastern Zaire.  In the same time-frame significant population movements have also occurred from camps further west into Zaire, Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi.  In addition, a further 500,000 million Rwandan refugees remain in exile in camps in Tanzania.  Given that the current population movements which are causing so many problems are not yet over and that there are further significant movements through the region, the need for a rapid reaction is obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I already mentioned, the Minister has visited the region and her description of the <Col N="817" /> abandonment of children in forests with little hope of survival was particularly disturbing.  It is hard to believe such a thing could happen in today's world.  The notion of children being abandoned in forests because their parents can only carry babies is something which belongs to books on the trauma of a bygone colonial age.</P>
    <P>More frighteningly, the deteriorating situation in the Great Lakes region has brought the awful spectre of genocide and ethnic division which we witnessed Rwanda in 1994.  It was in the context of this frightening scenario that the EU recently agreed to a series of measures to provide both immediate and long-term humanitarian and development assistance.  As a result, a package of 170 million ECU for the Great Lakes region was proposed.  This funding would be used immediately to provide food and shelter for refugees.  However, it is also intended that this money will be used to initiate a long-term programme of social and economic rehabilitation in the region.  The Minister's dedication and committed work in heightening international awareness about the ongoing crisis in the Great Lakes region is to be commended and I acknowledge the work she is doing.</P>
    <P>As the recently published White Paper on Foreign Policy notes, Ireland's foreign policy is much more than self-interest.  For many of us, it is a statement of the kind of people we are.  This notion is illustrated in our concern for human rights and our exemplary record in the field of humanitarian help.  Irish NGOs have been the vanguard of crisis management in developing countries for many years and have set an example for other countries to follow.  Those of us who visited countries such as Somalia, as I did many years ago, or Zaire, as the Minister did, can testify to the work these people are doing.  The international aid agencies, including Concern and Trócaire, are involved in the distribution of essential food and non-food items.  In addition, the Government has already announced an aid package of £2.25 million which is being channelled to the Irish NGOs involved in the operation in the Great Lakes region.</P>
    <P>Ireland has had a long association with the United Nations and is rightly proud of its ongoing support for effective international action in areas such as peacekeeping and the protection of human rights.  I welcome the Government's decision to agree to a request from the UN to contribute to the humanitarian mission and propose that we send a contingent from the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>From what I saw on television, it must have been very frightening for the Minister when she was in Rwanda.  I agree with Senator Maloney that she did great work there for the best part of a week and it is nice to see matters improving.  The Minister had her hands full but she seemed to make great progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> Everyone is horrified by what is happening out there.  There seems to be no end to the number of refugees.  It is unreal to think that such poverty and starvation should exist today.  Maybe the United Nations could have acted more decisively. I would be critical of them after what the Minister has done because we cannot stand idly by.  We must make an effort.  I do not suggest that the Minister, the Government and the Irish aid agencies did not do anything as it would be fair to say that they were to the forefront in getting aid to the region.  I hope it arrived on time.</P>
    <P>I remember listening to Nell McCafferty on the radio one morning and she could not understand why, if she was only half a mile from the camp, someone from the United Nations or the international aid agencies could not go to the camp and get the people to move back to their homes.  She painted a horrifying picture.</P>
    <P>It seems to me as an ordinary individual who reads the newspapers and watches the news on television that something has gone terribly wrong if helpless people are forced from their homes. The situation is now slightly improved.  A half million people have gone back to their homes but Senator Maloney mentioned that another half million are still in exile.  I hope the efforts of the Minister, the Government and the Irish aid agencies will help to solve the problem.  The Minister's efforts are not going unnoticed because it was the one piece of news I watched every night for the last three to four weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Maloney for their kind comments.  I was proud to represent Ireland in Rwanda, a small country the size of Munster.  Zaire is a large country the size of western Europe.  We have, as a result of our historical experience and peace process, an understanding of the complexity of trying to build reconciliation and trust and rebuild the countries involved as well.</P>
      <P>The European Union has offered a substantial humanitarian package to the Great Lakes region of 170 million ECU which is absolutely essential. We must examine four separate areas in this crisis because it is complex.  We must examine Rwanda, Zaire, Burundi and Tanzania.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 500,000 refugees have returned to Rwanda which, as Senator Lanigan will know from his participation in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, is little short of a miracle compared to a month ago.  So far, those people have returned in conditions of remarkable peace, without any violence or killing.  In order to sustain that, it will be necessary for the European Union, Ireland and the development agencies to put money, resources and effort into supporting the return being maintained on a peaceful basis.  I cannot stress the importance of that.  We need to supply money for food and seeds for the first planting season to make refugees self-sufficient. Rwanda is a very crowded but very fertile country <Col N="819" /> with a lot of potential as it has volcanic soil and two to three crops per year can be grown.</P>
    <P>Second, we must put more money in the medium-term into housing provision for refugees. This is a big political problem.  At the moment, the Rwandan Government has told people, some of whom are survivors of the genocide and took over empty houses, that they have 15 days to get out and make way for the returning refugees, some of whom are implicated in the killings of the families of those who survived and occupied the houses.  In order to sort out this political and humanitarian situation &mdash; the need for both parties to have shelter &mdash; there has to be a huge housebuilding effort in Rwanda.  This will be done by local people, using local materials such as bricks which are easily handmade, but with the international community supplying the money for door and window kits and tin for the roofs. Rwandans can work in partnership with the international agencies to build hundreds of thousands of shelters and housing units, which will be important in the long-term.</P>
    <P>The issue of justice must be addressed.  There are more than 80,000 people in Rwandan jails who are accused, to a greater or lesser extent, of involvement in and or the carrying out of genocide.  They will be brought to trial in the next few months.  In assisting the Rwandan Government, Irish aid has specifically funded elements of the justice system.  Some of the many people returning home will inevitably be charged with genocide.  We must insist on the Rwandan Government putting a justice system in place.  I visited Rwandan jails.  No jail in Africa is a pretty place and Mountjoy is a paradise &mdash; it is first class luxury &mdash; by comparison.  Many prisons in Rwanda would be similar to this Chamber holding 2,000 people standing up.  Prisoners are well provided for as regards water, food and medicine and there are no complaints of ill-treatment. However, there is the most inhuman overcrowding it is possible to imagine, resulting in phlebitis, other diseases and the risk of prisoner's legs rotting.  The justice system is important, both as a human rights issue and as a focus and force for reconciliation in Rwandan society.  The European Union should be willing to assist Rwanda in rebuilding all the areas I have spoken about, as well as in health and education.</P>
    <P>Zaire is the second country we need to address. It is a large country with more than 300 major national ethnic groups.  The rebel forces, some Banyamulenge and some who have been fighting since the time of Lumumba &mdash; it was Ireland's first international peacekeeping involvement &mdash; have come together in East Kivu.  The EU is supporting an election process in Zaire, which must be open to the participation of all Zaireans. The Banyamulenge have been there for 300 years and cannot suddenly be deprived of their Zairean citizenship.  Equally, along the borders of the eight countries to Zaire, different groups cannot be picked out and told they are no longer <Col N="820" /> Zairean.  We are dealing with borders drawn by the great powers in the aftermath of the Berlin and Vienna Conferences at the turn of the century.  We must ensure that, if possible, Zaire proceeds to change to the post-Mobutu period by peaceful means rather than having a civil war.  An election would be the keynote to peace. Somebody involved in our intricate peace process could offer suggestions on what is critical.</P>
    <P>Burundi is in a dangerous state and there has been much killing by the army.  We do not have the full details because the international agencies do not have access to Burundi.  There has been some separation of men from women and children among returning refugees and some of the men have been subject to arbitrary execution and killing by the army in Burundi.  President Nyerere of Tanzania was in Dublin earlier this week.  He proposed that now is the time to engage the two parties in Burundi in negotiation.  We support this.  Now is also the time to insist that the humanitarian agencies have access to Burundi so that we can find out what is going on and deter the random killing which appears to be taking place.</P>
    <P>Tanzania at the moment has about 500,000 Rwandan Burundian refugees on its western border.  The town of Kigoma received more than 90,000 refugees in the last week in addition to the 500,000 who have already been in Tanzania for some time.  The good news is that the Rwandan refugees in Tanzania are sending emissaries to say they want to come home.  They are selling their possessions.  That is another 400,000 going home to an area the size of Munster which now has a population of almost 7,000,000 people.  This must constitute the greatest mass movement of people in history in such a small concentrated area.  We and the Tanzanians would like to see those people going home.  They will need support to ensure their return is as peaceful as possible.</P>
    <P>In relation to the refugees in Zaire, there has been a debate about the numbers involved and whether it is 380,000 or 750,000.  This is obscene &mdash; what if it is not 750,000 but &ldquo;only&rdquo; 300,000? This is a vast number of refugees and we must have access to them in order to assist them.</P>
    <P>Ireland has supported the UN proposal in relation to the temporary multinational force. During the Troika's visit we stressed that the force should have a clear mandate to disarm the armed elements who are still in Zaire &mdash; the Interhamwe and the militia who planned, plotted and committed genocide and who would still carry it out if they had the capacity and could get back into Rwanda.  An international force that does not have a mandate on disarmament has one hand tied behind its back before it even goes in. We want the force to provide security for the humanitarian agencies and the returning refugees.  Above all, we want them to disarm the genocidal elements in Eastern Zaire &mdash; the Interhamwe, the militia and the ex-army of Rwanda.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> Even though the force is not fully constituted, something could be done while the discussions on it are proceeding.  I urge the generals to go as observers to Eastern Zaire, establish the numbers of people there and the kind of assistance they need.  They could set up their headquarters in Kampala where food is held under the World Food Programme and they could move it into Zaire and the areas where it is needed.  It is so glaringly obvious I do not understand why they are not doing it at the moment.</P>
    <P>There are larger questions about the mandate and size of the force.  In my view, a smaller force is now appropriate.  Two and a half weeks ago, I would have told the force to disarm Mugunga camp.  That did not happen but Mugunga camp is now free.  I would have told the force to bring lorries so people could be saved a 100 mile walk home.  This week I would tell them to go to Zaire with lorries and food and tell us the number of people there and their needs.  They could give them the kind of assistance they need and help the international agencies to get to them.  Next week the force could be required to do something different.  This week, it could do a job that could save a significant number of lives.  I find the discussion of numbers obscene.  Many people left refugee camps four weeks ago and they need our support.  As Senator Maloney said, the Irish Government has set aside £2.25 million to meet this crisis and has also established an extremely good working relationship with the Irish agencies in Rwanda.  The agencies are standing by ready to assist in Zaire and Burundi if they have the capacity but it must be safe for them to do so.</P>
    <P>We have also devoted money and attention to monitoring human rights.  Some £250,000 has been released for this operation in Rwanda and it will provide for up to 300 human rights monitors.  It is important that the plight of refugees who have returned home under peaceful conditions be monitored.  If there are human rights abuses or revenge killings they can be brought to light as quickly as possible and dealt with.</P>
    <P>It made me feel proud and humble to see the work being done by Irish aid agencies.  I endorse their appeal to the Irish public for financial support in the run up to Christmas.  Irish agencies in particular are working to re-unite lost children with their parents.  At each border crossing, there are a couple of thousand children who are lost or left.  In some cases children who could not walk were left behind by their mothers in Zaire and at the border.  The agencies perform an excellent job reuniting those children with their parents and for that alone the Irish public should be as generous as it can be to the different agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted this debate is taking place.  It is hard to know how effective one will be but if a debate in the Parliament of the country holding the EU Presidency does not have an effect, nothing will.  The Minister of State is also speaking in her capacity as President of the <Col N="822" /> Development Ministers Council and the Seanad must be used to the best of its ability to ensure Ireland gives some semblance of leadership during the short few months it holds the Presidency.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, on what she has done over the past couple of months.  I am a Member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and a number of its subcommittees.  The Minister of State has been generous with her time, not alone to the committees, but also to the people who are suffering in various conflicts in the world.</P>
      <P>These areas are not similar to traditional European and western societies.  Lines were drawn in the sand many years ago by colonial powers, most of which were European.  They did not take into account the indigenous population and the tribal system.  When people talk about tribes they give the impression that this name should not be used, but these were ethnic groups. Europeans suddenly colonised and divided tribes via lines drawn in the sand.  Unfortunately, it was similar to what the Spanish and Portuguese did in South America.  They thought that by using straight lines, they would create states.  This is the genesis of some of the problems that exist.  Just as suddenly the Europeans decided to leave these areas and the flags of the new countries were raised.  Unfortunately the lowering of the flag has led to genocide in the Great Lakes region.</P>
      <P>The resolution of this problem has only just begun.  The Minister of State appeared before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs two weeks ago.  Nobody would have thought that there would have been such a change in the attitude of the refugees towards those who were keeping them out of their country and that there would have been such a mass emigration from Zaire. They now have to deal with the problems of assimilation in their homeland.  A number of people who left because of the genocide now find that their homes and communes have been taken over by others.  As in every other conflict, there are people who will jump at the opportunity to take over somebody else's land.</P>
      <P>Rwanda and Burundi are countries which have superb agricultural processes that allow for the production of three crops per year.  They had an agribusiness without having the sophistication of university research and used concepts such as crop manipulation and cross fertilisation which people in European universities are trying to develop.  Apart from the situation in Zaire, there is the problem of hundreds and thousands of people returning home to try to re-establish themselves in their own areas.  How do we react to that?  The international community has not been successful in resolving the problems of people who have had to leave their homelands but they have never been confronted with the problems associated with the return of people to their homelands.  I have never heard of such a mass influx other than in the Talmud, Koran or the Bible.  It has never happened on such a scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> We have been protected from having to react to the exodus and the genocide and also from the problems of poverty and disease in the camps. The international community was trying to deal with one of the results of genocide and it is now faced with another.  It cannot deal with the problem completely.  The first person in one of the camps who decided, whatever the consequences, that he or she would go back to Rwanda effectively triggered the mass movement.  Perhaps the lesson to be learned is that the solutions may come from those who are suffering.</P>
    <P>The international community must organise an international force, although not necessarily a military force.  We must give the UN the power it needs.  The United States must pay its bills to the UN.  The African countries have the will to organise an international force to resolve problems in southern Africa but they do not have the money to do so.  They are members of the UN and some of them are up to date with their contributions.  The US is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and if it paid its dues there would be enough money to give the African countries to form an international force which might be acceptable in the region.</P>
    <P>For the last two to three years consideration has been given to the formation of international courts in Rwanda.  Almost all the judges and lawyers were killed in the genocide and there is no judicial system.  The international community promised to help set up a judicial system but has not done so to date.  There are thousands of people in jail in Rwanda.  Many of them would have been involved in the genocide but many others who had nothing to do with it are in custody.  Many women have borne children in the jails and those children are up to five years old.</P>
    <P>The jails are overcrowded and there is often not enough room for people to lie down and sleep.  I remember there was a sixpenny doss house next to my father's garage in Kilkenny where, for six pence a night, tramps could sleep leaning over a rope.  They could sleep on the ground for a shilling.  The people in the jails in Rwanda do not even have a rope to lean over. The international community should provide a mechanism to deal with those accused of being involved in the genocide, secure convictions for the guilty and release the innocent.</P>
    <P>The Irish aid agencies have done excellent work.  The Minister of State referred to the provision of seeds and tools.  It is worthless to send processed goods as food aid to Third World countries because they will be stolen and sold. Furthermore, the indigenous population cannot get the benefit of growing and selling their own food if the country is flooded with food aid.  If the indigenous farmers cannot plant and sell goods they cannot develop a cash flow and the agri-economy dies.</P>
    <P>The EU is a developed society.  The poverty line in Ireland is nine times above the poverty line in some African countries.  We have a protected society.  Poverty in Ireland is not the same as the grinding, day to day struggle to <Col N="824" /> survive which characterises life in some of the African countries.</P>
    <P>Television operates on two of our most important senses &mdash; sight and sound.  The day that smell can be transmitted by television is the day we might start to tackle poverty.  It is the smell of death and deprivation that strikes one in such camps.  Of course, the smell of death will never be transmitted by television because nobody will sponsor a programme, either through the State or commercially, to bring the smell of poverty into the living room.  The day that is done poverty might be eliminated but the station would go out of business.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State talked about the force having a clear mandate.  If it is a UN mandate it has to be clear, enforceable and enforced.  Over the past number of years we have had the best people in UNIFIL in Southern Lebanon but their mandate does not give them the power to do the job they were sent there to do: to make certain the integrity of the State of Lebanon was protected.  They cannot protect the legitimacy of the State of Lebanon because there is a <i>cordon sanitaire</i> which is controlled by Israel.  Our troops are part of UNIFIL.  When they go out there they are not Irish but UNIFIL troops.</P>
    <P>How do we address some of these problems? Some NGOs are working to protect their own place in the NGO world.  That is an enormous political entity.  There are NGOs with bigger budgets than the GNP of some of the African countries in which they work.  That does not make any sense.  In many cases, they create an NGO support society that has nothing to do with the deprived people or those who are very rich in these Third World countries.  Those who work for the NGOs feel they are doing a great job.  They have fourwheel drive vehicles and stay in hotels. They have the best of food from their home countries and they spend a fortune making certain their standard of living is as good as the one they enjoyed previously, giving as little as possible.  In Mozambique, Angola or wherever there is an NGO society.  Then there is the UN, another level of bureaucracy.  The conditions these people live in are different from those of people they are supposed to serve.</P>
    <P>Zaire will break up.  There is no doubt about that.  Areas in the country have enormous potential for wealth and other areas do not.  The international community will go into Zaire in the near future to reinforce that breakup.  Profits will go out of the country.  Angola is a typical example, with MPLA and UNITA using the diamonds and oil in a country which could be one of the richest in the world.  UNITA control the rural areas and most of the diamonds and MPLA control the urban areas and most of the oil. Examining the diamond and oil industries, one finds the controlling companies are based in Britain, France or the United States.  Those in Zaire who want to encourage the breakup were delighted when there were refugees coming into Eastern Zaire because everybody could attack <Col N="825" /> everybody else.  Such an atmosphere will contribute to the breakup of Zaire and that will be very serious for Africa and Europe.</P>
    <P>Julius Nyerere was here last weekend.  He commands huge respect and I hope the Minister of State, or whoever is working with him, can work to resolve some of the problems in that area.  International action has to be political, economic and social.  There is no point in pretending that a multinational force going in to to preserve peace will do anything.  A concerted effort must be made involving all elements of society.  Having read Julius Nyerere's proposal, there seems to be hope for the area if we back him as his is an African agenda.</P>
    <P>There is no easy solution.  The £2.5 million we give will be spent on seed and tools for long-term use.  It will do nothing in the short-term.  It is given to small, local seed and tool developments and could have major benefits in the future.  It is a good move and I compliment the Minister of State on the work she has done but I am frustrated because we are talking about a problem we cannot resolve.  If the Minister of State does nothing more than advance the position of the people in the area she will have done an enormous job.  It will not get her a vote in her constituency but she might leave office saying: &ldquo;At least I was able to help those people to help themselves&rdquo;.  If the Minister of State does a little for those who have nothing she will have achieved more than being re-elected, although that is also important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a committee in my area on the famine in Ireland.  Most people who went into workhouses died but some survived and their descendants still live in County Offaly and in the midlands.  Ireland at that time went through the same problems being faced in the Great Lakes region today, which brings home to us our duty to help those people.  In our difficulties we did not receive enough support from Britain and other countries.  We received some money from America &mdash; it was a small amount but it was welcome.  Our President appealed to our television and radio stations and national and local newspapers to continue to highlight this crisis and to bring to the attention of the Irish people the seriousness, sadness and the human tragedy of the disaster in the Great Lakes area. Her hope was that we could become more aware and would continue to use our influence both on the Government and on public opinion to help avert this disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let there be no doubt that hundreds of thousands of lives could potentially be lost.  Those who survive could have their health and that of their families damaged by lack of food.  We have an obligation to help.  The Rwandan Government is trying to absorb a vast number of refugees but it cannot cope with this challenge on its own.  We should use our position of holding the Presidency of the EU to do everything to provide assistance and <Col N="826" /> aid.  We should make every effort to ensure that the Rwandan Government is helped to absorb the refugees returning from eastern Zaire.  We have seen on television that these people are walking with little water, food and clothing.  They have no destination.  This has brought the challenge home to us.</P>
    <P>The organisation to which we must turn is the United Nations.  As Senator Lanigan said, it is regrettable that the most powerful nation on earth, the US, has not made its financial contributions.  It is sad that a country with such wealth at its disposal is not fulfilling its obligations.  Perhaps the comments made in this debate will make the American Government aware of our feelings.  If one country fails to contribute, others will follow and the UN will be facing problems.  Since its establishment, the UN has been the forum to which people from all over the world could come to debate problems.  Its work to date has made an enormous difference and it can help ensure that the problems in the Great Lakes region are resolved.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the UN Security Council's Resolution No. 1080, which is worthy of our support.  That resolution, passed on 15 November, sanctioned the establishment, for humanitarian purposes, of a temporary multinational force to facilitate the immediate return of humanitarian organisations and the effective delivery by civilian relief organisations of humanitarian aid to alleviate the immediate suffering of displaced persons, refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire and to facilitate the voluntary, orderly repatriation of refugees by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees as well as the voluntary return of displaced persons.  I am pleased that Canada has given a lead in this.</P>
    <P>To be precise, there are two main problems &mdash; the humanitarian one and the political one.  As regard the humanitarian problem, the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, attended meetings on 7, 22 and 23 November.  Those meetings have resulted in positive developments, which are to be welcomed.  Both the Tánaiste and the Minister of State have played a significant role and in years to come they will be seen as having contributed a considerable amount to the relief of the humanitarian problems that exist.  The problems are serious and I hope the financial contributions will assist in providing food, shelter, housing and clothing.  About 170 million ECUs have already been provided, with further moneys to come.</P>
    <P>We are sending in a multinational force but the area is vast and many people are well armed, so the force must have sufficient numbers and strength.  We must have a positive plan, know what we are setting out to do and have people with the expertise to do it.  We must ensure that we do not send the UN contingent, of which we are a part, without a proper brief because it could have serious consequences.  Great care must be taken because we are not going in just to keep the peace.  There may be considerable conflict <Col N="827" /> and our people may face risks.  Unless our group has the necessary back up and sufficient strength, it may be placed in danger.  Any plan must be carefully thought out.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made.  The European Union and the United Nations have been criticised. Some of this criticism may be deserved but they have made an effort to respond to the greatest crisis in that area during my lifetime.  I welcome the Government's efforts in this regard and I wish the United Nations every success in its attempt to alleviate this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's efforts on behalf of the Government to resolve this problem.  In 1994 we witnessed scenes of the most appalling suffering in Rwanda and in the sprawling refugee camps around Goma.  Then, or so it seemed from the media coverage, it all died down.  Some kind of law and order was restored to Rwanda and a few half hearted attempts were made at putting those responsible for the genocide on trial, while the refugees tried to live in Goma and the other camps.</P>
      <P>A few weeks ago, hostilities between Hutus and Tutsis flared up again in Eastern Zaire and the world looked on in amazement as the scenes of 1994 were replayed.  Recent events in the Great Lakes region should have surprised no one. My greatest fear is that the international community may sink back into complacency now that the refugees are returning to Rwanda.  The Minister will play a major role in ensuring that every effort is made to restore peace to that region.</P>
      <P>I am glad we are debating the situation in the Great Lakes region.  That part of Africa is Europe's business because the great European powers carved up Africa with set squares at the 1870 Berlin conference.  Ethnic, religious and linguistic groups found themselves divided by arbitrary borders as Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and Portugal bartered their colonial possessions to greatest advantage.  Deals were made where a seaport was exchanged for a mineral rich strip of land and the people were transferred from one jurisdiction to another like pawns.  Some 126 years later the people in Africa in general and in the Great Lakes region in particular are still paying the price for the game of monopoly played in Berlin.</P>
      <P>The exploitation did not end in 19th century Berlin.  Political colonialism was followed in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s by corporate colonialism which wreaked havoc in countries such as Nigeria.  The World Bank and the IMF have combined to ensure that many post-colonial countries are shackled by debt and the policies adopted by the World Trade Organisation have undermined any prospect of food security for many countries in Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Underlying everything is the arms trade.  Only recently we learned that a British arms company, Mil-Tec, had supplied large amounts of arms and <Col N="828" /> ammunition to the former Rwandan Government before and after it murdered an estimated 1 million people in 1994.  I have little doubt that European arms companies are currently supplying both the Zairian rebels and President Mobutu's kleptomaniac regime.  It has become clear that UN and EU arms embargoes will have little or no effect unless a concerted effort is made to get rid of existing loopholes.  Mil-Tec was able to continue supplying arms to Rwanda after the embargo by producing Zairian end-user certificates.  The current arms embargo against Nigeria is not worth the paper it is written on since EU arms companies can continue fulfilling supply contracts concluded before the embargo; arms supply contracts can take several years to fulfil.</P>
    <P>There are those who would have us believe that Africa is doomed to be a political and economic basket case beset by tribalism and violence and that the developed world should keep well away from what are essentially internal tribal conflicts. I do not subscribe to that view.  Europe needs to start picking up the political and economic tab for the great wrongs done to Africa in the past.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned at the smug complacency displayed by the international community following the return of refugees from Zaire to Rwanda.  The voluntary nature of that return was hastened by the civil war raging in Zaire.  The return of refugees merely alleviates one immediate symptom of the ethnic conflicts plaguing that region, without addressing the root causes.</P>
    <P>The response of the United Nations to what was a looming humanitarian crisis a week ago has been like a turtle chasing a snail.  The lack of urgency was almost palpable and the major players in the UN were more intent on passing the buck than on addressing the issues.  In this regard, I welcome Canada's initiative in agreeing to put together a multinational force and I welcome Ireland's intention to participate in it.  I wish the response by the EU and the UN had been quicker.  While resolutions were passed, assessments made and more red tape spun, hundreds of thousands of people were in danger of dying from military action of famine and disease.</P>
    <P>A cynic would say the response was delayed until the matter sorted itself out.  In the eyes of the United States and others, it has more or less sorted itself out since the refugees have returned to their country of origin.</P>
    <P>Significant population movements bring their own problems, whether in Africa or in Europe. In the past fortnight, half a million refugees have returned to Rwanda from their camps in Eastern Zaire.  There have been significant migrations from the west into Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi. Large numbers of Zairians have been forced to flee from the fighting in Eastern Zaire and there are still half a million Rwandan refugees in camps in Tanzania.  In total, the various forced migrations taking place in the Great Lakes region <Col N="829" /> equals the entire population of Ireland.  The Tánaiste is right in his assessment that these population movements are not yet over and I believe that both the EU and the UN need to plan for the future as well as the present.</P>
    <P>I welcome the aid packages agreed by the European Union as well as the aid package announced by the Government.  However, a long-term resolution of the crisis facing the Great Lakes region demands more than short-term sticking plaster responses.  I especially welcome the proposal, favoured by Ireland and the EU, that there should be an international conference on peace, stability and development in the region. Such a conference, if properly convened and given the appropriate powers, may go some way towards clearing up the territorial mess left in the wake of the 1870 Berlin conference.  Any conclusions must be backed up by appropriate financial, technical and material assistance.  The EU also needs to examine its own policies to ensure they do not militate against stability and development in the Third World.</P>
    <P>The refugees in the Great Lakes region are fleeing from war, whether earlier in Rwanda or now in Zaire.  Was is fed by arms which, for the most part, are manufactured in the United States or in the European Union.  A binding code of conduct governing EU arms exports is urgently needed to ensure that armaments manufactured in the European Union do not find their way into the hands of repressive regimes.  At a time when global arms control agreements are facing increasing obstacles regional organisations, such as the EU, have a crucial role to play in controlling and limiting the arms trade.  Such a code of conduct should strictly control the countries to which both arms and so-called dual use goods can be exported.</P>
    <P>The current EU export controls are relatively lax and focus on criteria relating to international security rather than on human rights observance in individual end-user countries.  An EU code of conduct should, at a minimum, require all exporters of arms or dual use goods to obtain end user certificates and EU member states should be banned from exporting arms to repressive regimes.</P>
    <P>It is only by addressing issues such as arms exports that the EU will be able to make a lasting contribution towards settling the conflicts currently raging not only in the Great Lakes region but also in other flashpoints around the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I compliment the Minister of State on her concern, the direct action she has taken and her knowledge and understanding of the complexities of the Great Lakes area of Africa.  I also commend the Irish aid agencies that have been active in the area, particularly Concern and Trócaire, and the good work they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> I welcome the fact that the Minister of State concentrated on the issues of disarmament and justice.  Obviously there are other issues such as humanitarian aid and helping people to get back on their feet economically and socially, but disarmament and justice are the ones on which I wish to focus.  The Minister of State indicated that one of the major tasks of the international force should be to disarm people who should not have arms and who are threatening the stability of the community and the attempt to return to some form of normal life.  Senator Sherlock rightly concentrated on the availability of arms and the role of the rest of the world in confronting people in so-called civilised and developed states who peddle arms.  There has been a failure to tackle this issue on an international scale because sometimes it is against the interests of some of the most powerful countries in the world.  It is important that a country such as Ireland, which does not have a colonial past and which is small and neutral, affirms its role in that regard.  I commend the Minister of State and the Minister for Foreign Affairs for standing firmly on those issues.  We must continue to use our Presidency of the EU to assert the importance of dealing with them.</P>
    <P>I wish to focus on the issue of justice.  There is a need for people to believe that war criminals will be brought to justice.  However, in this case there does not appear to be confidence that it will happen.  It is essential that the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and other international criminal tribunals work effectively and that the UN and EU do what they can to ensure that.  A report by Tom Ndahiro of the Kigali Institute for War and Peace stated:</P>
    <P>Rwandans, particularly the victims and survivors of genocide, express fears about prosecutions especially those brought about by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  Their misgivings are based on several factors: the pace and bureaucracy of the ICTR; the perceived failure of the tribunal to arrest the &ldquo;cardinal criminals&rdquo;; the intransigence, if not conspiracy with the criminals, of government harbouring hundreds if not thousands of political and military leaders of the regimes that planned and then committed genocide; and the failure of the United Nations to take measures against countries that are reluctant to cooperate in bringing the alleged culprits to book.</P>
    <P>It is most important that these issues are confronted and that we play whatever role we can under international law such as the Geneva Convention of 1949 and the 1948 Genocide Convention.</P>
    <P>During our Presidency of the EU we should insist that countries harbouring indicted persons &mdash; Camaroon is one example &mdash; co-operate with the tribunal and hand over persons sought by it. There has been a proposal that the UN designate somebody as a representative to the tribunal with <Col N="831" /> a brief to facilitate its work and to keep track of its administration.  That proposal should be considered.</P>
    <P>The other issue is security of witnesses and the fear of giving evidence.  People fear for what might happen to them after giving evidence.  I understand the Minister of State is scheduled, in the near future, to meet a group who are concerned about these issues.  I hope she will do what she can about their concerns in the context of Ireland's Presidency of the EU.</P>
    <P>On Monday evening I spoke to somebody who is familiar with this issue in the context of Bosnia. The person had been in Bosnia several times in recent years and he gave me first hand information.  He outlined vivid pictures of the experiences of people who have been victims of genocide, which would have been the experience of people in the Great Lakes area of Africa.  In Bosnia people had witnessed appalling atrocities. Women had been gang raped by soldiers and children had seen members of their families killed.  There is terrible trauma attached to such experiences and there is a need for people to see justice done so they can get on with the vestiges of their lives.  These experiences must be given the serious attention they deserve and whatever can be done must be done to ensure people, who take appalling risks to give evidence at tribunals, will see that criminals are brought to justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is aware of the issues involved and the need to ensure that the international community shows it cares.  It is in the interest of many people and governments in certain areas of the world to prevent the international community informing itself and ensuring that justice is done, but it is extremely important to those who have suffered to see that the world cares and is willing to stand up to certain members of the international community. We are aware of powerful countries whose interests would not be served by them being as determined on these issues as is our country.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State on her work and I hope she will take my comments on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on her speech.  It is clear she has carried out a great deal of research and has put much work into this issue.  She understands, in so far as people can understand, the miserable mess in that part of the world.</P>
      <P>In 1994, I worked in the Goma region for the summer.  It was an incredible experience.  I was in the Mugunga camp which was vacated last week. It was clear during that summer that the Hutu militia was in control of the camp.  A family which decided to go home would no longer be a family the next day as bodies would be found strewn in the camp that morning.  It was interesting that as soon as the militia left the camp the people immediately returned to Rwanda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many interconnected difficulties in the area which we find impossible to understand. <Col N="832" /> The unsophisticated nature of society in eastern Zaire is one.  Irish people find it impossible to grasp the reality of conditions there.  One would have to go back 300 years into Irish history to see anything of that nature.  The lack of civil rights is incredible.  There is no support for people in the region.  I visited Rwanda briefly so I am not sure of the position in that country.</P>
    <P>This is an incredible problem.  I am critical of the response made over the last couple of weeks. The Minister and the Tánaiste have done everything in their power to try to move things on but it is clear that many people are starving in eastern Zaire.  They have left camps where they had clean water and some food to go into the interior where they have neither.  We should respond to their needs in a totally non-political way.  The first priority is to keep those people alive but we have not been showing an interest at the level I would like to see.</P>
    <P>When I arrived in Goma at the end of July or early August 1994 there were bodies all over the place.  It is hard to imagine it.  When people drank from Lake Kivu, which was the only source of water, they died like flies.  It was an incredible experience.  There was a mass grave into which bodies were thrown before being covered over with clay.  The following morning lorry loads of bodies were again thrown into that big hole in the ground at Goma Airport.  People do not really appreciate what we are talking about.  We try to judge it according to our own experiences but we cannot because it is so incredible.</P>
    <P>People are dying because they are not getting aid, including food and clean water, to ensure they survive.  The political side of it is a minefield. In any African country with a number of big tribes there will be difficulties with people jockeying for power.  They are all armed.  When we worked in the camps we put our lives in danger every day.  We had to carry money to pay labourers $1 a day and people who supplied transport for us had to be paid as well.  People did not have guns but they had machetes which they used to cut down trees, dig holes in the ground and, when necessary, chop off heads.  Every machete should be removed from that part of Africa because the people are all armed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>When we built small villages the people working for us used machetes to dig holes in the ground to put poles in so that we could build huts.  The machete is part of every day life. During the strife in Rwanda a huge number of people were killed by machetes.  I saw their bodies; pieces of their heads were missing.  That experience will stay with me for the rest of my life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> I am not sure how one can deal with the political side of the problem.  People will try to seize power in those countries again and it will eventually work itself out.  I assume that education will have to hold away.  In the long-term, I would like to see strings attached to aid entering those countries but it is difficult because we are not talking about democracies.  If aid workers do not travel with the aid it will end up in the wrong hands and those in control will get the money or whatever else is sent in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is called an EU subsidy here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I do not know how the problem can be tackled in the long-term.  If aid is being made available in a particular area it should be tied to educational resources being put in place.  The Minister of State has rightly decided that the system of justice in Rwanda, for example, must be activated immediately so that those held in jail can be dealt with.  That must be done.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's analysis is excellent.  It is as if she had spent the same length of time I spent there.  We must stage another Live Aid show as quickly as possible.  After that an attempt must be made to bring about reconciliation in Rwanda, although I am not sure how one can even begin that process.  Huge numbers of the population were evidently involved in genocide at that time.  I find it difficult to imagine how one could get those people to live peacefully together in communities when they all know who was responsible.</P>
      <P>When we worked in the camps we decided to take a completely non-political view.  We knew we were feeding Hutu Interhamwe, keeping them alive so that they could kill others at a later date, but we could not do anything about it.  They were in the camps and we had to keep everybody alive. We fed everybody.  When we got up at 6 o'clock in the morning to drive to work we would find bodies all over the place.  A rumour went around that a certain family was going to return to Rwanda and their bodies would be found the following morning.  That was the sort of justice system we had to deal with every day.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should keep trying to save lives.  She should then try to put aid in place to restore ordinary life in that part of the world. It is a long haul and will require a long-term hands-on approach.  I urge the Minister to get food out there as soon as possible to save lives before moving on to stage two which will take longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt it important to make some small contribution on this debate although I am not as well prepared as I would have liked because this has been an extremely busy day and I am going abroad tomorrow.  However, I made a special effort to come here for three reasons. First, because of the extraordinary seriousness of the situation in human terms.  It is a disaster, <Col N="834" /> although not of unprecedented proportions because unfortunately these kind of disasters have a tendency to recur.  There is, however, something special about this kind of disaster.</P>
      <P>Second, to salute this Minister of State because she has done something very important &mdash; she went to Rwanda to see the situation on the ground.  Nothing can inform the view or commitment of a Minister more than actually seeing the deprivation and misery, touching the people and smelling the odours of carnage.  From the Minister of State's sombre expression, it is apparent that the memory of the shocking events she witnessed in recent weeks remains with her. It is important that someone of the Minister of State's standing bear witness on our behalf and ensure that this disaster is not the subject of a cover up.</P>
      <P>I have great respect for the Minister of State.  I attended a recent committee meeting where she vigorously defended her position.  Some Members attempted to highlight the cause of East Timor and, while the Minister of State was somewhat embattled, she stated that these situations are interconnected and that her time, resources and capacity are limited.  She also stated that she is obliged to prioritise situations and that she has given priority to problems in the Great Lakes region, Rwanda and the Congo.  I accept that and I wish her success in attempting to ensure that the world pays attention and that practical action is taken.</P>
      <P>Although I only spent six months there, I was actually born in Zaire.  I believe European nations have a responsibility to those parts of the world where they created a mess.  Despite the fact that I have many Belgian friends, including the present Ambassador, the Belgians did not cover themselves in glory in their dealings with that country.  They exploited the natural resources and did not display a sensitivity to the local culture or the indigenous inhabitants, who are not merely of Tutsi or Hutu origin.  There are many smaller tribal and racial groupings in Zaire whose needs may have been ignored because of the blast of publicity given to the two principal warring factions.</P>
      <P>I am ashamed that I am not better prepared but it is important that I speak on this issue.  This is a problematic situation and I referred to the involvement of the Belgians in that regard. Ireland also has a noble record in certain respects because Sir Roger Casement investigated the barbarous treatment meted out to the indigenous people in Zaire.  He conferred a significant service on humanity by so doing.  Even then the situation was ghastly and it was also recorded by the novelist Joseph Conrad in &ldquo;Heart of Darkness&rdquo;. One can only echo the words of Kurtz in that great novel who, on emerging from the jungle, uttered the words &ldquo;The horror, the horror.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is horror in human terms when one sees television pictures showing a small, bewildered girl separated from her family and unaware of their or her own whereabouts The distress of the <Col N="835" /> correspondent was visible when she stated that her natural instinct was to take the girl with her and try to do some good.  However, she knew this would be a mistake because it would further complicate the situation and perhaps lead to the girl never being reunited with her family. Following the Second World War there was a mass of displaced persons and one of the most important actions taken by the Red Cross was to try to keep records and ensure that families were reunited.  The picture of bewildered children, many of them younger than the young girl to whom I referred, left to fend for themselves at the end of the war must strike at the hearts of everyone, particularly at Christmas when we celebrate the power and vulnerability of children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in welcoming our visitors. European states are privileged although they do not always behave well.  Without being discourteous, I must state that the involvement of the French in Africa has not always been savoury because, as in the case of <i>Opération Tourquoise</i>, a noted violator of human rights was rescued by the French armed services.  The selling of arms and ammunitions to both sides in Zaire by countries whose representatives are present in the House is a disgrace and a reproach to the European Union.</P>
      <P>When one considers reports issued by the European Commission on the so called Konver Programme, one discovers that large sums of money were made available for the conversion of factories producing military equipment into more peaceful enterprises.  However, the Commission's report undermines this fact by stating:</P>
      <P>...conversion of military into civilian orientated production at factory level is not considered a feasible strategy by most companies.  Apart from the huge investment costs and difficulty of access for newcomers to establish civilian markets, conversion is hindered by the difference between on the one side, production of defence goods which is driven by technology and Government specifications and, on the other side, civilian markets which are mainly driven by price with marketing playing a major role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In post-Thatcherite Europe, a free market is available in respect of everything except armaments which are to be specifically supported <Col N="836" /> by Governments.  That is a disgrace and a reproach to everyone.</P>
    <P>The Newsletter of the Western Union Institute for Security Studies No 14 of June 1995 contained a report of a seminar on the European defence market which states:</P>
    <P>...the market has shrunk and industrialists were in no doubt that the smaller companies were in crisis.  Companies were therefore forming conglomerates and collaborating on new products, and internationalisation was a growing phenomenon.  The discussion then turned to the adaption of the institutional frame work in particular the WEAG and EU.</P>
    <P>This displays the &ldquo;arms for export&rdquo; mentality. There is overproduction in Europe in a shrinking market and companies are determined to sell armaments wherever possible.  That is regrettable and it is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of Mr. Mobutu in the Congo, who sequestered enormous amounts of money in Swiss bank accounts for his own use. We must question the ethics of the Swiss who allowed the accumulation of this amount of money while people in Zaire and elsewhere are starving.  Questions must be put to Swiss bankers in this regard.</P>
    <P>As a result of this tragedy, I stand open to correction by the Minister of State, but a separation process, which is valuable, appears to have begun between the major elements of the military and most of the civilian population.  It is regrettable that some of the civilian population has been taken into the bush by military elements.  Those involved in crimes against humanity must be brought to justice.  I would like to believe this will not be done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis similar to that which obtained at the war crimes tribunals in Zaire and Rwanda.  We must encourage the establishment of a standing war crimes tribunal at international level which can be brought into operation immediately and not be obliged to wait until the circumstances of a situation of this kind deteriorate to the point where we must appeal for action.</P>
    <P>In the context of reconciliation, it must be impossible and unspeakable to confront one's neighbours, who originate from the same genetic pool.  This situation is similar to Northern Ireland. People outside Zaire cannot tell the difference between Hutus and Tutsis because they are basically the same.  How could a person from Zaire tell the difference between a Presbyterian, a Roman Catholic, a Methodist or a Seventh Day Adventist?  They come from the same genetic pool and are part of the same family and it is always more bitter when one has that type of crime committed against one.  I have had contact with women in that area who have attempted to reconcile against all the odds.  I hope their work will continue in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would like to place on record some material I received from GOAL.  Mr. O'Shea from GOAL recently addressed the Joint Committee on <Col N="837" /> Foreign Affairs and, while I do not necessarily agree with everything he says, the House ought to be aware of his hands-on experience.  The document is dated 25 November 1996 and states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  GOAL is shocked by the decision of the international community not to deploy immediately a military force in Central Africa. The only conclusion to be drawn from the meeting of military chiefs in Stuttgart over the weekend is that there is precious little interest in the fate of the Rwandan refugees stranded in Zaire.  The UN say there are 700,000 helpless souls in urgent need.  The US Government tend to agree with the Rwandan Government that almost all of the refugees are back in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>2.  GOAL believes that it is imperative that the human rights of the Hutu refugees and indeed the resettled Tutsi population in Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire are immediately protected and guaranteed.</P>
    <P>3.  We believe that only the presence of an international military force on the ground will ensure that this occurs.  The returning refugees who may feel frightened or threatened would be greatly encouraged by the knowledge that an independent military force was on hand to protect their interests.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understand that there has been sporadic violence against people who have returned and that some have been murdered.  This is very regrettable.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;4.  A form of genocide has been perpetrated in Zaire on the Hutu refugees by the Tutsi rebels supported by the Rwandan and Burundi armies who slaughtered 300 people (Hutu refugees) earlier in the month.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So often in the past we have only seen the problem of the Tutsi because that was the major massacre that occurred.  The western press tended to see this in simple terms but it is a tragically complex situation in which awful crimes have been committed by both sides.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;5.  GOAL believes it is imperative that a military force locates and protects the 700,000 refugees at present marooned in Zaire.  These people are faced with Tutsi rebels on one side and the Burundi army on the other.  This GOAL believes is the most urgent and critical issue for the international community to address.</P>
    <P>6.  GOAL believes that the military force must locate and bring to justice the Interahamway &mdash; the perpetrators of the 1994 genocides and members of the Interahamway who may have slipped back over the border in recent days must be brought before the courts as a matter or urgency.</P>
    <P>7.  GOAL believes that the 80,000 prisoners in Rwandan jails suspected of being implicated in the 1994 genocide be afforded an opportunity to prove their innocence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> That is true; 80,000 is an enormous number of people.  It is not like Germany where it was done by an efficient technological machine and people were liquidated in an industrialised situation. People in Rwanda were brainwashed by radio broadcasts and incessant propaganda into taking up machetes against their neighbours.  Even so it is difficult to believe there are 80,000 war criminals at that level of criminality.  Certainly they should be presumed innocent.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;8.  GOAL believes it is imperative that a judicial system be established in Rwanda to give assurances to the returning refugees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is perhaps an area where Europe can give some degree of professional assistance in terms of a judicial programme.  However, that is down the line.  The immediate problem is one of desperate need, starvation and disease.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;9.  GOAL accepts the rebuilding of Rwanda is an important element in this dreadful situation, but would stress that the priorities must be the safety and security of the Hutu refugee population.</P>
    <P>10.  We are acutely disappointed that the only voice consistently calling for meaningful assistance for the 700,000 marooned refugees in Zaire is that of Emma Bonino the EU Humanitarian Affairs Commissioner.  GOAL fully supports this lady's stance on the issue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would not say that it is only Emma Bonino.  The Minister was there with that remarkable woman and I would like to think that they remain colleagues in the attempt to do something about this dreadful situation.  To say that one person alone, however eminent, is taking the matter seriously could undermine what other people, such as the Minister, are doing.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;11.  Many millions of lives have been lost in the world's major famines and disasters since Cambodia 1997 because the international community did not take any action other than supporting the aid community.  In GOAL's view the aid community has never been able and probably never will be able to meet the demands of such situations.  We see shades of Ethiopia and Somalia in this latest tragedy.  Aid agencies, however well motivated, do not have the capacity to bring relief to the numbers involved in disasters of this kind and it is vital to realise that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not going to name the aid agencies involved but I have in my file on Rwanda a number of letters from various aid agencies received earlier this autumn which were placatory, suggesting that a great deal was being done and that people were being fed.  Perhaps at that stage they were but how very quickly the issue exploded and how important it is that we register the tragedy and do whatever we can about it.</P>
    <P>GOAL called for an immediate and direct military intervention.  I am not wise enough to say if that would be successful or advisable. Sometimes military intervention, without a clear <Col N="839" /> mandate, objectives, training and political sensitivity can make matters worse.  This matter is so desperate that all options must be considered in the interests, not of the Governments, but of the people of Rwanda and Zaire</P>
    <P>I would touch my forelock to the Minister, if I had one, for her strength in dealing with some of the political leaders in Central Africa because many of them are appalling.  The Minister dealt firmly but courteously with people whose airspace I would not wish to breath.  At the moment one has to deal with these people and I congratulate her.</P>
    <P>Last night I listened to Julius Nyerere who is a very wise man.  What gave me greatest hope was that he refused to be obsessed by the looming tyrannical figures like President Mobuto.  In the long process of history these tyrants are irrelevant.  I hope they can be made irrelevant and the kind of action Ireland can take, small as it may be, can help to make them so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why the generals have to spend so many weeks arguing about the details when on each week there has been a job which a few thousand well equipped, properly mandated soldiers could have done.  It is not a case of western forces going in alone &mdash; countries such as Ethiopia, Eritrea and South Africa are ready to help.  They know the area and understand the problems.  This week they can bring assistance and transport to the 300,000 or 700,000 people wandering in Zaire.  We have satellites which can see what a farmer in Ireland is doing in relation to setaside and count the number of sheep on an Italian hillside.  I cannot understand why we cannot allocate more scientific resources to finding out where the people are in Zaire and the numbers involved.  The international agencies need that information.  It is something which a technical mission of that force could establish if <Col N="840" /> it went in now.  Some countries have technical missions in place, but they need more support.</P>
    <P>This crisis has convulsed the UN system.  We would all like to see that system prosper and grow, but it needs leadership and a sense of revitalisation.  The international tribunal in Arusha is a disgrace.  Following the killing of one million people, it has managed to indict fewer than 20 people in two and a half years.  That must remain one of the most shameful episodes of this period. Whether it is a lack of resources or leadership in the UN or in the tribunal structure, it is a matter to which we should devote attention.</P>
    <P>In Rwanda there is the prospect of a commission modelled on the South African Truth Commission for lesser categories of genocide.  It is hoped that it will begin some time in December.  It is important that we support the Rwandans in dealing quickly with those in the lesser categories so that the pressure on space in jails can be reduced.</P>
    <P>Members spoke about the arms trade.  The question of the European Union having an enforceable code of conduct on arms is urgent. The European Union is one of the great forces in the post Cold War period.  We have a humanitarian tradition and experience in this regard because of what happened during the last world war.  It was from that experience the European Union was born.  The EU should have an enforceable code of conduct on armaments. We saw invoices from Mil-Tec blowing on scrap heaps in the Mugunga camp.  Ireland does not have an armaments industry but, as Europeans, we must address this problem.</P>
    <P>An aid worker in Zaire asked me if General Mobuto could be persuaded to give half his fortune to the suffering people in that country.  It is potentially one of the richest countries in the world but it has been looted for the past 30 years. In terms of an evolving European foreign policy, if we want Africa to prosper and to be a trading partner from which we too will prosper, we must ask how generals, such as General Mobuto, acquire fabulous wealth, 17 chateaux and a beautiful seven acre property in the centre of Brussels.  We must ask ourselves hard questions. If people involved in and organisers of the genocide are living in countries in the European Union, such countries, following in the humane tradition of the EU, must give them up to the international criminal court system.</P>
    <P>Ireland, during its Presidency of the European Union, sought to work on a structure which would allow the different parties in the region to enter into dialogue.  It is important to support the transition to democracy in Zaire and security for returning refugees in Rwanda.  We must also consider the dangers in Burundi from where reports have come of refugees being killed on their return.  I welcome the safe return of the refugees.  However, another 400,000 refugees in Tanzania are seeking to return home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> In July this year the Rwandan Vice President, Mr. Paul Kagame, visited Ireland.  He led the RPF army in ending the genocide in Rwanda.  We visited Strokestown House which, for the benefit of our European visitors, is a beautiful, but sad place in the west.  It is a memorial to those who died in the Irish famine 150 years ago.  It has a good display for Irish school children who go to learn the history of what happened during the famine.  Those in the House this evening are the descendants of the survivors of the famine.  The Vice President looked at pictures of what was then the world's response to the Irish famine which was, as somebody said earlier, the workhouse, a large institution into which one placed the dying and the destitute.  If people were not already dying of hunger, they had a good chance of dying from fever in the workhouse. Vice President Kagame said they were like the refugee camps of today.  Workhouses were meant as a humane solution to the problem, but people at the time knew they were not the only solution and that there were better ones.  Refugee camps may be necessary in the short-term to save people but, like our workhouses, they are not a long-term solution.  As we see the cycle of refugee camps possibly coming to end, we should resolve to support the Great Lakes region so there will never be a need to rebuild refugee camps on such a scale.  I thank Senators for their extremely thoughtful contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to outline a serious problem for the people of Dingle, for fish processing in the town and for fishermen.  I will explain the history of this sorry saga.</P>
      <P>In the late 1980s and early 1990s it was decided to develop the fishing harbour in Dingle to its full potential.  Arising from the development of the harbour, substantial investment was made by fishermen, unaided by a State grant, in second-hand fishing vessels ranging from 90 to 100 feet to fish uncaught quotas in the Irish Box.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dingle was ideally situated to exploit the situation.  Approximately £4.7 million was spent on the development of the harbour over a couple of years.  Arising from this development and the investment by fishermen in new and second-hand boats, approximately 200 extra jobs were created for deck-hands and onshore workers.  Prior to the development of the harbour in Dingle, fish landings in 1989 were valued at over £1.1 million. This figure has increased steadily over the years and, for the past two or three years, it has exceeded £5 million.  Dingle has become the fourth largest port in terms of fish landings.  It is <Col N="842" /> expected that approximately £7 million worth of fish will be landed in Dingle in 1996.</P>
    <P>In line with that, local fish processing plants expanded and took on more workers.  There was no shortage of private investment which was helped by State grants from Údarás na Gaeltachta, etc.  Approximately 200 men and women work in these fish processing plants.</P>
    <P>Three years ago, Kerry County Council, acting as agents for the Department of the Environment, decided to build a new sewage treatment plant for the town as, up until then, all sewage went untreated into Dingle Harbour.  The harbour is landlocked and about one mile long and half a mile wide with a narrow entrance and exit.  The announcement of the new treatment plant was welcomed by all.  The tourism, fishing and fish processing industries welcomed this major development as it would be a huge advantage to Dingle.  As chairman of the Dingle Harbour Commissioners, I, along with some of the commissioners and the harbour master, met council engineers and consultants on a few occasions about the new treatment plant. Wayleave had to be obtained for pipes going through Department of the Marine property under the control of the Dingle Harbour Commissioners and there were underground pumps and pumphouses, etc.  We left no stone unturned in expediting the matter as quickly and efficiently as possible.  At the time, we were assured by the people we met that there would be no pollution from sewage flowing into Dingle Harbour when the plant was finished.  We were assured that the water would be so clean, we could drink it.</P>
    <P>Each of the fish processing plants was given a connection to this main sewage treatment plant. In fact, Údarás na Gaeltachta paid £250,000 to extend the scheme from Milltown Bridge to its Ballyhea industrial estate which has two substantially sized fish processing plants.  The only reason for this was to ensure the effluent from the fish processing factories would go into the new sewage treatment plant, thereby preventing any pollution of a local river or Dingle Harbour.  A third fish processing plant nearer Dingle was also given a connection to this sewerage scheme.</P>
    <P>In planning such a sewage treatment plant, fish processors, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the fishing industry should be properly consulted on the amount of fish processing which is done locally and which is likely to occur in the future so that the plant will be able to cater for any future development.</P>
    <P>The outflow from the plant enters the sea at approximately the same place where the old sewerage scheme entered the sea.  As soon as the new sewage treatment plant opened, I realised something was seriously wrong because, looking from my home down into the harbour, I could see hundreds of sea birds gathering where the outflow entered the sea.  That meant that some amount of raw sewage was entering the sea at that point.  Over the last six months at meetings <Col N="843" /> of Dingle Harbour Commissioners, of which I am chairman, several members asked why the treatment plant was not working properly.  Two local councillors on the harbour commissioners put down a notice of motion to Kerry County Council about it.  They were informed that, at peak periods for about three weeks of the year when a lot of fish were being landed at Dingle, the treatment plant was unable to cater for the high volume of effluent coming from fish processing plants.  It is ridiculous for anyone to state that a £3.5 million sewage treatment plant cannot cater for peak periods in the fish processing plants in Dingle when more fish will be landed in future and more fish processing plants will be built.</P>
    <P>The £3.5 million state-of-the-art sewage treatment plant is doing no more to prevent pollution in Dingle Harbour than if it did not exist at all.  Someone is at fault and serious errors have been made in the proper planning of this sewerage treatment plant.  It has been brought to my notice that Kerry County Council has suggested that the three processing plants should install their own effluent treatment plants before their effluent is allowed into the main sewage treatment plant.  If that were to happen, it would cost £300,000 to £350,000 per processing plant.  To suggest something like that is absolutely crazy since these fish processing plants were assured that the treatment plant would take the effluent from their factories.</P>
    <P>To make matters worse, one of the factories carried out a major upgrading and expansion one and a half years ago and the owner is still owed a grant of £750,000 which is being withheld by Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The job is finished, the factory opened for business over a year ago in new premises and is giving much needed work to 100 men and women.  Through no fault of his own, the grant is withheld because the owner cannot comply with the conditions of the effluent discharge licence.  He has been given one month by Kerry County Council to implement a treatment plant for which planning permission would take at least three to four months.  Should Kerry County Council insist on these conditions, there will be no option but to close the factory and make 100 people redundant which will have a knock-on effect on fishing in Dingle.  I ask that the owner be immediately paid the £750,000 owed to him for the refurbishment and extension of the factory and I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in that respect.</P>
    <P>I am reliably told that 80 per cent of the sewage going to the new treatment plant is bypassing it and flowing into the harbour.  Recently, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs opened the Mara Beo Aquarium in Dingle which cost £3 million.  It is a huge success.  The water from the aquarium is drawn from Dingle Harbour.  If the harbour is being polluted to the extent I believe, the aquarium could be wiped out which would be absolutely disastrous.  I and the harbour <Col N="844" /> commissioners could be held up to ridicule in that we were under the impression that this plant would give us a harbour free from pollution.  We applied for a blue flag for Dingle marina and, if the pollution is to continue, there will not be much chance of getting that blue flag.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to investigate why this treatment plant failed and is unable to cater for the small amount of effluent from three fish processing plants.  My hope is that there will be an increased landing of fish and that extra jobs will be created in fish processing in Dingle.  This will lead to increased effluent flowing into the new sewage treatment plant which should be able to cope with it so that the harbour will be free from pollution.  This matter should be addressed by those who are to blame.  The Dingle Harbour Commissioners and the fish processors were assured that when this new treatment plant was put in place, there would be no more trouble.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to investigate what has gone wrong so this matter can be rectified at no cost to the fish processors, who did everything they were asked.  If this matter is not rectified quickly and if Kerry County Council prevents the effluent from fish processing factories going into the treatment plant, all the boats in Dingle will be tied up.  I do not want to scaremonger but I would like to hear what the Minister has to say.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzgerald has raised an important topic and I thank him for giving me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, to explain the background to the current situation and the way forward in reaching an acceptable outcome.</P>
      <P>The Dingle sewage treatment plant was designed to deal with a loading of 8,000 population equivalent.  In designing the plant to this capacity Kerry County Council and its consultants made provision for the plant to take a significant loading from the fish processing plants in the area.  In fact, almost one quarter of the treatment plant's capacity was set aside to cope with the demands of the fish processing industry.  This capacity was determined by reference to the information made available by representatives of the fish processing firms and by Board lascaigh Mhara who had carried out a study of the industry in the Dingle area.  Pre-treatment at industry level to remove fats and grease was also envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be helpful to point out that the loadings and concentrations arising from the fish processing sector can change dramatically from season to season.  The discharge during the herring season, from October to February, is different from the summer season when the processing would relate to white fish which are gutted at sea.  Indeed, concentrations can change significantly on a daily basis, depending on fish fat content and the type of process being undertaken.  Municipal treatment plants cannot be designed on the basis of taking huge loads over short periods and running uneconomically <Col N="845" /> for the remainder of the year.  The way to deal with the wildly fluctuating loads is by the provision of pre-treatment at industry level and I now propose to address this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>Discharges from the fish processing industry to the public sewerage system are subject to licence. The granting of such licences is a matter for the local authority.  Recent samples taken by the council show loadings well in excess of the treatment plant's design capacity, which Senator Fitzgerald has correctly indicated.  Kerry County Council and representatives of the fish processing industry have entered into discussions with a view to dealing effectively with the problems being experienced.</P>
    <P>I understand that the industry accepts the need for adequate pre-treatment facilities.  The council is reviewing the licences and the industries have been informed of the council's requirements.  It is intended that the required pre-treatment facilities will be installed in the near future and, certainly, in advance of the 1997 herring season.  Full compliance with the licensing requirements will enable the treatment plant to deal effectively with these and other effluents.</P>
    <P>When the sewerage scheme was being designed it was envisaged that all fish processing would take place at the Ballyhea industrial estate.  This has not yet happened.  I understand, however, that discussions are taking place between the processing plant concerned and Údarás na Gaeltachta, with a view to having the filleting operation moved to Ballyhea.  This would enable the fish processing industries to provide one plant for pre-treatment facilities, which would also be a very desirable development locally.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald will appreciate that the problems being experienced are not attributable to the design of the Dingle sewage treatment plant.  The main problem lies in the inadequacy of the pre-treatment being provided by the fish processors.  These matters are being actively addressed at local level in the context of the review of the licences under way at present.  I am hopeful that the problems will be sorted out in the near future.  I also take on board the other points raised by the Senator, including the matter of the outstanding grant, which I will bring to the attention of the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter with the Minister.  I acknowledge there have been good improvements as regards the carer's allowance and disability allowance. The improvements have benefited a spouse who looks after another.  I am concerned about where a son or daughter is taking care of a dependent parent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa informed me in a letter that the further development of the carer's allowance is currently <Col N="846" /> being examined in conjunction with the Department of Health in the wider context of healthcare provision in the home.  The Commission on Disabilities report was published recently.</P>
    <P>A person in the home caring for a parent does not qualify for the carer's allowance unless the parent is in receipt of qualifying payments, in particular, disability allowance.  The parent may not qualify for disability allowance because of means testing.  Therefore, the carer will not qualify for the carer's allowance.  There have been improvements in the disability allowance, including a £45 disregard and the opportunity to have the income of an earning spouse included in the calculation of the means test.  If the other spouse earns £174 or less, the disabled spouse will qualify for disability allowance and, therefore, the carer will qualify for carer's allowance.  However, there are many families who have an income above that and may still not be particularly well off.</P>
    <P>One case came to my attention where a daughter aged 18 years left school early to look after her severely disabled mother.  Her father earns less than £200 per week and the three of them live together in the family home.  In this man's appeal to the Department of Social Welfare he said:</P>
    <P>My position today is that my daughter has informed me that she is no longer willing to remain tending to her mother's needs 24 hours a day, without any time for herself or indeed any consideration for the work she is doing. She says she is going to get a flat in the private sector.  She is insistent she will qualify for social welfare payments of £64.50.</P>
    <P>It does not say it here but she is currently in receipt of £35 from the health centre under exceptional needs payments.  The appeal goes on:</P>
    <P>She will also get a rent allowance.  She is determined to take this action if she does not qualify for the carer's allowance.  I find it hard to blame her as she can see all her peers going out and enjoying themselves and she is being denied any means of doing this simply because she has to stay at home to look after her mother, and has done so for a number of years. Any action of this nature by my daughter will effectively mean I will have to give up my job. Alternatively I may be forced to have my wife taken into the care of the Mid-Western Health Board, which is a situation I would not relish one bit.  I am well aware of the cost to the State of keeping people in care and I am baffled they cannot see the benefit in paying the carer's allowance to people like my daughter.</P>
    <P>This is one example where it is likely the family will break up if the man does not give up his job. His wife will have to go into a long stay institution and his daughter will move to a flat.  This is not a situation any of us would like to see happen although they are the kind of family who probably will not let it happen.  Nevertheless, <Col N="847" /> when this issue is examined, I would like consideration to be given to people in that position, so that this young girl and others like her who want to stay at home to look after an invalid parent can do so and still have some kind of respectable income.</P>
    <P>We know the cost of long stay care and that people get unemployment assistance and rent allowances if they move out of the family home. If they are looking after an elderly or disabled parent, they are not available for work and do not qualify for unemployment assistance.  It is an anomaly in the system and one that those in this House would not want to see continue.  I welcome the improvements that have been made and I raise this issue in the hope that this type of situation can be addressed in a caring way by the Minister of State and his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Sullivan for raising this issue.  The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain disabled persons with fulltime care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  At the end of September this year, there were 8,088 allowances in payment. Unlike the more restrictive prescribed relative allowance which it replaced, it is not a requirement of the carer's allowance that the carer be related to the person requiring care.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1990, the carer's allowance has been improved and expanded progressively over the years.  In 1991, the scheme was extended to include people looking after recipients of disability allowance, formerly known as disabled person's maintenance allowance, or an equivalent social security payment from an EU country or a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement.</P>
      <P>A major improvement in the means testing arrangements applying to the carer's allowance came into effect in July 1994.  A weekly income disregard of £100 in respect of the spouse's income from either employment or self-employment was introduced.  In addition, the existing initial disregard of income of £2 per week was increased to £6.  As a result of these improvements, a carer whose spouse was earning £160 per week could qualify for a carer's allowance of £37 per week where previously no allowance would have been payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1995 budget provided for further significant improvements in the scheme.  There is an error about which I will consult the Senator. The disregard of spouse's income was increased to £150 per week and was extended to include other forms of income.  The categories of person being cared for were also expanded to include people aged 66, or over, who are in receipt of <Col N="848" /> non-social welfare pensions, for example, occupational pensioners.  Furthermore, all recipients of carer's allowance were given access to the free travel companion pass which allows the carer to travel free when accompanying the person being cared for.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget, the weekly personal rate of the carer's allowance was increased by £5 to £67.50 which is an 8 per cent increase on last year's rate.  In addition, new regulations have been introduced which change the basis of assessment of means of carers for the purpose of determining entitlement to rent and mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  As a result of these changes, carers who are receiving rent or mortgage interest supplements from the health boards can now benefit by as much as £29 per week.  The new regulations also mean that some applicants who previously failed to qualify on the basis of their means will now be in a position to qualify for the allowance.</P>
    <P>Despite the improvements which have been introduced in recent years, there is in my view, a clear need for a fundamental review of the scheme with particular reference to current provision for general health care in the home for elderly and disabled people requiring care.  That review is being carried out by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and will be completed shortly.  The review will look at all aspects of the current operation of the carer's allowance having regard to our operational experience of the scheme to date.  I have to say, however, that any proposals arising from the review would have to be considered in the light of available resources.</P>
    <P>Two important reports published recently made a number of recommendations in relation to the carer's allowance and these will be taken into account in the review.  The reports I refer to are the fifth report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights entitled &ldquo;A Long-term Support Framework for Female Carers of Older People and People with Disabilities: 1996 &mdash; 2011&rdquo; and the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities entitled &ldquo;A Strategy for Equality&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I recognise the points raised by the Senator which are part and parcel of the issues the Department comes up against with any scheme when it is operational.  It is virtually impossible to determine such snags prior to that.  The scheme is under review and I will consult with the Senator on one aspect of the text which may be in error.</P>
