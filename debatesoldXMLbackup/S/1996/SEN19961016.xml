      <P>I have notice from Senator Calnan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to deal with problems created by groups of people in caravans who move into small towns and villages in west Cork intimidating and threatening local and business people, and also by a large number of new age travellers whose behaviour in many cases is not acceptable especially in public places.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator R. Kiely of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to expedite the special beef premium payments to extend BSE compensation to include cattle slaughtered from 1 January 1996; and to explore various systems to ease farmers' financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide the necessary funds <Col N="1702" /> to alleviate the serious overcrowding at the County Hospital Roscommon.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Farrelly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Education if funding will be made available this year to ensure that the extension to Ashbourne community school can go ahead.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Sullivan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to ensure adequate funding for health boards to maintain and develop the home help service.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Hayes of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to include in the intergovernmental conference discussions a complete and meaningful section concerning the rights of young people in the European Union, and that such a commitment be included in the next Treaty of the European Union which is under discussion.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Calnan's and Senator Kiely's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1 and item 15 on the supplement to the Order Paper.  Item 1 will be taken until 6 p.m. and, by agreement, speeches will not last longer than 15 minutes and Members may share time. This debate will be taken by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs but he will not be in the House at the beginning of the debate, although a Minister will, of course, be here.  He will make his contribution later in the debate.</P>

      <P>Two of our biggest natural resources are under threat at the moment &mdash; the beef and fisheries sectors. Will the Leader arrange a debate on the beef industry as soon as possible in light of yesterday's extraordinary decision by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry which will exclude three of our major beef producing counties from the Russian deal?  He should be afforded an opportunity to explain that decision to the House and allow us debate the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Barrett, in his capacity as EU President for Fisheries, is dealing with very comprehensive EU proposals for the fishing industry.  Following last week's meeting, he is now on a tour of EU capitals.  Will the Leader <Col N="1704" /> arrange for the Minister to update this House on his proposals and how he sees the industry developing, which would give this House an opportunity to debate the issues with him?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the welcome to the Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons.  I agree with Senator Manning that the Speaker could learn from your gracious self, Sir, but having listened to his wise and gentle words at yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I feel we have a lot to learn from the approach he demonstrated to us.</P>
      <P>Will you, Sir, and the Leader agree to send congratulations to Bishop Belo and José Ramos-Horta?  Bishop Belo is the Roman Catholic bishop of Dili in East Timor and Jose Ramos-Horta is the foreign minister of the Timorese people.  They have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which this House, due to its long tradition of discussing this matter forcibly, would wish to recognise by sending a message of congratulations. I hope this will be followed up by some action because Bishop Belo has called once again for a referendum in East Timor on the subject of self-determination. Perhaps this could be joined with the hope that Xanana Gusmao will be released from illegal detention in Indonesia and that a representative of the Timorese people be included in the negotiations between the Portuguese and Indonesian authorities.  I am sure Members will want to recognise this great and deserved distinction in a world where moral authority is not always recognised.  One notes the squeals of outrage from the Indonesians at this award.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that, in view of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges's desire to allow distinguished people to address us, this might be a way to overcome some of the procedural problems.</P>
      <P>I endorse the call by Senator Wright for an urgent and extended debate on the BSE crisis in view of the fact that beef from counties Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan has been excluded from the Russian market.  Farmers have taken many blows since the March announcement in the House of Commons.  This is another blow which makes life almost impossible from them.  In view of that, it is essential that we discuss the matter. I hoped we would have learned last March that Russian and Iranian consumers are the same as those in New-bridge and Ballyfermot and that the are entitled to get what they demand.  There seems to be some difficulty in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry accepting that fact.  I heard the Minister on radio today imply that we should keep quiet about these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the motion from Senator Rory Kiely which addresses related matters but not this particular one.  Are we meant to keep quiet about the misuse of angel dust and about people who introduce BSE into herds to get compensation?  Are we meant to keep quiet about the irregularities in the beef industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in the national interest to keep quiet about these matters and we had better decide that it is the consumer who counts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1706" /> I endorse Senator Norris's congratulations to Bishop Belo and José Ramos-Horta on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  I hope it will lead to a speed up in the right to self determination of the East Timorese people. This award has served to highlight their cause as we have tried to do on many occasions.  These people should have basic human rights and I hope the Indonesian Government will experience the pressure of international opinion and that the right to self-determination of the East Timorese will be granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the welcome to the Speaker of the Canadian Parliament. I rise to support Senator Wright's and Senator Dardis's call for a full debate on agriculture, especially in view of the dangerous precedent adopted yesterday in agreeing to ban three counties from supplying beef to our biggest export market.  It will mean disaster for all beef producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Dardis said, my motion is confined to a certain matter. A motion on the Adjournment would not provide sufficient time for such a debate and it would not do justice to the crisis the beef industry faces at present.  I call for a full debate; I understand there will be a debate in the other House in the near future.  It is important that the Minister come to the House to explain what he did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards phase 1 of the rationalisation of the vocational <Col N="1707" /> education committees, I ask the Leader to provide time for a debate and to ask the Minister for Education to come to the House to discuss this issue. Members on both sides are concerned about their role in serving the public through their local vocational education committee.  When we are talking about openness, transparency and accountability, here is a golden opportunity for the Minister to allow this House to open a discussion on this important issue. With the huge volume of change taking place, the public at large is very confused. The Leader knows that many public representatives from both sides have grave concerns about this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on BSE.  The Minister's proposals are unworkable because I cannot see a border being set up between County Cavan and County Monaghan in order to divide beef herds.  Since this is a random selection, I would be concerned about it.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to point out to the relevant Minister my concern that the women's All-Ireland Final is not being held in Croke Park this year because of a commercial deal involving a baseball match which takes precedence.  It was previously postponed because of the men's All-Ireland Final.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears any old pitch will do for the women's final.  I am disappointed that an organisation such as the GAA, which is backed to the hilt by the women of this country, should do such a thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the call from this side of the House for a debate on <Col N="1708" /> agriculture in the light of what happened yesterday.  I want to point out gently that comments being made about the fact that Senator Kiely will have an opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment may be fine in that it will certainly go on the record of the House but I am afraid there will be very little media attention mainly because of the timing of the Adjournment debate.  Any Member who has been present for Adjournment matters will testify that, while monitors may be available in the various press rooms, rarely is there a physical presence of the media in the House when Adjournment motions have been taken.  These motions are taken after the media deadlines and they do not appear in the public arena.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a matter for the Order of Business.  Is the Senator supporting a debate on agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but you commented that the matter can be raised tonight.  The purpose of raising it is to ensure that the voice of this House will be heard outside.  I am just making the general point that it is a sad reflection that matters on the Adjournment, which are an important element of the business of this House, rarely get into the public arena because of their timing and other deadlines.  The people of County Leitrim will be affected by what has been decided.</P>
      <P>However, the main reason I rose was to express my gratitude to the Government, which is rather unusual on this side of the House, in the context of the decision transmitted by the Minister for the Environment last week that the Government has finally decided to drop the farcical notion of setting aside three Seanad seats for emigrants.  The matter was debated in this House so I ask the Leader to convey our thanks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Leader will convey our thanks.  The counsel of this House has prevailed yet again and a decision has been taken.  However, in the context of that decision it seems there is some confusion.  Will it be discussed in a constitutional committee under the wider area of Seanad reform? This would be a dangerous precedent and a move to which I would be strenuously opposed.  Can the Leader clarify who should be asked to come into the House to talk about emigrant votes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Members on all sides of the House are anxious that this issue be settled once and for all.  There is a real and genuine desire on the part of emigrants to be involved in the electoral process.  Will the Leader consider giving Government time this session to discuss emigrant issues?  The Leader responded favourably when I raised this matter prior to the summer recess and I am anxious to know the present position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in demanding a full debate on agriculture next week.  The motion put down by Senator Rory Kiely will not give everyone in the House an opportunity to discuss this crisis which is escalating by the week.  We would like to hear the thinking behind the Minister's decision.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry must not know there are two separate constituencies in Tipperary; there was only one outbreak in South Tipperary.  Tipperary, <Col N="1710" /> Cork and Monaghan have been named. To date, partition applied to six counties; now it seems to apply to nine.  The implications are horrendous&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Leader to allow a debate on agriculture next week.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Ormonde's comments on the seriousness of the proposed changes in vocational education committees and the manner in which they are to be implemented.  The matter should be debated here before a major decision is made; it should not be done through back door methods.  I and many of my colleagues met members of the IFA an hour ago; they are angry with this typical nonsensical regulation by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Now there are nine counties instead of six&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to the rationalisation of the vocational education committees, I am a member of the IVEA standing council and I am a great believer in the vocational education committee system. A debate in this House at the appropriate time would be important.  The Minister will engage in serious discussions with the IVEA on the proposals that have emanated from the commission.  I remind colleagues on both sides that these proposals have been trotted out by successive Governments as far back as Dick Burke, Deputy Séamus Brennan, Deputy O'Rourke, Gemma Hussey <i>et al.</i></P>

      <P>In relation to BSE and the extraordinary decision to exclude three specific counties, I am happy to wait for an explanation from someone who has proven himself to be a consummate Minister for Agriculture.  Deputy Yates has been one of the best Ministers to hold that portfolio for many years. Senator Dardis has been preaching here that the consumer will always make the choices.  It is possible that the consumer made a choice which does not suit.</P>

He should return with a message of gratitude for the tremendous contribution Canada has made to the International Fund for Ireland.

      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for agreeing to a prompt debate on Northern Ireland.  I wish to raise the issue of mandatory reporting, this matter is on the Order Paper by way of a report from the Minister of State.  The House dealt with this issue on previous occasions and Members need to be fully informed about it.  I would welcome the opportunity for a debate on the matter.  I would prefer that it took place now when a high profile child sexual abuse case is not in the news or it does not form part of a fire brigade reaction.  I am in favour of this House investigating mandatory reporting.  I regret that most of the arguments against it are on the procedure rather than the principle.  It is crucial that Members are clear their minds in that regard.</P>
      <P>In deference to the GAA, and as a person who attends each year, I was not aware that the women's All-Ireland Final will not take place on Sunday.  I received tickets and an invitation to the Ard Chomhairle box so the match must be taking place at another stadium.</P>

European developments in the area of the marine will impact on the welfare, prospects and potential of the fishing industry. The House has engaged in a number <Col N="1714" /> of fruitful debates on this issue and it would be useful if the Minister for the Marine would give his point of view on a battle well fought in Europe.

      <P>I support Senator Kiely.  As the Minister for Agriculture and Food at the time, I put the most stringent regulations in place in relation to BSE.  I always insisted that our island status was the best guarantee we had of what is called &ldquo;white country status&rdquo;&mdash; the highest disease free status in the world. The decision by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to accept a Protocol which distinguishes Counties Tipperary, Cork &mdash; I am glad to have Senator Magner's support on this occasion &mdash; and Monaghan from the rest of the country is unnatural and foolish.</P>

With regard to the ESB, the Leader will be aware of a proposal from the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to sell and lease back the Moneypoint generating station in County Clare.  Will the Leader indicate to us if that matter has been decided by the Government?  I find it extraordinary that the Labour Party might agree to such a proposal.  We should have an opportunity to discuss this proposal which has come to light through media reports.  It is not clear whether there has been a Government decision on it. There is widespread concern among the workers at Moneypoint and the people of west Clare.  We would like clarification of what the Government proposes.</P>
      <P>I also wish to draw the Leader's attention to a statement made yesterday by the Minister for State, Deputy Fitzgerald, with regard to a committee she set up to co-ordinate the activities of various Departments that, in various ways, have responsibility for matters connected with violence against women, including attacks on women and children in the home.  The Minister of State indicated yesterday that there were 16,000 such vicious attacks last year.  She has established a committee to co-ordinate long-term national policy on the matter.  Can the Leader indicate what the Government's intentions are because we have only seen short statements in the media about them?</P>

I understand that councillors from two Government parties &mdash; perhaps from all three of them &mdash; indicated at a county council meeting in Dublin last week that service <Col N="1717" /> charges will not be imposed next year and that they will be removed in the budget.  That is a source of worry for county managers, revenue officers and councillors.  The matter should be cleared up so that the opportunity for local authorities to raise finances will not be undermined.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the decision of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to impose restrictions on beef exports to Russia from three counties.  The decision is extraordinary if it was based on actual outbreaks of BSE because I understand that in County Monaghan there were only three outbreaks of the disease while in the Minister's own county of Wexford there were four outbreaks.  Is there a particular reason Monaghan was included but Wexford was not?</P>

I will make efforts to ensure there is an early debate on that topic.  I will discuss that with the Leader of the Opposition later.  I join with Senators who have paid tribute to the <Col N="1719" /> Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry who has been an outstanding Minister in difficult circumstances.  There will be no difficulty in having the Minister into the House where we can a full debate on the facts.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright also raised the question of fisheries.  The Minister has an arduous schedule, but he is anxious to come into the House to discuss these issues.  That will be done as soon as I can arrange it.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris raised the question of the House sending its congratulations to Bishop Belo and the other winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.  This House should send its warmest congratulations to the winners of this prize.  We have had a number of debates in this House on East Timor and I am open to having a further short debate in the near future should Senators so wish.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde raised the rationalisation of the vocational education committees. We are fast approaching a position where we can have such a debate. The information is available and, as soon as I can, we will have that particular debate.  There is wide ranging consultation going on at present.  Senator Gallagher mentioned the women's All-Ireland Football Final.  I have no intention of involving myself in this controversy; anyway, I will be supporting the non-Monaghan team.  It is a matter for the GAA.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney raised the question of votes for emigrants.  I dealt with that at some length last week and I do not have anything further to offer. Senator O'Toole raised the question of mandatory reporting.  He is right when he says that this debate should take place in a calm atmosphere.  I will discuss the matter with him later to see if we can find a time for this debate.  He said he is not a member of the Opposition; he could have fooled me.  However, I can get clarification for him on that particular statement on the Order Paper.</P>

    <P>Senator Farrell raised the question of old people at risk.  Everyone's heart <Col N="1720" /> goes out to the unfortunate people who were brutalised last week but there is a wide range of measures in place encouraging people not to keep their money at home and providing extra protection through volunteer groups and the police in combating this particular rural scourge.</P>

    <Title>Northern Ireland: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we have an opportunity for this debate, which was arranged at the request of Senators from all parties.  I am not sure how helpful this debate will be.  There are times when one asks if anything more can be said about Northern Ireland.  Perhaps the one useful thing this House can do, being so far removed from where the real action is taking place, is indicate the depth of goodwill on all sides to those who are constructively, patiently and imaginatively seeking to find solutions and a way out of the current impasse. We can also express our impatience and anger towards those who persist in making any type of solution impossible. Sadly, the latter group ranges from the national saboteurs of the Provisional <Col N="1721" /> IRA to the constitutional bully boys exemplified by Robert McCartney and Ian Paisley, whose main talent appears to be selfish and almost mindless obstructionism.</P>
      <P>Since the Dáil debated this topic last week two important and positive developments have taken place.  The first is that the loyalist paramilitaries have agreed to continue their ceasefire.  We cannot over-emphasise the importance of this development.  We need have no doubt that every attempt was made to incite and provoke them back into violence. We can only wonder in horror at the mindset of people whose preferred option is to plunge Northern Ireland and the country into bloodshed, carnage and murder.  That is exactly what the Provisional IRA set out to do with the Lisburn bomb.  As long as they believe themselves to be above the law, humanity and decency, as long as they scorn the process of democracy and trample on the concept of consent, there is no place for them in civilised society and, least of all, no place for them at a negotiating table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Provisional IRA have their apologists, sneaking regarders and media fellow travellers; not many but still too many.  Within days and often within hours of the latest atrocity the excuses are trotted out or the finger of blame is pointed elsewhere: &ldquo;It is John Major's fault; his Government has not done enough&rdquo;, &ldquo;It is John Bruton's fault; he has not done enough&rdquo;, &ldquo;It is Dick Spring's fault&rdquo;, &ldquo;It is the Irish Government's fault&rdquo;, &ldquo;It is the Unionists who are to blame&rdquo;.  The finger is always pointed away from those who have perpetrated the outrage.  The pattern is predictable.  Look at the atrocities of recent times &mdash; the murder of Garda Jerry McCabe, the Clonaslee bomb factory, Canary Wharf, the London bomb factory, the murder and bombing in Lisburn, etc.  They were followed by a few days of silence after which the apologists were back blaming everybody except the murderers and bombers themselves; it is everybody's <Col N="1722" /> fault except the Provisional IRA, these misunderstood people.</P>
    <P>The Irish people have been extraordinarily patient with Sinn Féin.  It is clear they do not believe Sinn Féin.  How could they when they are bombarded with a daily diet of Adams-speak which stretches the imagination and so obviously flies in the face of the truth we can see around us?  The Irish people do not believe that Sinn Féin and the IRA are separate entities.  We are asked in speech after speech by Mr. Adams and others to accept that they are separate entities.  How can we accept this? The evidence is before our eyes.  In addition, the Irish people are deeply sceptical of the democratic credentials of Sinn Féin.  How can they be otherwise? What are the Irish people to make of the continuation of the so-called punishment beatings, these daily examples of kangaroo courts and barbaric brutality?</P>
    <P>The irony is that the Irish people want to believe Sinn Féin.  They want to believe that Sinn Féin can be trusted; they want to see Sinn Féin as part of a settlement.  That is the kind of people we are.  The conditions which the Irish people, North and South, have laid down for Sinn Féin are simple &mdash; end your ambiguity on violence and murder and accept fully the democratic process. That is the only condition the Irish people are asking of Sinn Féin and once again, if it is not too late, Sinn Féin should realise that, however slow they have been in the past few months, there would be a welcome for them and an expectation and hope that they would have a full part to play.  Is the IRA preventing Sinn Féin from playing its full part?  Perhaps, but I am sure that is only one part of the story.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the deep ambiguity in Sinn Féin which must end if it wants to regain the credibility and welcome it was accorded by all parties in this House after the ceasefire.  Its leaders cannot continue to face both ways.  Already many of Sinn Féin's best friends, especially in the US, are losing patience and belief.  Sinn Féin should <Col N="1723" /> never forget it was its American friends which gave it the respectability which helped it in from the cold on its early steps back into constitutional politics.</P>
    <P>Sometimes when we deal with a problem like Northern Ireland we get caught up in details and forget the fundamentals. There is a fundamental question to be answered: what does the IRA want after 27 years of the Troubles?  Is it to impose its will by force of arms on its fellow citizens, irrespective of the fact that over 95 per cent of the Irish people reject them and their methods?  Is it to stir up civil war in Northern Ireland between Protestant and Catholic? Emphatically that is what they are attempting to do at present.  Is it to drive the two parts of this island further apart?  Believe me the level of disaffection with Northern Ireland from so many people in the Republic, the sense of impatience, the sense of it being someone else's problem, is growing fast largely because of the tactics of the Provisional IRA.  Does the Provisional IRA believe it can drive Britain out of Northern Ireland against the wishes of the majority of people living there?  If this is the case then clearly it is not going to succeed.  What does it want?  I would like to know clearly, free of all the tortuous, convoluted, self-serving language of IRA statements, what they want.  I would like to know why they are so scared or contemptuous of democracy and dialogue.  Their view is they know best and they have the right to impose their will.  No Irish Government from any side of this House has ever given in to such threats and never will.</P>
    <P>At present there is a contrast between the IRA and the Protestant paramilitaries. I have no desire to glorify or adorn these same paramilitaries with any false sense of glamour &mdash; terrible crimes can be laid at their door.  Nonetheless, over the past difficult years, their leaders have shown courage, restraint and generosity.  They are under enormous pressure from the psychopaths in the Provisional IRA and, no doubt, from within their own community <Col N="1724" /> to restart their violence.  We can only hope that their nerve will hold.  It is important to pay tribute to Mr. McMichael and Mr. Ervine who have shown enormous imagination and courage. Would that they had their counterparts in the paramilitaries of the IRA and indeed, in the ranks on mainline unionism.</P>
    <P>The second important development since last week was the agreement between the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP.  We have waited a long time, too long, for this small breakthrough, yet we must welcome it.  The central fact in Northern Ireland is that if the mainstream parties cannot make the political process work, if politics are not capable &mdash; and seen to be capable &mdash; of delivering progress and of allowing elected representatives to talk honestly to each other, then any hope of normal politics there simply goes out the window.</P>
    <P>We should give at least two cheers for what has happened.  Let us hope the agreement this week is the beginning of something solid and real, knowing as we do that the history of Northern Ireland has been littered with false starts.  The long litany of false starts makes it very difficult to be other than sceptical about real progress.  We should not cheer too much until this small step develops into something more solid.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by reminding the House that we were to have had a small ceremony here tomorrow where a copy of a book by Alf McCreery on the life of our dead colleague, Senator Gordon Wilson, was to have been presented to the Cathaoirleach on behalf of the Seanad.  That has had to be postponed for a few weeks but, nonetheless, it is important to remind ourselves of the privilege we had in this House of having Gordon Wilson as a colleague and friend.  Most of all, we should try to remember and rekindle the spirit of generosity, imagination, forbearance and tolerance which underlay all his tireless efforts to bring peace and reconciliation to Northern Ireland.  I call on those politicians in Northern Ireland <Col N="1725" /> who are trying very hard, to keep in mind the spirit of Gordon Wilson.  I also call on Members to ensure his spirit and generosity are not forgotten.</P>

      <P>I endorse what the Leader of the House said in respect of our late colleague, Gordon Wilson.  I have no doubt that the tone of our contributions and the thrust of our efforts will be towards bringing about that understanding and tolerance without which no progress can be made in this difficult and tortuous problem.</P>
      <P>I am glad we are addressing this issue at a moment of hope and expectation. There have been numerous requests for a debate in the House on this issue over the last number of months.  I agree with the Leader that too much can be said and that one must always be conscious of the risk of a statement giving rise to a reaction.  There is now a possibility of an accommodation having regard to the agreement between the SDLP, the Unionist party and the other parties to the talks in Northern Ireland.  This is a moment of hope and expectation.</P>
      <P>In that context, I wish to pay tribute to my good friend for many years, John Hume, who has struggled relentlessly and under considerable pressure to bring about an understanding in Northern Ireland and to work towards the common advantage and interest of all the people on this island.  His search for peace has been constant and courageous. I was with him the day before the ceasefire ended in February.  His apprehension and agony at the prospect that it might end because of the lack of urgency on the part of both Governments at the time left me with a deep abiding feeling of the need for political leaders and Governments to move with urgency at all times to restore a lasting peace.  For that reason, I hope we can contribute to what might be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the loyalist paramilitary organisations which, despite the considerable pressure they must be under, have adopted a leadership role and have proclaimed and proved that they intend to maintain a ceasefire <Col N="1726" /> with a view to bringing about political discussion, agreement and, in the final analysis, political stability.  It is time we promoted those who have made so much effort to bring about the breathing space we now have.  Efforts have been made by churchmen, such as the Rev. Roy Magee and Fr. Alec Reid from my home town and with whom I was in contact many times over the years, to bring about an understanding and a commitment to peace from those who previously were involved exclusively in violence.</P>
    <P>As a republican, about which I feel very deeply and in the true spirit of what it means, I demand that the IRA restore its ceasefire for two reasons.  The violence and killing perpetrated on our fellow Irishmen of whatever tradition &mdash; their traditions are legitimate and valid &mdash; cannot be a basis for understanding but is a basis for dissension, trauma and further killing and violence.  In the name of all elected representatives I demand that the ceasefire which the IRA put in place over two years ago with a sense of courage be restored because it is unacceptable to the people or to any democratically representative here or elsewhere that any political progress could be achieved through violence and death.</P>
    <P>I demand the restoration of the ceasefire for another reason.  Sinn Féin must be party to the all inclusive talks if we are to bring about for the ultimate solution to this problem.  Unfortunately there can be no place for Sinn Féin until that clear, unequivocal and unqualified declaration of a ceasefire comes from the IRA.  Sinn Féin has played a positive and significant role and I hope that in a climate where an IRA ceasefire would be restored without any equivocation, it would be enabled to take its place at the table so as to bring about the ultimate resolution to this difficult problem.</P>
    <P>I condemn and reject violence and killing as a means to political accommodation because it is self-evident that it is the opposite in that it is a means to further dissension, violence and suffering. Having said that, condemnation is <Col N="1727" /> not enough.  The role of this and the British Government is to promote and to pursue every avenue and opportunity towards establishing peace on a secure and permanent basis.  To achieve that, one must win the trust and confidence of all parties in the interest of a secure and lasting peace.</P>
    <P>Above all else, political representatives and Governments must avoid provocation of a type which, far from bringing about a move towards understanding, reconciliation and a common cause, causes the opposite reaction.  I say with regret that the Taosieach did not serve that cause well &mdash; I know his purpose is one of good faith and that his intentions are honourable &mdash; when quite needlessly he equated Sinn Féin-IRA to the Nazis in Germany.  They can be accused of much on the basis of their inhuman activities &mdash; killings perpetrated in their names which we all reject &mdash; but no one could ever equate that with the horrific cruelty perpetrated by the Nazis on a race during the last war which was unprecedented in the human experience.  Despite recent terrible experiences in Bosnia and Rwanda, I hope it will never again feature as a blemish on humanity.  I do not understand why the leader of our nation chose to extend the horror which we share towards violence as if it were on a par with the human ovens of Auschwitz and elsewhere.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Urgency must be evident in everything our Government and the British Government do.  In that context, I welcome the signs of progress as regards the agreement for an agenda for the talks because a political vacuum only increases the risks of violence.  The door must always be kept open for Sinn Féin <Col N="1728" /> to come into these talks, assuming a durable IRA ceasefire is established. The British Government and the Ulster Unionist Party must not repeat the mistakes they made after the last ceasefire. The parties in the talks should try to create real momentum &mdash; the Governments must ensure this is done &mdash; and not create obstacles to inclusive participation.</P>
    <P>Unionist parties, particularly the Official Unionist Party, must realise that trying to disqualify a party which represents over one-third the Nationalist community from talks, even if the ceasefire is reinstated, is not the path to peace, stability and reconciliation.  The prize for which we must strive is not a political settlement without peace or a precarious peace without a political settlement, but a peace which is based on a durable political settlement.  That is the only prize which will secure what we hope to achieve through political action.</P>
    <P>There are many positive developments now.  Many friends around the world, in the United States, the EU and Canada which was represented in the House today by the distinguished Speaker of the Canadian Parliament and the former Senator Mitchell, are anxious to help us to bring about that durable peace based on a political settlement.  The Government must respond to that opportunity.  Both Governments failed to do so on the last occasion.  They sat back for too long and the frustration expressed to me by John Hume, a man of peace, is clear evidence of that.  Some now say that they seem to be responding to violence, like the unacceptable violence in Lisburn.  This is the type of thing in which a Government should not allow itself to be caught up.  It must take the initiative and maintain the momentum at all times.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Taoiseach refused to met John Hume and Gerry Adams at a time when they were fellow guarantors of the peace process.  That is not evidence of the type of urgency we now require.  The British Government sat back and backed down at Drumcree in <Col N="1729" /> the face of threatening violence, although I will not go back over recent history.  That is no way for a Government to behave.  Our challenge is to build what our leader called a stairway of consensus so that all sides can climb, albeit slowly, to a level of agreement which will protect the traditions and allegiances of all by respecting them and by pointing out that their role in the Ireland we want, North and South, must be real, positive and vigorous.  That role cannot be based on deceit.</P>
    <P>There is no point saying, for instance, as the Taoiseach said some time ago, that we have no interest of our own other than obtaining an agreement which is reasonable and fair to the aspirations of both communities in Northern Ireland.  He may have been trying to reassure by saying that but it is clearly and patently untrue.  Of course we have an interest in our own.  We, in our jurisdiction, have an entirely legitimate interest of our own not just in peace and stability in Northern Ireland but in closer co-operation between the two parts of the island for our mutual benefit and no member of the Unionist community will be reassured by our leader, the Taoiseach, saying that we have no interest of our own.  That may have been well intended but it certainly deceives and it will not create the basis for trust without which we cannot make progress.</P>
    <P>The future to which we look can only be based on respect and co-operation, a respect which poses no threat from any part of the community in Ireland, North or South, and which is reflected in the harmonious relationships in this part of Ireland to the extent that we do not even know to which denomination a person belongs in terms of his or her political affiliations.  That may not be anything to boast about but it is the reality.  I would like to think that our fellow Protestant Irishmen who have played a huge part in the development of the institutions of this State would continue to communicate to their fellow Protestant Irishmen in the North that <Col N="1730" /> the Ireland in which they live and hope to share is not one based on any threat or domination which, unfortunately, has been all too much a feature of Northern Ireland for far too long.</P>
    <P>The potential for all of us in the condition which we want to bring about will be one where there is triumph of hope over fear, confidence over distrust, tolerance over prejudice, peace over violence and exuberant life over cruel death.  This can be achieved provided we look to the potential we have together on this island and in Europe. Our fellow Unionist Irishmen, whom I respect greatly, will see that they are now deprived of a meaningful international role which we richly enjoy.  We want to share all that with them.  Hopefully, we can begin to see that sense of urgency and confidence in that spirit which will bring together the political representatives of this nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate assessing the current situation in Northern Ireland and how the various parties, including the two Governments, might be able to move the process forward.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Leader and Senator O'Kennedy invoked the spirit of our late colleague, Senator Gordon Wilson.  Indeed, Senator O'Kennedy also referred to Rev. Magee and Fr. Reid.  We need to bear in mind the heartfelt spirit of generosity, reconciliation and understanding of the experience of others who may come from different communities which those three people represent.  That spirit is needed in Northern Ireland at present.</P>
      <P>Much of what has happened in the past few months has given little ground for optimism.  Drumcree represented the worst traits of unionism &mdash; backward looking bully-boy supremacy which alienated their neighbours. Serious questions also arose around that time about police partiality which was followed by boycotting, which brought further alienation to the communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1731" /> The Lisburn bombs and the resulting death of Warrant Officer James Bradwell have highlighted starkly the necessary isolation of Sinn Féin from the democratic talks process for as long as they give support to the IRA's killing and maiming campaign, and there is no evidence that Sinn Féin will stop giving that support.  They cannot hold two hands of cards &mdash; the armalite and the ballot box &mdash; and expect a place at the table where everyone else has only one. Neither can they ignore the significance of potent message of 92 per cent of Nationalist readers of <i>The Irish News</i> surveyed recently who said clearly that they want the ceasefire renewed.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin frequently refers to its mandate but is it being properly represented when the evidence indicates that the vast majority of those who gave them that mandate do not want violence to be used as a political weapon at this stage in the history of Northern Ireland?  History does not stand still and what people want from their political leaders can change.  The people of Northern Ireland, including the vast majority of those who voted for Sinn Féin in the last election, want them to work on an agreed future through dialogue and not violence.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin must also face the fact that the Lisburn bombs have had the direct effect of making it more difficult for the British Government to proceed in way which includes Sinn Féin.  They cannot be seen to make concessions to violence. Sinn Féin can make a positive contribution if it acts both publicly and privately as a persuader to the IRA to call a ceasefire.  I listened to &ldquo;Saturday View&rdquo; on RTE Radio 1 last Saturday when Martin McGuinness was asked if he felt his party should do this and he ignored the question.  Instead, as is their wont, he told us what he thought the British Government should do.  This is not acceptable and it is not what the vast majority of those who voted for Martin McGuinness and his colleagues want.</P>
    <P>I read in the newspapers that Gerry <Col N="1732" /> Adams said last week in north Belfast that Sinn Féin is prepared to go the extra mile for peace.  I have heard him say this before and we could have believed him at certain stages, particularly two years ago, but if this is not mere empty rhetoric, we need to see it go that extra mile quickly.  We have genuine grounds to wonder whether Sinn Féin means what it says when it uses such rhetoric.  We should keep the door open and be ready to respond if it genuinely brings about another ceasefire. If we are to believe it will go that extra mile, we must see Sinn Féin uses its powers of persuasion with the IRA as we have seen the representatives of loyalism speak out clearly to their paramilitaries.</P>
    <P>The British Government reacted to the Lisburn bombing and the death of Warrant Officer Bradwell with understandable condemnation, anger and frustration but it, too, has a responsibility to do what it can to resolve conflict without giving comfort to terrorism. In the immediate future, clearing logjams as they arise in the talks process will be the central preoccupation but the British Government can now begin to put a process in place well in advance of next year's marching season so that decisions with regard to routes, policing and community consultation are based on clear and impartial guidelines and are implemented vigorously.  It could have done this in advance of this summer's marches and this might have headed off much of what happened, particularly the stand-off at Drumcree which left Catholic communities feeling oppressive Unionist tactics had won out. Before the marching season the British Government should have worked out a strategy; I sincerely hope it will do so before the next marching season.  They must be prepared and put procedures in place which are seen to be fair and impervious to pressures.</P>
    <P>We found out in the last day or two that the Apprentice Boys of Derry intend marching next Saturday.  I appeal strongly for appropriate consultation with residents of Derry from both traditions <Col N="1733" /> so that confrontation can be avoided.  That can be achieved only if people are consulted.</P>
    <P>The British Government can take other action which would not be perceived as concessions to violence.  It can and should move to draw up and implement a bill of rights.  This is something which the Labour Party and other parties have been saying for some time. Indeed, there is broad support in the Northern community and beyond for the concept of a bill of rights.  I urge our Government to impress on the British Government the importance of taking politically impartial steps, such as the drawing up of a Bill of rights.  They can also address the prisoners issue and economic and social measures, especially in those parts of the North where these problems are most acute.  It is not a coincidence that those who are recruited to violence and terrorism are most likely to come from areas of social and economic deprivation.</P>
    <P>The anti-violence stand taken by loyalist leaders of the PUP and the UDP has been praised and encouraged in this country and beyond.  They need to continue to articulate this clearly thought out position which they hold with great conviction.  They need to persuade those within their own communities and support structure, who may not be as convinced as the leadership, to adhere to democratic dialogue.</P>
    <P>As two previous speakers have said, the SDLP have demonstrated flexibility and maturity when most needed, from helping Sinn Féin come in from the cold and playing an important part in the process to the agreement they made yesterday with the UUP on an agenda for talks.  While Mr. Trimble and his colleagues may be motivated as much by the opportunity to isolate Sinn Féin as a need to progress the talks, they must nevertheless be given credit for moving forward.  The agreement on an agenda between the SDLP and the UUP is to be welcomed for two reasons in particular.</P>
    <P>First, it puts decommissioning on a separate track and deals with it along <Col N="1734" /> with talks.  Anyone with a grasp on reality would not expect the loyalists currently taking part in the talks to agree to decommissioning while Sinn Féin are outside the process.  Arms will have to be decommissioned in a balanced manner with both sides of the community being part of the process. Decommissioning has been put into a separate compartment and has not been allowed to block progress in the talks.  I welcome the fact that the SDLP and the UUP together have led that process.  It would have signalled the death knell of the talks if such a decision had not been made on decommissioning, as there is no immediate prospect of Sinn Féin entering into talks.  Progress on decommissioning is fraught with difficulty.  The two Governments have indicated their intention to draft plans for a mechanism by which this can be done.  Decommissioning is not likely to happen in the immediate future.  It will take careful discussions, dialogue and understanding before we get to that point.</P>
    <P>The other reason the agreement between the SDLP and the UUP is so welcome is these two parties, representing the majority of Nationalists and Unionists, show a willingness to compromise that is essential to progress. That the DUP's Reverend Ian Paisley and the cry of the UK Unionist Bob McCartney &ldquo;traitor&rdquo; is all the more reason to hope that David Trimble and his party are being pro-active.  They have led, despite the others sniping at them from the sidelines.  I have spoken before of the arid prospect of a pan Nationalist front and a pan Unionist front in confrontation.  This is a dangerous prospect which will not get us anywhere. We need to understand the other community's point of view.  If we see ourselves in terms of a pan Nationalist front versus a pan Unionist front, we will achieve nothing.</P>
    <P>We need real engagement between Unionists and Nationalists.  We have some evidence that the SDLP and the UUP have taken steps along this path. All of the advice and wisdom on conflict resolution underlines the absolute <Col N="1735" /> necessity of real engagement between representatives of the different traditions to develop some level of trust and willingness to compromise.  I participated in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and heard directly of the South African experience.  I heard the words of wisdom of Dr. Eida, Kevin Boyle, Tom Hadden and others who gave us an expert view on conflict resolution. It is clear that progress will be made only if those who lead their communities do not dig their heels in and refuse to yield ground for fear of appearing to let their side down.  The leadership on all sides are conscious they have to bring their people with them.  They also need the courage to understand and accept the needs of the other community.</P>
    <P>The way forward is a hazardous passage which has to be negotiated with great care.  Anyone who uses violent or obstructionist tactics to block progress will betray the future of their people. The current and previous Governments have ensured the essential principles of consent and parity of esteem underlying the process.  They are a vital part of the balance of interests and must continue to play this positive role.  Our Government has played a positive role right through the process and must continue to do so.</P>

      <P>I agree with much of what Senator O'Sullivan has said.  She has touched on important aspects of conflict resolution and examined the matter from the principled position of how to move forward on an understood basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of discrimination and a veto, which has ruined the process in Northern Ireland for so long, must be addressed.  On this side of the Border we have spoken about the veto on talks <Col N="1736" /> which the Unionist community appeared to have and the IRA is currently exercising another veto by effectively ensuring these talks do not get under way.  It seems like heresy to say it may be necessary for the mass of people to say we should get on with it and take decisions.  If a tiny number of people are not part of it, they will eventually be isolated. I would prefer to take my chances with that approach rather than bending over backwards to find a solution.</P>
    <P>I receive word of developments in the North on a daily basis.  During the ceasefire last year I said, in a small voice, that whereas everyone in the North was delighted the ceasefire had happened, the harsh reality was that when there was no violence to distract people, the fundamentals of discrimination existing in that society would become more obvious in workplaces and neighbourhoods where they were never seen before.  It is not surprising that it manifested itself this summer and to a lesser extent last summer.</P>
    <P>Discussions have commenced to ensure that marches next summer will take place on an agreed basis.  The social partners, including the communities, ICTU, farmers' groups and Government are in talks on this matter which I hope leads to something positive.</P>
    <P>I would like to look below the surface of the conflict and highlight some real issues which we have ignored for far too long. The fundamental problem in the North is that we are trying to resolve the issue at the wrong end in looking at the effect rather than the cause.  The only way to deal with the position in Northern Ireland is to consider the background which informs the attitudes and feelings of ordinary people.  We must consider the reality which exists for members of a divided community.  I refer to it as a &ldquo;divided community&rdquo; for reasons of brevity but I realise there are many facets to the Northern Irish community and society. However, I am discussing the freely understood sides in the conflict.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> The House will accept these generalisations for the sake of brevity because people on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland are born in different hospitals, live in different housing estates, attend different schools, play different games, practise different religions and are probably buried in different graveyards.  That is the essence of difference in the daily lives and deaths of Northern Irish people.  This difference is endemic because it is enshrined.  It is enabled and supported at every level and, in many cases, has a statutory base, which can be seen in the areas of housing, education, religion and, in particular, equality legislation. There are aspects of positive discrimination in equality legislation in Northern Ireland that favour one side or the other which would be considered outright discrimination in other countries. When the situation is considered in this way, is it extraordinary that there are difficulties in encouraging people from different backgrounds to agree an agenda and a process?  This cannot be the case and it would be extraordinary if such difficulties did not exist.</P>
    <P>I recognise that I am speaking in broad terms and using shorthand to make a general point.  However, we must ask how people in the South can help.  There seems to be an absolute partitionist attitude to Northern issues on the part of many of the most influential players in the establishment of the Republic.  For once, I pardon politicians in the main because 95 per cent of them do not belong to that category.  During the past ten to 15 years, politicians were the only people who have shown flexibility and a willingness to change.  There have been extraordinary changes in the policies of the main political parties in the South in that period.  They may have made mistakes but they have shown an openness towards change and movement.</P>
    <P>During the period of the ceasefire, however, there did not appear to be any signs of movement in the great areas of influence in the establishment in the Republic.  I refer to the area of education, <Col N="1738" /> in which I am involved, where the idea of exposing Northern Protestant Unionist teachers to our poor Catholic southern children was beyond the scope of many people's grasp.  The idea of allowing a Unionist from Ballymena who could not speak the Irish language to be part of the education system in the South was more than most people could grasp.  Therefore, there was no change on the part of those most closely associated with the idea of a united Ireland.  These people showed the least flexibility.  I tried to ensure flexibility and encouraged consideration of an all-Ireland education system but this created a threat to those with entrenched views.  There is a cultural partition in the South and the Border has enabled the growth of many groups and prejudices here which were exposed during the ceasefire.  Progress was not made as a result.</P>
    <P>There are too many people on this island, North and South, who act as if compromise always means that the other side must move towards their position.  I fully agree with Senator O'Sullivan's point that conflict resolution means that both sides must move towards each other.  This did not occur during the ceasefire.  Everyone must be asked about the compromises they are prepared to make for the sake of peace. That question was not answered during the period of the ceasefire.  Everyone knew what they wanted but no one stated what they were prepared to give, how much they would compromise or how much ground they would sacrifice in the interests of peace.  During the ceasefire, people were stronger in their certainties that they were right and that the other side should move towards them.</P>
    <P>Those who take the moral high ground as a matter of principle because they know they are right, and therefore refuse to compromise, are of no use to the peace process.  The word &ldquo;principle&rdquo; is the most abused and deteriorated word to enter discussions on Northern Ireland.  Earlier I used the word &ldquo;principle&rdquo; in its correct sense as meaning &ldquo;rules&rdquo;&mdash; the rules for conflict resolution, <Col N="1739" /> etc.  In discussing the relationships between North and South and the involvement of different groups, the distinction between principle and prejudice becomes more difficult to identify.  It is also becomes more difficult to see the point at which one blurs into the other. Eventually, the highly principled person, having stated and restated their position <i>ad nauseam,</i> begins to sound prejudiced.</P>
    <P>Principled prejudice seems to cloud sound judgment time and again.  In this process, the pragmatic are more likely to find a solution than the principled. Only the pragmatic can negotiate and engage with people who hold a different point of view with the objective of finding a resolution.  Those who begin from a principled position seem to be saying that they know why they are here, that they are right to be here and they are not going to move.  Once that position is made clear, it is a matter of principle not to move away from it.  I am fed up with people holding the high moral ground and lecturing everyone because they believe they are right.  If we assume everyone is right, where do we go from there?  States and armies can justify the taking of life but other people cannot. It is easy to hold different points of view.  The fact that people believe and know they are right does not mean they are right.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that just because people have a right to do something does not mean that they are right to do it.  That is where our problems begin and end.  A root and branch approach must be adopted to change society on this island, North and South. We must enshrine integration rather than division in our society at every level &mdash; housing, education, religion, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to listen to Senator O'Toole who made many interesting points with most of which I agree.  I will try to be brief because I am pessimistic about the situation in Northern Ireland at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> At the outset, the Leader asked what the IRA wants.  I do not know what it wants but, whether its members know what they want in terms of the bottom line, it cannot believe that the idea of bombing Ulster Unionists into a united Ireland is remotely on the agenda for the next millennium.  If the IRA still relies on the argument that Irish Nationalists have a right, in principle, to rule over Ulster Unionists, I, as an Irish Nationalist, reject that right just as I reject the right of any community in Ireland to rule over any other community against its will.  It seems there is no difference between those positions. That does not get us very far but there would be progress if either side were prepared to accept that principle.</P>
    <P>What can be done to alleviate the problems in the short-term?  During the debate on the Framework Document, the Taoiseach informed the Dáil that it was the beginning of work towards a wholly new form of expression of traditional aspirations, focusing on individuals and communities rather than on territory.  He went on to state that it was hoped that, by expressing &ldquo;aspiration&rdquo; in this new way, the two otherwise irreconcilable aspirations could be reconciled. What are people in the South doing to try to implement that aspiration? This seems to be kernel of the issue, I am aware that it can sound clichéd and trite but if one were able to &ldquo;operationalise&rdquo; that it would be a major contribution to solving this problem and similar problems around the world which shows us how difficult it would be to do something about it.  If we could, that is the direction we should take.  I wonder what we are doing.</P>
    <P>If it is the case, as Senator O'Kennedy said, that the Taoiseach said we have no interests of our own in Northern Ireland, that we have no interest beyond &ldquo;whatever they agree to, we agree to&rdquo; and if it is the case that the British Government takes the view that it has no interests in Northern Ireland beyond &ldquo;whatever they agree to, we agree to&rdquo;, then we are in a more difficult situation than if we were prepared to be objec-Irelan <Col N="1741" /> tively and explicitly more intrusive.  The two Governments have an interest beyond &ldquo;what they agree to, we agree to&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If that is the position of the Governments, what incentive is there for any of the extremes, although on one side the extreme is mainline, to come to an agreement?  Why should the Unionists enter negotiations which they can only expect mean concessions of some sort? What is the incentive for them to negotiate if that is what is at the end?  In that context the only <i>quid pro quo</i> would be peace, but if they are promised peace in advance as a condition of going into negotiations, what is the incentive for meaningful negotiation?  This is a catch 22 and I have great sympathy for anybody trying to resolve it.  Perhaps the Government has made statements of which, in the welter of statements, it can be easy to overlook the details.  If there is a way of &ldquo;operationalising&rdquo; the statement by the Taoiseach on the framework document that is the course to take.</P>
    <P>I was at the last meeting of the British-Irish interparliamentary body and it was a sad occasion because Sir Patrick Mayhew &mdash; who, as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, has the most thankless task in Europe this side of Bosnia &mdash; appeared to have crumbled under the moral defeat of Drumcree. That is what is was for anyone who wants to uphold law and order.  He kept referring to the statement by Sir Hugh Annesley, indeed almost repeating it.  I respect the difficulties Sir Hugh Annesley confronted but his statement was to the effect that if there is one golden public order rule it is that a number of people, if there are enough of them, can in the short term overrun a normal policing operation.  Sir Patrick Mayhew kept repeating that.  It sounded to me like an invitation to any thug in Northern Ireland, on any side, to mobilise enough bodies and the police will give way because it is not prepared to confront them.</P>
    <P>Sir Hugh Annesley made the analogy with the burning of the British Embassy <Col N="1742" /> and with French riots but they were false analogies.  If that is the condition into which the best minds in Northern Ireland have lowered themselves in terms of analogies, we are at a very low ebb in trying to get to grips with the real problem.  I wish the Tánaiste well in his attempts to get to grips with the problem but judging by these documents we are at as low an ebb as we have ever been in terms of comprehending the radical situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a statement to the Seanad on the current situation in Northern Ireland.  As Members of the Oireachtas it is our privilege and our duty to speak for the people of Ireland. It is important for us to do so, especially at this time of great worry and perplexity in relation to Northern Ireland.  The bright hopes we cherished so recently that we were leaving behind the spectre of political violence are greatly diminished and may be quenched entirely. We must speak out on behalf of all our people to condemn the wanton acts of violence which are the primary cause of the sense of betrayal and despair which is now so widespread.  It is also important to use our democratic fora to convey a sense of where the Government stands and what our policy will be in the difficult choices with which we may be faced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Lisburn bombs and the other atrocities, or attempted atrocities, from Canary Wharf onwards, it is right and necessary to express the sense of national disgust and betrayal uppermost in our minds.  We must ensure our moral senses are never blunted by the dreadful familiarity of atrocity.  We must be careful to call right and wrong by their proper names.  We extend the deepest sympathy to the family of Warrant Officer Bradwell and to those injured in the attack.  To them and to all other victims of violence, we want to say that we abhor the terrible suffering visited on them.  We repudiate all attempts to justify it.  We repudiate particularly <Col N="1743" /> any grotesque claim that it is done in the name of Ireland.  The Ireland which is supposed to need such bloody offerings exists only in the warp of some closed minds.  It has nothing to do with the Ireland we are trying to build and offers it only misery and unending harm.</P>
    <P>I could spend much time here dissecting the contradictions and absurdity of the present IRA campaign of violence but so many others, including the Taoiseach the Opposition Leaders, have done this so cogently in recent days that there is little new to add.  Just as surely as violence destroys lives and livelihoods, it poisons the ground on which a political settlement must be built.  It is important that democratic representatives continue to be loud and clear in their condemnation.  In this respect these Seanad statements are particularly valuable.</P>
    <P>At the same time condemnation must not be made a substitute for policy.  It is particularly important at a time when anger and despair can be uppermost in the public mind that the Governments should steer a steady course.  That is right in itself.  It is also the most telling resistance which can be offered to those who seek to dictate the political agenda through murder, bombs and bullets.</P>
    <P>There are diverse views in this country on the origins and nature of the conflict in Northern Ireland and how precisely it should be resolved.  However, on certain matters the overwhelming majority of the Irish people and their democratic representatives in both Houses stand together in unanimity. The keystone of that consensus is peace. We wish to live together in peace, to foster social and economic growth in peace, to talk through and settle our differences in peace and to enjoy and respect our different traditions in peace. No Government policy is conceivable in Ireland which did not seek to serve as fully and consistently as possible that fundamental commitment.</P>
    <P>In doing so we must of course first maintain our strong defences against all those who would attempt to draw us <Col N="1744" /> down the violent path.  The first duty of a democratic state is to protect its citizens. For any group to take it upon themselves to use violence in our name is an attack not just on the innocent victims of each atrocity but on the lifetimes of work of millions of Irish men and women who have together built our society.  The Garda Síochána and the Army are the instruments of the law and the preservers of the peace.</P>
    <P>Our security forces, like those in Northern Ireland and in Britain, with whom they co-operate so closely, have relentlessly pursued the men of violence and their arms for over 25 years.  They have had substantial successes in containing and countering the threat of terrorism, not least this year.  The Clonaslee bomb factory was only the most spectacular and important of several excellent pieces of work.  As the Minister for Justice reminded the Dáil last week, since August 1994 the Garda has recovered 600 illegally held firearms, 30,000 rounds of ammunition and 60 kilogrammes of semtex.  The Garda Síochána &mdash; one of whom, Garda McCabe, made the ultimate sacrifice earlier this year &mdash; will continue to hunt down and punish the perpetrators of violence.</P>
    <P>The work of peace, however, goes beyond the necessary defence of democratic institutions and values against overt or covert attack.  Security measures alone will not eradicate the cancer of violence used for political ends.  There is also a need to ensure, as far as humanly possible, that our political systems clearly offer the means to discuss and to manage the political problems or tensions which provide the soil where a culture of violence can take root.  That is why we have sought to achieve a lasting and comprehensive political settlement and accommodation.</P>
    <P>One could spend a lifetime arguing the rights and wrongs of history.  What is indisputable is they have left Northern Ireland as a political entity suffering from a fundamental lack of political consensus.  That is a source of political <Col N="1745" /> and social instability which has blighted so many aspects of life in Northern Ireland.  It has also been very costly for this jurisdiction, which can never be insulated from its effect.  When Unionist leaders complain of interference they should first ask themselves honestly whether any Irish Government, whatever its ideological hue, could ever be truly indifferent to bad political stewardship and confrontation in Northern Ireland when the repercussions for us are so direct and costly.  Rather than construing our concerns as a threat, they should understand that our natural and unmistakable interest in peace and stability is a strong and obvious foundation for a new partnership.</P>
    <P>The parameters of a viable and fair accommodation of the Northern Ireland conflict have been elaborated in a long and difficult process of trial and error between the Irish and British democracies. They have been refined in a series of agreements and documents which enjoy, broadly speaking, bipartisan support in both Parliaments and are, therefore, reliable pointers to future policy. These parameters include, conspicuously, the total rejection of violence and of any attempt to mix politics and violence. They aim for the broadest possible application of the principle of consent. No one now seriously entertains the notion that you can bomb nearly 1 million Unionists into a united Ireland.  It is obvious that one of the main casualties of IRA bombs has been the traditional ideology of a united Ireland itself.  The principle of consent in Ireland is a coin with two sides.  Unionist failure to acknowledge its relevance to Nationalists in Northern Ireland is one of the strongest barriers in the way of a new political dispensation where the Unionist position would be protected by the agreement of all.</P>
    <P>It is broad common ground also that a political solution must address all the key relationships, and ensure parity of esteem and just and equal treatment for the identities and aspirations of both traditions and both communities. Unionists cannot be marginalised in <Col N="1746" /> their own country and neither can Nationalists.  Equality and mutual respect are not just moral ideals, they are in practical terms the only ground on which the two communities can reach a stable equilibrium.</P>
    <P>There is widespread agreement also that the Stormont talks have, potentially at least, all the ingredients necessary for meaningful negotiations.  They are inclusive in intent and could become so in practice, subject only to decisions which lie in the hands of the republican movement itself.  They address all strands.  They have a comprehensive agenda, with all issues unquestionably on the table.  They have distinguished, expert and very patient chairmanship. They can be the vehicle for a meaningful accommodation if the political will to reach it is there all round.</P>
    <P>Progress in the talks has been excruciatingly slow.  Naturally, we welcome as a positive step the agreement which has now been reached on the agenda for the remainder of the opening plenary.  We hope all participants will use it briskly to get down as quickly as possible to the core purpose of the talks; building new political relationships in place of those which have failed.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that the slow progress was somehow due to the Governments dragging their feet, or standing around waiting for Sinn Féin to come in.  Nothing could be further from the truth as all the participants know. We do indeed want to see an inclusive process in place.  It would be very strange to want otherwise or to view as anything other than a regrettable necessity the absence of representatives elected by a fairly sizeable constituency. It would be wrong to assume that, because the IRA has blocked the door to Sinn Féin, the constituency has thereby ceased to exist or can simply be ignored to the extent of being totally insignificant.</P>
    <P>The stability of a kind which came from the politics of domination is no longer possible.  The stability of the future, which we all want to see, will inevitably come from the politics of <Col N="1747" /> inclusion by whatever route it is ultimately achieved.  That is why we have sought to maintain a consistent and careful balance on the issue of Sinn Féin participation.  We are democrats and have a duty to encourage all those who seek a democratic mandate and commit themselves exclusively to the political path.  We must give the necessary encouragement and support to those who are genuinely seeking a transition from violence to peace.</P>
    <P>At the same time we equally have a duty to make sure that this encouragement does not compromise our fundamental principles or is viewed as weakness or vacillation in the face of terror. It is not easy to maintain that careful balance without being attacked for being either soft on terrorism or blind to the potential of the peace process. Nevertheless, I believe this consistent balance is right and should be maintained.</P>
    <P>From the start it has been made clear to Sinn Féin, as to the loyalists, that dialogue with it and its inclusion in the negotiations depends on its commitment to peaceful and democratic means. The ending of the IRA ceasefire in February led immediately to the end of political-level contact with Sinn Féin, and it is the reason it has remained outside the talks.  Likewise, while Sinn Féin's entry to negotiations continues to depend on an unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire, once inside it would be subject to the same disciplines as all other participants. It would have to make clear its total and absolute commitment to the Mitchell principles of democracy and non-violence, including the renunciation of the use of force, or threats of force, to influence the course or the outcome of all-party negotiations.</P>
    <P>We would expect it to work constructively and in good faith to secure the implementation of all aspects of the report of the international body in the context of an inclusive and dynamic process in which mutual trust and confidence are built as progress is made on the issues of concern to all participants. <Col N="1748" /> We have sought to ensure a bridge for Sinn Féin out of the wilderness of its self-imposed isolation and into the democratic arena.  To date the IRA has not allowed it to cross that bridge.  It is not clear if the IRA ever will, but it remains there for Sinn Féin.  We still hope it will cross that bridge and will do so soon before the spiral of violence becomes irreversible.  If and when it does cross it, and has made it clear that it will not return to the other side, it will be treated like everyone else.  It will have no more influence than that to which its support and the force of its arguments entitle it, and also no less.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt, just as the consistent observance of the ceasefire has enhanced the credibility and standing of the loyalist parties, the collapse of the IRA ceasefire was an enormous blow to the credibility of the Sinn Féin leadership. The credibility gap which has to be bridged has widened with each sucessive atrocity.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the futility of violence stands out in sharper relief than ever before.  The logic of a wholehearted commitment to the political path as the only way forward is cogent as never before.  In our anger or despair we must not gratuitously slam any door.  Wiser counsels must one day prevail and it would be foolish to foreclose the capacity of our democratic system as a whole to respond wisely in turn.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we must not treat entry to negotiations as a kind of certificate of approval to be bestowed only on the like minded.  Political dialogue and negotiations should more accurately be seen as a duty on all political leaders with any contribution to make.  Disqualification should, therefore, relate to the minimum that is required to protect the political basis and fairness of the negotiating process as a level and strictly democratic playing field for all participants.  In the Downing Street declaration and in the February communiqué the two Governments set out that minimum threshold.  We should certainly not lower it and neither should <Col N="1749" /> we raise it to a new and unrealistic height.</P>
    <P>While we are clear on our preference for a fully inclusive process, we are determined also to exploit to the full whatever option for political dialogue is available to us.  The two Governments carry a heavy burden of responsibility in leading the process and in demonstrating that there is reason for hope even in the darkest days.  We are in constant contact at all levels, in particular in an intensive and practical fashion at the Stormont talks.</P>
    <P>At all stages we have taken initiatives to move the debate forward and to offer the parties ways out of the very great difficulties in which we find ourselves. We will continue to devote all our energies to making the political negotiations work.  Even before the negotiations started we knew they were not going to be smooth or straightforward.  As the Taoiseach has rightly stated, the negotiations are not about fine tuning aspects of public administration, they are about nothing less than achieving a settlement which can win the adherence and consent of two communities which have traditionally seen their identities as diametrically opposed to one another and their aspirations as irreconcilable.</P>
    <P>In any context this would be a profoundly difficult task, even though I remain convinced that the two Governments have succeeded in defining the principles for, and sketching a possible outline of, an honourable and balanced agreement.  Moreover, the poisonous legacies of violence, sectarianism and injustice continue to wreak their havoc and to infect fresh generations.</P>
    <P>Many of us expressed the hope that the shocking events of the summer would have forced a reappraisal on all sides of what was at stake, and of the risks of political failure.  While there has been some evidence of this, largely among those whose commitment to peace and agreement was already clear, a depressing amount of political energy has been wasted on the selective and distorted elaboration of fresh mythologies <Col N="1750" /> and the restocking of already ample inventories of historic recrimination.</P>
    <P>Much of the current difficulties in the process derive from the vexed question of decommissioning.  I have put on record on many occasions in this House and elsewhere exactly where I and the Government stand on this matter.  I am aware of, and grateful for, the widespread support which exists for that stand throughout this House and more widely.  Nevertheless, our views continue to be misinterpreted and misunderstood. To suggest that this is a complex question which, in practice, will be only resolved voluntarily and by agreement is to lay oneself open to the charge of being some kind of IRA fellow traveller or apologist.  Still worse, it is to invite the accusation that one is indifferent to the terrible sufferings caused by illegally held weapons and explosives, above all in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let me seek, once again, to set the record straight in this House.  First of all, if it were within my power or, I am sure, that of any Members of this House, every item in the paramilitary arsenals, down to the last bullet, would be destroyed tomorrow, if we could do it. This generation has definitively rejected the use of violence for any political purpose whatsoever and repudiates and disowns the perpetrators.</P>
    <P>Secondly, while as I emphasised earlier, our security forces continue to work for the total disarmament of all paramilitaries, we must not confuse that continuing security commitment with the essentially political goal of voluntary decommissioning by those holding illegal weapons.  As is clear from the experience of countries which are substantially less democratic and open than ours, security measures alone, no matter how severe, are simply incapable of eradicating violence which, as is the case in Northern Ireland, has deep roots in our history and is intimately linked with fundamental disagreements.  Only an approach based on dialogue and persuasion offers the hope of a lasting accommodation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> Full decommissioning in the sense of the Mitchell report will only come about on a voluntary basis.  This logically and necessarily requires the co-operation of those actually holding the weapons. Decommissioning will not come about by making peremptory demands upon the paramilitaries, irrespective of the political context.  Any peremptory approach belongs inevitably to the security dimension.</P>
    <P>The decommissioning question has bedevilled the political atmosphere for 18 months and for a long time it looked as if the two divergent sets of strongly held opinions might be irreconcilable. However, the international body established by the Governments showed great skill and balance in devising a road map which showed us the way forward.</P>
    <P>From the start the Irish Government has supported its analysis and recommendations. Before the talks began in June we, together with the British Government, committed ourselves to an approach whereby all participants in the negotiations should work constructively and in good faith to implement all aspects of the report.  That remains our approach now.  It is the only realistic approach to achieving the goal, and preventing the decommissioning issue wrecking the political talks.  Senator Mitchell and his colleagues made it quite clear that decommissioning would only happen in the context of political agreement.  Progress on decommissioning and political progress would be mutually reinforcing.  In our communiqué of 28 February, the two Governments, borrowing the language of the report, identified that confidence building at the start of negotiations would, in addition to commitment to the Mitchell principles and an address to the proposals on decommissioning, I quote&mdash;</P>
    <P>require that the parties have reassurance that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiations is genuinely being offered to address <Col N="1752" /> the legitimate concerns of their traditions and the need for new political arrangements with which all can identify.</P>
    <P>The international body made clear that agreement on practical decommissioning arrangements based on the principles set out in the report, required complex discussions of a technical nature in which all concerned with the issue would have to take part.  In addition, decommissioning would happen only on a mutual basis, that is, through the involvement of both sets of paramilitaries. That mutuality will plainly only be possible if all parties are present at the negotiations.  Actual decommissioning will only happen, therefore, as a result of intensive discussions running alongside political negotiations in which both Sinn Féin and the two loyalist parties are full participants.  It will be the fruit of an inclusive peace process or it will not happen at all.</P>
    <P>The proposal published a fortnight ago by the two Governments reiterated our commitment to work with all other participants in the negotiations to implement all aspects of the international body's report.  We suggested that a committee be established to work to secure that goal, operating in parallel with the substantive political negotiations. As a demonstration of our good faith and of our determination to ensure that there would be no blockages on our part, both Governments have said that they would introduce enabling decommissioning legislation in their respective Parliaments so that, as progress is made on political issues, the legislative framework would be enacted by Christmas.  We have committed ourselves to publish that proposed legislation as soon as possible.  The Irish Government would also make available a range of expert personnel, including independent experts of international standing whom we would envisage playing an appropriate part in the work of a verification commission when it is established.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1753" /> We are continuing to work intensively with the other participants in the negotiations to find a way forward which would offer a realistic chance of progress on this issue and would not stimulate either dangerous anxieties or unrealistic hopes.  The very real emotional force, as well as the practical importance of the decommissioning question, has been underscored by the Lisburn bombs.  There is, understandably, a profound reluctance to come face-to-face with those who have over the years excused or supported the great hurts inflicted upon the Unionist people in an effort to coerce them. There is also a continuing anxiety the threat of violence might be used alongside negotiations, or by die hard elements, even after the achievement of agreement.  I do not for a moment say that these fears are unreal, but when examined they can surely be put in perspective. It would be defeatist and unwise to exploit them, or rely on them, to justify a refusal to negotiate.  To risk the shipwreck of the negotiations on the rock of decommissioning would seem to confirm the primacy of the military over the political and to demonstrate the futility of dialogue and an abdication of politics.  To insist on an approach to decommissioning which disregards the wisdom of the international body's report would, in essence, guarantee that decommissioning would never happen.</P>
    <P>Unionists should have confidence in the continued commitment of the security forces on both sides of the Border as well as in their own continuing determination not to be intimidated.  They should have confidence in the commitment of the two Governments and of all the other parties now in the negotiations to the Mitchell principles, which include a firm requirement that the use, or threat, of force to influence the course or outcome of the negotiations be renounced.  They should have confidence in the legislative basis for the negotiations and the rules of procedure which between them offer ample safeguards. The principle of sufficient consensus and the commitment by both <Col N="1754" /> Governments to put the outcome of negotiations to referendum North and South are cumulative guarantees that no unacceptable blueprint will be forced upon them.</P>
    <P>Not least, they should have confidence in the overwhelming Nationalist commitment to the principle that there can be no change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland without the consent of a majority.  That commitment has in recent years transformed the Irish Government's approach to Northern Ireland and means that we have no higher priority than the achievement of genuine agreement among the people of Northern Ireland and reconciliation between North and South.  It also means that Northern Nationalists too are fully aware of the parameters which will frame a settlement.  Unionists, in sum, ought to draw confidence from the position in which they start negotiations.  Of course, it would be wrong and pointless to assure them that reaching agreement will not involve hard choices on their part &mdash; just as it would be wrong and pointless to offer such assurances to Nationalists and republicans.</P>
    <P>The shared principles on which the British and Irish Governments have agreed, and which command broad support in both jurisdictions, imply that serious and meaningful change within Northern Ireland, and in its wider relationships, is necessary if, for the first time, its institutions are to reflect and accommodate the diverse identities and aspirations of its two communities. Without that there could be no real stability.  I offer that assessment, not in pursuit of any hidden agenda but in recognition of the needs and ambitions of the Nationalist community within Northern Ireland.  But if Unionists could themselves, as a community, make that imaginative leap and approach the negotiations in that spirit, then I am certain they would emerge from them in a position, though different, that had been fundamentally strengthened, not weakened, through a fresh partnership with their Nationalist neighbours.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1755" /> We all need to ask ourselves which is better, the sterile certainty of political failure and the vacuum it would create or the constructive adventure of political negotiation which offers the hope of a better future for all.  The Irish Government, for its part, stands firmly on the side of engagement and dialogue.  It is well past the time that, together, we seized the opportunity which still exists and which we can still shape to our common benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in this House for as long as this problem has existed in Northern Ireland.  I am as wise today as I was 27 years ago.  It is one saga after another and one crisis after another.  It is easy to point a finger but very difficult to find an answer to this problem.  It is on the record that, after the British Government had agreed that the Tánaiste and the people of southern Ireland had a part to play and that we could only solve the problems of Northern Ireland together, David Trimble, a man with whom we had hoped to do business, told the Tánaiste he would only meet him when it suited him and that he would only discuss affairs which did not pertain to Northern Ireland.  I was disappointed that the Tánaiste did not tell Mr. Trimble where he stood and that he had the support of the entire nation in negotiating the problems pertaining to Northern Ireland.  I wanted the opportunity to say that before he left the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no quick solution to the problem.  I watched a television programme last night which gave us the history of Mr. Trimble and his involvement in the paramilitaries.  Anybody who saw that programme will realise we face a formidable task if we are ever to reach an understanding because when an agreement is reached and is about to be implemented, the ground will shift and David Trimble will look for a new excuse.  This is so evident now that some people in his own party have decided that they can no longer stay in the party. I do not have high hopes that we will <Col N="1756" /> ever reach an understanding with David Trimble.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the coin, I was one of those who went to Pittsburgh last week in the hope of generating investment in the North of Ireland and in the southern Border counties.  I need not tell this House the effect the bomb in Lisburn has on that investment conference. It was a serious blow.  Many Americans looking at the possibility of investing money in Ireland were shattered to see that the peace, once again, was gone thanks to the Provisional IRA, thanks to the stupidity of those people who believed they were contributing to the Irish cause.</P>
    <P>They only gave John Major and the Conservative Party something to talk about at their party conference, which is usually a pretty flat affair.  From a paramilitary point of view, it was a political disaster not only for the paramilitaries but for the entire country.  It was sheer, utter stupidity.  It dealt a destructive blow to the conference in Pittsburgh which had been held to attract investment to the north-west of Ireland, including the six southern Border counties. I was devastated; I could hardly believe it could happen at such a time. One must wonder who caused the explosion and damaged the prospect of bringing much needed jobs to the north of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Over the past 27 years there have been many opportunities and aspirations for reaching a settlement in Northern Ireland.  No county has suffered more than mine from the Troubles.  The approximate cost of security for this State is £1 million per day.  What could we do with £1 million a day in providing houses, jobs and other improvements?  Britain is pumping £11 million per day into sustaining Northern Ireland.  Britain is under enough financial pressure at present to count the cost of Northern Ireland.  The IRA is stupid. Britain would press for and accept a settlement in Northern Ireland if the IRA would co-operate and be reasonable. The IRA must see that it will never put the British out of Northern <Col N="1757" /> Ireland with the gun and the bomb.  All they will do is create more crises, more barbed wire, more checkpoints and make it impossible for the people in Northern Ireland to survive.</P>
    <P>We have had 18 months in which the tourism industry has revived and flourished in my county.  It behoves this Government and the Tánaiste who have a communication with the IRA to use it, even if that contact is not as good as that of Deputy Albert Reynolds.  The IRA seem to have no understanding or wisdom. The Taoiseach, Tánaiste and the Government must tell the IRA there is a settlement on the cards and that it is about time the IRA settled this long saga.  There is no way a settlement can ever be reached until there is decisive action by the IRA to give it a chance. More than a year is involved: the history of the country and the future of the people of Northern Ireland, who will not disappear, are at stake.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and the Taoiseach must have serious consultations, not arms-length negotiations, with the IRA.  It is not so long since they refused to meet the IRA and perhaps there were good grounds for that decision.  Nevertheless, the Irish Government must say loudly and clearly to the IRA, Gerry Adams and Sinn Féin that there will never be peace or a settlement in Northern Ireland until they stop the violence and give peace a chance.  It is ironic that at every opportunity in Northern Ireland we see them appearing with placards carrying the slogans &ldquo;We support peace&rdquo; or &ldquo;Give peace a chance&rdquo;.  I do not understand what they mean.</P>
    <P>My county has suffered greatly, as have the other five Border counties. Nobody can calculate the price we have paid in terms of lack of development during the past 27 years.  We are competing on a serious level with the industrialists of Northern Ireland, whose deprivations of the past 25 years have been paid for by the British Government. However, we are not competing on a level playing pitch.  Nobody in their senses could set up a business in the six southern Border companies and compete <Col N="1758" /> against the grants available over the Border.  Eighty per cent grants and other funding being pumped into the North makes it unattractive for an industrialist to consider locating in the six southern Border counties.</P>
    <P>In one week we have lost two industries. We lost a shirt company which was providing employment in Newtown Cunningham.  It has moved to a new factory in the North because 50 or 60 per cent grants make it attractive to do so. Not a cold farthing is available here, despite the number of agencies that have been established.  I listened to Deputy Nealon's contribution last night in the Lower House.  He rightly pointed out that we have too many agencies which are confused about their tasks.</P>
    <P>I attended the formal opening by EU Commissioner Pádraig Flynn of the peace and reconciliation fund office in Monaghan.  Everybody acknowledged the value of the office being established in Monaghan.  I invited the fund's representative with responsibility for Donegal, Mr. Paul Skinner, to Donegal. He met six community groups.  He listened to their contributions and when they finished he told them that the peace and reconciliation fund could not spend money on bricks and mortar in the South.  I only had to wait one week to learn that a new advance factory costing £800,000 was built in Strabane with funds from the peace and reconciliation fund.  My contribution to this debate might not be relevant or important but why was money from the peace and reconciliation fund refused for a shirt factory in Newtown Cunningham &mdash; the proprietor of the factory is Doug Irwin &mdash; while money was provided across the bridge in Strabane?  The Minister must give me an answer.  I will pass it to the people in Donegal who do not understand how that can happen.</P>
    <P>It is part of a pattern.  It is now unattractive to invest south of the Border. Not one pound is available for a small tourism project in the South.  We have heard about the schemes to save the west from the bottom up and everyday a new organisation is launched.  One <Col N="1759" /> does not know where one stands. Deputy Nealon correctly told the Lower House that the proliferation of new agencies is organised confusion.  One does not know where to advise somebody to go, one does not know what application form to seek.  This is the legacy of the troubles that have been supported by the IRA; this is the price we must pay.  The IRA must be told as much in straight language by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste because one gets the impression that the IRA is operating in a vacuum and do not know what they are costing the taxpayer and those who are hoping to build a future for themselves in Ireland.  This is a serious situation.</P>
    <P>It saddens me to say that I do not have confidence that a settlement will be reached.  We are only tinkering with the problem.  There is no real drive by the Government to come to grips with it.  I am not waving a political flag but it was a different ball game when Deputy Reynolds was in charge.  We expected something to happen.  Sadly, today I expect nothing to happen.</P>
    <P>The David Trimbles and Gerry Adamses are playing politics and dancing to a different tune.  We are told that nothing will happen until after the British general election.  I am not confident that the issue will be resolved under the present regime.  There is no genuine attempt to talk sense into the IRA.  If the IRA said tomorrow &ldquo;there is a ceasefire; we will give negotiations a fair chance&rdquo;, those people who prevent a settlement being reached will have to be seen to be out of court.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell the Government it is time it took this matter seriously? Those of us who live in or near the Six Counties are paying a very high price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Tánaiste on the plain language and clear thinking in this speech.  He has my support.</P>
      <P>It is useless to name call.  I agree with what the Taoiseach said, but that should be the end of the name calling as far as the IRA and Sinn Féin are concerned. When you call them monsters you sing their song.  They have been called this for 25 years and know how to respond. They should be engaged in dialogue much more publicly.  Although they are not in the talks that should not stop them from engaging in some form of limited dialogue in order to let the other side see how they are thinking.</P>
      <P>At the first press conference of the Peace Train organisation I did not call them names but accorded them the honour of regarding them as an army.  I asked them for military answers to questions such as the reason for bombing the train line.  We did not receive an answer but at least we showed they did not have one.</P>
      <P>We should stop watching the broth bubbling and go to the door of the kitchen.  We must look at the background to this.  The Northern Ireland problem has been overestimated in the eyes of the world.  I have been to many funerals of victims of loyalist and republican assassins and do not underestimate the hurt that has been caused but these troubles began about housing.  It was cranked up by the violent loyalist reaction to perfectly reasonable demands from the Catholic population.  I get the impression that with every concession given and the righting of one wrong after another, the Nationalist side puts on the spectacles you get in an opticians to which you can add ever stronger lenses. The result is that problems which were overlooked 25 years ago are now major issues.  I will not mention any one in particular but they are there for all to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards trying to talk constructively to the republican sector, it seems the IRA is confused to the point where it and its spokesmen in Sinn Féin are out of kilter.  Usually their language is terse and tight but in their public statelengt <Col N="1761" /> ment after the bombing of the army barracks in Lisburn, they actually apologised for civilian injuries.  However, in cases such as Teebane, civilians who worked in army camps were a particularly juicy target for them.  There is evidence that they need help and we should ask them, for example, to dwell more on the 250,000 Roman Catholics who want to stay in the United Kingdom.  These people are never mentioned. They cannot say they want to remain in the UK.  Monsignor Faul is almost the only man on that side of the argument who acknowledges this.  We should ask the IRA and Sinn Féin to talk about these Catholics and allow them into the equation.</P>
    <P>All parties should remember disadvantaged Catholics.  They support Sinn Féin because they believe that party is the only one which can protect them. That is why we should engage Sinn Féin in dialogue even though it is outside the talks.  I am not talking about television dialogue which is pathetic.  I have hardly ever seen a satisfactory television confrontation with Sinn Féin except the one, said he modestly, where I met a republican at a racecourse and dealt with him in a couple of minutes.</P>
    <P>We should understand that the IRA, in safe areas of the North, is cranking up the fighting mood.  The people in Crossmaglen are in no danger of being shot by loyalist assassins.  There is pressure from these safe IRA areas to keep the fighting going.  I do not think that the IRA in north Belfast, for example, is as keen to carry on the fight and we should remember this.</P>
    <P>We should talk to Sinn Féin about the use of the Irish language as a political weapon.  I support the Taoiseach on this issue.  It alienates Protestants further.</P>
    <P>The IRA and Sinn Féin cannot dodge the issue of consent any longer.  They were left looking very lonely and vulnerable at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation when they would not go along with it.</P>
    <P>The present IRA strategy leads to mutual molestation &mdash; too many young <Col N="1762" /> lives are lost.  At some forum Sinn Féin should be invited to consider options other than talks backed by brute force. They should, for example, consider models other than a unitary island state. Despite the denial by Protestants that they are Irish, any North/South referendum following talks agreement should be deemed to be joint self determination by one nation expressed in two polls.  Protestants should be deemed to be Irish by Sinn Féin, their denial of their Irishness is largely Sinn Féin's fault.</P>
    <P>We should welcome the UUP's initiative in helping the agreed agenda and for placing decommissioning further down that agenda.  However, the DUP and UUP should remember they do not just represent the Orange Order.  I am told there are 10,000 people in the Order although I think this is an exaggeration.  That leaves 890,000 people who are not in it.  I wrote an article in <i>The Belfast Telegraph</i> in which I said that we were not pleased with the way in which we, the vast majority of Protestants, were portrayed to the world as a consequence of Drumcree. The tourism industry was left in ruins and it should go on record that the support I received from the non-Orange sector of the population was fabulous. The news editor of <i>The Belfast Telegraph</i> rang me to emphasise this.</P>
    <P>I say to Mr. Trimble and Mr. Paisley that by ignoring the public relations aspect of what they are doing they throw away the loyalist ceasefire gains for the sake of winning a 17th century faction fight.  They choose not to understand the major principle of politics that you must be not only right but seen to be right.  The last six months have seen Unionism at its lowest since the burning of Bombay Street.</P>
    <P>The Republic has not been free of guilt.  Arising from the Supreme Court case taken by the McGimpsey brothers, I was bitterly disappointed that the Republic chose to use Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution as a bargaining point.  Since I know that the vast <Col N="1763" /> majority of the people in the Republic were dismayed to learn that this was a territorial demand &mdash; they regard it as an aspiration &mdash; it would have seemed reasonable for a new wording to be put to the people of the Republic indicating that the nation contains two major religious and political traditions and it is the nation so described that decides how the island of Ireland is to be governed. That would have done enormous good. There is a growing realisation among Government agencies that Catholic areas do not have a monopoly on deprivation.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote from a paper on community development in Protestant areas in Londonderry.  One speaker said:</P>
    <P>There is a growing realisation and recognition among Government agencies and major funders that Catholic areas do not have a monopoly on multiple deprivation and disadvantage. The apathy within the Protestant community has been changing to an anger that their areas have been neglected by Government Departments, funding bodies and even some of their own Unionist representatives. Alongside the anger, there has been a growing sense of Protestant alienation which, in many ways, sees itself in retreat on a number of fronts: social, political, economical and cultural.</P>
    <P>The main drive behind my contribution today is that we should bear in mind those who have been victims throughout the troubles.  When the talks develop, the Republic in concert with the other bodies acting as referees or brokers, should always bear in mind that the Protestant perception is if the British leave this island, nobody outside Ireland will give a monkeys about what happens to Protestants.  If the British ever left this island, for whatever reason, Protestant rights could be trampled on, scrapped, withered away or suffer the benign fate of the mixed marriage laws.  There would not be any media coverage because Britain would <Col N="1764" /> no longer be involved.  The combination of Britain and an ancient religious war brought the media there over in the first place.  That Protestant fear should always be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, to the House. One of the most important parts of this debate was the Tánaiste's speech, particularly when it is read in the context of the volatility of the loyalist ceasefire after the last number of weeks. He stated &ldquo;This generation has definitely rejected the use of violence for any political purpose whatsoever and repudiates and disowns the perpetrators&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The message should go from this House this afternoon to the Unionist and loyalist communities that this State will do everything in its power to track down illegal weaponry and members of illegal organisations.  I congratulate, in the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, the Garda Síochána on its great successes over the last number of months in tracking down illegal weaponry.  This State will never stand over any fudging of the issue of political violence.  That was the kernel of what the Tánaiste said this afternoon.</P>
      <P>The only way to solve this problem is, as we have all said, through all party talks.  The talks process is the only way forward.  The present process has a much better chance of success than that of 1991.  Why?  For the first time the vast majority of participants are around the same table.  The legitimate concerns of all sides are being expressed at the same time.  The three strands are being taken together, as compared to 1991 when they were separated.  At last, we now have a process that may do something for the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I encourage the republican movement to follow the example of the late President de Valera and Seán MacBride. There have been men of courage in every generation since this State was founded who moved from the military route to the constitutional one.  When Fianna Fáil accepted its seats in the <Col N="1765" /> Oireachtas in 1927 and when the late President de Valera formed the first Fianna Fáil Government in 1932, that party recognised and legitimised this State and, thereby, moved from the military route.  The same can be said of Clann na Poblachta in the 1940s and the great courage shown by people such as Seán MacBride in moving away from the IRA military route to the constitutional one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the responsibility of this generation of republican leaders to follow the constitutional route.  As Senator McAughtry said, that route must be embedded in the principle of consent.  The Tánaiste rightly said that the principle of consent has two sides.  It is not just about the Unionists being able to veto every agreement which comes from the talks process &mdash; it is also about Nationalists having their concerns and views fully legitimised in whatever agreement comes from that talks process.</P>
      <P>I say to the republicans that the only way forward is through talks and the constitutional route can achieve much of what they and their supporters want. The SDLP achieved more for the Nationalist people in one day than 25 or 26 years of violence by the IRA and Sinn Féin.  Let them follow that constitutional route because it is the only one which can succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning asked what the IRA actually want.  None of us know the answer to that question.  However, it will not be gained from the &ldquo;Brits out&rdquo; slogans daubed on the walls of republican areas.  The British will not be leaving Ireland.  We do not want them to leave because the British experience is part of Ireland.  Republicans must be realistic about what they want to achieve if a ceasefire is called.  If they are not going to be realistic, let us not have a second ceasefire because an airy fairy fantasy world was created after the last IRA ceasefire.  I ask them to seriously consider <Col N="1766" /> what they want to achieve because everyone has to compromise in this process. The present talks process in Belfast is the only way we can begin to deal with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>When I called with other Senators for this debate last week, I said I felt this was &ldquo;make your mind up time&rdquo; for Gerry Adams.  I believe this to be true for there is no doubt in my mind that we are now at a critical juncture in terms of political developments, both within the North and between the two parts of the island.</P>
      <P>By exploding bombs at the Thiepval army base, the IRA has shown a cynical contempt for all the people of this island.  In placing the second of the two bombs in hospital grounds to which the injured were being ferried and where civilians were particularly exposed, it has violated the most basic conventions of humanity to which it so frequently and hypocritically makes appeal itself.  If it is a war, as it claims, it has certainly ensured it is a dirty one.</P>
      <P>It is clearly unconcerned that its actions may lead to a vicious retaliation against civilian members of its own community and is quite content to use them as Catholic cannon fodder in its campaign to usurp the democratic process. It is also clear from its actions that it will never regard the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland as fully human and, therefore, deserving the same regard for their civil and human rights as others until they make the miraculous conversion to nationalism, to which, for some obscure reason, it believes a campaign of murder, assassination, bombing and bloodshed will persuade them.  The stark evidence that its continued violence could precipitate a form of civil war in which the civilian population of Dublin and other southern cities will once more become innocent targets apparently also leaves it unmoved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several possible, and by no means exclusive, reasons for its action. The first is the historic perception that the political movement towards independence progresses by fits and starts in <Col N="1767" /> direct relationship to the intensity and ferocity of sporadic terrorist outrages. This phenomenon was noted by James Joyce in a lecture he gave in Trieste in 1907 on Fenianism, where he said:</P>
    <P>After each one of these crimes, when the general indignation has calmed a little, an English minister proposes to the House some reform measure for Ireland, and the Fenians and Nationalists revile each other with the greatest scorn, one side attributing the measure to the success of parliamentary tactics and the other attributing it to the persuasive faculty of the knife or the bomb.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, events of the last two years have appeared to give some confirmation of this view in terms of the willingness or unwillingness of the British Government to convene meetings, set dates, provide a time scale, etc.  This may be merely a perception, but it is a dangerous one which is fostered in the South by the continuing chorus maintaining that since the IRA ceasefire, no concessions have been granted to the Nationalist side despite the absence of violence.  This is quite untrue.</P>
    <P>Why should the Irish public, North or South, debase themselves with fawning gratitude simply because the IRA has ceased to murder citizens?  Moreover, the ceasefire was marked by clear advances, albeit gradual ones.  Border roads were opened, bridges were rebuilt, the Army presence was scaled down, troops were removed to barracks, the RUC recommenced unarmed patrols and some, although not enough, concessions were made to republican prisoners.  These are not negligible matters but they are blithely ignored by many people in public life in the South. This should not be so.  We must learn to be generous in our appreciation of such moves while continuing to press especially for more humane treatment for Irish prisoners in Britain.</P>
    <P>Yesterday some Members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs had the privilege of listening to the Speaker of <Col N="1768" /> the Canadian Parliament.  He indicated to us that the Canadian way was not to resort to violence in situations such as that obtaining in the province of Quebec but for the different sides, however strong their zeal, to talk themselves and each other to a standstill at which point a resolution inevitably emerged.  It would seem that for the republican side to resort once more to the abysmal depths of violence we witnessed at Lisburn after a period of less than two years during which advances were made shows that they have not learned this fundamental lesson of democracy and that they are, to put it mildly, both trigger-happy and politically irresponsible.</P>
    <P>It also raises the question that, supposing we reached a stage at which Sinn Féin was accepted into the inclusive talks, what does the present evidence suggest would be the end result?  It is overwhelmingly obvious that the talks process would not lead and, indeed, could not lead in the foreseeable future to the kind of outcome that is the objective of both Sinn Féin and the IRA.  The evidence of their behaviour so far indicates that, in those circumstances, they would again have recourse to the bomb and the bullet.  It is no doubt for this reason that Sinn Féin representatives at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation refused to sign the basic democratic principle of consent.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable for anyone on this island to be a part-time democrat.  Mr. Adams, Mr. Morrison and Mr. McGuinness are, as I said in the House last week, faced with make your mind up time.  They can no longer espouse the slogan of the ballot box in one hand and the bomb in the other.  It is not &ldquo;both and&rdquo; but &ldquo;either or&rdquo;&mdash; the ballot box or the bomb.  It is time for Mr. Adams and his colleagues to make it clear on which side of the divide they stand.</P>
    <P>I am not particularly concerned about forcing Mr. Adams, Mr. Morrison and so on into formal condemnation of acts of violence.  Such condemnations in the present circumstance would sound hollow and unconvincing, especially to the Unionist population.  What I ask for and <Col N="1769" /> what I believe is essential is for the leadership of Sinn Féin to separate themselves clearly and unambiguously from the action of the self-styled army with which they have to date acted in guilty concert.  Such a stance might require some courage.  However, in electoral terms its seems clear that it would be popular even with its own supporters &mdash; I point to the fact that approximately 97 per cent of the readers of <i>The Irish News</i> indicated in a recent widescale survey that they were against the resumption of violence.  It would be helpful if, even in the absence of a condemnation of IRA outrages, Sinn Féin ceased to be the apologists for continued bloodshed.  Let us have an end to equivocation.</P>
    <P>When the IRA ceasefire was called some cautious people wanted an acknowledgement that it would be permanent. Sinn Féin had considerable difficulty with this concept and performed linguistic gymnastics at every turn to avoid using this word.  Perhaps now we know why.  What was envisaged was not the kind of ceasefire we were lead to believe but a cessation of violence which would not continue if the unelected militarists of the republican movement were not satisfied with the rate of progress towards achieving a solution which appealed only to a minority of voters on this island.  For this reason, however difficult as it may be, it is necessary that a future ceasefire should have the qualities of clarity, unambiguity and permanence. Nothing else will satisfy and it will be difficult for many to place full credence even on such an assurance. Such a ceasefire must also include an end to kangaroo courts, revenge attacks and the maiming of citizens as well as the arrogant assumption of the right to exclude citizens from this island by threat.</P>
    <P>We are frequently told when we call for a debate on Northern Ireland that the time is not appropriate because inflammatory language from this House may set things back.  I never regarded this as a serious contention.  There is no recorded instance of a debate in either <Col N="1770" /> House precipitating, by virtue of the sentiments expressed, the smallest incident on the streets of either Northern Ireland or the Republic.  In a conflagration one is unlikely to notice a puff of hot air.  On the other hand, the language of some of the central players is highly dangerous and worthy of comment.</P>
    <P>Mr. Adams, for example, who is nowadays pretty careful about his language let the mask slip on one notable occasion when, in response to the chants of a crowd in Belfast about the IRA, he said into the microphone with a half smile &ldquo;they haven't gone away you know&rdquo;.  What does this mean if we decode it other than that the section of his movement concentrating for the time being on the ballot box were aware of and happy to receive the assistance of colleagues still devoted to the bomb and the bullet.</P>
    <P>Recent demands from republican sources for calm and logical debate need to be placed in the context of the highly abusive sectarian and racist tone of their publication, <i>An Poblacht.</i>  As long as this journal peddles its message of hate and contempt, how can anyone take seriously claims of the republican movement to be interested in genuine brotherhood with those whom it regards and describes as subhuman?</P>
    <P>Let us turn to the issue of Drumcree. As a practising member of the Church of Ireland, I would like to say that with a few exceptions, such as the former Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Victor Griffin, its response has been inadequate, lacking in courage and in moral or political leadership.  The situation is clear.  Church property was used and church personnel were involved in events which, although they could be presented in a neutral light as religious or commemorative, were as everyone knows inevitably destined to cause disharmony, civil strife and potentially large scale casualties.  To permit any form of religious sanction for such activity in the present situation was totally wrong.  As in the case of the opening of the tunnel in the old city of Jerusalem <Col N="1771" /> by the Israeli authorities, the question is not whether it was done before or whether there was a legal precedent or entitlement but of sensitivity to the perception of the surrounding population.</P>
    <P>While I recognise it is unlikely that church authorities could legally have prevented the rector from permitting these events, why was there such a deafening silence from most of the church authorities?  Why did the Church of Ireland officially, through its Primate and Bishops, not disassociate itself from such events and condemn them outright? Was it afraid of alienating elements within its congregation and if so, should it not have asked itself would the founder of its church, Jesus Christ who chased the money changers from the temple, not have been prepared to risk alienation?  Where is the prophetic voice of my church?  How is it tolerable for members of the Church of Ireland, in particular clergymen, to give assent to the tenets of the Orange Order or to remain members of such a group as long as the aims, objectives and practices of that group are so nakedly sectarian and anti-ecumenical?  There is a clear contradiction here.  The Church of Ireland is and has declared itself to be an ecumenical church in full support of dialogue with the other churches with a strong hope and intention of achieving full intercommunion.  Membership of the Orange Order on the other hand specifically precludes members from attending services of the Roman Catholic Church.  It is not possible to serve God and Mammon and in this case the Orange Order is clearly Mammon.</P>
    <P>These are awkward matters and difficult to face, especially for church authorities or for the British Government. Both have shown themselves lacking by their refusal to confront these issues.  I cannot find it in my heart to blame the RUC for Drumcree.  It was placed in an invidious position.  A local police force known to and associated with the community they were asked to restrain was subject to intense pressure, blackmail, <Col N="1772" /> threats and intimidation to an extent that no civilian police force should be asked to sustain.  At that point I have no doubt that matters became the responsibility of the British Army acting as the legitimate representative of the State.</P>
    <P>The Orange Order at its first breach of the civil law should have been confronted by the forces of the Crown. When armoured plated earth moving equipment was introduced it was the clear responsibility of the British Government to instruct the military commander to drive a tank over it and flatten it into the ground.  Had this been done, the law would have been preserved and the right of the citizens of Northern Ireland to free progress along the Queen's highway would have been maintained.  However, they lost their nerve, whether for political reasons or not I do not judge except to say that it was a serious and dangerous miscalculation by the British authorities.</P>
    <P>It also clearly called into question the much vaunted respect for law and order of the Orange Order.  It is easy to respect law and order when it suits and to deny its authority in circumstances where compliance with it does not suit. That is what being an adult citizen is all about.  I accuse the Orange Order of bad citizenry and bad faith in deliberately going outside the law to seek confrontation. I am not saying all Orangemen are evil, many are good, honest and decent people.  In Joyce's <i>Dubliner's</i> a character in &ldquo;Ivy Day in the Committee Room&rdquo;, Mr. Crofton, is dismissed as an Orangeman only to be defended by a Dublin working class Catholic who says of course he is an Orangeman and a damned decent Orangeman too.  I have no doubt that it is possible to be a damned decent Orangeman but I also have no doubt that there is something rotten at the heart and core of Orangeism and its essential sectarian nature with the awful neurotic certainty that goes with it.  I have always believed in the power of positive doubt and unless we admit as human beings that we are vulnerable, unsure and frail, we <Col N="1773" /> will always repeat the inhuman errors of previous generations.</P>
    <P>What was great about Deputy Reynolds' participation in the peace process was not that he was an overwhelming academic intellect but precisely because he was ordinary and had taken the prophetic step of abandoning the baggage of the past wanting only to deal with the practical human realities of living in the present and forming the future in a way which would accommodate all traditions on the island.</P>
    <P>I well remember being at a high level meeting in Oxford where some high Tories were inclined to be dismissive of Deputy Reynolds as a pet food manufacturer and former dance band impresario. I did my best to disabuse them of this notion telling them, as I believe it to be true, that a man who creates substantial employment in his own area through developing a pet food factory and has travelled the length and breadth of the 32 counties organising social functions is one who will have his finger on the pulse of the people and will know in his gut precisely what he can deliver and how this can be achieved.  Sinn Féin tried to acquire some of the kudos from Albert Reynolds's reputation by associating itself with his contribution to the peace process.</P>
    <P>The question of internment was raised at the beginning of this week on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; on RTÉ television. This has always been a very tempting easy solution and there have been times in the past when I have been tempted towards it.  However, I am in no doubt whatever that any notion that it would improve the situation at present is a dangerous illusion.  Apart from anything else, because of the clever line adopted by the loyalist paramilitaries and the representatives of the PUP it would be politically impossible to introduce internment on an evenhanded basis.  This would mean it would be directed once more solely at Roman Catholics and the Nationalist population. This is not just counterproductive; it is a recipe for complete disaster.  We ought to learn the lesson <Col N="1774" /> we have been trying to teach Sinn Féin and its IRA comrades, however difficult and exasperating, we must keep our political nerve and not reach for the security option alone.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the law of the State must be observed.  By accepting too gullibly the bona fides of the IRA's ceasefire, the authorities on both sides of the Border relaxed police measures in a natural desire to win the hearts and minds of particularly the Nationalist population.  This clearly permitted the IRA to move personnel and equipment into place so that when the time is right, according to its book, it could set out on a campaign of terrorism once more. This cannot be allowed to continue.</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear Senator Norris's contribution because, without putting too fine a point on it, I am rather tired of debates in this House where people with genuine motives and feelings express extraordinary platitudes and say very little of what matters, particularly on the issue of Northern Ireland.  It is easy, and compulsory, to come in here and condemn violence, express one's own credentials for peace and sit down.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the situation has ever been worse than it is now.  It cannot be measured in terms of the number of bombs being planted and bullets fired but in the potential for that to happen and the atmosphere on the ground which is appalling at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in this part of the country are living in cloud-cuckoo-land.  It is self-induced and wishful thinking.  I do not believe there ever was a ceasefire and the evidence points to that.  Throughout the so-called ceasefire Sinn Féin/IRA was preparing for war.  That is not a ceasefire; that is a tactic, and that is all that was going on.  Neither do I believe <Col N="1775" /> there was ever a peace process but it shows the extent to which we have been brainwashed that we use the expression as though it was a fact of life.  There was no peace process.  There was a group of politicians who, to their shame, were dancing to the Sinn Féin tune and subscribing to the Sinn Féin/IRA agenda. That is what was happening.  Many people warned about it and those of us who did so were branded as prophets of doom.  Unfortunately, we have been proved correct.</P>
    <P>There was no peace process.  There was a hope of brief peace.  Very naive and innocent people did what the IRA wanted them to do in the hope of peace, and they have been fooled.  They were given a great deal of help by many in the media and particularly RTÉ.  It is an absolute disgrace that RTÉ should have had Gerry Adams on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; for a soft interview two weeks ago while the ceasefire was not in operation. I cannot see any justification for giving him such a platform to talk about issues which are not related to violence and present him as a normal person.  He is not a normal person or politician.</P>
    <P>The night before last I gather Martin McGuinness was on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; portrayed, again, as some sort of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; politician with all the other politicians.  Mr. McGuinness and Mr. Adams are apologists for the IRA and they are being courted, tolerated and given platforms by our national broadcasting station.  That is intolerable.</P>
    <P>Why are they continually given this platform?  The reason is quite obvious. It is not because they represent the people; they do not but because there is a smell of sulphur about them, they are somehow exciting and can influence events because they can influence the IRA who plant bombs.  That is what I mean by the agenda being dictated by Sinn Féin/IRA and official Ireland is consenting and, indeed, facilitating it.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris was right when he said that there has been a give in these so-called negotiations.  I do not know what else the IRA wanted.  Section 31 was <Col N="1776" /> repealed and the most powerful platform they could be given in this country is open to them day and night to tell lies. They were given open Border roads; the release of prisoners; the so-called Forum for Peace of Reconciliation was set up, which was a mockery in terms of its name and participants; and the army withdrew from the streets.  What more do they want?  They want a complete and utter victory over the majority of the population in the Northern Ireland, they want to crush them.</P>
    <P>The reality of &mdash; people know this but they dare not say it &mdash; is that people have been fooled.  The whole peace process was a confidence trick.  Deputy Reynolds and Mr. John Hume were fooled.  Deputy Spring, who was present today, was fooled as were leading Europeans and the President of the United States.  That is the horrific scale of what has gone on in the last two years and the Lisburn bomb tells it all.  There was no ceasefire; there was a tactical stoppage in order to allow them to regroup. We hoped there was some sort of ceasefire but there was not.</P>
    <P>Canary Wharf, unfortunately, gave the lie to everything we hoped for and believed in over the last 18 months because there is no point in having a second ceasefire.  After Canary Wharf the Government said it would allow Sinn Féin/IRA into the talks if they called another ceasefire.  How can they? Another ceasefire would only produce the same set of circumstances, that is, a ceasefire for as long as the IRA decided. It would be blackmail and would prove that these people were liars because Martin McGuinness is a liar &mdash; nothing else.  It was Martin McGuinness who lied.  He said that the ceasefire would hold in all circumstances.  It has not held in all circumstances.  It held as long as they felt it was convenient.</P>

Civil servants meet with these people and convey messages back to Ministers.  That is a cosmetic exercise.  We should ostracise these people.  We still seem to be frightened of cutting them out of the political process. They are not normal people and should be kept off the airwaves.  We cannot trust them any longer if they say there is a ceasefire as we know their word is not their bond.  Section 31 should be reimposed and <i>An Poblacht</i> banned.  The existence of these people and their cohorts should not be publicised or encouraged until we are convinced they are completely committed to democracy.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate to review what has happened over the last couple of years, particularly how Sinn Féin have been treated and the manner in which they have responded. Many people have been duped and continue to be duped by this organisation. A distinction should not be made between members of Sinn Féin and their colleagues who make up the IRA. These are semantics as both sides know what is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1778" /> It was suggested that the Canary Wharf and Manchester bombings were carried out by splinter groups.  Nothing happens within that organisation without proper planning.  After such incidents the same people appear in the media with their usual manipulative style, saying the peace process must be pushed forward.  These people plan and carry out bombings at Canary Wharf and Manchester, the murder of Garda Jerry McCabe and even a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>We must review the situation where people waltz around Government Buildings or the White House while their colleagues commit murder.  It is time for a get tough policy.  We should stop spoonfeeding these people because they have manipulated the media and will continue to do so.  I cringe when they appear on television.  It has been said that reporters ask them difficult questions.  To date, they seem to have got a soft run from some of our journalists.</P>
    <P>We have to learn from the past.  In relation to the release of prisoners, how many have been involved in or have tacit knowledge of or given advice about specific events?  They did not move to a new desk job when they were released. The reality is that they are involved in planning various atrocities.  A get tough policy should be pursued by politicians in the Republic.  During the cessation of violence there were many punishment beatings to which far too many politicians turned a blind eye.  There was a lack of criticism of what was going on. While these spokesmen were performing for the cameras, people were knee-capped and told to get out of certain areas.  Politicians did not grasp that nettle.</P>
    <P>We have to go forward.  It may be necessary, as Senator O'Toole said earlier, to push ahead and forget about Sinn Féin.  At what price do we want Sinn Féin in these talks?  I hope this debate leads to a greater realisation of the problems with which we are dealing.</P>

      <P>We hoped and thought the type of statements we are having this afternoon had been consigned to the past.  At an early stage in what has been called the peace process, I expressed, not too confidently, the hope it would lead to lasting peace.  At the time, I was regarded as being something of a Jeremiah.  Unfortunately it has transpired that much of our hope has turned to ashes.  The task which confronts us as constitutional and democratic politicians is to reconstruct the edifice of peace.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross is right in saying there has been a certain element of self-delusion and wishful thinking in the peace process and how we thought Sinn Féin was committed to it.  On the basis of my experience at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, where I was privileged to serve on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I came to one conclusion and nothing has happened subsequently to change that conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The compromises which are at the heart of democratic politics do not exist for Sinn Féin and the IRA.  Sinn Féin has one objective &mdash; a United Ireland. By what means is that achieved?  If it feels it can achieve it by bombing and killing 5,000 people or by talk, it will do whatever is required.  The compromise at the heart of a democracy does not exist for these fascists.  The republican movement believes in force as a political tool.  Perhaps what happened in Lisburn has confirmed the merit of that approach.  What did we see after a soldier was blown to bits?  Following his death, a succession of Sinn Féin members appeared on television throughout the world.  The apologists for the violence were frequently seen on television.  Over a period of time, section 31 of the Broadcasting Act was repealed, prisoners were released and Mr. Adams visited the US where he was <Col N="1780" /> fêted by the American administration. He travelled to Frankfurt where he was also fêted to launch a book.  What was achieved by, or what gesture was made in return for, these concessions and media opportunities?  Nothing.  The response was to blow up a British soldier. There is a major contradiction in this regard.  There was also a contradiction at Drumcree regarding the conduct of people purporting to worship in a Christian place.</P>
    <P>How can we place any value on statements made by Sinn Féin spokespersons when ten tonnes of explosives were discovered in a London house?  What value can be placed on such statements when the IRA was preparing a bomb for Canary Wharf during the visit of the President of the United States to the Republic and Northern Ireland?  How can those circles be squared?  Sinn Féin members state that they do not represent the IRA but that they will not condemn bombings because they do not partake of the politics of condemnation. They also state that they sympathise with the victims but they do not condemn and they inform us that they are not the IRA.  The semantics continue.</P>
    <P>Earlier, the Tánaiste proclaimed that we are democrats.  The Houses of the Oireachtas, the British Parliament and parliaments throughout the world must proclaim that they are democratic and are prepared to make the compromises at the heart of political democracy to achieve peace.  The democratic way is the only way.  The peace process does not belong to Sinn Féin; it is the peace process of constitutional politicians.  We must proclaim this and defend it.  Fascism and democracy are incompatible.  If we have not learned that from the history of this century, we have not learned anything.  The compromises at the heart of the democratic process must be permitted to operate.</P>
    <P>In the Downing Street Declaration, the framework document and the joint statement of the two Governments we will find the basis for a way forward. Certain principles and actions are necessary if we are to achieve a political <Col N="1781" /> settlement.  My party Leader referred to these in the Dáil when she stated that a new political order in Northern Ireland must have genuine equality of esteem and recognition for both communities, a written constitution should be established for Northern Ireland which would include a Bill of rights and democratic institutions and acceptance of the principles that the external constitutional status of Northern Ireland must be decided by the majority of its people.</P>
    <P>This goes back to the principle of consent which was discussed for many months at Dublin Castle.  However, when it came to the crunch, Sinn Féin would not subscribe to it.  There must be a maximum degree of self-government in Northern Ireland and policing structures that have cross-community support. There must also be a North/South dimension to areas of mutual interest.</P>
    <P>There are lessons we can learn.  On Monday last, I attended the prayer breakfast near Dundalk.  Politicians from North and South gathered to pray, joined in their common Christianity. Senator Ross referred to platitudes, but one is not speaking in platitudes when echoing the late Senator Wilson's proclamation on the opening day of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation that &ldquo;love is enough&rdquo;.  Where is our Christianity?  We are overwhelmed by religion but there is no Christianity. Some people were fortunate to be present on Monday morning to hear Michael Cassidy talk about the experience of South Africa.  Members could have learned something valuable because Mr. Cassidy made a very interesting statement when he said that we are overwhelmed by people talking while not enough people are listening. We must listen more and talk less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and thank the Tánaiste for his contribution. I wish to express my concerns about the present situation because this is a crucial time for Irish people.  If there is a return to the killings and maimings that occurred before the ceasefire, it will be serious for everyone because it will <Col N="1782" /> have an increasing impact on the South and the North.</P>
      <P>While fully condemning recent events, we must ask the IRA and Sinn Féin to stop and think of the consequences for society if there is an allout civil war in Ireland.  We must ask what type of Ireland would result from such a conflict?  It would be anything but a united Ireland.  There would be deep divisions between its people.  If we want a united Ireland, the people must be united.  Further violence will only drive a wedge between the people.  This should not be the objective.  If Sinn Féin/IRA states that its objective is to bring a united Ireland into being, it is going the wrong way about doing so. That organisation is dividing Ireland by its tactics.</P>
      <P>The people of Northern Ireland have suffered greatly and desire peace.  I recently met some of them who were former supporters of the republican movement in Northern Ireland but are now bitter as a result of the resumption of violence.  They point to a certain section within the IRA and state that its members did not suffer the consequences of violence in Northern Ireland heretofore.  This element, whose influence within the IRA has increased, has decided that the people of Northern Ireland must again suffer the kind of outrages which occurred during the past 25 years.  People in Northern Ireland have a deep fear of returning to that stage.  They also feel greatly let down by certain sections of the IRA.  It is no secret that the IRA is divided on how to approach the future.  We must encourage those who believe that peace represents the way forward and ensure that their voices are heard, common sense prevails and there is a return to peace which will improve the quality of life of the people of Northern Ireland in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also compliment the loyalist paramilitaries for maintaining the peace.  It is difficult to congratulate someone on ensuring peace but the loyalist paramilitaries are to be complimented for resisting provocation.  Constitutional <Col N="1783" /> politicians in Northern Ireland, the Republic and the UK must ensure that the talks progress rapidly. The constitutional Unionists must modify their language and approach to the overall situation.  There were positive developments during the past week following discussions between John Hume and David Trimble.  That is the way forward. John Hume and David Trimble, in particular, can play a strong role in developing the process and ensuring that the paramilitaries and those who want to kill, maim and destroy the Irish people are isolated.</P>
    <P>Those of us involved in the peace process feel disappointed, frustrated and lost for words.  Senator Maloney, among others, was involved in examining the humanity of the approach to the prisoners in the UK and ensuring a development in that regard.  Those of us who contributed to a progression of the peace process find it hard to ask the IRA and Sinn Féin if they were genuine in their interest in the prisoners and in developing that process.  What do they say now?  Were they genuine when they spoke about a humanitarian approach to prisoners?</P>
    <P>A large section of Sinn Féin was quite genuine in wishing to progress the process but, unfortunately, the hawks seem to be influential at present.  I ask them to ensure society as we know it, North and South, is not destroyed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Tánaiste for his statement.  The ceasefire ended with the Canary Wharf bomb.  It was a stupid decision to recommence the bombing &mdash; since then the IRA has set off bombs in Manchester causing about £500 million of damage and there were bombs in Lisburn which resulted in the unfortunate death of a soldier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have come through one of the worst summers in Northern Ireland any of us can remember.  I refer specifically to the events which began in Drumcree, events which did immense damage to the Orange Order and to unionism in Northern Ireland.  I was in Drumcree on <Col N="1784" /> the Sunday of the march and I was in Derry for the Apprentice Boys march the following month.  The hatred and bigotry evident there among intelligent people was so strong that one could almost smell it.  The damage done by the recommencement of the campaign of bombings and killings and the events at Drumcree have set the peace process back many years.</P>
    <P>For 11 months the Drumcree residents' groups had sought a meeting with the Orange Order and the police to discuss the march through Drumcree. Neither the Orange Order nor the police met with the residents to try to defuse what would be a dangerous situation. I felt sick at seeing Mr. Gracie, the Grand Master of the Orange Lodge in Portadown sharing a platform with Billy Wright and Willie McRea.  These people did not even take the time to try to defuse the situation by meeting with local residents' groups.  It begs the question whether these people really want peace.</P>
    <P>In northern Antrim in the past few weeks a 400 strong protest outside a church in Ballymena was carried out to stop people going into services.  It is the worst form of protest.  One finds it being used by Ian Paisley junior as a measure of easing the boycott of Protestant shops taking place in Northern Ireland. I hope such events will never happen in the South.</P>
    <P>A married couple with two sons running a shop in Portglenone had a financial intake prior to Drumcree of about £1,400 a week until a campaign was started against them orchestrated by Sinn Féin thugs.  Their takings are now down to less than £200 a week.  The owner, who stated that he was a strong loyalist but had not attended Drumcree, said he had received telephone calls to say that they would be boycotted just because they were Protestants.  The owner of the shop said he had always shopped with his Catholic neighbours and would continue to do so.</P>
    <P>He made a statement to <i>The Belfast Telegraph</i> to the effect that he would fight the boycott and at 2 a.m. the following <Col N="1785" /> day bricks were thrown through the window of his house.  The following day he received a telephone call expressing dislike with what he had said to the newspaper.  This is the nature of life for people in the North.  I recently read that Protestant businessmen in Northern Ireland are launching a campaign to boycott goods coming from certain companies in the South.</P>
    <P>Death threats have been issued to the Ulster Democratic Party representatives Gary McMichael and David Adams and to the PUP representative Billy Hutchinson. It is important to establish trust in Northern Ireland and I welcome the efforts made this week to get the talks moving.  Mr. George Mitchell is an excellent chairman but he cannot wait forever for substantive talks to start.  It is important that Sinn Féin would be admitted to the talks.  It is easy to say that they should not be present but we should look at what happened when they were excluded.</P>
    <P>The IRA will always be on the verges of the political situation.  When Diarmuid O'Neill was killed recently in London it was galling to hear republican sources accuse the British of shooting first and making up the facts later.  They stated that he was unarmed.  The late Gordon Wilson's daughter, Marie, was also unarmed as was Tim Parry the young boy killed in Warrington.  The IRA cannot speak out of both sides of its mouth.  Neither, unfortunately, can it be ignored.</P>
    <P>The ten tonnes of explosives found in London show that it will not go away. It is not good enough for the Unionist politicians to say the IRA cannot be allowed into the talks.  Since the ceasefire we have seen unbelievable fudges from Mr. Trimble and the British Government because they were under pressure from the DUP and the UK Unionists led by Robert McCartney. Nothing was done by these people to try to move the process forward and they must carry a lot of responsibility for what happened.</P>
    <P>It is easy to condemn Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness but I commend <Col N="1786" /> them for the work they have done in holding their people together in an unpleasant climate.  Unfortunately, if we ignore them the bigger the chance we take with the so-called ceasefire.  The IRA will always find people like Diarmuid O'Neill a soft touch.  I have seen such young men in Donegal with no interest in politics who are sucked into the IRA, used and easily discarded, sometimes having served long terms in jail, having been injured by explosives or shot dead.  They are a disposable asset to the IRA.</P>
    <P>It is up to the politicians to give a lead.  All we can do is ensure that everything possible is being done to keep the talks moving forward.  I remember the message of Gordon Wilson &mdash; it is preferable to try to convince people that loving one's neighbour is better than trying to blast a way to a new society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not use the term &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; rather we should use the term the &ldquo;Six Counties&rdquo; because County Donegal is part of northern Ireland.  The problem lies in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>We must look for the reasons behind the violence on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland.  I have talked to ordinary farming and business people in the North.  When Warrant Officer James Bradwell was killed we all sympathised with his family.  However, the same amount of sympathy was not evident on the death of Michael McGoldrick, an innocent taxi driver.  We knew who shot him.  I wish his wife and her new son, Andrew Michael, well and I hope he grows up in a peaceful society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admired Senator Norris for being so straightforward.  When power sharing was tried who broke it up? It was not the IRA.  Who broke the law at Drumcree?  It was not the IRA; it was the Orangemen.  Sir Hugh Annesley was hung out to dry because there was no doubt he was instructed to hold the line but when the Unionists had been to Downing Street they informed their colleagues that the march would go ahead <Col N="1787" /> the next day at 5 p.m.  Such injustice worries the Nationalists in the North.</P>
    <P>Mr. Stalker was brought in to investigate an alleged shoot to kill policy and he said that he met with a conspiracy of silence.  He was sacked by the British Government because it said there was a photograph of him with someone undesirable.  It was later proved to be a false accusation and the British Government had to pay a six figure sum in damages to the man in question.  We can all see that the Nationalists are being neglected. They are doing their best but someone must bring it home to David Trimble and company.  We saw him at Drumcree and he has no intention of giving one inch.  Unless there is compromise on all sides there cannot be peace. I appeal to the Unionists in Northern Ireland to be big enough to compromise, give way and share the cake with the Nationalists.  In that way we would have permanent peace in Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to outline his Department's response to the job creation recommendations contained in the IBEC report on the music industry and the report <i>A Strategic Vision for the Irish Music Industry</i> commissioned by Irish Songwriters and Publishers and submitted to the Government; and the steps he intends taking to implement these recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the value of the Irish music industry is variable the Irish Export Board estimates that the total value of the sector is well in excess of £100 million.  This 1993 figure is probably a little outdated and it may now be in excess of that.  The figure is arrived at based on the sales of recorded music, live music performances, merchandising and exports.  Due to the variable nature of the industry it <Col N="1788" /> is also difficult to estimate with any degree of accuracy how many people are employed either part-time or full-time but studies indicate the figure is in excess of 10,000 nationwide.</P>
    <P>The importance of the Irish music industry has been belatedly recognised in recent years.  In the early 1990s a Government report on competitiveness stated:</P>
    <P>The Irish music industry is developing as a major internationally traded service.  The industry includes composing, publishing, performance and recording of music, sales and distribution, tapes and compact discs, and associated services.  There is already significant employment in these areas and there are real opportunities for increasing employment in the industry if advantage is taken of the technological, structural and legislative changes now taking place in the worldwide music industry.  A detailed examination of the industry will be taken to identify the potential for job creation.</P>
    <P>The foregoing is a quote from the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  Sadly no such detailed examination of the Irish music industry has been undertaken and we in Fianna Fáil believe it is past time that the Government recognised the underlying economic value of the industry to the economy. In referring to the Government as a whole, I hasten to add that I am perhaps being somewhat disingenuous in not acknowledging the individual contribution that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has made, and continues to make, in the area of the arts.</P>
    <P>Our motion is based on two reports. <i>Striking the Right Note</i> was a submission to Government on the development of the Irish music industry prepared by the IBEC music industry group in November 1995.  A prior submission to Government entitled <i>A Strategic Vision for the Irish Music Industry</i> was submitted in February 1994.  Inevitably there is a great degree of overlap between the <Col N="1789" /> two reports and the participants in both are almost the same.  They represent song writers, publishers, the record industry and the royalty collection agencies. Both reports go into considerable detail on the structural weaknesses in the Irish music industry and make positive recommendations on how the State could assist in developing the full potential of the industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The music industry has always had a certain mystery about it.  Perhaps this is one of the reasons it has never been taken very seriously by politicians.  This air of mystery extends into the manufacturing process.  Some years ago I remember a record company executive refusing to go into detail on the manufacturing process of vinyl with the somewhat ingenious answer that it would remove the mystery for consumers who really only wanted to know if the latest hit was in their local record shop on a piece of black vinyl.  He said that providing details of the manufacturing process would eliminate the glamour and glitter associated with the pop music business.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the mystery and the glamour, the rewards for success in the music industry are limitless.  For example, the royalties alone, as distinct from sales, generated by the sales of the two &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; videos have already generated several million pounds for its creators.  This aspect of the music industry has created some controversy among consumers who believe they are being ripped off by multinational record companies who have a virtual monopoly on worldwide sales and effectively operate a cartel on pricing policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister and colleagues will be aware that in recent years the record industry in Britain has been called to account by a House of Commons select committee to explain its pricing policies, specifically on compact discs, and justify the perceived high profit margins involved.  Of course, they denied that there were unjustifiably high profit margins but, to quote the age old cliche, &ldquo;they would, wouldn't they&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The perception of the music industry by the vast majority of people, whether <Col N="1790" /> here or abroad, is of a bloated, egocentric, hugely profitable and secretive business.  Therefore, the question can be legitimately asked why should scarce State resources be directed towards the assistance of such an industry?  The answer lies in both of these well researched and comprehensive reports on the state of our music industry.</P>
    <P>In the document entitled entitled <i>A Strategic Vision for the Irish Music Industry</i> the participants recommend that the policy objectives of the Irish music industry should be to maximise employment, participate fully in commercial opportunities afforded by the development of new technology, enable and actively foster the creative output of music of Irish origin in recognition of the importance of maintaining a vibrant cultural life and support training for musicians.</P>
    <P>Management expertise should be more widely available so that Irish performers have the capability to successfully utilise their creative talents in a demanding domestic and international marketplace.  The main recommendation of the IBEC report is the establishment of an Irish music board.  The report goes into considerable detail on the activities of this proposed board. They are: to prepare and agree with Government the co-ordination of a five year development plan for the industry; to review progress yearly and present the results in an annual report; to advise Departments, State agencies, education and training bodies and other organisations regarding the needs of the music industry; and other policies and practices <i>vis-á-vis</i> the industry generally. The new Irish music board would also engage in and promote overseas marketing activities by the Irish industry and would be a source of expertise, knowledge and experience of how the industry operates.</P>
    <P>While I have a great deal of sympathy with many of the aims of the IBEC report, I am not convinced that the establishment of yet another State agency would be the most practical response to the development of the <Col N="1791" /> music industry.  Indeed, many of the proposed activities of the new board are already carried out by various State agencies such as the Irish Export Board and Bord Fáilte.  I compliment the Irish Export Board particularly for its initiatives over recent years.  It has helped considerably to fund Irish participation at the internationally prestigious MIDEM festival in the south of France, which the Minister has graced.  It is a worldwide shop window for international music sales and much money has been generated in this country as a result.  A more sensible approach would be the establishment of an <i>ad hoc</i> or advisory board by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to advise the Minister of the day on various aspects of the Irish music industry. The Minister has in recent years acquired elements of this expertise through a variety of committees and by direct contact with the music industry itself.</P>
    <P>There are three broad strands common to both reports that I would like to follow.  The first is the definition of music as a form of cultural expression and a defining national characteristic. According to IBEC, the Irish music industry is dominated by multinational companies.  Statistics indicate that 90 per cent of record sales in this country is in the control of six companies, all of which are foreign owned.  However, the upside is that independent record companies which are wholly Irish owned have made a far greater and significant contribution to the development of Irish music within Ireland and overseas than their size indicates.  For example, one of the biggest selling Irish records of all time &ldquo;A Woman's Heart&rdquo; featuring leading Irish female artists was manufactured and distributed by a wholly owned Irish record company.  Equally, artists such as Sharon Shannon, The Saw Doctors, Mary Black, Daniel O'Donnell, Christy Moore and Foster and Allen enjoy international success with companies which are wholly Irish owned.  The outstanding success of the <Col N="1792" /> two &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; videos which are now estimated to have sold in excess of four million units worldwide is not only creatively Irish in its entirety, but is also Irish owned.</P>

      <P>Recent Grammy Award winners in America &mdash; the US equivalent of the Oscars &mdash; included Irish composers and performers such as Bill Whelan, Andy Irvine, Davy Spillane and Rita Connolly who all record for the Tara record label which is wholly Irish owned.  The Chieftains and Enya continue to be among the world's most sought after artists although admittedly, they record for international record labels, but both artists have used and continue to use Irish recording studios and expertise.  The international success of these performers, and more especially of their record company management and promoters, is all the more astonishing when the fierce competition and massive resources that are lined up against small independent labels by multinational companies such EMI, Warner Brothers, Polygram, CBS, RCA, Virgin, etc., is considered.  Both reports make a strong recommendation which I endorse that Irish creativity should be rewarded rather than penalised and that the artist's exemption under section 2 of the Finance Act, 1969, should be extended to Irish composers, publishers and record producers who are part of the creative chain.  It is ridiculous in a small country with an equally small music market, where record sales rarely top 50,000 or 60,000 albums and usually go in excess of only 10,000 &mdash; that includes U2 whose &ldquo;Zooropa&rdquo; album only sold in excess of 50,000 units here, although its sales overseas were significantly higher &mdash; that the State should take 48 per cent tax from composers, publishers and producers. I strongly urge the Minister to investigate this aspect of the tax regime as it applies to the music industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second strand running through both reports refers to broadcasting in <Col N="1793" /> Ireland.  From a music industry perspective broadcasting can be accurately referred to as the oxygen of publicity. The strategic vision report states that broadcasters play a vital role in the music industry as a market and as a means by which music is disseminated to the public.  It goes on to state &ldquo;a key determinant in the success or otherwise of music is the exposure that it enjoys through broadcasting, particularly on radio&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The report raises a very serious point in regard to airplay.  Because of the small size of this country and the vast repertoire of international music plus the marketing budget available to promote major acts, it is, perhaps, inevitable that non Irish music enjoys the lion's share of broadcasting time.  The report goes on the say that a constant complaint has been that Irish broadcasters do not give sufficient airplay to Irish acts and it refers to the music quotas system in operation in France and other countries.</P>
    <P>I am an enthusiastic supporter of the quota system and I know that the Minister has in his public pronouncements over the last few years indicated a certain sympathy for this point of view. Throughout the 1980s there was intensive lobbying to establish a quota system for Irish broadcasters but it fell foul of the competition element of the Treaty of Rome, which Ireland signed on accession to the European Union. However, the goalposts have now been significantly moved and the overriding concern of the EU is to protect the cultural diversity of member states.  It is within that framework that I strongly urge the Minister to give serious consideration to the legal enshrinement of a quota system for Irish broadcasters in the forthcoming Broadcasting Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appreciate the Cathaoirleach's indulgence for a moment.  RTE radio has operated an <Col N="1794" /> unofficial 25 per cent Irish music content for several years, while a number of local radio stations, especially the most successful ones, have transmitted a significantly higher percentage of Irish originated content and signs on. Opponents of this argument state that quotas are an unfair imposition which would affect the viability of broadcasters, that they are an erosion of freedom of choice and that they are protectionist in nature.  These arguments were used prior to the introduction of a music quota system in Canada in the early 1970s.  Canada, like Ireland, lives in close proximity to a large neighbour. Similarly, the Canadians discovered that their indigenous music industry was suffering heavily from the dominance of the US market and something had to be done about it.  Canadian music can now stand on its own without the type of quota which I have mentioned.  It is past time such a quota system was introduced in this country.  Otherwise, the Irish music industry as we know it, with some notable exceptions, will disappear.</P>
      <P>I criticise the music policy of the two Dublin commercial stations &mdash; FM104 and 98FM &mdash; who resolutely refuse to operate a proactive policy of playing Irish recorded material.  This situation is all the more disgraceful as both stations operate a virtual monopoly in a market of 1.2 million people.  It is a disgraceful state of affairs and should be changed at the earliest opportunity.  I do not understand why a city this size does not have more thematic radio stations to give people more choice rather than what they have at the moment, which is effectively two stations chasing the national pop station, 2FM, which caters for a market of 30 per cent of the listening audience.  I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for allowing me extra time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and concur with everything Senator Mooney said.  He has vast experience in the industry and it is all the more obvious from the magnificent contribution he made here in the Minister's presence. The Minister took office many years ago <Col N="1795" /> and we knew on that occasion we had a Minister whose attitude was 100 per cent correct, who understood the industry and knew exactly what was required. His visit to Cannes to support the industry a few years ago was a great example of that.</P>
      <P>We are nearing the run up to a general election.  Many in-depth analyses have been carried out on behalf of his Department and it is the time for a decision because, whoever comes into his Department after the next general election, may not have the openness, the understanding and the concern for the music industry which we, on this side of the House, recognise he has in abundance. Action speaks louder than words and we are looking for him to bring that to the fore.</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator Mooney's comments on the quota system.  We discussed this at length with the Minister on two or three other occasions and his reply was that there was an EU regulation. It is about time he stepped in, particularly with 98FM and FM104.  I highlighted this during my last contribution on this subject.  I took the chief executive of FM104 to task on Northern Sound Radio and on Radio 3 and asked him to give me the airplay times for Irish music.  I challenged him that the figure would be no more than 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These stations will be reviewed this year.  If they are not prepared to give their support to Irish artists, producers, record companies, recording studios and music publishers, all of whom are making a small living from the industry, when they are the shop windows for the wares we are selling, their licences should be withdrawn and I will call for that.  I make no apology for it.  I worked long and hard with the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, Senator Mooney and our parliamentary party to have those stations licensed.  They were unlicensed at the time.  We achieved that.  We recognised the difficulties and territorial problems that would arise. However, I never thought I would see <Col N="1796" /> the day when an Irish radio station would refuse to give more than 5 per cent of its airplay to Irish artists between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn seems to think this is a joke.  I am reluctant to name her because the radio station in Clare is probably one of the best examples of what community and local radio is about.  This is a serious matter.  I spend between £200,000 and £300,000 per year in the Irish live music industry. However, people like me are becoming fewer.  We will not be able to survive the crisis at hand.  RTE Radio One has nothing but chat shows and bad news, with the exception of Ronan Collins, from 8 a.m. until the evening.  Perhaps the station is making an effort with &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; by moving it from current affairs to light entertainment. No alternative radio licence was granted for our capital city in the last ten years.  I hope the Independent Radio and Television Commission will be sympathetic to any licence application which caters for the alternative listener of between 35 and 80 years of age.  There is no such station in the city at present and the industry is suffering badly.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; has been the best shop window for tourism and Irish music and culture we have seen in our lifetimes.  It shows what RTE television, which has the opposite attitude to RTE Radio One although it does not have the airplay time, can do for Ireland in the context of tourism and sales.  I believe &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; will sell ten million units.  It is extraordinary to see its popularity and what it has done for Bord Fáilte.  I congratulate everybody concerned.  The Minister played a major role in enthusiastically encouraging everybody involved and did everything possible to help them.</P>
    <P>I concur with Senator Mooney's comments on the producers who create the product, come up with the ideas and give the artists the encouragement they need.  The usual sales figure for an album in Ireland is 5,000.  One can imagine the number of hours involved <Col N="1797" /> in recording an album.  It takes between five or six weeks and eight or nine months, depending on the creativity that is necessary.  If the incentives were available, the top producers in the world would come to Ireland, just as the artists have done, and we could grow our industry.  From that point of view the proposal I have outlined would be a magnificent gesture.</P>
    <P>The Irish Film Board and the Arts Council have been established but the music industry takes in 40 to 50 times more than those sections of the arts. Some area of the music industry should be grant aided.  Foreign artists come to this country and leave without having to pay one penny in tax.  The Minister should examine the possibility of imposing a 10 per cent tax.  Five per cent could be given to the new board and five per cent could go to the Exchequer. If we go to the UK to record we pay 27 per cent artists' tax.  If we go to Australia or America we pay 10 per cent and in Canada it is 15 per cent.  If a record is a hit here or in England, it can be a hit in any other English speaking part of the world.  A music board could grow the business and create employment.</P>

Is tráithiúil mar a tharlaíonn an díospóireacht seo, ar dhá chúis.  I dtús báire, ar an mbonn náisiúnta, fuair mé cóip de FORTE le déanaí, an meitheal oibre a bhunaigh mé i mBealtaine 1995.  Sa dara áit, mar chuid dár nUachtaránacht Eorpach agus i gcomhpháirt leis an gCoimisiún Eorpach, tá Mor-Fhóram Eorpach eagraithe agam atá le tarlú in Inis an tseachtain seo agus a dhéanfaidh smaointe a chothú faoi ghníomhartha agus tionscnaimh gur féidir a ghlacadh ar <Col N="1798" /> bhonn na hAontachta leis an mórthionscal Eorpach seo a fhorbairt.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to put on record recent developments in the music industry and my attitudes and initiatives towards this most important of our cultural industries.  I also thank both Senators for their gracious comments and positive contributions.  The timing of this debate is opportune for two reasons.  First, on the national level I have recently received the report of FORTE, the music task force which I established in May 1995.  Senators will recall that I received an interim report which enabled me to make a recommendation to the Minister for Finance to expand BES this year.  Second, as part of our European Presidency and in co-operation with the European Commission, I have organised a major European forum which is to take place this week in Ennis and which will develop ideas on actions and initiatives that can be undertaken at Community level to develop this major European industry.</P>
      <P>The fact that the health and potential of the music industry is seen as a fit topic for debate in this august Chamber is a measure of just how much we have developed as a society.  One would not have to transpose oneself a great distance back in time to find oneself in an era where issues of concern to music and musicians would not have loomed large in the thinking of our legislators and policy makers.  The welcome change in the perception of music as an industry rather than a commendable pastime or even an esoteric obsession has been brought about by the reality of modern society and the challenge of the postindustrial world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has taken some time for the realisation to sink in that a community's wealth should be measured no longer in terms of its access to base metals and primary raw materials.  Instead, the capacity to produce wealth is increasingly a function of a community's creativity, imagination and flexibility.  The nature of employment has changed to the extent that we are increasingly a service orientated society and it is to that <Col N="1799" /> sector that we must look for increased employment.  Music is a cultural industry and as such it belongs to the service sector.  Employment in the cultural industries is typical of the service sector in general in terms of the potential for employment creation, the maintenance and the characteristics of that employment. The cultural industries at present provide approximately 21,500 full-time job equivalents.  That is about 1.9 per cent of the total employed workforce. This compares with the banking sector's 2 per cent, with 24,000 full-time job equivalents and about 7,500 in computer hardware.</P>
    <P>It is beneficial to examine some of the characteristics of employment in the cultural sector.  The most recent authoritative study of employment in the cultural area recorded that the cultural sector is a mixture of full-time, part-time and seasonal employment.  Of the estimated 33,800 employed in the cultural sector, approximately 48 per cent are employed in cultural arts organisations while the balance operate on a freelance or self-employed basis.</P>
    <P>The gross aggregate value of cultural industries in 1993 was £441 million.  This figure does not take account of the contribution made by the cultural industries to other sectors, for instance, the importance of Irish music to our tourism industry.  Significantly, the study shows that 88 per cent of the cultural sector's income is earned through their own direct trading activity and that only 12 per cent is earned by way of grants.</P>
    <P>Music is by far the biggest employer within our cultural industries, accounting for approximately 10,000 jobs.  It operates on many levels; from aspiring young artists who view the world as their potential audience to music lovers who listen to radio, buy records and attend concerts; from the traditional musician playing in sessions to the concert performer.  It is a complex world with an ethos, culture and mythology of its own.  It is a diverse and seemingly fractured industry representing a partnership between the creative and business <Col N="1800" /> worlds &mdash; a sometimes tense alliance between often conflicting aims and motivations.  Yet, despite its inherent tensions it is an enormously successful industry with huge potential rewards for those seeking a successful career.</P>
    <P>In 1995 the European music industry had an estimated turnover of £14.8 billion &mdash; a greater turnover than both the cinema and video industries.  Most significantly the industry on a European scale provides employment for over 600,000 people.  The world music market is valued at £24.68 billion.  Ireland as a nation has done well in this highly competitive international market.  We are, for instance, the fifth highest provider of international hit records in the international pop and rock music market.  If you take six of the top selling Irish artists &mdash; such as U2, the Cranberries, Enya, Sinéad O'Connor, Chris De Burgh and Van Morrison &mdash; you find that between them they have sold 124.5 million records worldwide,</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Boyzone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed and we congratulate them.  These records sales give a minimum retail turnover of £1.25 billion.  It is estimated that in 1993 Irish music accounted for 4 per cent of the German market, 3 per cent of the Dutch market and 5 per cent of album sales in Britain &mdash; a level of penetration achieved by few other Irish industries, including the tourism and drinks industry, and bettered in the UK only by the US and UK recording artists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the potential richness of the music industry, the wonder is not so much that we now address ourselves to the focused initiatives that might usefully be undertaken to assist the industry but rather why it has taken so long for the message to take hold.  Clearly a rich natural resource with such enormous potential is an area that must be of interest and concern to Government. Despite recent statements by some commentators that the creative elements in our society are now being &ldquo;stall fed&rdquo;<Col N="1801" /> and that life has become too easy for our writers and creative people, I still believe that the cultural industries need and would welcome focused initiatives and partnership with Government and State agencies.  For instance, the motion before this House mentions two specific reports, <i>A Strategic Vision for the Irish Music Industry</i> and the more recently published IBEC report <i>Striking the Right Note.</i>  Both reports make the case for such strategic planning and partnership. The former report was one of the main reasons I decided to establish a special task force, FORTE, on the music industry and I specifically referred to that report when announcing the terms of reference of the task force.  The IBEC report was a separate initiative by the music industry group of IBEC and worked parallel to the FORTE report. Four members of the IBEC group were also members of FORTE and it was agreed that the IBEC report would feed into and inform the FORTE group. Indeed the coincidence of membership made this inevitable.</P>
    <P>The FORTE group has completed its study and submitted its final report to me.  I am now considering this report with a view to implementation of many measures which I will discuss.  However, I had at the beginning of FORTE's deliberations requested that they provide me with an interim report covering possible initiatives in the area of taxation. This interim report, coupled with others, such as the strategic vision and the IBEC report, enabled me to successfully argue the case for the extension of the business expansion scheme to the music industry.  I offer this as my first response to the analysis offered by the music industry and as an indicator of my personal commitment to action.</P>
    <P>The extension of the BES to the music industry has been correctly interpreted as recognition by the Government of the increasing value of the cultural and creative sectors and their potential in terms of employment creation, value added and generation of wealth.  The BES for music has been specifically targeted to stimulate investment <Col N="1802" /> in the production, publication, marketing and promotion of new and emerging talent and is not intended to fund activity already taking place in the industry or well established artists.</P>
    <P>The decision to extend the BES to music was made against a background that includes the following; the assertion in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> that most new jobs will be generated in the service-oriented sector; the National Economic and Social Forum's report &ldquo;Jobs Potential of the Services Sector&rdquo; which concluded that a range of policy changes, including taxation measures, are needed to support the further development of the services sector and to accelerate its employment performance; the Government's policy agreement A Government of Renewal which states that &ldquo;particular attention will be given to the introduction of tax and other incentives in order to expand employment in the music industry&rdquo; and, as I mentioned, the interim report from the music task force FORTE coupled with the industry submissions on the development of the Irish music industry.</P>
    <P>The music industry employs some 10,000 people and is a major contributor to the economy.  Why then, if it is doing so well, does it need assistance from the Government and the hard pressed taxpayer? The main reason is that the music industry is an extremely high risk area and despite our major success stories which quite rightly receive the bulk of media attention, the fact remains that it is still extremely difficult for new and emerging talent to secure adequate investment.  So risky is investment in new artists that there has been a tendency for investment in the music industry to be concentrated on a relatively few bankable, established artists, arguably at the expense of emerging talent.</P>
    <P>There is also a huge attrition rate among new artists and bands.  This squandering of creative talent represents a waste of resources that would not be tolerated in any other industry. Both the reports mentioned in the motion before us and also the FORTE <Col N="1803" /> report have indicated that increased investment in new and emerging talent would help many more artists make the leap from talented amateur to marketable professional.</P>
    <P>The extension of the BES to music is intended to encourage and reward investment in the most vulnerable area. It is a valid and worthwhile investment in a national asset and it must always be borne in mind that when we invest in new artists we are creating employment, not just for the artists themselves but also for all the support services such as road crews, management, promoters, retailers, merchandisers, studio personnel, etc.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the extension of the BES to the music industry is targeted and focused and brings real benefit to both the artists and the taxpayer, all projects will be certified by me as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. This certification process is subject to guidelines which have been agreed between myself and the Minister of Finance. The issue of a certificate will not imply any judgement as the artistic merit &mdash; I claim no expertise or special sensitivity to the nuances and relative merits of the different musical genres nor would I allow myself sit in judgment of them.  Similarly, certification by me does not represent an endorsement of the investment worth of the project.  The effect that this measure will have on the music industry will be closely assessed during the first year of operation of the scheme in order to inform our decisions for any fine tuning that may be required in the future.</P>
    <P>Throughout my consideration of the music industry you will have noticed that I have emphasised the benefits that the industry can bring in purely financial and economic terms.  I do this not because I necessarily believe that these are the most important arguments, far from it, but because they are the arguments which tend to carry most weight. Perhaps more important, and just as relevant, is the intrinsic worth of music as a means of communication, of artistic and <Col N="1804" /> cultural expression, of national identity, social empowerment and enrichment and of sheer pleasure.  I am at one with the Senators who stated that the cultural component must be emphasised and that is why I am willing to face challenges in Europe and elsewhere.  We are blessed to enjoy such a rich heritage of music and song and also an imaginative and creative people who are constantly rediscovering, reinventing and redefining that heritage for themselves.  The reports mentioned in this motion and the FORTE report contain many challenging elements and, as I said, I am considering the analysis provided and the recommendations made.</P>
    <P>I have detailed the background to the extension of BES to music since I believe it is a very important initiative and one that is very relevant to the industry.  It shows what can be achieved when the concerns of an industry are linked to Government policy for the overall benefit of the community.  This partnership approach will be continued and developed in my ongoing dialogue with the industry.  I find myself in agreement with several important issues raised in the various reports but I must hasten to add that I do not enjoy jurisdiction on several of the areas covered, for instance, copyright or education. However, I would like to assure Senators that I will be keen to support any initiatives by my colleagues in Government at a local, national or international level which will address the many important issues still outstanding.</P>

I deeply appreciate the valuable points and comments made by Senators.  I listened to them with great care.  I agree with them it should be borne in mind that, apart from production in the music industry, the relaying of an actual broadcast is not so much a commodity but the carrier of a cultural expression.

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this worthwhile debate.  I compliment the Opposition Senators for tabling the motion and giving this House the opportunity to discuss this very important issue.  As the Minister said, the music industry provides employment for over 10,000 people and is growing all the time.  Per head of population, the international success of Irish musicians has been quite extraordinary.  In the current climate there is an international focus on Ireland for a variety of reasons such as the success of many artists and bands and our repeated success in the Eurovision Song Contest.  Sinéad O'Connor and bands such as U2 and Boyzone have brought Ireland to international attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are very fortunate to have Deputy Higgins as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  He fully appreciates and recognises the importance of music to our culture and future employment.  I am delighted with the manner in which he has dealt with the issue this evening. The fact he has convinced the Minister for Finance to include investment in the music industry in the BES scheme is very welcome.  I am pleased he and the Government have decided to take this initiative.  The investment will be focused on those who need it rather than existing successful projects.  Lack of finance is often a difficulty as far as <Col N="1806" /> an artist's success and recognition is concerned.</P>
    <P>This decision will provide investment in the areas highlighted by <i>Striking the Right Note,</i> the report by the music industry group of IBEC, and <i>A Strategic Vision for the Irish Music Industry.</i> Those reports highlighted weaknesses in relation to publication, recording and management.  Investment in these areas through the BES scheme should be extremely helpful and I hope will provide what the Opposition Senators and the Minister desire for the industry.</P>
    <P>The forum established by the Minister is meeting this week in Ennis, in the Minister's home county of Clare, to consider and deliberate on that issue.  Coming, as I do, from a county with an appreciation of traditional music, song and dance, I am delighted it is taking place in that area.  I hope the Minister will consider locating the centre for music in County Clare.  I hope he will not take offence at that parochial note; I appreciate that his constituency will also make a strong bid for it.</P>
    <P>The contribution of people such as Miko Russell to the traditional music sector must be valued and appreciated. He is a focus for the interaction between the tourism and cultural industries. Many Europeans have come to the west, particularly Clare, as a result of Miko Russell travelling to Germany 20 or 25 years ago.  That might not receive national recognition but it is a reality which has been recognised by the Minister who has provided funding for a centre in Doolin.  That is greatly appreciated and is very valuable and worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The overall importance of the industry is recognised by this Government. The Minister, in particular, has been very positive and recognises its cultural importance.  We have modern rock bands which have achieved international fame but we also have our traditional music.  It is important to distinguish between them to some degree and to recognise the separate contributions which each can make.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> It is very important to further develop the international focus which has been placed on Ireland by our various artists. Much of this has occurred with little State support, particularly from the Irish Trade Board, SFADCo and the various promoting bodies.  To date, these bodies have been far more geared towards promoting industries such as computers and manufacturing and have not been as focused as they should have been.  A debate such as this and the Minister's positive response is worthwhile. I hope that agencies such as SFADCo, Forbairt and An Bord Tráchtála will have a more defined focus in future in relation to promoting the Irish music industry abroad.  That is extremely important.</P>
    <P>Some of our international success stories, such as Sinéad O'Connor, Boyzone and U2, happened because of the quality of the artists involved and because they made their mark in particular niches of the international music industry. However, it is important that our agencies consciously promote the industry. We are always looking for equal treatment of men and women and I hope the Government will take the opportunity when making appointments to some of these boards to focus on people from musical backgrounds with this level of expertise.  It is important for their views to be heard in the relevant fora in order to change policies and affect decisions.  The Arts Council could also take a more active role in relation to music, particularly traditional music. It is important for all the agencies involved to co-operate with each other.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate to have a Minister who fully appreciates the industry and has an overall view of what he wants to achieve.  I hope a co-ordinated structure of what he envisages will be in place for whoever succeeds him.  I compliment the Minister on his contribution this evening and the Senators opposite for tabling the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and his Department on their work to <Col N="1808" /> date in the music industry.  The report <i>A Strategic Vision for the Irish Music Industry</i> defined the Irish music industry as comprising a wide range of activities &mdash; composers, song writers, publishers, performing artists, record companies, record shops, venues where music is performed, royalty collecting agencies and people who ensure that those who hold copyrights are recompensed for the use of their creative talents.  It covers a wide spectrum.</P>
      <P>A striking feature of the music industry until recently was its fragmented and diverse nature.  That lack of unity has often resulted in a lack of purpose.  Until recently the industry had no clear vision of its future.  The fact the music industry joined IBEC in 1994 was due in no small part to prompting by the Minister who encouraged those in the industry to get together and support one another.  The Minister's appointment indicates an awareness of the need to support the arts and culture.  Nobody can deny that music lies at the heart of Irish culture and it is often how foreigners identify with us.  Music brings many visitors to this dark and rainy country.  They hitchhike many miles to get to a pub where they can hear genuine Irish music.</P>
      <P>We must realise that music takes many forms.  When I look back to my childhood I am reminded of the records my father played for us in the pre-television era.  We listened to recordings of John McCormack, Bridie Gallagher and the Gallowglass Céilí Band.  Our interest in and love for music has come from that mix of music with which we grew up.  However, that diversity led to weaknesses when it came getting economic benefit from the treasure house of talent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IBEC report, <i>Striking the Right Note,</i> published in November 1995 stated that this diversity causes great difficulty in assessing the value of the industry.  It stated that due to the nature of the industry, relatively low entry barriers contributing to considerable entry and exit, overlaps between categories, particularly composers and performers, <Col N="1809" /> the freelance and contract nature of much of the employment and the importance of part-time jobs, variations will take place in the estimates of those employed.  According to the Simpson Xavier report, there are up to 10,000 full-time employees in the music industry.</P>
    <P>An Bord Tráchtála estimated that the total value of the industry is approximately £100 million.  As the Minister said, that value should be recognised in terms of exports.  It is estimated that Irish music accounted for 4 per cent of the German market, 3 per cent of the UK market and 3 per cent of the Dutch market.  It compares favourably with the amount of food and drink we sell to those markets.  Taken in that context, it is an important industry.  It is a pity that much of the money does not stay in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his success in extending the business expansion scheme to the music industry.  It is right that we start to build a basic infrastructure so Irish artists and those who support them can make money.  By setting up the task force, the Minister has ensured that he is committed to the future development of the music industry. One cannot chart the future of any sector if one does not fully understand what is happening.  We can only move forward by building on our strengths and rectifying our weakness and I look forward to the publication of the FORTE report.  The establishment of FORTE is in line with recommendations made in <i>A Strategic Vision for the Irish Music Industry</i> and <i>Striking the Right Note.</i>  The Minister is listening to those involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Senators who tabled this motion.  They have hands on experience of the industry.  I agree with their call to have more Irish music broadcast on radio stations.  It is a chicken and egg situation in that young people are swayed by what they hear on radio and if they do not hear a particular type of music, they will not buy it.  Dolores O'Riordan comes from a place close to where I live and her father is a good Irish musician.  There is a cross over between Irish and pop music.  If one <Col N="1810" /> grows up in a home with music, one will produce music.  I compliment the Minister and I hope he will continue his good work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleagues and thank the Minister for the work he is doing which will make a valuable contribution to the development of jobs in this vital business and which will generate revenue for the economy.  Although I am a relative amateur compared to my colleagues, Senator Mooney and Senator Cassidy who have wide experience of this business, I have close friends involved in the music industry and some family members involved in the teaching of music in schools in Limerick.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of years music has been treated as a second class subject in secondary schools.  I recall that when somebody wanted to take music in the leaving certificate they were discouraged as it was considered to be too difficult and they could not make a living out of it.  We all know of people who were discouraged from getting involved in the music and entertainment business because the attitude in the past was that they should get a job in the Civil Service or public service or that they should teach.  However, attitudes are changing.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a great opportunity to set down the framework for the expansion and development of the music business because there is relatively little legislation in this area.  In doing that, he should protect and conserve traditional music.  It might have died in the west were it not for the work done by Ciarán MacMathúna.  Traditional music in the western counties is stronger now than at any time in the past 70 to 100 years thanks to people like him and the late Seán Ó Ríada. Thankfully, that tradition is being continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unique work is being done in Limerick University by Micheál Ó Súilleabháin and Bill Whelan, who was involved in some of the productions which brought recognition to Irish talent.  They are cleverly blending traditional and modern music; that is the real secret.  It <Col N="1811" /> is almost like the Commissioners of Public Works who when restoring Dublin Castle, were able to protect the best of the environment while building a new conference facility which is being used for EU Council meetings at present. People like Bill Whelan and Micheál Ó Súilleabháin are building on the strength of Irish traditional music and, at the same time, are not afraid to take bold new initiatives.  The present conflict between those who say a jig or a reel must be played as it was 100 years ago and those, such as the people involved in &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo;, who transform basic traditional Irish music with new ideas, is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>However, this is a high risk business of which we have all had experience. Recently, I talked to the Clare County Enterprise Board about providing support for three people from west Clare who where interested in forming a band. Their main difficulty was that people would not invest by way of the BES in such high risk business.  The enterprise board, which was not sure whether it should support such development, was not prepared to give them grant aid.  To get established, these people needed to invest in equipment and instruments but they were not in a position to show to the enterprise board, bank or financial institution that what they had in mind would create revenue and cover whatever the loans or investment.  There is a difficulty in this area which needs to be addressed.  It could be dealt with by way of tax incentives.  I am sure this has been looked at by the Minister and that new initiatives will be considered.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged by the present state of the music industry in Ireland, the prospect of further permanent jobs being created and the revenue that will accrue to the State.  I look at the success of Patrick Cassidy, for instance.  This unassuming man has lived in Shannon for a good number of years and has brought an international dimension to music.  I believe he recorded not so long ago with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.  Tremendous work has been <Col N="1812" /> done in that area and it is encouraging to look at people like John O'Connor, Bill Whelan and Micheál Ó Súilleabháin as the nucleus of a vibrant industry, one which can build on the strengths and foundation created and supported by people such as Ciarán Mac Mathúna, RTE and local radio.</P>
    <P>Local Clare radio has made a dramatic impact on the local scene since its establishment.  It has transformed the music and entertainment business and news broadcasting and made a dramatic impact on the county.  It has had considerable influence in encouraging the industry develop and advance.</P>
    <P>I was in Government when the 1988 Bill was brought before the House.  It was never intended that legislation would be the be all and end all of local broadcasting and the Minister's Green Paper affords further opportunities to underpin local radio stations.  I urge him strongly to avail of the earliest opportunity to direct funding from the RTE licence revenue to the local independent stations.  Section 20 of the 1988 Act allocated £500,000 of licence revenue to fund the first two years expenses of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  There is no reason that mechanism cannot be continued and a small amendment to the 1988 Act would ensure that local radio would continue to get part of the £60 licence fee which RTE will get this year.  A portion of that revenue, £4 million, £5 million or £10 million, would be well spent if it enabled local radio to continue its work, support their commercial activities and underpin their valuable contribution to industry and employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his lucid, concise and perceptive view of the music industry and acknowledge the introduction of the BES scheme as a first step in the taxation area.  I am sure that the Minister appreciates the high risk element to which Senator Daly and Senator Taylor-Quinn referred and will keep this under review.  I would hate to think that the Government, because there may not be a sufficient beneficial <Col N="1813" /> fallout from this initiative, would shy away from any further initiatives in the taxation area.  I understand the Minister's reason for extending the BES.  I hope what we asked for in the context of the artist's exemption would also be extended.  I do not see why that should not happen.  Why, for example, should the poet &mdash; I appreciate the Minister has risen to poetic heights and has a certain sympathy in that area &mdash; have little difficulty being established under the artist's exemption while somebody who might compose music which will be heard worldwide is treated differently?</P>
      <P>I want to touch on a point to which the Minister referred, I appreciate it is not within his brief but it was central to the two reports, that is, the question of copyright.  The final strands referred to the urgent need for copyright reform. As copyright law is a highly technical and complicated subject and while I have left it to this stage in the debate, I do not wish to diminish its overall importance to the future viability of the Irish music industry.  Both reports devote separate chapters to the copyright position and make specific recommendations to the Minister.  I acknowledge that a number of the recommendations have been acted on since both reports were published as a result of Ireland's adoption of EU Directives in this regard but I am sure the Minister will agree there is an urgent need to bring forward a new copyright Bill to replace the 1963 Act.  I appreciate this Act comes under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise and Employment but I would be grateful if the Minister would indicate &mdash; I think he has gone some way towards saying that he would support any initiatives in this regard &mdash; that he will push the introduction of this legislation at Cabinet, not just in the interests of the music industry but in the interests of Ireland's status as a country which protects intellectual property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, in both reports is a viable blueprint for placing the Irish music industry on a firm footing and the Minister has taken the first step.  Perhaps I <Col N="1814" /> sound a little churlish when I say that repeated public acknowledgments by Government and official recognition of the economic potential of the Irish music industry would be welcome.  As the Minister said, we have come a long way from the time when issues of this nature would not be discussed in this House.  There is a need to provide some form of State assistance for the development of indigenous music talent.  Irish music creativity is unparalleled throughout the world and is acknowledged as being unique to this island.  I may be going against the grain in stating I am saddened that we must slavishly follow international music trends.</P>
    <P>I applaud the success of bands such as U2, the Cranberries, Boyzone and the Corrs, who were not mentioned but who have enjoyed great international success. Such bands operate in an international commercial environment. However, they could have originated in any country because there is very little Irishness in their musical output.  Let us be brutally frank.  People, particularly those of an artistic nature, are products of their environment.  However, because of the context in which the international pop music industry operates, these successful bands, whom we applaud for being Irish and succeeding in an international competitive market, could come from America, New Zealand or elsewhere.  Their success highlights the internationalisation of the music business.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly referred to Dolores O'Riordan.  The Corrs rely heavily on use of the fiddle which is a traditional instrument.  I do not wish my remarks to be misinterpreted.  There is a vast, indigenous, untapped creative talent.  I include everyone from Sharon Shannon to Christy Moore to Daniel O'Donnell in the wide genre that can be called &ldquo;Irish&rdquo;.  A certain musical racism is practised whenever people refer to such artists who have an established international reputation.  It is time for the chattering classes, particularly those in Dublin 4, to stop criticising their success and applaud them, rather than criticising <Col N="1815" /> their music.  When commentators refer to Irish music, they invariably speak about the rock music industry as if it is somehow all-embracing.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be all inclusive in his thinking when bringing forward proposals.  The vast majority of working musicians, composers, publishers and recording companies in this country come from the indigenous music sector.  They, not the multinational companies, need the greatest help.  It is to them we should look for the future protection of our cultural identity and that which makes us distinctly Irish.  Most of the bands referred to were successful because they sent their recordings to the international headquarters of multinational companies rather than that they happened to be in Ireland.  As such, the Irish music industry did nothing for them.  They had to travel abroad to join the international jet set.</P>
    <P>We are discussing local musicians and I appeal to the Minister to encourage the Minister for Finance to include many of those to whom I referred under the artists' exemption section of the Finance Act.  I commend and applaud the Minister for his work in making the arts and cultural activity central to our national identity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Events during the summer prompted me to raise this matter on the Adjournment of the House.  I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and thank the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, for meeting a deputation from Dunmanway <Col N="1816" /> regarding the problem I will now outline. I compliment the gardaí, particularly Superintendent John O'Flynn of Clonakility who made himself available to the local community when required. We deeply appreciate his help.</P>
      <P>The Dunmanway races have been held since 1615 when a charter was provided to hold a race meeting in a field outside the town.  These races have continued to be held successfully over the centuries.  In 1995, there was an influx of people in caravans who were intent on wreaking havoc on the area.  As a result, the festival organised to coincide with the race meeting was cancelled. However, the races proceeded and, a week before they were due to begin, a hoard of approximately 60 caravans descended on the town.  Their owners parked them in lay-bys and at the roadside in complete disregard of road signs, yellow lines, etc.  They parked outside people's houses and pestered them for almost 14 days.</P>
      <P>Local business people, shopkeepers, etc., were intimated and threatened. They were informed that if they did not serve those travelling in the caravans their premises would be burned out and they would be beaten up.  As a result, business people were obliged to employ security personnel to keep undesirables off their premises.  Children from the caravans stole goods from supermarkets and shops.  They also ran into old people's houses and pilfered their possessions. Those children were not supervised and were allowed out at all hours of the day and night.  People were observed surveying houses from their backyards.  This situation persisted for almost ten days.  The entire town and surrounding countryside was held to ransom.  When pressure was applied through the deployment of extra gardaí in Dunmanway, these people moved to local towns and villages and pestered the inhabitants.  Elderly people, women living alone and lone parents were afraid and people would not permit their children to play outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am highlighting this matter before problems arise at next year's race meeting. <Col N="1817" /> In the past, there was a very good festival which coincided with the races but this was cancelled because people could not leave their houses unoccupied. It is not fair that a local community can be held to ransom by a bunch of blackguards who can enter the town in their caravans and do as they please.  That is a disgrace.  I did not refer to those involved as &ldquo;travelling people&rdquo; or &ldquo;itinerants&rdquo; because I believe many of them have houses, probably local authority houses, elsewhere.  They travel in groups to blackguard people in certain localities.  I ask that steps be taken to stop this happening in the future.</P>
    <P>I live in west County Cork and Cork County Council carried out a survey of travelling people and itinerants there.  It was discovered that only six families were in need of housing.  Four of those families were housed by the county council, one family left the area and the other does not wish to be housed.  The issue of the travelling community in west County Cork has been dealt with quite well.  However, there is another group purporting to be travellers who are not travellers.  Travellers should have some form of identification or the county council should draw up a list so that they can be identified.  People should not be permitted to travel under two tags &mdash; owning a house and not owning one.  The people of any community have the right to their festivals, to live in peace without being abused or intimidated and to go about their business without fear or threat of their houses being broken into.</P>
    <P>Another problem which has affected Dunmanway is the influx of new age travellers from abroad.  Many young Irish people have left this country to look for work abroad.  If they cannot get work here they are often refused the full rate of unemployment assistance because they are living at home yet people can come from abroad to live here in huts, teepees, tents and caravans. They go into the labour exchanges and health centres to get money.  They drink on the streets and look shabby. Tourist buses often drive on through <Col N="1818" /> towns when they see these people rather than stop.</P>
    <P>Dunmanway won the tidy towns competition in 1982 and this problem is giving it a bad image.  These people congregate in the square in Dunmanway around the telephone kiosk obstructing people.  The county council erected seats there where old people could sit and enjoy the sun in the summer. However, now they are prevented from doing so by these people.</P>
    <P>This problem is bad for tourism.  It is putting severe pressure on the social welfare system and the health clinics. There can be long queues of people waiting to see the community welfare officer and whereas before local people could see the officer easily now they are left waiting for long periods.</P>
    <P>These two problems must be handled. I thank the Minister for Justice for meeting the deputation.  I hope I have made the point more clearly tonight and that steps will be taken to alleviate the problems not only for Dunmanway but for other areas which suffer intimidation from people who have no respect for law and order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice is unavoidably absent and has asked me to respond to the matter raised by the Senator.  I have noted the points he has made and I will convey them to the Minister.  She has made inquiries of the Garda authorities into the issues raised by the Senator and she has been informed that problems can occur from time to time when convoys of caravans arrive in west Cork, sometimes resulting in disputes between the local residents, including farmers and traders and the travellers themselves. She understands that these problems are most pronounced during a local summer festival.  The Minister further understands that these problems are associated with simple trespass and annoyance to the landowners and local communities.  When these travellers infringe on the criminal law they are dealt with by the Garda Síochána in the <Col N="1819" /> same way as any other individuals or groups in society.</P>
      <P>As the law stands, trespassing is treated as a civil matter unless that trespass is accompanied by specific behaviour which would bring it within the remit of the criminal law.  There seems to be an impression that the Minister for Justice can introduce some form of legislation which would categorise the problems associated with new age travellers as a law and order issue, the solution to which lies exclusively with changes to the criminal law.</P>
      <P>However, there are many other concerns associated with these issues which are of an environmental and social nature, such as public health, safety concerns, adverse effects on amenities, negative effects on tourism, property values and industrial estates.  All the issues involved were discussed by a working group set up by the Government in May 1993 which comprised representatives from the Departments of Justice, the Environment, Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Social Welfare, the local authorities and Garda authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This group reported to the Government which decided on 20 July 1994 that the Minister for the Environment should review the Sanitary Services Act, 1948, with a view to modernising its provisions in order to deal with the illegal parking of caravans.  The Law Reform <Col N="1820" /> Commission was to be requested to review the law on trespass with a view to strengthening the powers of the various statutory agencies in dealing with the problems caused by large mobile congregations and the Minister for the Environment was to establish a liaison between the Garda and local authorities to monitor and anticipate the movement of mobile traders.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice understands that the Sanitary Services Act, 1994, is at present being reviewed by the Department of the Environment and that the Minister for the Environment has requested the Law Reform Commission to review the law on trespass.  I understand that the early warning network and liaison system is now operating.  The purpose of this arrangement is to anticipate problems and enable preventative and, where necessary, corrective action to be taken, for example, to notify local landowners or sports clubs that they should secure their property.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has indicated, the problems referred to are multi-faceted and come under the aegis of a number of agencies.  She wishes to assure the Senator that where breaches of the law occur the Garda authorities do and will take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17 October 1996.</P>
