      <P>I have notice from Senator Finneran that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Health to provide the necessary funds to alleviate the serious overcrowding at the County Hospital, Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Today's business is items 1 and 2.  Item 1 is to be taken from now until 5.30 p.m. and it is proposed that there be 15 minutes per speaker. Members may share their time.  The Minister will not speak at the beginning of this debate.  He will listen to the debate and respond.  Item 2, the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1996, Second Stage, will be taken from 5.30 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for making statements on agriculture the first priority this week as he was asked. <Col N="1994" /> We have also asked for time to debate EU fisheries policies.  I am aware, as is the Leader, that the Minister has often been in the House.  However, several Members on this side of the floor have vast experience of the fishing industry and are well aware of the possible outcome of the policies being pursued at the moment within the EU.  We ask the Leader to provide an opportunity in the next week or two for the Minister to bring us up to date since the last meeting in Brussels.  He has the support of this House in his efforts on behalf of the industry.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is making the north of the city and the airport a priority after the meetings on Luas last week.  It is significant that it took a European Commissioner to come to Dublin to imply there was a need for a connection north of the city and to the international airport for this suggestion to be heeded.  My party and I would welcome an opportunity for the Minister to bring us up to date on his thinking in this area.  Making this extension to the north of the city and to the airport a priority is most welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of Fianna Fáil has raised most of my issues.  I thank the Leader for providing so promptly time for this welcome debate on agriculture.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's intervention and I appreciate the opportunity to participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also concerned about Luas.  As the Leader will recall, we had a number of meetings with the Minister and the Minister of State and we had some very tense discussions.  The northern connection was raised time and again.  It is disappointing to hear that the Minister was more amenable to responding to a question from Europe than he was to one from this House.  This is worrying at a time when the issue of sovereignty and involvement in Europe has such a high profile.  Commitments could have been given.  If the Government had intended to move, the concerns of Members <Col N="1995" /> might have been given some consideration.</P>
    <P>We discussed law and order recently and I hesitate to ask for another debate on it but I would like to place on the record that, after a particularly difficult week for the Garda, it is appropriate for us to express our confidence in the Force.  Despite media publicity it deserves our confidence.  Gardaí are doing an almost impossible job with very few resources and against all the odds.  I have a lot of sympathy for the leadership and for rank and file gardaí. As I said, the last week has been a particularly difficult time for them.</P>
    <P>I raised the issue of a discussion on the White Paper on Education with the Leader some months back and he was agreeable.  At the same time Senator Magner raised the question of the involvement of politicians in the education sector, the need for political involvement as in the vocational education committees to be transferred to the regional boards and how that might impact on a balance of power within the education sector.  I take the wider issues as well.  I raise it because the Minister is bringing in different legislation. It is important that the House is informed of the changes that are likely to take place and offers an opinion before legislation is drafted.  We make our input to legislation when it comes before the House but it is also important that we inform those who draft it and that is best done through debate.  I would welcome a chance to discuss the White Paper on Education and the Minister's most up to date plans on it at an early opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the remarks of Senator Wright and Senator O'Toole on the arrangements for today's debate.  It reflects well on the House that this matter will debated today and is the first item of business this week.  I also endorse the remarks about Luas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the House to give consideration to the question of economic and monetary union.  Opinion is divided <Col N="1996" /> on how we should proceed, particularly in respect of the single currency, and what Ireland should do in the event that is opts for that and Britain decides to stay out.  For those reasons it would be important for us to give our views on the matter either by way of a narrowly focused debate on economic and monetary union or a more widely focused one on European affairs.  I commend this to the Leader.</P>
    <P>The Leader has previously answered questions on the introduction of the credit union Bill.  Does he have any more up to date information on when we might expect that Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I call upon the Leader of the House to provide time for a debate on the milk quota structure.  We have two groups of producers, dormant and active.  People might not realise that some dormant producers receive between £200 and £300 per week.  They have no cows yet they are still paid for producing milk.  On the other hand, active producers, some of whom are small quota holders and are the backbone of this country, have provided much money for dairy hygiene and are paying others up to 50 pence per gallon to produce milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Toole again on the rationalisation of the vocational education committees a matter which I raised last week.  It is a serious issue for public representatives who serve on the boards.  The Minister for Education is going ahead with the implementation of something which has not been debated.  It would be a golden opportunity for her to come into the House to discuss this serious issue.  Politicians of all persuasions are anxious that this should be discussed here.  Will the Leader give us an indication as to when she might come into the House before she implements this rationalisation plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ensure the Minister for Justice is made <Col N="1997" /> aware of the rising influence of Sinn Féin in law and order matters in Dublin where it sees fit to hold a press conference in which it seeks greater influence through its President?  The primacy of the Garda Síochána should be emphasised.  The Sunday newspapers highlighted that many people are concerned at this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's call for a debate on fishing. The proposals being put forward by the EU for a cut of 40 per cent in our fishing fleet are totally out of line because their results for this island, North and South, will be disastrous.  The west and small rural communities will be affected.  I, as spokesperson on the Marine, and other Senators are in the dark about what is happening apart from what we read in the newspapers.  Other Departments issue press releases on behalf of Ministers. I would like the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, whom I admire, to give us an idea about what stage the talks are at rather than have us find out from the newspapers, which seem to get the information.</P>
      <P>I would like a discussion on the Irish language.  It would be timely if it could take place when Teílifís na Gaeilge comes on air.  It would be good for this House and it would show those in Teílifís na Gaeilge and those watching it go bhfuil cúpla focal Gaeilge ag Seanadóirí. I look forward to the Leader's cooperation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call made by Senator O'Toole and Senator Ormonde for a debate on the proposed changes in the vocational education committee. There is much concern among teachers, pupils and parents about what will happen. We want to debate the effects and enormous cost of the changes before legislation is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of fisheries was raised by Senator Wright and Senator Fitzgerald.  I had a bilateral discussion with the Minister for the Marine on Saturday evening on this matter.  He <Col N="1998" /> appreciates the support he is getting in the House and he is keen to come here. Members will appreciate he has an extremely difficult schedule at present but he wants to come to the House to discuss events.  He is reasonably hopeful of a good outcome.  I will bring to his attention Senator Fitzgerald's point about the lack of ongoing information and I will see that it is rectified.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with an early debate on Luas and I will see where it can be fitted in.  Senator O'Toole and Senator McAughtry raised the question of the Garda Síochána.  There are two messages which Members would support. The first is that the reputation of the Garda Síochána is an essential ingredient of our democracy and that we stand behind it and want to see it maintained to the highest standard.  The second is that the Garda Síochána, and nobody else, has an exclusive role in law and order; this is something we all endorse.  I am glad Senator McAughtry raised that issue.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole called for a debate on education.  I have no difficulty with that but perhaps Senator O'Toole, Senator Ormonde and others would get together and provide specific guidelines for the debate; this would be helpful. Senator Dardis raised the question of the European Monetary Union as did Senator Quinn last week.  I spoke to the Minister and he will be happy to have a debate on the future of the European Monetary Union and on the state of the currency in the near future.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis also asked about the credit union Bill.  It is at an advanced stage but I will try to have more up to date information for him on Thursday's Order of Business.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that it would be appropriate to have statements on the Irish language prior to or at the same time as the inauguration of Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>I will take account of Senator Townsend's request for a debate on the milk quota structure.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate. Even though it meant adding an extra sitting day, I thank the Leader for supporting this debate because it will be well worthwhile.  I welcome the Minister. He is having a difficult time and it is only right that both Houses should have their say on the matter.</P>
      <P>The announcement on 20 March 1996 of the BSE problem in England reflected the lack of importance placed on agriculture in the UK and the total disregard for the agriculture industry of other EU countries, such as Ireland, whose agriculture industry, and the beef industry in particular, is of vital national interest.  Bearing in mind that Ireland is Britain's fourth most important customer, the British displayed a complete disregard not only for this country but for the beef industry across the world. The British have objected to the slaughtering policy to which they had agreed and they think everybody should bail them out.  It was Britain's policy which created the problem in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Ireland adopted the right policy with the complete slaughter of herds and the banning of meat and bone meal from the food chain.  Any farmer who does not observe these regulations deserves everything he or she gets.  There have been some cases in the courts and I take no pleasure in a man being sent to jail but I support the action taken because whatever it takes we must protect this country's beef industry, which is worth approximately £1.7 billion and, above all, our clean green image.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I address the main argument, I wish to say a few words about the input costs of agricultural production.  I do not have precise figures at present but I am prepared to state that input <Col N="2000" /> costs in Europe are completely out of line with those of our main competitors. The price of fertilisers, the main ingredients as far as agricultural input costs are concerned, increased by approximately 7 per cent over the past five years&mdash;an increase of between 30-35 per cent &mdash; while in some of Ireland's main competitor countries, such as the USA, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, farmers are purchasing fertiliser at about half the cost to the European farmer.  This is reflected in the price we can accept for our produce.</P>
    <P>The price of beef to the producer has dropped over the past 12 months by about 20p per pound.  This time last year the price was about 102p per pound while the average price at present is in the region of 82p per pound.  This poses the question: did the retailer hand on this reduction to the consumer?  I have spoken to numerous butchers and supermarkets and the word from the housewife is that the price of beef has only reduced marginally on last year's price so that the consumer has not benefited from this huge drop of 20p per pound to the producer.  The distribution and retail system has not forwarded this reduction to the consumer and someone is creaming off vast amounts of money which should belong to either the producer or the consumer.  If there was a proper reduction in the price of beef, consumers would purchase it in greater amounts.  In certain instances, prime cuts are selling at the same price as last year.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for countries to introduce a substantial programme to promote the virtues of red meat.  This should be carried out on a shared basis by the beef producing nations and the producers.  Huge damage has been done to consumer confidence in the world's beef industry.  I ask that the Minister initiate a worldwide programme whereby beef producers could emphasise the message that there is nothing to compare with beef.  Much research has taken place in Ireland regarding the benefits of beef for women and children in particular.  There is no substitute for <Col N="2001" /> beef.  A recent report stated that a research programme in English universities discovered that children should be encouraged to eat beef when they reach ten months of age.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the main argument I wish to bring to the Minister's attention a report in last Saturday's <i>Irish Independent</i> by agriculture correspondent, Willie Dillon, relating to the recent veterinary conference.  It provides serious reading, contains new material and perhaps the Minister will comment on its content:</P>
    <P>Irish Veterinary Association president Diarmuid Dooge said that frozen and processed poultry products are coming in here with what the exporting countries would regard as &ldquo;an acceptable level of salmonella&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He said Irish beef was being tarnished as dangerous and diseased while we imported junk to meet a shortfall in poultry supplies here.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dooge, a food safety officer with Cork Corporation, said there had been 50 cases of salmonella food poisoning in the Southern Health Board region this summer compared with a normal number of around 20.</P>
    <P>He revealed that tests on 250 imported poultry products had revealed three cases of salmonella and enteriditis.  These were in breaded poultry products from two different British processors.</P>
    <P>Speaking at the joint conference of the Irish Veterinary Association and the Irish Veterinary Union in Killarney, he said they would expect to find &ldquo;zero&rdquo; cases of the same disease in any tests on Irish poultry meat.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we got salmonella enteriditis in an Irish product, we would freak out. We would be obliged by law to inform the department and that flock would quickly get the chop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how Ireland accepts the importation of diseased goods.  Mr. Dooge made another awful statement when he said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2002" /> We and our colleagues in the medical field are beginning to see an increase in salmonella food poisoning in the human population.  There are 200 deaths per year from salmonella enteriditis in Germany, the most civilised country in Europe.</P>
    <P>On an annual basis, the Germans accept that 200 people will die from salmonella food poisoning.  If one such death occurred in Ireland, the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Health would be in grave trouble.  I was horrified by this article.  It is unbelievable that the importation of infected chickens into this country is being permitted when the officials of a health board have proven the existence of 50 cases of salmonella food poisoning.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the main argument in the time available.  For some time, sales of beef to the USSR and Russia were sourced mainly from intervention stock. Commercial sales took off in 1994 when the level of export refunds to Russia were increased thus making this trade economic.</P>
    <P>It also coincided with the transformation of the Russian food market following the break-up of the USSR.  This factor, together with the decline in Russian products following difficulties associated with privatisation of the agriculture sector, has resulted in a steady increase in the export of Irish beef to Russia.  In 1995 some 100,000 tonnes were exported to Russia valued at about £325 million, making it the largest market for Irish beef outside the EU.  It continues to be our most important third country market for beef this year.</P>
    <P>The confirmation of the first BSE case in Ireland in 1989 caused difficulties for Irish beef sales to a number of third countries, including Russia.  In autumn 1990 the USSR authorities raised concerns about accepting Irish intervention beef.  The sale from intervention was only cleared following the visit of their chief veterinary officer to Ireland to inspect our health controls at first hand.  In July 1993 the Russian authorities <Col N="2003" /> suspended imports of Irish beef because of BSE related concerns.  The ban was lifted following the visit of a high level veterinary delegation to Ireland and the negotiation of a veterinary certificate which included certain specific animal health assurances required by the Russian authorities.</P>
    <P>Therefore, BSE related concerns in Russia are not new.  It is only since 1994 that a consistent commercial trade developed in that market.  The most recent and serious BSE crisis commenced following the House of Commons statement on 20 March and we are aware of the subsequent wave of consumer concern and market closures which followed.  However, the Russian market remained open because of the ongoing contacts with the Russian authorities and their satisfaction with the comprehensive series of controls in place in Ireland to ensure the safety and quality of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>In addition, a permanent Russian veterinary official was assigned to Ireland to monitor the filling of contracts and the loading of ships for Russia.  The presence of this officer facilitated the continuing trade to Russia at a time when difficulties were being experienced in a number of other markets. The Russian authorities have been updating themselves on the BSE problem on an ongoing basis and are relatively familiar with the control systems here.</P>
    <P>During recent months, they began to express concern about the increase in BSE cases in Ireland.  There have been 38 cases of BSE so far this year which is more than double the number of cases in 1995 and is higher than the level of cases in any year to date.  During the visit of our trade delegation to Moscow in mid-September the Russian veterinary authorities raised the issue of the increasing level of cases in Ireland and a ban was threatened although not implemented at the time.</P>
    <P>Despite reassurances, the issue was raised again on the margins of a veterinary conference in Malta two weeks ago. <Col N="2004" /> The Taoiseach contacted the President of Russia and the Tánaiste contacted the Russian foreign ministry and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry contacted his Russian counterpart. The Russian chief veterinary officer was invited to Ireland and following a review in Moscow it was decided that he would come here with a delegation of experts to study the matter at first hand.</P>
    <P>There was no complacency on our part and the circumstances which arose last week were the culmination of events which took place over two months.  The Minister monitored the situation on almost a daily basis but he saw no advantage in advertising to the world that we had BSE related difficulties with Russia or in talking about a ban.</P>
    <P>The Russian Federation's chief veterinary officer and a delegation of veterinary experts visited Ireland from 7 to 12 October to review the controls in place and to study the disease in Ireland.  The Russian team completed a comprehensive programme of visits covering beef plants, rendering plants, ports and laboratories. The Minister and the Taoiseach met the delegation during its stay. At the end of the week the Russian delegation put forward a Protocol which set out the basis for the continuation of the importation of beef from Ireland. The Protocol included the categorisation of counties and the exclusion of up to seven counties from the Russian market.  They selected the counties and their selection was based on their study of the figures.  It was linked, however, to the level of the disease in the counties in 1996.</P>
    <P>The Russians made it clear that, if the Protocol were not agreed, an immediate ban would be recommended and implemented on all Irish beef with effect from 1 November 1996.  That was a serious situation for the Minister to find himself in.  Notwithstanding the threat of a ban, the proposed categorisation was vigorously opposed and it was strongly argued that there was no scientific justification for the measure.  The meetings ended without resolution.  Following high level consultation, negotiations <Col N="2005" /> resumed later that evening.  The Russian side continued to insist on categorisation but reduced the number of excluded counties to three &mdash; Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan.  I feel sorry for beef farmers in those counties. However, there will be no difference in cattle prices between these counties and any other county.  I have heard the Opposition making that point.</P>

      <P>It has been heading in that direction; I do not like to use the word but that is what is happening.  It has too high a profile.  We do not have a serious problem.  We know it arose because cattle were fed meat and bonemeal. We are not foolish.  I am a farmer, three Members of the Opposition are farmers, the Minister is a farmer and a farmer is sitting beside me.  I have never fed meat and bonemeal to my animals and neither did the majority of farmers. However, for the past ten years, meat and bonemeal were imported from the UK and farmers used it with the result that we are faced with the present problem. Our job now is to rectify the situation. We must support the Minister because he has done a good job.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> today, the Russians said that, if it were not for the Minister, there would be a complete ban on the importation of our beef into Russia.  The Minister has our full support and he should continue along present lines, irrespective of what others say.  This is a difficult situation which must be controlled at all costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important debate because beef is one of our major industries and it affects 100,000 farmers <Col N="2006" /> and many workers in the industry.  Beef prices have fallen since live export refunds were removed last October. Senator D'Arcy made an important point when he said beef prices had fallen by 20p per pound.  However, they have fallen further.  Beef made 106p last October, not 102p, whereas it now only makes 82p per pound.  He also said this has not been passed on to the consumer; I agree.  It is the task of the Government to ensure that any price reductions are passed on to consumers and it has failed to do this.  The Senator also said nothing compares with beef; I agree with that too.</P>
      <P>Some years ago my club won a county championship and we had a celebratory dinner.  We were deciding on a menu and were suggesting mutton and chicken.  The chairman, who was the curate, said to forget about mutton and chicken as they were only mutton and chicken whereas beef was meat.  That is how important beef is to this country.</P>
      <P>We must promote it better and assure people it is safe; this is also up to the Government.  Our first case of BSE was in 1989 and probably received too much publicity, as Senator D'Arcy said.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry did not help at times.  Its television advertisement featured a cow staggering; this did not project a good image.</P>
      <P>I am sceptical of some BSE outbreaks. Farmers have to be compensated for any disease outbreaks.  I had an outbreak of brucellosis on my farm and I understand the hardship disease can cause.  We were not adequately compensated but it appears BSE compensation is attractive for some farmers. A case is now being investigated, as the Minister knows.  One newspaper stated that cows had been imported from the North to infect a herd.  In another recent case a farmer gave poitín to a cow so that she would stagger around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of the farming community and every morning I listen to &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo;, presented by a man earning in excess of £250,000.  A regular part of his show is devoted to <Col N="2007" /> condemning farmers.  One morning he mentioned those who use illegal substances but their numbers are minimal. I am completely against the use of those substances because it does not help farmers who are trying to make a living and is not good for consumer confidence in beef.  The secretary of the ICMSA, Mr. Dónal Murphy, said recently that the courts are too lenient with people who are charged with the use of illegal substances.  They should be made pay whatever fine is due because they are doing harm to Irish agriculture. More detective work should be done in this field to ensure consumer confidence.</P>
    <P>There has been crisis after crisis in the beef industry since last October.  The BSE ban imposed on Britain on 20 March affected Ireland and put great pressure on the Minister and the Government, who are not doing enough to ensure farmers will not suffer.  The failure to make any political response led to the difficulties in the departure lounge of Dublin Airport last week.  At a stroke of a pen one-third of the output of our biggest industry was branded as not acceptable in Russia.  Beef from three counties was banned but while that is only three out of 26, they are three large counties.  Factories will not accept cattle bought from another county but kept in one of those counties.</P>
    <P>Since March there have been repeated calls for a determined political response from the Government but it has not happened.  The Taoiseach and Tánaiste effectively abdicated their responsibility to rural Ireland.  Despite beef being our biggest industry, they have sat out this spiralling crisis.

      <P>It was the Government's consistent failure to treat BSE as a serious political issue that led directly to Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan being sold out on 12 October.  The Minister claimed markets would be reopened when operational Protocols were sorted out.  He has only his own incompetence to blame if he found himself with a gun to his head and five minutes in which to sign a deal which ditched one-third of his biggest industry. Only colossal ineptitude would have made any negotiator throw in his hand on 12 October when faced with an ultimatum of a 1 November deadline.  He could have played for time to make a better deal or at least one not which would not be as severe as this.  It has opened the door for other countries to follow suit.  <i>The Examiner</i> reports today that &ldquo;Russia's copycats threaten beef sales&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>What news did the Minister bring back?  Has he visited Iran?  What has made farmers most angry is that in the weeks preceding last weekend the Minister insisted that there were no problems with the Russian market. He glossed over the issue in response to questioning in the Dáil.  He also denied there was a problem at the International Ploughing Championships in Carlow.  However, we now know that not only is there a problem but it has been allowed to get out of control.  The Minister's handling of the issue has been incompetent.</P>
      <P>An extraordinary and unexplained feature of this fracas was the way in which the Minister caved in to a 1 November ultimatum on 11 October.  He could and should have prolonged the talks to play for time.  This would have given the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs an opportunity to make a political approach.  I take both to task for not getting more involved in this crisis.</P>
      <P>Given the importance of relations between the EU and Russia it is inconceivable that the country that holds the Presidency of the EU cannot exercise leverage.

    <P>
      <Col N="2010" /> The failure by the Government to respond to the call by Fianna Fáil for the establishment of a Cabinet subcommittee chaired by the Taoiseach to address the BSE crisis as a political priority has led to the present situation.

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to ask the financial institutions to waive referral fees for beef farmers and those who find themselves in financial difficulties because of the BSE crisis and the collapse of the beef industry.  It is also important to introduce subsidised loans, with an interest rate of, say, 5 per cent, to ensure that beef farmers can stay in <Col N="2011" /> business.  At present interest rates are too high for some farmers.  Perhaps the Minister will address this in his reply.</P>
      <P>It is also important to expedite the payment of the special beef premiums to help the industry and farmers.  The farmers' charter, which the Minister launched with such euphoria, stated it would be paid within two months of the retention date.  However, that is not happening.  Farmers who submitted applications last January for the special beef premium should have been paid by May or June but they have not received payment to date.  Regardless of whether regulations would prevent it, the payment of that premium would help farmers. The Minister should ensure these payments are effected more promptly, and immediately if possible.</P>
      <P>There was much criticism on the radio this morning of the protestations of farm leaders.  However, they are entitled to protest as much as employers or employees if their incomes are being reduced.  We all pity the workers in Packard Electric and much money has been invested by the IDA in multinationals and other operations. However, Mr. Pat Kenny is earning in excess of £250,000 of taxpayers' money and any funds invested in farming is money well spent because there are many spin off industries</P>

      <P>I met a contractor recently whose business is affected as a result of the poor incomes in farming. There are spin off benefits when farmers make money and earn a decent livelihood.  However, that is not the case at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the most disturbing aspects of the Government's response to the crisis <Col N="2012" /> has been the cynical news management by the Minister.  He has repeatedly outlined an imminent doomsday scenario as the months of negotiations continued. By setting the bottom line so low he has effectively sold out the interests of Irish farmers.  The Minister's overriding concern is to avoid the possibility of a politically damaging defeat at any cost.</P>
    <P>To serve this personal political strategy, he has perfected to a fine art the tactic of avoiding meaningful political engagement.  He dumped the national interest and abdicated his responsibility rather than risk his own political capital. Farmers are the pawns in the Minister's game plan and as such they are seen as of little value, except in relation to what they can achieve for more important protagonists.  I appeal to the Minister to devote more time to this matter and to treat it seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The current problems in the beef industry did not start with the BSE scare in the House of Commons on 20 March but some time previously.  The problems will not be solved by blaming them on the BSE crisis.</P>
      <P>Senators will recall that the IFA held a briefing session in Buswells Hotel on 7 February as a result of the 6p a pound fall in the price of beef.  The organisation called it the cattle price income crisis.  Senators will also recall that when CAP was reformed and the GATT agreement was put in place, it was anticipated that the price of beef would fall.  A subsidy of approximately £200 for each male animal was introduced to compensate for this reduction.  At that time, area aid was also introduced for cereal growers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The beef industry, which is worth approximately £1.7 billion annually, was handled in a disgraceful manner by some of its largest players.  Senators should refresh their memories by reading the beef tribunal report about what went on in the industry at that time.  It was a national disgrace and would have <Col N="2013" /> been regarded as treason in any other country.</P>
    <P>Some farmers also severely damaged the industry when they used the banned substance angel dust.  It is clear that some of the beef plants and these farmers had an understanding regarding the use of that substance.  It is no wonder that consumer confidence in beef which was already at a low ebb led to a falling off in consumption.  Before the BSE scare in the House of Commons on 20 March, consumption of beef had fallen by 8 per cent across Europe and that figure is now higher than 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>While it is impossible to do much about the reformed CAP and GATT in the short term, the Minister is doing a lot of good work to restore confidence in the beef industry and this is the route we have to take.  He has tightened procedures in the beef plants and farmers who had been using angel dust are now finding it unprofitable to continue doing so.  This is a positive development.</P>
    <P>In 1989, when Senator O'Kennedy was Minister for Agriculture, he introduced what was known as the slaughter policy.  In 1990 he also introduced a ban on meat and bone meal.  It appeared from these measures that positive action was being taken in relation to the slaughter policy.  It was thought that all animals from an infected herd were being slaughtered and removed from the food chain.  I now understand that the only animal taken out was the infected animal.  Can the Minister tell us what is the present position?</P>
    <P>As regards meat and bone meal, again it is clear that the compounders continued to use it in rations despite being banned by the Minister in 1990. Were the introduction of the slaughter policy in 1989 and the ban on meat and bone meal in 1990 merely cosmetic moves?  Has any action been taken on foot of these measures?  Can the Minister clarify this because it is an important point?</P>
    <P>The Minister has been criticised for the deal he made with Russia.  However, before we criticise him, we should take a business-like look at the situation.  What <Col N="2014" /> would have been the position of all our beef producers if the Russians had not taken up their contract of 300,000 cattle?  It would have left us with a large number of cattle not taken up.  The safety net intervention network would almost certainly have come into play and the most farmers would have received for their cattle would have been 78p per pound.  That would not have been very satisfactory.  However, because the Minister succeeded in offloading 300,000 head of cattle on to the Russian market, the three counties which have been left out will not see their prices fall.</P>
    <P>While I deplore the fact that the Minister had to exclude Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan he had no option.  He acted in the national interest and he deserves our congratulations.  He did not go down the road of political play acting.  He had no alternative and, being an honourable man, he did what was in the country's best interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the IFA did an excellent job with the compensation farmers received for their beef.  I know several factory workers who lost their jobs and small businessmen who lost a great amount because of the BSE scare. I do not think they received any compensation. The Minister and the IFA have done a good job in that regard.</P>
    <P>Mr. Goodman announced at the ploughing championship in Carlow that the beef contract with Russia was in the bag.  I wonder where he got that information. Over the past number of years some journalists and politicians have begun to work on the principle of a small boy throwing mud at a wall &mdash; very little sticks in the beginning but if he stays at it for long enough a great deal will stick.  The mud being thrown at the Minister will not stick because he has gone down the right road.</P>
    <P>During the beef tribunal, the Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring; Deputy Rabbitte of Democratic Left; and the former Deputy Mac Giolla of the Workers' Party refused to divulge where they got their information on the scams and <Col N="2015" /> downright fraud in the beef industry.  I congratulate the three of them on not disclosing the sources of their information. They acted in the national interest because members of the public now know they can point out wrongdoing to some politicians without having their names broadcast around the country.</P>
    <P>While it is unsatisfactory that Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan were excluded from the contract, the Minister did the best job he could.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all prefer if this debate were not taking place.  We would also prefer if everything said today were said in the best interests of trying to rescue the beef industry from the present crisis.  It is a difficult and delicate job to be both objective and honest at the same time, but I hope the contributions will be based on full disclosure of information and, on that basis, maximum consumer confidence. It is essential when dealing with consumers, either at home or abroad, to tell the full story at all times because they are the people on whom we rely.</P>
      <P>This is an issue of credibility and confidence. I do not intend to spend much time discussing the Minister's credibility because, important though that may be for him and for the Government, the credibility of our industry is of much more importance.  We must concentrate on the significant need to restore confidence in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision taken by the Minister at Dublin Airport, which, as I indicated in another forum, was an unprecedented and extraordinary place to conclude negotiations of such importance, was taken at the last minute and under pressure.  I acknowledge those circumstances would not allow any Minister the scope, judgment and balance which he would want to apply to such a decision.  That is why the Minister freely acknowledged and conceded there is, in his own words, no scientific basis for this decision.  He has also said there was no statistical basis for it.  Therefore, the <Col N="2016" /> Minister has been forced to justify and vindicate a conclusion which he acknowledges is not based on scientific or mathematical data.  That is a very difficult position for any Minister and I sympathise with him for having to defend it.  However, I am only concerned about the impact of this on consumer confidence around the world.</P>
    <P>This decision does not concern regionalisation.  Counties were selected which are a long way from each other &mdash; Cork is a long way from Monaghan. This unique breakdown of our island status is unprecedented and disastrous. It does not compare with the regionalisation precedent in France cited by the Minister.  Brittany is a very big region in the north-west of France.  Such regions are not comparable to our small counties.</P>
    <P>Tipperary, one of the counties concerned, is surrounded by eight other counties.  I am sure the Minister and his advisers are aware that marts in Roscrea, County Tipperary, take most of their product from Laois and Offaly with only a small proportion coming from Tipperary.  On the other hand, the marts in Birr and Portumna, which are not in Tipperary, take most of their product from Tipperary.  Those are some of the ridiculous anomalies which arise from this.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledged there has been no incidence of BSE in south Tipperary. However, farmers in south Tipperary are being excluded from the Russian market unlike farmers in Limerick, where the incidence of BSE is at a much higher level &mdash; the Minister has the figures from his Department &mdash; than in south Tipperary where it does not exist. How can those anomalies be explained?</P>
    <P>We want to restore confidence in the industry nationwide.  I am worried that, as a consequence of this unprecedented decision, other countries will take the opportunity of demanding at least the same conditions in order to reassure their consumers and establish their political weight and muscle.  Will the Minister confirm or deny that Iran, which accounts for £70 million of our exports, <Col N="2017" /> and Libya, which accounts for £100 million of our exports, are seeking the same conditions?  Will the Minister tell them that Russian consumers are in a privileged, special position?  He will not concede that &mdash; he does not accept it himself &mdash; to Libyan and Iranian consumers.</P>
    <P>How can we go to those markets now?  When the first outbreaks of BSE occurred, our competitors, as is the nature of competitive trade, spread the word about our incidence of BSE in 1989 and 1990.  I went to Iran a number of times to meet my counterparts there and they came here.  Our veterinary surgeons met their counterparts.  However, a Minister never had a gun put to his head by any veterinary officer.  I would never have accepted that.  A veterinary officer has a legitimate but different role to play.  He has to answer to his superiors, to whom he wants to be able to demonstrate that he forced the Irish Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to do this or that.  That is the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>This issue has been building up since 20 March and the infamous statement of the Secretary of State for Agriculture in the House of Commons.  At the time we seemed not to recognise that the problem was not caused by an increased number of cases in Ireland but by the feeling that there was a link between CJD and BSE.  No such link has been established by any information I have. Equally, it is important to say that there is no evidence of any transmissibility at all.  There was no evidence of transmissibility of BSE from animal to human in the scientific data I saw when I was dealing with this issue as Minister for Agriculture.  It is time we made a very clear distinction between the situation in Britain, where there was and is an outbreak, and Ireland, where we have had isolated cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and his Minister of State should be very careful.  I assume the speech delivered by the Minister of State in this House last week was <Col N="2018" /> drafted with the authority of the Minister, unless things have changed greatly in the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Food.  The Minister of State said in this House that it must be recognised that Ireland has BSE.  In the context of Britain having BSE he said it must be recognised that we have it too, without making the sharp distinction that Ireland has had 153 cases and has slaughtered over 21,000 animals, whereas Britain has had 165,000 cases.  I am not aware of any slaughter policy being introduced in Britain.  Why should the two situations be mentioned in the same breath?  Why should a Minister here convey the impression, in a casual statement that was clearly not properly examined, that we both have BSE cases?  There is no comparison, and never was.</P>
    <P>I do not claim, as the Minister said on some television programme recently, to have done a great job.  I do not boast that for myself.  I only state as a fact that during the period when I dealt with this issue, I took responsibility on behalf of the Irish nation as a one-island entity, which has always been our strength.  The Minister will be aware that this was recognised both by the International Epizootic Office in Paris, the Standing Veterinary Committee of the European Union, and the United States Department of Agriculture under white country status.  I only claim to have vindicated that status as a nation, as an island country.  That is what the Minister has underlined.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the circumstances were more difficult for the current Minister than they were for me, because I did not face the need to respond to any such foolish statement, except on one similar occasion when Mrs. Edwina Currie made a statement on salmonella which was undermining the confidence of our poultry industry in Laois, Monaghan, Cavan and all around.  I reacted immediately to that statement and demonstrated the difference to the markets, as the Minister will be aware, between the Irish poultry industry and the British poultry industry, with a very significant <Col N="2019" /> self imposed policy which we oversaw in the Department.  We kept the markets open for Irish poultry when Britain was closed, and properly so.  That is what the present Minister should have been doing.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Senator D'Arcy, a fellow county man, who said that it is ridiculous that beef, which is full of health giving ingredients, is now becoming a matter of scare, contamination and worry.  Poultry imports, as I know from my experience in dealing with the salmonella outbreak in Europe, represent about 25 per cent of the total poultry consumption of this country. This poultry is coming from salmonella infected countries.  Why are we not being heard on that?  This is a much more serious risk than any claim that the few cases of BSE we have are a risk to health when this claim is not held up by any scientific understanding.  We should be pursuing the quality assurance and traceability aspects of this situation. I acknowledge that the Minister is facing a more difficult situation than I faced in my time, but I addressed what I had to face.  I will say no more than that.  I do not want to claim any further credit.  Let the record speak for itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have my full support. He will be aware of the fact that as Minister I introduced legislation to deal with clenbutherol.  I wish RTÉ would stop using the euphemism &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo;. It is not angel dust.  It is poison dust, it is devil dust and I wish everyone would stop using that euphemism.  It is acting in a diabolical fashion to poison our beef industry.  When it first emerged, I introduced special legislation to increase the penalties for its use.  The Minister, the Department and the DPP have my full support in all they do in that area.</P>
    <P>We did the right thing when we introduced the slaughter policy.  This Minister could equally have been the one to introduce it but he was not in office at the time.  I introduced the slaughter policy, paying full market value at the top end of the market for BSE infected <Col N="2020" /> beef, no matter what the cost, which has now come to over £14 million for 153 cases.  However, it has become clear that some rogues have abused a scheme that was introduced to protect the name and status of Irish beef.  Any evidence the Minister or the DPP can get in such cases will have my vigorous support.</P>
    <P>I see no basis for selecting certain counties and introducing a new concept there.  If any one county was to be selected, it should not have been Tipperary, not because it is my home place, but because we are surrounded by seven or eight other counties.  It would be difficult to put in place a policy for Tipperary, as if Tipperary was in the north west or the south east, like Wexford, the Minister's constituency.  It is particularly difficult when the number of cases of BSE in Tipperary is exactly the same as in Wexford this year.  Wexford had one case last year when Tipperary had none, you had five in the last two years when we had four.  The cattle population of Tipperary, for what it is worth, is two and a half times the cattle population of Wexford.  How can any Russians, looking at those figures, say that they selected Tipperary but found Wexford was fine?  I do not find that credible.  I do not want to see Wexford penalised as well but I do not find that decision credible.</P>
    <P>I will support any action the Minister wants to take to restore the good name of Irish beef which was always at the very top of the market.  I have said through my membership of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs, and I know the Chairman conveyed this to the Government, that those of us on that committee with some experience of this area are ready, if the Government wants our support, to go those markets with the Government's instruction or guidance, on an all party basis, to demonstrate that we want full, free and open discussion.  This is a matter of very considerable importance for the Minister.  It would also have been so for me.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry produces thorny problems from time to time which are <Col N="2021" /> not necessarily of any Minister's making.</P>
    <P>The status of our industry at this point is far more important than the status of any one Minister, whoever that Minister may be.  The Minister has my support and good wishes in trying to solve the problem, but he will not have my support for any specious argument that suggests that someone looking at these figures found that these three counties jumped out at one when the level of incidence in those counties is lower, at least in my own county of Tipperary, than in some of the counties, like Wexford, which have a higher level of cases.  That is the credibility that is under question at this time.  I hope we do not have any further occasion on which to discuss this.</P>
    <P>In today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> it is stated that we are being presented with a good agreement under pressure. The Russian veterinary inspector has said if we have other cases, they will reserve the right to extend the ban further or reject everything.  The Minister and his best veterinary adviser could not say to anyone there will not be any other cases.  If that is a record of what was concluded at Dublin airport, I worry even more.</P>

Is it any wonder as a result of what transpired at the beef tribunal that the Russians stated they will not take second class beef?  In other words, they will not be fooled as they were before we had beef tribunal.</P>
      <P>The ban on meat and bone meal in animal feed introduced in 1990 was never implemented.  The veterinary inspectors from these countries tell us that if it had been implemented we would not have the current problem. What was the point of introducing a ban and not implementing it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>The previous speaker talked about the great decision to introduce depopulation.  The only animal of the depopulated herd which did not enter the food chain was the one diagnosed with BSE.  Recently, the Minister made a decision that none of the depopulated herd would enter the food chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter is extremely serious.  I look at the damage that has been done over the last number of days by politicians mainly those of the two Opposition parties.  The Leader of the main Opposition party and his spokesperson on agriculture, food and forestry are engaging in national sabotage.  There is no question but the more the issue is hyped up, the more our competitors <Col N="2023" /> gain from the statements and comments made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem must be much worse than we think.  I remember a little over 20 years ago we cut the corn and sent it to the local co-operative.  It was our main source of income.  A receiver was appointed and the co-operative was in liquidation.  We were faced with a situation where we could take 80p in the pound or get no money.  That was the agreement reached after long negotiations.  Is there anybody in this House who, faced with the same position as the Minister, would not take 90 per cent of the market?  Those of us involved in business know what the Minister had to do when presented with the facts by the Russian veterinary authority. We hear much talk from these so-called politicians who pretend they know better than the Minister.</P>
      <P>The farming leaders say there should have been intervention at the highest level.  There was such intervention for a month because the Russians had not decided whether to take any more beef from Ireland.  They do not need to worry about Irish beef as they can get supplies from other counties.  Following these high level negotiations, it was agreed that the Russians would send over their veterinary inspectors.  They spent a week visiting factories, abattoirs, farms and having discussions with the authorities and the politicians.  They were given the authority to decide the issue on the basis of the information on the ground.  That is how business is done and the Russians are treating this as business.  I have no doubt the decision was not made lightly but no farmer or businessman I have met over the last four days said the Minister did not make the right decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Others will say that their county is excluded from the contract and we <Col N="2024" /> regret that.  There is a duty on us to ensure there is a reduced incidence of BSE and that the rigours of the law will be brought to bear on people who are accused of introducing the disease into particular counties.  If people distort the number of cases in these counties, they should be put out of business.  People fiddle with the facts and distort the numbers for example, in the Monaghan and Tipperary cases and the one in Cork which has gone on for three or four years and has not been dealt with yet.  People have told me that if red lead is injected into animals it will have the same effect as BSE.  We are dealing with people at political level who are prepared to create national sabotage, hyping up the issue so that every day pages of information are sent to our competitors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We were led to believe that further negotiations should have taken place in relation to this deal.  It is important to point out that it takes three weeks after contracts have been signed for them to be filled.  The closing of the market for any length of time and a decision not to continue with the particular market could have led to a sharp <Col N="2025" /> decrease in the money being paid to farmers for their animals.</P>
      <P>It is important to note the Minister has secured approximately £70 million in compensation for last year's beef winter finishers and that for the first time heifer finishers received compensation. I hope next week's negotiations for compensation will be as successful for finishers on the grass for the past four months as they have been for the winter finishers.  The animals which the farmers I represent bought over 12 months ago are losing more over the grass period than the winter finishers.  I hope farmers will receive similar compensation for their heifer finishers.</P>
      <P>BSE put the beef industry into a tailspin and resulted in the reduction in cattle prices.  CAP reform was beginning to bite when prices in the factories were reduced by 6p or 7p last spring and before the famous speech in the House of Commons.  CAP reform under Mr. MacSharry, aided and abetted by Fianna Fáil, was going to ensure that beef would be about 85p per pound when it was fully implemented.  No one disagrees with those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ensure beef farmers are kept in business with whatever support can be achieved from the Agriculture Ministers. We must ensure we have a sustained market and that there are farmers in the marts purchasing store cattle. If the Russian market was closed, we would spend a year or two negotiating to get it reopened; this happened before.  If it was not opened, what would be the consequence for the remainder of this year and for the 25 per cent of the animals available to this market next year?  I have no doubt we have a fight on our hands as regards other markets. However, if we do not hype the situation into something which can only be called sabotage, we can sell the fact that we have a low number of BSE cases; unfortunately, it is the second highest in Europe, but the number of cases is only 150.  If responsibility is placed on the shoulders of those in the industry they might come to the fore in trying to wipe out this scourge.  If the ban on meat and <Col N="2026" /> bone meal introduced in 1990 had been enforced, we might not be discussing this topic today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader and the Government Whip for making time available for this important debate.  It was appropriate that we were asked to come back a day early to discuss this vital national matter.  I thank the Minister for attending and for listening to us. It is not my intention to be confrontational; I hope we can be constructive. We are dealing with the largest national industry, the livelihood of over 100,000 farmers, jobs in meat factories and a £2 billion industry.  Because of that, we must adopt a unified national approach. That is not to say I do not have criticisms which I hope will be taken on board and acted on by the Minister.</P>
      <P>On 20 March last we debated this matter.  On that occasion it was not regarded as being important enough for the Minister or the Minister of State to be here.  The debate was taken by the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Durkan.  The other Ministers had more important things to do, like attending to by-elections. On that occasion Minister Durkan said that measures in place have protected the reputation of and market access for Irish beef which is accepted in 80 countries internationally.  That may have been true on 20 March but it is certainly not true today.</P>
      <P>Our response to this national crisis has been characterised by an initial complacency, by reaction and by playing catch up.  I see little evidence of a strategic approach which will bring us out of this crisis and which will confirm to the world that our food, not only our beef, is safe, wholesome and can be consumed with confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week on the Adjournment the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, made a statement which I heard the Minister repeat, that is, that there is BSE.  As far as I recall, certainly in this House, that was the first time this was stated.  This comes back to a point regularly made and which needs to be challenged, <Col N="2027" /> that is, that there is national sabotage involved when people point out the deficiencies in the beef industry.  We help this delusion by saying the international press is watching, that it will seize on these matters, publish them internationally and this will damage our international reputation, and that we had better stay quiet and hope it will go away.  We heap delusion upon delusion. Do we really believe something said in a meat factory in County Kildare or elsewhere is not known by our consumers, customers and competitors shortly afterwards whether it is publicised in the international media?</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, asked what useful purpose would have been served in advertising to the world that we had BSE related difficulties with Russia or in talking about trade restrictions when none actually existed.  Russian difficulties had been reported in the press for several weeks before the matter came to a head.  Throughout that period there was a conspiracy of silence to ensure the matter would not be debated.  It is important for our greatest national industry that these matters are debated and that we can provide the assurances our customers require.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, said that the age and labelling requirements which had been agreed by the Russians would be easy to meet.  As a matter of interest, what are those age and labelling requirements? He also said that the restriction would be reviewed every three months. Are we to assume on the basis of the most recent statement, which we read about in this morning's newspapers, that the review will take place sooner than three months and that Ireland's BSE status has improved?</P>
    <P>It is bizarre, irrespective of whether this agreement had to be made, that this matter was resolved in the departure lounge of Dublin Airport.  I cannot imagine any major beef seller acting on a commercial contract doing a deal on <Col N="2028" /> that basis.  Perhaps I am wrong, but it is bizarre and I wonder who was present.</P>
    <P>I noticed that a Russian epidemiologist is staying in Ireland.  Where are all our epidemiologists?  Where is our science? What are we doing to establish scientifically the safety of Irish beef and reassure our customers?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they have quality vodka.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect the Minister will agree that perception in international markets is everything and if our customers perceive Irish beef is no good, no matter what we say we will have problems convincing them.  One of the most disappointing aspects is the question of limited regionalisation, that is, that three counties must pay the price. How dare anybody say that this matter is not serious?  I do not think the Minister would suggest it is not serious; of course it is serious, irrespective of whether it was right to adopt the present policy.  It is serious for the farmers in the counties concerned and for the country.</P>
      <P>While there may have been an inevitability about all this, I wonder whether all the cards were played.  Did we not have more time?  Was there not a window between the events of 12 October at Dublin Airport and 1 November during which more discussions could have taken place?  It is my information &mdash; and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that the Mayor of Moscow was one of the people who was trying to keep the markets open in Moscow.  It seems that not everybody on the Russian side wanted the markets closed.  My information is to the contrary; there were people on the Russian side, conscious of employment in beef processing in Russia, who wanted to keep that market open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This sets a disastrous precedent.  We have been proud of Ireland's disease free status and moved at every opportunity to protect it at European level when it was threatened.  This is a huge erosion of our claim of disease-free <Col N="2029" /> status.  Was an earlier agreement reached that one Middle East customer would not accept beef from certain individual farms and not just individual counties?</P>
    <P>There is no scientific justification for what has been done and I submit that there is very little statistical justification either.  On whose figures were the Russians acting?  It has been stated that the Russians made the decision themselves and that they used their own figures but they must have got them somewhere. From where did they get them?  Try telling somebody in County Tipperary, County Cork or County Monaghan that this is not scientific justification.  All they are confronted with is a fact based on whatever justification, or lack of justification which brings me back to the question &ldquo;Was there not time?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are things which can be done and I put the proposals to the Minister. First, there must be scientific backup for the industry which can confirm that Irish beef is wholesome and disease free.  There seems to be a dearth of scientific knowledge and epidemiology in respect of the disease, how it occurred and how it spread.  We could say it has got to the point where it has gone beyond an agriculture issue and become a health issue.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that it was British Secretary of State for Health who first raised this matter.  Is there not a role for agencies, other than the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to confirm the credibility of the Irish industry and the health of Irish beef.  Does the Department have the credibility to stand over the produce when international buyers come to our shores to give them the necessary reassurances?</P>
    <P>The issue which arises from that is tracability.  I know the Minister has proposals in that respect but, again, I wonder are we going far enough?  It is now possible to tag animals electronically?  I know of an Irish company which produces such tags.  Can nothing be done to ensure the many movements of animals in Ireland are monitored and to trace problems to the farms from <Col N="2030" /> whence they arose?  I know there is such a system in Northern Ireland and there seems to be a case for modelling our system on it.  I am also aware that international buyers at a trade display earlier in Spain in the year were particularly impressed by the Northern Ireland system.</P>
    <P>How do we create the atmosphere among international customers and consumers that our beef is good and safe? I accept it is good and safe and that Ireland has some of the best produce in the world but I sometimes wonder whether our green positive image of beef produced off grass is what we think people in Europe and elsewhere should believe rather than the reality.  I commend the work being done by An Bord Bia in adverse circumstances in trying to find and promote markets for Irish beef but all its work will be for nothing unless the consumers are convinced that the produce is safe and healthy.  We need an inspectorate independent of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry which will incorporate representatives of the Department, Teagasc, the Department of Health, the veterinary profession, producers, processors, major retailers and consumers so that we can tell buyers that the produce is the best and is safe for consumption.</P>
    <P>Last June when we debated the Bord Bia Bill I made a suggestion which the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, agreed to put to the Minister, that is, that there should be a national food forum.  All interests in the industry should be brought together to devise a strategy because there is plenty of experience on how agricultural produce should be marketed.  All those people can be of assistance to the Minister and he should avail of their advice and expertise.  The Cabinet has a responsibility to support the Minister.  There must be no equivocation on the part of any party in Government or, indeed, in Opposition in terms of ensuring that this vital national industry is secure and that those employed in it, and the farmers who rely on it, will be protected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2031" /> After 20 March we said the customer would rule and the consumer would be king.  It has taken us a long time to come to that position.  There was a great deal of resistance to having a consumer on the board of An Bord Bia until the Minister agreed to one consumer representative in June.  That consumer representative is now a member of the board.</P>
    <P>I am not sure there was a genuine acceptance that the intervention era had ended and that we had better produce the goods required by the markets, which must then be sold in a very competitive environment.  We must show the world that our produce is of the highest quality and can be relied upon.  Assurance is required from the veterinary, scientific and medical professions to confirm Ireland's health status otherwise An Bord Bia's work will be undermined. We must stop engaging in a rearguard defence based on reaction rather than adoption of a strategy.</P>
    <P>The people who speak about the defects in the industry are not responsible for national sabotage.  Those who use angel dust, repackage beef and sell it as something other than it is and tamper with tags and animals while protesting that TB is not being eradicated are responsible for national sabotage, not the people who highlight such matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The beef industry is crucial to the economy and rural areas and it has taken a battering in recent years.  It was still recovering from the hands-off approach of the last Fianna <Col N="2032" /> Fáil led Government, as evidenced by the beef tribunal, when the BSE crisis struck.  Today, the industry must also contend with the activities of a minority of rogue operators whose greed has led them to use illegal growth promoters.  I have heard little condemnation of such people by the spokesmen for the farming organisations who have seen fit to condemn the Minister.  Fianna Fáil is aware that the Minister had no other short-term option but to agree to a ban on beef from three counties as an alternative to losing the entire trade with Russia, valued at approximately £300 million.</P>
      <P>The difficulties with the Russian market are not new.  The then USSR first raised concerns about BSE infected Irish beef in 1989.  In July 1993, the Russian authorities suspended imports again because of BSE related concerns. That ban was lifted following the visit of a high level Russian veterinary delegation to Ireland.  It is only since 1994 that a continual commercial trade was developed with the Russian beef market. It is only due to the efforts of the Minister and his Department that the Russian market remained open following the development of the latest BSE crisis in March.  In recent months, when Russian concerns regarding the increasing level of BSE in Ireland were again raised, the Government did everything possible to maintain the trade with that market.  I understand that the Taoiseach contacted the Russian President, the Tánaiste contacted the Russian Foreign Minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry contacted the Russian Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period in question the Government, unlike its predecessor led by Fianna Fáil, was conscious of the need to maintain confidence in Irish beef and, therefore, refrained from broadcasting any developing difficulties in the Russian market.  It was stated earlier that on 12 October the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was faced with a clear and unpalatable choice. I live in a rural area and I can state that people understand the problem. <Col N="2033" /> Their analysis of this situation is that the Minister did everything in his power.  He was faced with a choice to either accept the Protocol put forward by the Russian authorities excluding the purchase of beef from Counties Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan or await the imposition of a total ban on 1 November.  I represent farmers in one of the counties affected by this partial ban but I recognise that the Minister had no choice and he acted in the national interest.  Had he adopted the wait and see attitude familiar from successive Fianna Fáil led Administrations, he would have been criminally negligent.  The net result of such action or inaction would have been the exclusion of Irish producers from a market with an import requirement of almost 500,000 tonnes of beef.</P>
    <P>I have already stated my belief that north and east County Cork should be excluded from the ban which should be limited to those areas in the west of the county where cases of BSE have been identified.  It is extraordinary that these cases were identified in one area of west County Cork.  However, there is now a greater focus and we will see the end of the use of this agent once and for all.</P>

      <P>I shall continue to make strong representations in this regard, which I hope the Minister will take on board.  I am confident he will continue to negotiate strongly for a solution which is in the interests of the Irish beef industry.</P>
      <P>All is not lost, however, because yesterday an individual paid £6,000 per acre for land in County Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to make some pragmatic points regarding the Russian market and the BSE crisis.  It is extraordinary when one considers the hysteria that has been drummed up.  I understand the hysterical posturing of the Opposition parties in that they are attempting to take a shot at the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's party provided a good example when in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I cannot understand the logic behind such a reaction. I am aware that Senator Byrne lives in County Tipperary and has a particular difficulty with the Minister's decision but he had no choice.  It is extremely important that the Russian market be kept open to Irish farmers and the beef industry but it is unfortunate that three counties have been affected by this ban.</P>
      <P>Local IFA committees raised their voices in anger at the Minister's decision.  However, it is difficult to comprehend the stand taken by the IFA at national level.  That organisation is supposed to represent all Irish farmers.  If the Minister did what the IFA wanted, the beef industry would have come to a halt and there would be no market.  The Russian market is the largest available to Ireland at present and the IFA failed to state why it adopted this approach at national level.  Why did the president of the IFA and its major players take this decision?  They have been asked to provide reasons the Minister should not have agreed to the short-term banning of three counties.  If there were no markets open to the beef industry, the country would be in dire straits &mdash; economically and in other ways &mdash; and farmers would protest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be congratulated for the difficult decision he made.  I believe Deputy Yates is the best Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry <Col N="2035" /> the country has had for many years.  I am proud he is a member of my party and I have the utmost confidence that he had the ability, energy and capability to solve the problems faced by the beef and agriculture industries.</P>
    <P>We must try to restore consumer confidence. An Bord Bia has done great work over the last few months in this regard with the support of the Minister and his Department.  However, scare-mongering tactics have been employed with regard to BSE and CJD.  It has not been proved that BSE will affect humans.  It is like saying that one should not cross the street in case one might be knocked down by a bus.</P>
    <P>Political parties, especially those in Opposition, must work in the national interest.  It is fine to raise political issues and make political points but when the national interest depends on what individuals may say, they must consider the consequences.</P>
    <P>We must try to restore consumer confidence in Europe.  The third country markets are important for us and, with the co-operation of the Russians and the farming communities in the counties affected, I have no doubt this ban will be lifted over the next few months. What the Minister has built into the deal with the Russians will assist in achieving that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a sense of <i>déja vu</i> about this debate.  I have been an Independent Member of this House for ten years.  I do not share the view of some of my Independent colleagues that being Independent puts one on a high moral ground.  I congratulate people in political parties on their work.  However, I have witnessed the craw thumping of Members on the Government benches when they were in Opposition.  I heard it when the then EU Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, tried to reform CAP and when the farmers marched against the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey.  The country has been well served in the past by Ministers responsible for agriculture <Col N="2036" /> and it is well served by the present Minister.  I wish those in Opposition could see that and remember it when in Government.</P>
      <P>Senator Reynolds's point about the Opposition would be well remembered by every political party.  In the ten years since becoming a Member of this House I have not heard a balanced debate on agriculture.  I defended Ray MacSharry's proposals on CAP and I was opposed.  Each Minister responsible for agriculture in the last ten years worked to the best of his ability to get the best deal for Irish agriculture.  As with any negotiator, they could never get a deal to satisfy everyone.  It is unfair to personalise the attacks on Ministers.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry had a simple choice.  He was dealing with a market worth about £0.5 billion a year and certain conditions were imposed by those placing the order.  The Minister had a simple alternative &mdash; to keep selling £0.5 billion worth of beef or not.  There could only have been one answer.</P>
      <P>I have sympathy for the farmers in the three counties involved but I also have sympathy for consumers.  Agriculture is the sector in which we have the highest level of public spending.  I make this point repeatedly to the farmers' leaders although they do not like me doing so.  With an expenditure of £2.2 billion in agriculture every year, it takes up more money than education and almost as much as social welfare.</P>
      <P>Legislation dealing with abbatoirs was passed by this House in 1988.  I agree with Senator Sherlock that there has been a growth in confidence in local butchers.  Unfortunately, the restrictions imposed under the abbatoirs Act have stopped consumer development at that level.  I do not know where that money went to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard Members on all sides talk about market forces over the past ten years.  Irish beef prices are approximately twice those of world prices.  I have sympathy for all Irish farmers because such a price difference will not continue.  In ten years time Irish beef <Col N="2037" /> prices will not be double world market prices.  I have not heard any farmers' leaders make that point.  However, I have heard successive Ministers with responsibility for agriculture make it. We put £2 billion a year into an industry which will collapse if farmers cannot plan their output based on a five or ten year strategy and not on the basis of last year's prices.  The industry will collapse if farmers cannot introduce efficiencies. They cannot do so when their output is governed by quotas and when they are dependent on various grants.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to criticise the work of farmers.  Like anyone else, they work to the brief they have at any given time.  If I were a farmer I would be considering what my entitlements might be, what I could get at the mart and what I could get if I export.  The farmers are being taken for a ride.  Farmers borrow money each spring to buy weanlings or sucklers. They condition them for six or seven months and sell them.  If they buy them for 70p a pound and sell them for 101p a pound they have to borrow enough to buy at 70p.  If, however, they were buying at 40p and selling at 71p they would be borrowing less, have cheaper costs and make more profit. That is a simple sum.</P>
    <P>We must move in that direction.  The Minister should set a time scale to do so for the good of Irish agriculture and give farmers confidence in the good job they do.  They must be allowed to plan for the inevitable time when Irish beef prices will match world prices.  At present Irish beef sells for about 90p a pound and the world market price is 45p or 50p a pound.  That will not continue. There are industries working on the basis of that price but I do not know how they do so.  There is something seriously wrong when a person buying on behalf of a meat company in Ireland cannot match the prices being offered by a buyer from Egypt who has to transport the meat halfway across the world. It is a serious reflection on the industry that the Kerry group got out of the red meat sector last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2038" /> My shallow knowledge of the industry would indicate that there seems to be more of a monopoly in operation now than before the beef tribunal.  The industry seems to be in the control of one person.  The farmers will be made fools of once again.  They are led to believe that a grant or subsidy is more important than their job.  If Irish agriculture collapses, it will not be because of BSE but because of global market forces.  If we do not prepare our farmers for that, we will pay a bigger price in the long term.  We should move towards having Irish prices in line with world market prices in a manner which is supportive of farmers and does not make fools of them.</P>
    <P>Since there was a good price for potatoes this year, they will be grown in half the country next year.  It is predictable. I gurantee there will be a ten per cent increase in land tilled for corn next year because this was a good year for it. It is short term planning.  Areas such as agriculture and fisheries are subject to weather and other conditions.</P>
    <P>Beef produced by Irish farmers is the best in the world to my experience.  I have never tasted better than Irish beef. On the other hand, I have spoken to vets who have worked in factories and they have shown me hormone implants taken from carcases.  The court decisions of the last three weeks will do more for consumer confidence in the beef industry and farmers than the £1 billion we have spent on TB testing.</P>
    <P>The Minister came into this House last year during his problematic and high profile row with the vets.  I do not know who won or lost but I concede the matter has settled down.  I criticised the Minister then because I did not agree with the manner in which he dealt with the problem.  I have much confidence in Irish vets who are doing a superb job. However, until every single movement of cattle is monitored, we will not control diseases, a point made by Senator Dardis.  This cannot be done if a vet must fill in 13 different forms in reporting a reactor and then wear a suit of mail so he will not be attacked by the <Col N="2039" /> herd owner.  We must fund this area to ensure confidence.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be vindicated as this was the only decision he could have made.  He had no choice.  He could have been cuter and announced the loss of the Russian market, waited for the row and then announced he had managed to secure exports from 23 counties.  A halo would have then been put over his head. Maybe that is what he should do the next time.  If that is what it takes to sell a good deal, that is what must be done.</P>

    <P>The problems facing the beef industry cannot be underestimated.  In a time of <Col N="2040" /> family crisis, the family should always stick together.  Unfortunately, the lack of national loyalty and the hungry head of politics has reared again.  It is unfortunate that this is seen as an opportunity to put down, walk on, slur and blackguard the Minister.  This current crisis has built up over the years.  BSE has not appeared in the last six months but has been a growing problem in the UK and, unfortunately, Ireland has suffered the effects.</P>
    <P>A journalist from <i>The Irish Times</i> said on the one o'clock news that he was in Russia recently and met the chief veterinary inspector.

      <P>I wish to put on the record what was said on the one o'clock news, not what the Minister said.  Professor Sheehy, a highly respected individual in agriculture, said unhesitatingly that the Minister saved the Russian market.  That gives the lie to the slurs made against the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Belton for sharing his time with me.  We are debating the major industry in Ireland. We must ensure consumers are happy with the product they buy, otherwise we will have problems.  Our beef and milk products are the best in the world.  That is something we must get across to people because there has been a decline in the quality of our marketing.  An Bord Bia have had problems in marketing our products because of use of illegal hormones and brucellosis, for <Col N="2041" /> example.  Overall, we have an excellent product to market and the sooner it is marketed the better.</P>
      <P>We have been fortunate in having Deputy Yates as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry during the furore arising from the sale of beef to Russia.  His handling of this affair has been skilled.  He understands the issue and had the ability to negotiate a good deal for farmers.  Senator Belton is correct in quoting what Professor Sheehy said on the radio.  If the Russian market had been lost, it would have been a catastrophe for the beef market because there would have been a glut as cattle are now coming off grass.  I attended a number of marts in the midlands yesterday. There was a good trade for cattle yesterday, which would not have been the case if we had lost the Russian market. Russia buys approximately 400,000 tonnes of beef per year and Ireland is probably the main supplier with 120,000 tonnes.  This market is worth £300 million per year to Ireland and if we had lost that it would have been a catastrophe, as Professor Sheehy rightly said, because we would have lost not only the Russian market but all other markets. Mr. Séamus Martin, the Russian correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i>, reported that Mr. Avilov, the chief Russian veterinary inspector who met the Minister last week, said Russia had been considering a total ban on Irish beef.</P>
      <P>We must look back over what has taken place, particularly during the beef tribunal.  This is not a political point but for its own sake and that of the industry Fianna Fáil would be better not to cause a furore.  When it had the opportunity it did not lead by example, as can be seen from the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The courts have been successful in bringing convictions.  It is high time many more were charged and I am pleased with the Supreme Court decision.  The Department of Health and the Minister should seriously consider imposing a mandatory sentence on anyone found using illegal growth promoters. The farming organisations <Col N="2042" /> should expel such people and name them publicly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I offer my sympathy to farmers, particularly those in the three counties concerned.  I do not include the IFA in that because that body does not need sympathy but lessons in economics and marketing.  In particular, it should look at the issue from the buyer's point of view.  I also offer my sympathy to the Minister who was caught in a position where no one would want to be but has weathered the storm well.</P>
      <P>The nation should have learned the lesson last week that one can have a product for sale but there is no guarantee anyone will want to buy it, particularly if there is a question mark over it. To listen to the IFA one would get the impression that if one has a product for sale one can compel people to buy it.  Its performance last week was incredible and defied logic.  Its spokespersons should have stood back and listened to what they were saying.</P>
      <P>Can we compel people in Russia to buy our beef?  That is obviously a rhetorical question but other questions should be raised.  Why is BSE on the increase this year?  We put a strict regime in place in 1988 or 1989 to control BSE but the cows that are now stricken with the disease were not born at that stage.  Does anyone in Ireland know anything about BSE?  Are we waiting for information from sources outside the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;rather than doing sensible research into diseases like this? We keep saying beef is our most important export but we are not taking great care of it.  The amount of money which successive Governments have put into research and development, research in particular, is not adequate. We invest considerable money in developing the progeny of cattle but not enough resources are devoted to animal health.  Would we have fed offal to cattle if we had discovered it was bad <Col N="2043" /> for them and would produce this disease?</P>
      <P>A country which continues to claim that beef is more important to it than to any of our EU partners should invest heavily to protect that market.  Will the Minister state what investment we currently make in animal health?  This disease is interfering with our markets and destroying a large proportion of our national output.  Is the IFA putting money into such empirical research, which should be happening all the time? That association has substantial and lucrative investments in Spain; has it made investments in Ireland which are designed to protect the welfare of a market it was screaming about in such ludicrous terms last week?  I assume it has not and, if it is serious, it should cash in its investments in Spain and elsewhere and reinvest some money at home to protect the good name of the product which is so important to us.  Let us take a partnership approach to the research required to protect the product. The IFA should come to terms with that because we have much work to do.</P>
      <P>The industry finds it difficult to get the resources necessary for research because it has low added value.  Governments down the years who have failed to put enough money into the area must take the blame for that.  We are proud of the beef we produce and we should invest in research.  I am glad I had the opportunity to make these points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not enough time to do justice to the issue or the jobs involved both on the farm and the factory floor.  We should not have to scrounge for time.  We often spend longer debating minor issues and this debate should have continued until at least 7.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>This is a serious matter.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry made a bad deal on bad advice but I am not here to knock him, rather to tell him not to take that advice in future.  An entire industry is at stake and I am surprised that he, a man from farming stock, took that advice because our other markets are endangered through the signing of this agreement with Russia. We may lose more than we will gain because our image has been severely damaged by the suggestion that we have a major problem.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the cherry-picking involved in this deal but perhaps the Minister will explain it. Cork is one of the biggest cattle producing counties in Ireland.  The Department looks on my county as two separate units.  There was no outbreak in one of them.  Does it know what is happening?</P>
      <P>It is time that the Government and farmers' organisations asked if there has been value for money in the past 40 years, whether it be in respect of TB and brucellosis eradication or the handling of BSE.  I believe we are getting very bad value.  There has been much bungling. The approach to the banning of meat and bone meal is an example, where the rules introduced by Senator O'Kennedy when he was Minister for Agriculture and Food were not implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials were partly responsible for the fall of the last Government.  What officials did not do their duty in these instances and why are they still employed by the Minister's Department? A similar situation arose in 1982 when the then Minister for Agriculture was provided with the wrong figures as <Col N="2045" /> he attempted to fight for a quota for farmers.  The official is still in his job. He was not reprimanded or demoted while the small farmers were left with only a few shillings to produce milk because of his inaction and carelessness. It is time there was accountability in the Civil Service, as there is with politicians. The way we have conducted our business over the past 30 to 40 years under successive Governments is a national scandal.  There is blunder after blunder, yet nobody is responsible.</P>
    <P>We have had to deal with reams of red tapes over the years.  We cannot gain confidence for our beef at home, never mind abroad.  Teagasc, An Bord Bia and the Minister's Department have different policies on the promotion of beef.  Similarly, legislation on abattoirs has not been implemented in most counties because the Department fell down on the job.  We visited the Department last year to discuss the situation but the officials did not know what we were talking about.  It cost south County Tipperary £35,000 to subsidise the implementation of the scheme on abattoirs. It has only been implemented in a few counties.  Family butchers had to update their premises and shops at enormous expense, yet they are now put at a disadvantage because they cannot sell their beef as it can be purchased at cheaper prices in adjoining counties.</P>
    <P>On the question of confidence, it was disclosed at a veterinary conference in Kilkenny that people are eating meat that has been slaughtered without any veterinary supervision.  We must get our own house in order.  The Minister's Department has fallen down miserably. A senior reporter from my county will visit Russia before the Minister to show that the system is not as bad as it appears and that the deal was a bad mistake. The Russians should be the last people to talk about quality.  They nearly poisoned the world with radiation and deceived people about the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to use their influence and common <Col N="2046" /> sense.  They should forget about the spin doctors.  They are experienced politicians and they should be attempting to save our image in the national interest, which has been badly damaged by this debacle.</P>
    <P>We have produced 15 million cattle in the past eight years, yet there have been only 150 outbreaks of BSE.  The Minister calls this a crisis, but it is not by comparison with the UK.  If we have a crisis it is because the Minister's Department fell down on the banning of meat and bonemeal.  There are too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  Nobody cares in this country anymore about carrying out their duties with a conscience. Perhaps we would not have had BSE if there had been proper implementation of the regulations introduced by Senator O'Kennedy when he was Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister's Department has advertised for more officials. We would have less problems with BSE, brucellosis and TB if those already working there did their duty.  We are getting bad value for money.  I hope the Minister will provide abattoirs with funding this year because the legislation in this area has not been implemented. The Department has failed miserably on this.  We talk about new markets, yet we cannot even conduct our business at home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not here to pay homage to the Minister, unlike some of my colleagues on the other side of the House.  There has been no response to the BSE crisis since it was announced in the House of Commons on 20 March 1996.  After numerous debates over the past few months, the Minister and officials from his Department have done very little in terms of travelling abroad to ensure that our markets are maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Russian deal, the Minister denied for weeks that there was a problem.  Despite rumours, he sent only his junior Minister to Russia, who later confirmed to the House that we have a BSE crisis.  What plan of <Col N="2047" /> action had the Minister to ensure that the Russian deal would have been confirmed, with the 26 counties supplying the market?</P>
    <P>It was announced that the Minister saved the Russian market worth £300 million, while a veterinary officer from Russia praised the Minister for ensuring the market was kept open.  On what scientific data, be it statistical, epidemiological or otherwise, did he provide figures to the Russian officials to designate Counties Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan as the three counties that would cause problems for Russian consumers? Singling out these counties in this way does not stand up to srutiny, especially Counties Cork and Tipperary.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister confirm announcements to the effect that Saudi Arabia, Iran and Libya may in the near future demand a deal equivalent to the Russians, or even more stringent, debarring more counties from the present scheme which supplies the Russian market?  If so, he has jeopardised the island status of the country, which we fought for years to protect, in addition to our efforts to assure customers at home and abroad that the beef industry had the proper regulations in place and that it was a safe product.  The Minister already undermined this by the agreement he signed with Russia at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>While the Minister's PR machine may still be intact, farmers are not impressed with his handling of this crisis.  While he stood in Carlow for photographs with the beefburgers, he did nothing to travel abroad, or to get the Taoiseach or Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to do so, to ensure that the proper information is disseminated to foreign markets.  He must now do so, because, unfortunately, they are reliant on damaging headlines, not alone in the Irish press but also by our competitors internationally.</P>
    <P>It is time that the farming community and farm leaders became consumer conscious and pointed out to their members that the use of illegal substances is <Col N="2048" /> unacceptable and detrimental to the economy.  We have been too soft in this area.  Laws and regulations have been passed but we have not implemented them.  I hope that over the next few months the few rogue farmers will be brought to justice to ensure that we can fully guarantee that our commodity is safe.  However, to date, I am disappointed with the Minister's response, even though he looks good in photographs from Carlow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Tuesday will go down as one of the darkest days for the beef industry following the announcement of the Russian ban on three major beef producing counties.  People in my area, County Monaghan, cannot believe that the Government and the Minister accepted a deal which repartitions the country and classifies only some beef as pure quality produce.  It is heartbreaking and unbelievable for a county which has worked so hard over the years in building up the industry and becoming one of the top food producing regions in the country and Europe.  It is outrageous and unacceptable that the Minister has agreed to this deal when there is no basis, scientific or otherwise, to justify a ban on any Irish beef, and particularly in relation to produce from Counties Monaghan, Cork and Tipperary.</P>
      <P>Irish agriculture has had a dreadful time since the BSE problem came to a head in March.  Cattle prices have collapsed and farmers have experienced losses of up to £200 an animal. However, this latest development is the biggest bombshell to hit the farming community.  The Government has allowed a third country to create internal barriers in Ireland which will stop certain farmers trading their beef fairly in the international market.  The concession by the Minister that beef from certain parts of the country is unsafe plays into the hands of traders and competitors in the international marketplace.  It creates a dangerous precedent for future negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2049" /> I am outraged that anyone would suggest that the quality of beef from County Monaghan should be questioned or rated as inferior.  Food in County Monaghan is produced in a natural, clean, green environment and it is of the highest quality and excellence. The Minister has made a huge mistake by agreeing to this deal and it must be immediately reversed.  I call on the Taoiseach to travel to Russia and renegotiate this deal as a matter of urgency.  Farmers from Counties Monaghan, Cork and Tipperary cannot be sacrificed and their souls must not be sold, as has happened in this botched deal.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will have a strong case to make if he travels to Russia.  Ireland has the toughest and most effective controls worldwide to which farmers have strictly adhered regarding the containment of BSE.  The Taoiseach must act swiftly if permanent damage is to be avoided.  Foreign competitors will use the ban to undermine international confidence in the industry and Irish consumers will be concerned.  I wish the Minister well in his negotiations in the days and months ahead.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for allowing Members to use some of his time.  As a resident of one of the counties earmarked by the Russian authorities for exclusion from its market, I am glad to have an opportunity to participate in the debate.</P>
      <P>It is evident that a serious problem exists but the regionalisation of the country is an unhappy precedent to set. The possibility of other countries seeking to do as Russia has done may eventually turn farmer against farmer. The prospect of an extension of the Russian ban to other counties should not be overlooked.</P>

    <P>There is little point in the exchanging of political blows which has taken place in the Oireachtas and elsewhere recently.  I accept the Minister's assertion that he had no option but to sign the agreement and that there is no <Col N="2050" /> scientific basis for the Russian view that meat from the three counties should be excluded.  However, this is beside the point.  For whatever reasons, Russia has decided not to import beef from the three counties.  The moratorium begins on 1 November and it will be renewed after a three month period.  A Russian veterinary officer will remain in Ireland to continue the checking process.  We should consider this aspect.  How we can ensure that the partial ban will be lifted in three months?  In effect, we have three months in which to get our house in order.</P>
    <P>I welcome the stiff penalties handed down by the court to a farmer found guilty of importing animals with BSE into the herd for compensation purposes. Such acts are treason and the message must be put across to farmers by the Minister, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the farming representative organisations that farmers must be on their guard against new cases of BSE.  However, we should not be pessimistic about the ban. It is based on the incidence of BSE in a two month period and not the year as a whole.  If we can get our act together over the next three months, it should be possible to reverse the ban.</P>
    <P>Members of the House must be honest with farmers and the public.  While we may not like the action taken by Russia, there was little the Minister could do about it.  As far as beef is concerned, it is a buyers' market and if the Russians wish to buy their beef elsewhere, they can do so.  It has been clear in recent months that Fianna Fáil is attempting to make political capital from this issue.  It is in Opposition and this is understandable.  However, I welcome its, and the IFA's, acceptance, that a national herd management scheme is required.  For too long, the food industry in Ireland, and probably in the EU, has been producer led. People do not have to eat beef if they do not wish.  There are countless alternative products available if they choose. I wish to share my time with Senator Magner.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to the debate and some of the contributions were wide of the mark. However, I am glad to have this opportunity to discuss the recent events in the Russian market.  I am also glad that, given the initial hysterical reaction last week, the debate is more rational. Regardless of whether people accept it, the fact is that if I had not accepted this Protocol, Ireland could not have sold any beef from 1 November to Russia. There would be a total dependence on safety net intervention at a time when, <Col N="2052" /> on the basis of last week's figures, 33,000 steers are being slaughtered.</P>
      <P>This decision could be changed in the morning.  I could rip up the Protocol and say we will live with the ban instead. However, nobody is sensibly suggesting that this is how the matter should be pursued.  Anybody who seriously thinks that any stone was left unturned since last May when I travelled to Russia is trying to mislead the public or will not accept the facts.  Everyone would agree that this is about consumer confidence. I am happy to tell the full story which Senator O'Kennedy requested.  There have been times this year when I was shocked at some of the things I found out in the Department.  I want to put my record in terms of eradicating BSE to the reassurance of the consumer against any former Minister who has had to deal with this since 1989.</P>
      <P>I found it totally unacceptable that the meat from a depopulated herd went for human consumption.  I found that inexplicable and at first I could not believe it.  I have carried out a study on why we are having such difficulties with the Russians and so many others.  Two years ago there were 19 cases of BSE; last year we had 16 and so far this year we have had 38 and we will have more before the year is out.  The figures will more than double and maybe treble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do have a problem.  Out of 7 million animals the number is still at a very low, sporadic level.  The public is inclined to ask where did these numbers come from?  The Russians and everyone else have asked the same.  I have looked at cases as recently as last Saturday where neither the mother of the infected cow nor the cow itself ever moved off the farm.  They were home bred and were not traded.  The problem was entirely due to the feed.  These facts come from an epidemiologist's study. This year I have put regulations in place whereby a licence to buy or sell meat and bone meal is required.  I am also putting a task force in place to ensure vigilance in the implementation of this measure. <Col N="2053" /> I do not believe the numbers of infected animals will increase dramatically next year.  However, if the numbers rocket, if they were to double, I could not guarantee any market.  It is nothing to do with politics.  If Russian vodka coming into Ireland was declared unsafe in a chief veterinary report would any Government override that? Let us have some reality in this debate.</P>

I have been working 16 and 18 hours a day on this since 20 March.  My Department's good relations with the Commission and the Standing Veterinary Committee has ensured that, above any other country in Europe, we are regarded as the most credible country on BSE.  We do not have a JCB approach to BSE and we can stand over our controls.  If it is the case that there is a higher level of incidence of BSE then we have to tighten our controls further.  If that means playing catch up, then I am prepared to do so to ensure that we have ever tighter controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an international crisis.  Beef consumption has dropped right across the world.  Countries that have never had a case of CJD or its new strain and countries that have no BSE have suffered a reduction in beef consumption. The resolution of this problem ultimately lies in science.  I want to assure the Irish public and the Irish consumers, not to speak of international delegations of veterinarians, that we have the strictest policy in relation to the eradication of BSE in the world.  Our policy of extinguishing the herds in which it exists, tracing the cohorts of animals which might have had eaten the same feed previously and taking out the progeny of cows with BSE, coupled with our totally effective controls on meat and bone meal and the removal of depopulated meat, is a collective series of responses of which any Government in Europe would be proud.  I have no hesitation in saying that Irish beef is <Col N="2057" /> safe and consumers can enjoy it as the high quality, nutritious product it is.</P>

    <Title>Health (Amendment) Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): This Bill has three main objectives: to strengthen and improve the arrangements governing financial accountability and expenditure control procedures in health boards; to clarify the respective roles of the members of health boards and their chief executive officers; and to begin the process of removing the Department of Health from detailed involvement in operational matters.  Before dealing with the individual elements of the Bill, it might be useful for the House to consider the context in which I am bringing forward this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy agreement, <i>A Government for Renewal</i>, endorsed the health strategy as the basis for the Government's programme in the health area.  The health strategy seeks to reorient our health care system so that improving people's health and quality of life becomes the primary and unifying focus of all involved in the health sector. It sets out a four year action plan with targets for reductions in risk factors associated with premature mortality, together with other improvements in other indicators of health status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health strategy outlined a number of principles to guide the development of our health services.  The Minister and the Department of Health should be responsible for the development of health policy and overall control of expenditure but should not be involved in the detailed management of the services.  The roles and responsibilities of all key parties, including the members of boards and their managements, must be clearly defined.  Greater responsibility should be devolved to the health boards and other executive agencies. Greater autonomy must be balanced <Col N="2058" /> by increased accountability at all levels.  I am pleased to say all these principles find expression in the legislative proposals now before the House.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward this legislation, I am keenly aware of the difficulties confronting those involved in the delivery of health and personal social services. There is no denying that, on a day to day basis, health workers must deal with an ever increasing demand for services from a more knowledgeable and informed public.  They are required to deal with competing demands and priorities within the confines of the available funding.  Their achievements in so doing are a testament to the co-operation, professionalism and dedication of health service workers and management.  We are extremely fortunate in the quality and commitment of our health service personnel.  I wish to place on the record of the House the Government's recognition of the contribution of all those working in the health service.</P>
    <P>Despite significant levels of investment in recent years, we continue to face enormous pressure in terms of the demand for health services.  The increasing complexity of the technology available in the services, the new drugs which continuously become available and the ageing of our population are all putting an increasing strain on the resources available.  After decades in which we lagged behind other developed countries, current spending on health social services in Ireland is now comparable with other EU and OECD countries.  It is worth noting that over the last five years the level of non capital expenditure on health in this country has increased by 7 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>This growth in health spending took place at a time of unprecedented levels of growth in the economy overall.  While the economy will continue to grow in the years ahead, the forecast is that the rate of growth will slow down.  This will have implications for the level of resources available for public services generally and, in turn, for the level of public investment in health care.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> In the years ahead we can expect, on the one hand, an inexorable pressure for additional and higher quality health services and, on the other hand, pressure for stronger discipline on public spending as a result of our obligations under the Maastricht criteria.  We will need to develop a strategy to cope with these conflicting pressures while ensuring, at the same time, that the services currently available conform to the highest standards of quality, effectiveness and accountability.</P>
    <P>In developing the service plans which are required of them under this Bill, health boards will also be keenly aware of these conflicting demands and pressures on their resources.  It is vitally important to the successful implementation of this legislation that all the players involved &mdash; health boards, their members and managements &mdash; accept they are now required to plan and deliver services within the confines of their annual financial determination. Putting together the service plans will present them with significant challenges, but will also help them to reflect local priorities in a reasoned and justified way.  Greater autonomy and more local decision making, linked with greater accountability and responsibility at local level, is the message of this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Bill has three main objectives.  The first of these is to strengthen and improve the financial accountability arrangements in health boards.  The Government is determined that the health boards will in future operate in a environment of service planning aligned to strict financial control and accountability.  In <i>A Government for Renewal</i> we committed ourselves to introducing legislation to improve the accountability of health boards.  This Bill gives effect to that commitment.  It reflects the Government's strategic management initiative, with its emphasis on making the public service more responsive, accountable and open.</P>
    <P>The second objective of the Bill is to clarify the respective roles and responsibilities <Col N="2060" /> of the members of health boards and their chief executive officers.  One of the key problems identified by the Commission on Health Funding in relation to the present structure is that it confuses political and executive functions to the detriment of both.  The health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i>, proposed that this be tackled by making board members responsible for policy functions &mdash; for example, determining overall levels of service and expenditure &mdash; while delegating to chief executive officers responsibility for operational matters.</P>
    <P>Clear lines of responsibility are necessary between boards and their chief executive officers.  All modern organisations, whether public or private, must have clear lines of responsibility so that each level understands its role.  A board which interferes in operational matters cannot perform its functions in an adequate way as it will lose sight of the broader issues and strategy with which it must be concerned.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives effect to the health strategy by specifying the functions to be performed by board members and chief executive officers respectively. Essentially, what is proposed is that the board members should be responsible for policy functions while the chief executive officer will have responsibility for the day to day operational functions.</P>
    <P>The effect of these changes will be to bring the management arrangements in health boards into line with the position which has obtained in the local government system for many years.  The &ldquo;reserved functions&rdquo; which will be carried out by the members of health boards include the adoption, supervision and amendment of service plans; the appointment and removal of the chief executive officer; the purchase and disposal of land; the borrowing of money and decisions to discontinue the provision and maintenance of any premises.</P>
    <P>The third objective of the Bill is to begin the process, as I signalled earlier, of removing the Minister and the Department of Health from detailed <Col N="2061" /> involvement in the management of individual services by devolving greater authority and responsibility to the health boards.  In future the role of the Department of Health will relate to policy formulation and the measurement of outcomes.  There will be more attention to having systems in place which will ensure not only is policy being implemented but that we can accurately measure its effect.  The development of greater expertise in the health board in relation to service planning and evaluation, allied to the improvements envisaged in the governance role of health board members, will create an environment in which greater authority and responsibility can be devolved to health boards.</P>
    <P>A highly centralised service creates an unnecessary and undesirable distance between those making the decisions and the people affected by them on the ground.  Where there is local control, by way of a service plan agreed by a health board which includes local representatives, problems are likely to be addressed with more focus, unmet needs are more likely to be prioritised and services are less likely to be duplicated.  The Minister must, of course, continue to have ultimate responsibility to the Oireachtas for all health services, but this process of devolution of authority and responsibility from the centre to the regional and local level is the way forward for our health services.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 contains definitions of key terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 requires health boards in carrying out their functions to secure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of resources when carrying out their functions; to co-operate and co-ordinate their activities with other health boards, local authorities and public bodies; and to give due consideration to the policies and objectives of Ministers and of the Government.  I direct Senators' attention in particular to subsection (1)(b) of section 2, which requires a health board to have regard to the need to co-operate <Col N="2062" /> with voluntary bodies who provide services to people in the health board's functional area.  This subsection is the result of an amendment which I brought forward following discussion of the Bill in the Dáil and following representations on the issue from, among others, Senator Gerry Reynolds.  It was pointed out that this section, which required health boards to have regard to the need for co-operation with other health boards, local authorities and public bodies, should impose a similar requirement in relation to co-operation with the voluntary sector.  The voluntary sector makes an enormous contribution to the provision of health and personal social services in this country, whether it be general hospital services, services for the mentally and physically handicapped, child care services, services for the elderly and for other vulnerable groups.</P>
    <P>I was happy to give statutory recognition to that contribution by imposing on health boards a duty to have regard to the need for co-operation with voluntary bodies who are providing services to people in their area.  This underlines the Government's commitment to the role of the voluntary sector.  I hope that this provision will promote greater co-operation between the health boards and the voluntary sector in the delivery of our health services.  I see it as the start of the process whereby the Department of Health can gradually disengage itself from detailed involvement with the affairs of voluntary bodies as they, in turn, develop deeper and stronger links with their local health boards.  A fundamental change will be taking place over the next few years in the funding of the voluntary sector.  In future, voluntary hospitals and mental handicap agencies will be funded by the health boards, rather than the Department.  It follows that good relationships will have to be developed between the boards and the voluntary bodies.  This section, I hope, will lay the foundations for those good relationships.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 clarify the respective roles of the members of health boards <Col N="2063" /> and their chief executive officers.  Provision is made for certain specified functions, to be known as &ldquo;reserved functions&rdquo;, to be carried out directly by the members of health boards.  These include the adoption, supervision and amendment of service plans, the appointment and removal of the chief executive officer, the purchase and disposal of land, the borrowing of money and decisions to discontinue the provision and maintenance of any premises. The chief executive officer will assist the board, as appropriate, in these matters, but the board will have the final say in the performance of these functions.  Any function that is not reserved to the members will, subject to some minor exceptions, be a function of the chief executive officer.  The chief executive officer will be obliged to provide the board with any information they might require on such functions but will otherwise be autonomous in performing them.  The effect of these changes will be to bring the management system in the health boards into line with the arrangements that have worked well in the local government system over many years.</P>
    <P>Section 5 requires the Minister to specify the maximum amount of net expenditure that may be incurred by each health board in any year.  The term &ldquo;net expenditure&rdquo; means the gross expenditure of a health board less the income of the board, other than grants made by the Minister.  This amount, which is referred to as a &ldquo;determination&rdquo;, must be notified to the board within 21 days of the publication of the Book of Estimates.  The Minister is empowered to vary the determination at any time during the year &mdash; for example, when making additional funds available to meet agreed pay increases or to develop particular services or facilities.</P>
    <P>Section 6 requires a health board, within a period of 21 to 42 days of the receipt of a determination, as the Minister may direct, to adopt a plan specifying the services to be provided by the board within the financial limits determined <Col N="2064" /> by the Minister.  The board is required to submit a copy of its plan to the Minister.  If a health board does not submit a service plan within the relevant time-scale, the Minister may allow a further period not exceeding ten days to enable the board to do so.  If a health board fails to submit a service plan, the Minister may direct the chief executive officer to prepare and submit a plan within ten days.  The Minister may, not later than 21 days after the receipt of a service plan, direct a health board to modify its plan and the board is required to comply with such a direction. Service plans are already in operation throughout the health boards on an administrative basis.  The plans cover all the main service programmes such as general hospitals, services for the mentally and physically handicapped, elderly, child care, etc., and describes how boards will manage those programmes during the year.  Under this Bill, service plans will become the key tool in the planning and management of services and in the control of expenditure.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that where the Minister amends a health board's determination, he or she may direct that the service plan of the board shall stand amended accordingly.  This is intended to deal with situations such as where the Minister makes additional funds available to meet agreed pay increases or to develop particular services or facilities. The members of the board will be required to monitor expenditure to ensure that it does not exceed the amount set by the Minister.  In addition, a health board may vary its plan at any time during the year provided it does not breach the financial parameters laid down by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that whenever the Minister makes a determination, he or she shall specify the amount of indebtedness that a health board may incur and a health board shall not exceed the amount determined by the Minister. Section 9 requires the chief executive officer to implement the service plan and to ensure that net expenditure and indebtedness do not exceed the <Col N="2065" /> amounts determined by the Minister. Where the chief executive officer forms an opinion that a decision or a proposed decision of the board will result in net expenditure or indebtedness exceeding the amounts so determined, he or she is required to inform the Minister and the board of that opinion.  Section 10 provides that if, at the end of the year, the expenditure incurred by a health board is less than the amount set by the Minister, the savings can be carried forward into the next year.  However, if expenditure is greater than that authorised, the excess expenditure will become a first charge in the income and expenditure account for the following year.  Section 11 requires health boards to keep all proper and usual accounts and to prepare and adopt annual financial statements on or before 1 April in the year following the year to which they relate. This is also the date by which health boards are required to submit their accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that if the Minister is satisfied that a health board is not performing any one or more of its functions in an effective manner or has failed to comply with any direction given by the Minister, he or she may, by order, transfer specified functions of the board for a period of not more than two years to either the chief executive officer or such other person as the Minister may specify.  This provision is intended as a measure of last resort to deal with situations where a board is not being governed in a satisfactory manner &mdash; for example, where a board has seriously and without good cause breached the expenditure limits set down by the Minister.  I hope that this power will never have to be invoked and that any difficulties or disputes that might arise can be resolved without resorting to this provision.  I also point out that before exercising this power, the Minister is required to have a report prepared on the performance by the board of its functions; he or she must give the board at least 14 days notice of the intention to exercise the power and <Col N="2066" /> must have regard to any representations made by the board.  This process provides some &ldquo;breathing space&rdquo; to allow problems to be resolved by agreement between the Minister and the board.</P>
    <P>Section 13 empowers the Minister to give directions in writing to health boards and requires boards to comply with such directions.  Section 14 provides that future appointees as chief executive officers of health boards shall hold office on a fixed term contract basis, as is already the case with senior civil servants and city and county managers. The new provision will not affect the tenure of existing office holders. This section was amended during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil on foot of a proposal from Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn which I accepted.  The amendment means that a chief executive officer's contract shall be for a period not exceeding seven years, bringing the maximum term of office of a chief executive officer in line with that which applies to other public servants, such as Secretaries of Departments and city and county managers.</P>
    <P>Section 15 requires each health board to prepare and publish an annual report on the performance of its functions during the preceding year.  The public expects a more open system of health administration.  This provision will help taxpayers to judge whether they are getting the best value possible for the money they contribute to the public finances by making more information available on the actions and decisions taken on behalf of the people.  Section 16 provides for the dissolution of the Dublin, Cork and Galway regional hospital boards, the local health committees and the National Health Council. As Senators will be aware, all of these bodies have long since ceased to function and this provision is merely giving formal effect to their abolition.</P>
    <P>Section 17 contains miscellaneous amendments to the Health Act, 1970. Most of these are required to bring the relevant provisions of the Act in line with this Bill.  Of particular interest is paragraph (g) which imposes a new <Col N="2067" /> statutory obligation on health boards to develop and implement health promotion programmes.  The need for an explicit statutory duty in this regard was identified in the health promotion strategy launched last year.  I believe this provision will assist in the successful implementation of that strategy.</P>
    <P>Section 18 dispenses with the need for health boards to obtain ministerial consent to the acquisition or disposal of land.  It contains several important safeguards. First, all decisions on the acquisition and disposal of lands will be reserved functions of the members of a health board.  Second, and most particularly, provision is made that the Minister may give general directions to a health board on any proposed sale or acquisition of land.  These directions must be complied with by the board. The directions I propose to issue as soon as possible after the enactment of the Bill will set out general guidelines aimed at ensuring transparency of procedure and the attainment of maximum value in respect of the disposal and acquisition of health board land and, with regard to the application of the proceeds of sale, will ensure that they will be used for the improvement and development of the health service. Included in these directions will be a requirement that health boards consult the Valuation Office to ascertain the correct market value of any lands they propose to buy or sell.</P>
    <P>The section also sets out particular requirements that must be followed by a health board which proposes to dispose of any land which is not required for the purpose of fulfilling its functions. Subsection (e) contains detailed requirements concerning the notification of board members regarding any proposed disposal of lands.  Members must have at least ten days' notice of the proposal and must be given details of the land and the person to whom it is proposed to sell it.  A positive resolution must be passed at the next board meeting after such notification in order to give effect to any proposed disposal of <Col N="2068" /> lands.  These safeguards will ensure that health board lands are not sold without the full knowledge and consent of the board members.</P>
    <P>Section 19 amends the Health Act, 1953, to dispense with the need for health boards to obtain ministerial consent to the payment of grants to voluntary bodies.  Again, the Minister is empowered to give general directions on procedures which must be followed in such cases and these must be complied with by the boards.  Section 20 makes it an offence to carry on a nursing home that is not registered under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. This is required to close a loophole which has become apparent in the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 21 allows the Minister to extend, by order, the term of office of An Bord Altranais which was due to expire on 3 October 1996.  I amended this section on Committee Stage in the Dáil to ensure the order can be made with retrospective effect.  Work on the revision of the Nurses Act which will involve the establishment of new board structures is at present underway in the Department and it is hoped to publish a Bill early next year.  The purpose of this provision is to enable the present board to continue in office until the new Act comes into force.  This avoids An Bord Altranais going to the trouble and expense of holding elections to a board which will fall to be reconstituted under the new legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 22 amends the definition of &ldquo;health service&rdquo; in the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961.  This Act provides the statutory basis for a number of health agencies, including Beaumont and St James' Hospitals and the National Rehabilitation Board.  The current definition of &ldquo;health service&rdquo; in the Act has a traditional medical orientation and this has prevented the establishment of bodies under the Act to perform functions in relation to personal social services.  The revised definition is designed to overcome this problem. Sections 23, 24 and 25 contain standard provisions regarding repeals, the laying <Col N="2069" /> of orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas, the short title, construction and commencement.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is a significant Bill which will affect all aspects of the management, planning and financial accountability of health boards.  It is fully in keeping with the aims and objectives of the health strategy and its enactment is central to the achievement of those objectives.  The Bill also reflects the Government's desire to introduce a more strategic approach to management in the public service.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing Senators' contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>My party broadly welcomes this Bill.  It is appropriate that after 26 years we should look at the health services provided by the health boards.  The late Deputy Sean Flanagan introduced the legislation which set up the health boards but there has been no major review of the health board system since.  I fully agree with the intent of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister seeks greater financial accountability from the health boards and is looking for a defining role for health board members and the chief executive officer.  He also wants to distance the Department of Health from the activities of the health boards so it will not be involved in their day to day operation.  There will be considerable obligations on the health boards, particularly on the financial side with which I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I have many good things to say about the health boards, I have had conflicts with them on the handling of their finances.  I understand it costs approximately £17 million per day or £1.5 billion per annum to run the health services, yet one health board's annual report is two years out of date.  What financial institution or major bank would be allowed to carry on its business in that way?  The four commercial banks produce annual reports within two months.  Health boards must understand that from now on they will have to make returns within a certain time.  It <Col N="2070" /> is necessary that matters be more streamlined than they were in the past. That, and many other issues, were taken into consideration in the overall review of the health boards.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a health board for many years and I saw health boards spend money like drunken sailors come the month of December.  They found they had a certain amount of money which they had to spend by the end of the year otherwise they would have problems the following year.  The provisions in this Bill will prohibit such nonsense.  If there is extra cash, a health board can carry it over into the following years, and rightly so.  Why should they squander it in December just to get themselves into shape for the new year? That happened in health boards over the years and it was a scandal.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the increased level of administration in health boards.  A person was a nobody in a health board unless he or she had staff or at least a secretary, even though he or she might be far from senior.  In many instances there was massive duplication at administrative level.  Matters which had to be cleared in a local office in one county still had to be authorised at regional level.  There was no need for that and I thought there was an attempt to create an administrative industry.  It annoyed the public when, for instance, a medical card had to be stamped four times.  In the past, a staff officer in the health board would stamp the card and hand it out.</P>
    <P>People expect that the money provided by the taxpayer goes into the provision of health services and not into the clerical end which consumes too large a proportion of the moneys provided for health.  People look at that aspect against a background of waiting lists. Only this week I came across the case of a pensioner whose doctor sent a letter on his behalf to a health board seeking the investigation of his hip.  The man received a letter three weeks later which indicated that he had been placed on a waiting list but was unlikely to be seen <Col N="2071" /> for two years.  This related to the investigation and not the procedure to be carried out.  That is not appropriate.  If such investigations cannot be carried out within a reasonable length of time, we are not addressing the real issue of health services.</P>
    <P>While some people believed in the past that there was a two tier health system, they now consider that there is a three tier one and they blame the consultants for it.  If people want a procedure carried out, such as a hip operation, there are three routes open to them.  Medical card holders will have the longest wait, those with VHI will not fare too badly but if people want to jump the queue, they should produce cash and they will be in clover.  Such persons will have the procedure carried out and that unfortunately is the reality of Ireland's health service.  There is very little the Minister can do about it in the present legislative framework but the issue should be tackled.</P>
    <P>I agree with the removal of the stipulation that health boards must apply to the Minister to sell lands.  It could take six or eight months for the Department to clear the sale of land worth £200 and I thought it was nonsense that so many letters on the matter passed between the health board and the Department.  I understand that the proceeds of the sale of large portions of valuable land, most of which is owned by the psychiatric services, are not ploughed back into those services.  That is at odds with what the Minister proposes in the Bill.  I hope this Bill will tighten up that matter and ensure the money does not go into the general pool.  Over the past number of years, long before this Minister took office, the Department of Health, the health boards and others colluded to dismantle the psychiatric services without providing an alternative.  Simon Community and other voluntary groups were left to pick up the pieces.  Former psychiatric patients roam the streets of our cities and towns and many of them end up before the courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2072" /> Medical, paramedical, nursing and ancillary staff in the health services have done an excellent job over the years and have provided a wonderful service. They have responded positively to new technologies and procedures and, at the same time, have taken on board many new initiatives, such as the division of the health services for the mentally handicapped and the extension of the voluntary sector.  I compliment them on their massive contribution to the health services over the years.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill provides for co-operation between the voluntary sector and the health boards as otherwise we would not get the health services to which we all aspire.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how grants will be paid. My understanding is that the health boards will not have to apply to the Department to pay grants.  Is there an onus on them to pay grants?  That is very important.  May they pick and choose?  What safeguards are in place to cater for those involved in the voluntary sector?  Will the health board will pay grants to the voluntary sector, allow it to continue providing services and not starve it of necessary cash?</P>
    <P>This Bill is concerned with the health boards.  However, large sections of the health services, including voluntary hospitals, etc., are not covered under the health board system.  In the past there were jealousies and stand offs between the health boards and voluntary hospitals.  In certain instances there was also a lack of co-operation.  That should not be the case.  Those involved in providing healthcare who receive funding from the taxpayer have a responsibility to give full co-operation and ensure that the service provided to the public is given priority.  That is important; not empire-building, retaining catchments or providing a service before a neighbouring hospital does so. The priority should be to complement and supplement each other in the provision of full and adequate health services.</P>
    <P>While a great deal has been achieved by the health boards, there have been <Col N="2073" /> many gaps in the service provided and there have been mistakes and slip-ups. For example, many health boards failed to respond to the problem of child abuse.  They were not alone in that and the Department had a role to play. However, health board officials received the initial reports of such abuse and had a responsibility to act.  This House debated the many gaps in the services provided by the health boards. As a result of court cases, we have seen the inadequate approach adopted by health boards, which were also criticised for not addressing matters of concern. In the future that area cannot be allowed to move in the direction it did heretofore.</P>
    <P>Everyone has a responsibility to ensure that child abuse is not permitted under any circumstances.  Whether mandatory reporting is introduced, the necessary steps must be taken to ensure that there is no hidden room in Ireland for child abuse.  As legislators, we have a responsibility to see to it that the authorities, the Department, the health boards, etc., carry out their functions and ensure that child abuse does not take place.  Another area in which the health boards were not directly involved concerns infected blood.  There was much discussion of this matter in recent weeks and I will not repeat the arguments.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on health has increased by 65 per cent during the past five years but I am not sure whether a corresponding return was achieved in service.  The Bill before the House addresses that matter.  There must be a service plan and, if one is not in place, the law provides for an extension of time and an option for the Minister to act.  There is also a responsibility with regard to making returns.  In the past there was a lack of accountability and information and some health boards were very secretive. On occasion, it was difficult to extract information from the health boards and there seemed to be a fear of releasing facts to the public.  I will not state that cover ups occurred, but the boards did not want to release information.  Reference <Col N="2074" /> was made to a charter of rights for patients and the public is entitled to information regarding how money is spent, etc.  In most health boards the gap between such spending and the release of information relating to it falls outside what is normal in a commercial situation.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister intends to introduce a new Nurses Bill, which is overdue.  The term of office of the current board of An Bord Altranais ended in recent weeks.  Did the Minister introduce an amendment in the Dáil that its term of office could be extended?  Was this achieved by means of regulation or legislation?  Will the Minister clarify that matter?  I understand the board's term of office ended on 3 October, but something has happened to change that.  If this was done by the introduction of regulations, well and good.  I agree there should be a new Nurses Bill because the current legislation is outdated and is no longer relevant to the present situation. The sooner the better we have an opportunity to debate that Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the support of Fianna Fáil on the Bill before the House.  We will not oppose Second Stage.  Had there been sufficient time available, I might be able to inform the House regarding Committee and Report Stages but I received the Bill on short notice.  The Minister has the support of the House on this Bill which is a welcome development.  The situation obtaining in the health boards should have been addressed many years ago. The Bill has been in the offing for some time and offers a solid approach to the problem.  I hope it contains the necessary safeguards to ensure that national public service agreements will be honoured, that the health boards do not have an out clause regarding their employees and that national agreements on pay and conditions will be applied. These issues are important because the thousands of people employed in the health service want to know that their interests will be protected and that chief executive officers will not have access to an out clause in the future. <Col N="2075" /> It is past time that chief executive officers were employed on a contract basis.  It does not make sense that people have been employed in such positions since the establishment of the health services in 1970.  Those responsible for operating the major financial and institutional apparatus of the health boards should be employed on a contract basis.  City and county managers and secretaries of Departments are employed on seven year contracts.  The same should apply to the health board chief executive officers and also to the programme managers.  Programme managers should not be able to stay in their jobs for as long they wish.</P>
    <P>A practice has developed in health boards whereby people are allowed to stay on after retirement age, particularly at senior management level.  A cosy cartel has existed for years whereby people are kept on to do special jobs or on a merry go round for interviews.  The small percentage at the top of the health boards are looked after.  An old boys club has developed.  There are few women in senior positions in the health boards.  Although the health boards are mostly run by women, there are no female chief executive officers and few programme managers or hospital administrators.  There has been a cosy cartel at the top whereby people are kept on supposedly because their services are specialised.  It has more to do with their being friends of one another than being specialised.  I hope the new legislation will leave no room for such &ldquo;nod and wink&rdquo; arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill aims to modernise planning and management systems in the health boards.  In doing so, it gives effect to a commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to introduce legislation to improve the accountability of health boards.  It also implements undertakings in the health strategy <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> to improve the organisation and management arrangements of health boards and to begin the process of removing the Department of Health's <Col N="2076" /> day to day involvement in operational matters.</P>
      <P>In order to improve accountability the health boards are required to provide service plans each year and to publish annual reports by the end of June each year following the publication of their annual financial statements.  The Eastern Health Board, of which I am a member, has made major changes in its accounting system arising from the introduction in 1994 of new accounting standards for health boards.</P>
      <P>This legislation will require health boards to provide service plans each year.  The Eastern Health Board has prepared service plans.  The 1996 general hospitals care service plan is in line with the general policies and objectives set out in the health strategy <i>Shaping a Healthier Future.</i>  The service plans provide a basis for future planning, monitoring and review of the performance of the general hospital care programme. The plans endeavour to achieve the greatest possible health and social gain within the resources available and to ensure that treatment and care is provided in the most appropriate setting, having regard to the key principles of equality of service and accountability.</P>
      <P>The highlighting of service development, quality initiatives and development measures were of primary concern in setting out the service plan for 1996. Arrangements have also been made for all new service plans being developed to be evaluated with the support of the board's new department of public health medicine, and value for money initiatives will continue to be vigorously pursued.  It will be necessary for the programme to meet its targets by the end of 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key performance measures in the programme include the number of patients treated, the level of diagnostic service activity, the average length of stay, the bed occupancy and the review of the waiting lists.  I thank the Minister for his interest in the waiting lists of the Eastern Health Board hospitals and the voluntary hospitals in Dublin and for the extra funding he has made available <Col N="2077" /> to reduce these waiting lists.  The activity levels in this programme will be monitored throughout the year to ensure service targets are achieved within the financial and human resources available.</P>
    <P>This year's service plan for the community care programme has been prepared and framed keeping in mind the key concepts of health and social gain as outlined in the health strategy.  This programme will include a wide range of services.  During the year all areas of service provision will be scrutinised and reviewed.  Where necessary, adjustments will be implemented to ensure the focus is on the priority objectives set out in the health strategy.  Value for money initiatives and efficiency measures will continue to be vigorously pursued and it will be necessary for the programme to meet its targets by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>A service plan has also been drawn up for the special hospitals care programme. This plan deals with a range of services under the broad headings of adult psychiatric services, the central nurse training school, the voluntary organisations and the mentally handicapped services.  I am pleased the Minister has placed the work of the voluntary organisations on a statutory basis with the health boards because it is in the psychiatric services that the voluntary services play the greatest role. Once again, value for money initiatives and efficiency measures will continue to be vigorously pursued and it will be necessary for the programme to meet its target by the end of this year.  These are some of the measures being introduced by the health board to provide for the greater accountability required by the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>When I read the debate on this Bill in the other House I was interested to note that a number of Members referred to the need to provide care for the elderly. In planning for the future needs of the elderly it is essential that consideration is given to the population projections for the coming year and how they will impinge on the service requirements as <Col N="2078" /> stated in the health strategy.  The health strategy states:</P>
    <P>The rapid rise in the number of people in the oldest age groups poses a special challenge to health services in the next four years.  Services in the community and in hospitals will have to be responsive to the increased demands and the growing population of older people.</P>
    <P>In a survey carried out in 1985 by the National Council for the Aged it was predicted that the number of persons aged 65 and over in our health board areas would increase by 12 per cent between 1981 and 1991 and by 31 per cent between 1981 and 2006.  However, the actual increase between 1981 and 1991 was 15 per cent and it is now projected that the increase between 1981 and 2006 will be 41 per cent.  Almost half of our population will be over the age of 65 by 2006.</P>
    <P>To respond to the growing needs of the elderly the Eastern Health Board has planned a four year action programme. It intends to extend the community ward team facilities throughout the board's area.  This will necessitate the provision of additional human resources, principally nursing, paramedical staff and care workers.  It also proposes that 50 bed community units be established at nine centres in the health board's area.  The Minister recently opened one such unit at the Navan Road and a unit at Sir Patrick Dun's hospital will be available by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>These units will have a two fold effect by providing accommodation for the elderly population and provide a &ldquo;step down&rdquo; facility for acute hospitals.  At present there are a number of elderly persons occupying beds in acute hospitals.  By providing these community unit facilities beds that are required for urgent medical treatment will become available.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board, in partnership with the voluntary sector, is moving towards the final stages of completing a ten year major reorganisation <Col N="2079" /> of the psychiatric services from an institutional to a community model.  The three main principles governing this plan are the development of a comprehensive community based service to enable many who until now have required hospitalisation for treatment to live at home while receiving treatment, the resettlement of long stay patients from institutional care to community living and the transfer of acute psychiatric admissions from major psychiatric institutions to psychiatric units in general hospitals.  These principles are based on the premise that psychiatric patients' services should not be equated with beds but with achieving optimum treatment results and the best quality of life.</P>
    <P>The Bill also refers to the respective roles of health board members and chief executive officers.  It makes a distinction between the reserve functions of elected members of the board and the executive functions of the chief executive officer. During the years I served on health boards there was never confusion about the demarcation between the duties of elected members and those of the chief executive officer.  I have always found the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board to have been helpful, especially with executive functions.  I pay tribute to the recently retired chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board, Mr. Kieran Hickey.</P>
    <P>In contributions made in the other House, a number of Deputies referred to a health strategy document identifying a weakness in the Eastern Health Board area.  This was that significant services were provided by voluntary agencies in the health board area but no single authority had overall responsibility to co-ordinate all services and ensure appropriate links between them. The Eastern Health Board area is different from other health board areas in that a significant number of hospitals in it are voluntary.  The health board has responsibility for only two major hospitals in Dublin: Blanchardstown and Cherry Orchard.  I look forward to <Col N="2080" /> the reorganisation of the Eastern Health Board region.  I ask the Minister in his reply to indicate what stage it is at. The reorganisation is necessary because there is no value in some hospitals being funded by the health board and others directly from the Department of Health. The health board has little control over these hospitals' services.  If, as is proposed in the Bill, that the role of the Department of Health be removed from the day-to-day operation of health matters, it is vital a new health structure be provided in the Dublin area as soon as possible.  This would help to fulfil what the Minister spoke of, that voluntary hospitals and agencies for the disabled would be funded in future by the health boards and not the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a necessary piece of legislation.  I hope health boards will in future be more accountable than in the past and, in doing so, provide necessary services to local communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. However, I am anxious about one area. While I am pleased with the freedom health boards will be granted, I raise the issue of communications which come from them to their employees, particularly doctors working within it.  I speak of directives from health boards because, if these are taken at face value, it means doctors cannot speak on behalf of their patients.  For example, the Southern Health Board produced a handbook last year entitled <i>Caring For People.</i>  This was a laudable document in many ways.  However, the following statements were made in it:</P>
      <P>Publications &mdash; Publication of any matter relating to affairs of the Health Board, or use of information drawn from official sources in publications by staff members or for publication by others, should have the prior approval of the Chief Executive Officer.</P>

    <P>Media &mdash; The giving of interviews, statements or any other information connected with the services provided <Col N="2081" /> by the health board should not be undertaken without the prior approval of the Chief Executive Officer or the delegated official spokesperson for the Board.</P>
    <P>Information &mdash; Public statements by Board staff may be taken as reflecting Board policy or illustrative of Board attitudes.  Therefore, information should be issued only through authorised spokespersons (leaking of information to any source, including making it available to colleagues in professional/staff associations in this or other Boards, is not permitted).</P>
    <P>This is a serious matter.  These statements could be in conflict with, for example, the consultants' common contract and the associated legislation regarding clinical independence of the consultant which, under paragraph 6.4.6, states:</P>
    <P>...the employing authority will provide a forum, in the first instance, for the consultant's advocacy role. Neither does it preclude the profession as a body advocating more or better services for patients.</P>
    <P>These directives could be in direct conflict with our obligations to our patients. Article 25 of the principle of medical ethics in Europe, which is supported by the Irish Medical Council, states:</P>
    <P>It is the duty of a doctor, whether acting alone or in conjunction with professional organisations, to draw the attention of society to any deficiencies in the quality of health care or in the professional independence of doctors.</P>
    <P>Directives similar to those issued by the Southern Health Board were issued by the Western Health Board.  I gather these have been modified.  However, I hope that, in giving greater powers to the chief executive officer and the health boards, the Minister ensures they still understand that doctors have to fulfil their ethical obligations to their patients.  If it is a case of the patient <i>versus</i> the system, we must support the <Col N="2082" /> patient.  We must support our ethical obligation.  I hope we will be in a position to rely on the Minister to ensure that officialdom cannot overtake the ethical obligations of the medical profession.</P>

      <P>This Bill is important but may not appear so at first glance. Any Bill concerned with the administration of public authorities does not, as a rule, make newspaper headlines. This is only if things do not go wrong, which they unfortunately have recently. The court case in London, which is receiving unbelievable media attention, arose from an administrative breakdown in a Government Department. Perhaps the Minister's Bill will not receive the attention others will.</P>
      <P>I was in Letterkenny hospital yesterday and the main bone of contention for people there was the moneys paid to doctors under the general medical services. I examined the listing and saw that two doctors in Donegal received £147,000 and £164,000 in 1995.  People asked how, if a nurse or porter earns only £200 per week, these people were earning £164,000 in one year?  People will ask those questions because health services are a great debating and gossiping point and people will always talk.  If someone asks a Member on either side of this House to obtain a medical card for them, it is worth a vote or two if it can be delivered.</P>

      <P>Health is a major area which will be discussed no matter where one goes.  If a doctor does something from which possibly someone dies, it is the talk of the area for a long time and the poor doctor will be criticised and the centre of scandal.  Health impacts on people's lives so it is important for us to get things right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2083" /> The reform of our public administration is one of the biggest issues which faces us today.  As our economy and society grows, it imposes new burdens on our social services.  As our young population begins to age, our health services will have to bear the burden of considerable extra usage.  The estimate for this year is £2.4 billion, of which £1.3 billion will go to the health boards.  How will this be spent?  It will be spent on general services, psychiatric services, services for the disabled and on the elderly.  The health boards employ thousands of workers throughout the country.  My main concern, in common with Senator Finneran, is the psychiatric service, the &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; of the system which did not receive the consideration it deserved in the past.</P>
    <P>The health board structures were set up in 1970 and this is the first major review since then.  <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> was a step in the right direction. We must review these services to make them more consumer-friendly, so that people know how the moneys are being spent.</P>
    <P>This Bill has three purposes, the first being to ensure the financial accountability of health boards.  I welcome this move although it is important that it is not taken up the wrong way.  No one is suggesting that there are financial irregularities in the health boards.  On the contrary, the Bill attempts to improve the accountability of the boards by facilitating proper public examination of health board priorities and spending in any given year.  This is not a new move, it merely brings health boards into line with other Government agencies.  The number of annual reports published by various State and semi-State bodies has increased considerably in recent years.  While at times this may cause us difficulty as we attempt to keep abreast of what is happening in each area, there is no doubt it has improved the accountability of public institutions both to us and to the public.  The publication of annual reports has a positive effect.  Almost by definition, it will require any health board to appraise <Col N="2084" /> fully its performance over the previous year.  While many do so already I am also certain that, as a result of day to day operating pressures, many do not give sufficient thought to this process. That they will now be compelled to do so is extremely important.</P>
    <P>We must again refer to the consumers when mentioning operating pressures. One need only note the outcry which arises when there is pressure on beds during the winter.  If beds are put into hospital corridors there is hell to pay.  I have had reason to write to a previous Minister for Health on this matter when I worked within the services.  Recently, nurses in Letterkenny have again been overworked and under pressure.  People call for more bed space but if 2,000 beds were provided they would be full tomorrow. We must examine the areas in which we spend money.</P>
    <P>One of the worst moves was the abolition of county health committees.  Their members could inform the health boards of problems which pertained in the county.  They were advisory bodies but they should not have been scrapped because they had an important role to play.</P>
    <P>The introduction of technology into psychiatric hospitals has put more pressure on staff.  They have not been fully compensated but they have done tremendous work.  They used to write notes in the evening but now patients' details are available at the touch of a button.</P>
    <P>The second purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the board fulfils its policy role within each health board.  In line with best contemporary management practices, the Minister is seeking to ensure appropriate demarcation between the boards and their chief executives.  No Member of this House who could argue against that.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about sections 18 and 19 which deal with the sale of land. Some time ago the health board tried to sell land in Donegal.  The sum agreed for the sale was ridiculous.  Two years later, the same price was received for the milk quota on the land.  The health board still owns the land and it continues <Col N="2085" /> to receive a large amount of money through leasing.  We must keep strict control of this.  As Senator Finneran said, any money from the sale of psychiatric hospital or health board land should go to the area in which the property is sited.</P>
    <P>After the <i>Planning for the Future</i> document, many psychiatric patients were allowed to leave or were pushed out of hospitals.  Many of them wandered the streets, completely lost and without enough back-up.  Re-admission rates soared and many of these people turned to alcohol, were taken advantage of or committed suicide.  That strategy was wrong.  If psychiatric service lands are to be sold, the money should go towards providing proper services for the people being treated.</P>
    <P>Section 20 deals with the treatment of the elderly.  Are we getting value for money in our nursing homes?  Are the elderly being looked after properly?  We regularly hear reports about the lack of services for them.  The health boards are paying major subventions to nursing homes on behalf of the taxpayer; according to some reports one would not put a cat in a nursing home because it would be so badly treated, yet they are registered and supported.  Some of them are maintaining up to 40 beds but they are not able to look after their patients.  It is second hand care.  One must commend the people who worked within the services prior to that initiative for the care they gave to these people.</P>
    <P>The third purpose of the Bill is to attempt to ensure appropriate demarcation between the responsibilities of the board and the Minister for Health and his Department.  I welcome this. One of the prime difficulties in the past has been the extent to which our administrative system and power has been concentrated centrally in Departments. This has been extremely harmful to local democracy which, in itself, is clearly inadequate.  It has been widely accepted for some time that centralisation is a problem.  This perception is shared by politicians, academics and commentators alike and I am pleased <Col N="2086" /> the Government is now addressing it.  It is not only in the health area that this devolution of powers is taking place.  My party colleague, the Minister for Education will attempt to do likewise soon and I welcome that too.  I look forward to seeing the Opposition's reaction to these proposals.  This is not an attempt to divest the Minister of ultimate responsibility for the health services but to allow the development of local focused responses to their problems.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, who is the chairman of the national strategy group on drugs. There is a great difference between the sums spent on drug programmes in the city and the country.  Treatment programmes and education are extremely important but the drug problem is not confined to the Eastern Health Board or Dublin.  Drugs are available in every town and village.  We must deal with it in every way possible and should not concentrate all our energies in Dublin when there are problems in Letterkenny and Roscommon also.</P>

      <P>When there are cutbacks in hospitals, the people who are affected are always those who provide the hands-on service to the patient &mdash; nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, etc. &mdash; but never the health board administrators. This is wrong because patients suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we do not discuss other Bills along these lines which attempt to tackle a problem before it gets out of control.  Notwithstanding the increases in health expenditure which have taken place in recent years, for which my party can rightly take the bulk of the credit, the pressure on health services is not diminishing in any western country.  In that sense, the health services are a black hole &mdash; no matter how <Col N="2087" /> much we spend there will always be difficulties and reasons to spend more.  It is incumbent on us to spend the money in as wise and judicious a fashion as possible.  This Bill is an important contribution to that process and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Doyle in wishing Kieran Hickey and his wife a happy retirement.  He worked with the North-Western Health Board and in 1982 was my chief organiser when, on an awareness campaign during the International Year of the Disabled, I drove a pony and trap from Bundoran to Ballsbridge to highlight the needs of the disabled.  We have been great friends before and since.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It could have been written by the chief executive officer of the North-Western Health Board because we have complied with its provisions for many years.  However, unfortunately, the board never got credit from any of the Minister's predecessors. We always kept within budget, but it was hospitals which spent outlandishly that, years later, received increased funding to correct their finances. Indeed, when we sought extra funding from Ministers we were told that money had to be directed at services which we were already providing.</P>
      <P>Senator Maloney attacked the psychiatric services.  We have the best such services in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not use such words.  The Senator should have listened to what I said.  I called for more resources for the psychiatric services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The North-Western Health Board has made greater attempts to support hostels than any other health board.  Many of the <Col N="2088" /> Senator's colleagues who work in them have told me that they would not go back to the hospitals.  It is unfair of the Senator to say that men have committed suicide because of the lack of resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator appears to have a chip on his shoulder regarding the North-Western Health Board, which provides a very good service.  I cannot allow his remarks to go unchallenged and must correct the points he made.  I hope the provisions of the legislation work well, but we should be clear that they will entail us attempting to run health boards as businesses.  It is difficult to do this, given that the boards provide a service for which there is no competition.</P>
      <P>The biggest problem with expenses for the health boards today relate to medical personnel and drug companies. The bills for drugs continue to increase and we do not appear to be able to get to grips with them, no matter what we do.  According to recent statistics, there have been more car accidents involving people taking drugs than alcohol.  We are over prescribing drugs, leading to knock-on problems associated with dependency and side effects.  It is time to cut down on the costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures must be taken to cap waiting lists.  The Minister and his three predecessors all injected funding to reduce them, yet within three months they returned to their high levels.  This is where major expenses arise.  A problem associated with this area is the difference between private and public treatment. Medical card patients are left on waiting lists while private patients can obtain the same treatment immediately. <Col N="2089" /> If we are to tackle this problem we will have to provide that those in the medical profession who want to practise in the private sector must do so full time. To ensure this, we will have to measure their workload and production capacity.</P>
    <P>Society has changed.  Hitherto old people were nursed at home, but today many cannot live in rural Ireland and keep a job.  The health boards are doing a better job on care for the aged than private nursing homes, where residents pay more.  The care provided by the health boards include therapy services and minibus services.  No private nursing homes take out their residents.  Provision should be made to ensure that they do so.  While they are well looked after, it is not enough to leave residents in the home all day watching television or reading a newspaper.  We should try to ensure that this part of the health service is as good as that provided by the public services.</P>
    <P>Any land sold by the North-Western Health Board was used to obtain matching funds.  We often obtained as much, if not twice as much, from the Department and EU funding, which was then reinvested in the services provided by the board.  Land has generally been sold at full market value.  There was much controversy over the sale of an old hospital in Sligo seven or eight years ago when it was alleged that we gave it away.  Since then it has twice been offered for sale by the developer who bought it but he cannot get his money for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no problem with planning permission or with the provision of services.  The developer bought it to build a hotel, but it did not work out for him.  Nobody is interested in buying it even though it has been on the market for the past six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not correct to allege that we sold land cheap.  We have obtained full market value for land sales.  In most cases land is sold to regional colleges, county councils or corporations.  It does not go <Col N="2090" /> to private hands but goes back to the public to whom it belongs.  The services in the north west would not be what they are today if we did not sell land and obtain matching funding for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that section 2 requires the health boards in carrying out their functions to secure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of resources.  That is a lovely phrase, but how do lay men and women tell medical professionals that an extra hip replacement should be carried out or that extra patients should be seen during the week?  This is how money is lost.  In many cases medical people do not agree with administrators who must balance the budget.</P>
      <P>A fair level of production on the part of medical professionals should be assessed.  For example, how many operations should they carry out?  This aspect has not been considered and it is why money is lost.  We will not have a proper medical service until we get to grips with that position and ensure people with medical cards are treated equally to those with VHI cover or people whose relatives come home from the United States with money.  We are doing our best but we are moving further away from that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards can only do so much and they need more help and co-operation to ensure a full return on the money spent.  I agree with Senator Maloney about a black hole; millions of <Col N="2091" /> pounds have been spent on health boards over the last 20 years.  They were originally run by the county councils who provided a good service.  There were regional hospitals and they were not overloaded, although the level of population was almost the same as it is at present.</P>
    <P>There are now more doctors, one of whom received £147,000.  I do not know if this involved a consultant or a general practitioner, but a GP would not have received the full amount.  There may be three other doctors in the practice and a surgery receptionist who must be paid from that sum.  It is easy to make capital from a large figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Secretaries only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>General practitioners provide a wonderful service and if somebody earns that amount, they are working long hours.  If a doctor was not providing a good service, or if he was unpopular, he would not earn such a sum.  I am satisfied that GPs do a good job, particularly in rural Ireland.  They are available 24 hours a day; one rarely rings up a doctor in a rural area and finds they are unavailable.  One goes to the same doctor on each occasion and they earn every penny they have.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to curtail spending on the health services, but I do not know how this can be achieved. Health boards have been in operation for 22 years and I have been a member of a board for 21 years.  During that time costs have continually mounted and the number of people queuing for treatment has also increased.  Consultants have been asked to have timetables and to see people hourly.  However, some people arrive at 10 a.m. and are still there at 7 p.m. or are sent home without seeing the doctor.  Savings should be made in this area but it requires cooperation. The stock answer for delays is that consultants were called to an emergency.  The waiting lists will not reduce unless some consultants are available only to see out patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of managing health <Col N="2092" /> boards is the increasing number of new services.  In the past, people only went to hospitals to have their appendices removed or for broken bones.  However, each new service not only involves a bed but a patient, a nurse and a physician. The pyramid is becoming wider at the bottom and taller.  We must come up with a system which sets the maximum amount which will be done.  Vast sums of money are spent on new technology and this will cause major problems in the future.  The first advances included hip and knee replacement operations but soon it will be possible to replace fingers and hands.</P>
    <P>This is admirable because people should be relieved of pain, but how can we continue to provide such services given the resources available?  Ministers like to say that bigger and better services are being provided; but irrespective of how many Bills are passed, costs will not be kept down while the services continue to expand.  The Bill suggests that health boards should be run in the same way as private businesses, but this will not work as efficiently as the Minister thinks because boards provide services to sick people who need treatment. The boards cannot only give half a service; it is all or nothing.</P>
    <P>The implication of the Bill is that members of health boards are running away with all the money, but 75 per cent of each board's budget is spent on staffing and only 25 per cent is available for other areas.  A hospital cannot function without staff and the number of staff must continually increase.  At present, many nurses work many hours above and beyond the call of duty for which they receive little or nothing.  Under the current tax system, if they work overtime and long hours, the Minister for Finance receives more than they do. They do not work for money but to provide a service.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but the Minister must do more than introduce legislation. The Bill addresses a problem but not its cause, which is that services must be provided but not at the going rate. For example, some years ago in Cork patients were sent to Belfast.  They <Col N="2093" /> received a good service but at less expense.  If services are to be cut, perhaps arrangements should be made with hospitals in England and elsewhere.  The North-Western Health Board has a good relationship with hospitals across the Border in Northern Ireland.  Instead of putting people on waiting lists for services at home, perhaps the Minister should consider giving them the cost of the service if they can get it elsewhere. This would put an end to waiting lists and people could get services.</P>
    <P>If we are going to run the health board as a business then let us put it on a business footing and give the customer choice.  If you go into a shop for a commodity and you do not like it, you can go into another shop.  Unfortunately, the person with a medical card has no choice and must sit on a waiting list for perhaps two years.  If that patient could be told that the Minister will meet the costs of their treatment if they could personally arrange it then we could say that we had put our health boards on a business footing.  In such a scenario the medical card holder would be on a par with the VHI subscriber or someone with sufficient money to pay for their treatment.  Perhaps this should be done on a pilot basis.  I am not happy that medical card holders are getting the service they need, they never have.  I am not happy because it is the money the Government is giving to provide that service that is keeping the medical professionals in work.  How many of them could manage successfully on their own if they had not got their jobs in the regional hospitals?  Let us determine to run the health service as a business and give the medical card holders who cannot get the required treatment in their own area the money to pay for their treatment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope it meets the requirements but I do not think it will.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and commend him and the Minister for Health on making changes.  I also want to put on record my appreciation of the Minister for Health's commitment to the general hospitals system.  The programme <Col N="2094" /> for Government and the health strategy document contain a commitment to make the health boards more accountable and to improve and define the management structures.  By and large, this Bill succeeds in that aim. However, I do not believe that a community based responsive health service will be served by abolishing the one democratic tier between the health provider and the health consumer, namely, health committees.  This document in one and a half lines states that local committees established under section 7 of the Principal Act are hereby dissolved; whereas in the Health Act, 1970, there are five subsections in that section.  They were never abolished but they are being abolished now.  In 1988 and 1989 the Government was following a programme of fiscal rectitude.</P>

I was a member of the Southern Health Board between 1985 and 1991 and of the local committee up to 1988 and, because of the cuts in health services, the issues were being raised in the local committees. For that reason the Government decided to withdraw the officials from the local committees and deprived the public representatives and representatives of the voluntary bodies of the right to speak out at a time when health services were being cut to the bone.</P>
      <P>In my own region an official of the health board told the officials of his department that the board may not be able to pay their wages.  He did that for an ulterior motive but he paid the price &mdash; he got his walking papers and rightly so.</P>

    <P>I want the Minister to look carefully at this because I will not support the abolition of health committees.  I represent an area which has a population of 75,000 people.  It is known as the North Cork public health district.  It stretches from Ballydesmond in the west to Araglen in the east.  With 75,000 <Col N="2095" /> people, it is as big as County Limerick. Who have we to speak for the health of the people in that area?  A health board where one day there is an official available and nobody available the next day; a director of community care who will come to north Cork whenever it suits, perhaps on Wednesday or Thursday. That is not providing a service and I am not going to accept it.  I have a great commitment to helping people with health services.  I have had to fight for a general hospital system for half of my life and we are glad that that at least has been recognised by the Minister and Government and that the general hospital system is secure for the future.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider section 16 of this Bill, which abolishes the local health committees.  As I stated, in the explanatory memorandum that is the reason given, namely, they had ceased to function.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the Bill decentralises our health system by increasing the powers of the health boards while at the same time missing the opportunity to not only maintain but to increase the powers at local level.  Under the section of the Health Act relating to voluntary bodies it states:</P>
    <P>it shall be the principal function of a local committee to advise the health board on the provision by the board of health services in the functional area of the committee, and a health board shall consider any advice so tendered to it.</P>
    <P>That is what you are asking us to abolish and I cannot accept that.  I hope the Minister will take account of these concerns and review the terms of section 16.</P>
    <P>I welcome other provisions in the Bill which I believe will make health boards more accountable and efficient.  The health boards were established in 1970 by Minister Childers.  I remember it well.  After a short time a very prominent person in Irish politics when asked about this system replied &ldquo;How do you unscramble the egg&rdquo;?  That is what we have to contend with &mdash; a health board in my own region of Cork or Kerry that <Col N="2096" /> has sub-committees, such as a general hospitals committee, a psychiatric services committee or a community care committee, that meet behind closed doors, a health board that will meet for two hours on the first Monday of each month.  Do you think that this provides a forum for people to raise issues of concern?  It does not and have no doubt about it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the trend in full eligibility.  I once got a figure from the Minister which showed that 39 per cent of people in the state had full eligibility. I would say that now it must be just over 30 per cent.  We have a situation where three people in the same family have medical cards and they are depending on the one person's income.  The income of the principal householder is assessed when determining eligibility.  One card is given to the spouse, the husband, the other perhaps to the wife, and one to the dependant over 16 years of age. That is an appalling state of affairs.  It is being done for the purpose of decreasing the percentage of people who are eligible for a medical card.</P>
    <P>Senator Maloney said that in excess of £100,000 was paid to GPs.  A similar sum is paid to GPs in my region and they also have private practices.  Last week the community welfare officer found that one person who was over the means limit got a medical card.  He was 85 years of age and his 75 year old wife was denied a medical card.  How could a 75 year old spouse be excluded from full medical card eligibility in 1996?  I could not agree with that.</P>
    <P>Although I welcome the Bill, I cannot figure out how the Minister can say a fundamental change will take place over the next few years in the funding of the voluntary sector, which comprises voluntary hospitals and the medical handicap agencies.  What are voluntary hospitals?  Will the public voluntary hospitals be under the aegis of the health boards?  They have failed since 1960 to bring them into the common selection procedure.  I wonder how the Minister will, with one stroke of his pen, fund the voluntary sector so easily.  They are all separate entities which receive <Col N="2097" /> substantial funding from the Department, although admittedly they provide a good service.</P>
    <P>I do not want to talk about all the bad stories, but the Bill states that a health board will be confined to whatever programme its submits and whatever expenditure is allocated by the Department to meet that programme.  On 1 October 1996 the dental department of the Southern Health Board was told it could no longer provide dental treatment to medical card holders because of the lack of funds.  The Minister can check that with the board.  I have a letter at home in which I made a very strong case and the reply which I received.  The principal dental officer and a dentist in my region confirmed that to me.  If there are strict regulations about funding, how can the Minister monitor crisis situations? There has to be some flexibility.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the public voluntary hospitals and I welcome the Minister's commitment to the general hospital system. A hospital is as good as the staff who run it and the equipment with which they are provided.  Since 1988 and 1989 there has been talk in my health board region of a pan hospital structure. Has that all been forgotten about?  The idea was to bring the old general hospital, which is a public hospital, in with the public voluntary hospitals.  We will always defend our general hospital system.  It is vitally important to have a hospital which is easy for people to reach.  There is also a sociological argument that patients' relatives and friends should find it easy to visit the hospital. If we had not fought so hard and had not gone to the High Court in 1989 we would not have a general hospital now. As a result of those experiences, I am somewhat wary of decisions which have been taken.  I want to ensure the best service is provided in hospitals which are near people.</P>
    <P>I see no sense in my health board paying colossal sums of money to lease premises in Cork city, north Cork and elsewhere.  A one-off capital expenditure would enable the board to build premises to accommodate their services <Col N="2098" /> and would save a great deal of money in the long-term which could be used to provide services.  I am speaking from the heart on this issue as I have very strong feelings on the question of medical services. I hope the Minister will take on board the points I made about section 16 and the abolition of the health committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to this debate.  I am pleased by the broad welcome the Bill has received.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said at the outset, this is an important Bill which aims to modernise the management systems in the health boards.  It sets down financial accountability provisions which will change the way health boards conduct their business.  It introduces a planning framework which is linked to specific resources and clear objectives.  In short, the Bill requires health boards to carry out their tasks in a context which emphasises planning, strategic management and financial accountability.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I have listened carefully to all the contributions.  It is fair to say there is broad agreement on all sides of the House on the need for the changes envisaged in the Bill.  I would like to respond to a number of matters raised in relation to specific provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Finneran's criticisms of the substantial increase in expenditure on health services, I wish to make the following points.  Recent Governments have identified health as a priority area for investment.  Additional funds have been provided for child care services, services for the mentally handicapped and nursing homes for the elderly. These additional funds have funded additional residential and respite care places and have increased the capability of the health services to respond to those most in need.  Value for money initiatives have contributed £20 million towards these developments. The health service is a labour intensive provider of services 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2099" /> Year-on-year increases in the health Estimate include provision for items such as national pay agreements, compensation for general inflation and increases in the various cash allowances paid.  These increases account for almost half of the overall increase.  A further 20 per cent, approximately, is accounted for by community drug schemes, legislative obligations and European Union commitments.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle alluded to the restructuring of the Eastern Health Board.  The Government has no plans to move away from the system of regional health boards which, by and large, have served us well over the last 25 years.  However, given the scale and complexity of health services in the greater Dublin region, there is a general acceptance of the need for some restructuring of the Eastern Health Board.  The Minister intends to submit proposals on the future administration of health services in the Eastern Health Board area to the Government shortly.  The Minister will make a further statement when the Government has taken decisions on the matter.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the purchase and sale of land by health boards.  Section 18 dispenses with the need for health boards to obtain ministerial consent for the acquisition or disposal of land.  It contains several important safeguards.  First, all decisions on the acquisition and disposal of lands will be reserved functions of the members of a health board.  Second, and most particularly, the Minister may give general directions to a health board on any proposed sale or acquisition of land. These directions must be complied with by the board.</P>
    <P>The directions, which it is proposed to issue as soon as possible after the enactment of the Bill, will set out general guidelines aimed at ensuring transparency of procedure and the attainment of maximum value in respect of the disposal and acquisition of health board land and, with regard to the application of the proceeds of sale, will ensure that they will be used for the <Col N="2100" /> improvement and development of the health service.  Included in these directions will be a requirement that health boards consult the Valuation Office to ascertain the correct market value of any lands they propose to buy or sell.</P>
    <P>The section also sets out particular requirements that must be followed by a health board that proposes to dispose of any land which is not required for the purpose of fulfilling its functions.  Paragraph (e) contains detailed requirements concerning the notification of board members regarding any proposed disposal of lands.  Members must have at least ten days notice of the proposal and must be given details of the land and the person to whom it is proposed to sell it.  A positive resolution must be passed at the next board meeting after such notification in order to give effect to any proposed disposal of lands.  These safeguards will ensure that health board lands are not sold without the full knowledge and consent of the board members.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran sought clarification on section 21.  This section amends the Nurses Act, 1985, to allow the Minister to extend by order the term of office of An Bord Altranais, the Nursing Board, which was due to expire on 3 October 1996.  The board has 29 members, 17 of whom are directly elected by members of the nursing profession and 12 of whom are appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to enable the present board to continue in office until a new nurses Bill, currently being prepared, comes into force.  It will avoid having the Nursing Board going to the trouble and expense of holding elections to a board which will fall to be reconstituted under the new legislation.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) makes it possible for the Minister to extend the term of office of the members of An Bord Altranais, which expired on 3 October 1996.  The subsection provides that the period of extension cannot be for more than 12 months.</P>
    <P>Sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Nurses Act prescribe the membership of the Nursing Board, and provide for appointments and elections to it.  Reference to <Col N="2101" /> these sections allows the Minister to extend the term of office of those members of the Nursing Board who are elected directly to the board by members of the nursing profession. Otherwise, the Minister could only extend the term of office of those members he appointed himself.</P>
    <P>Rules 1 and 2 of the Second Schedule to the Nurses Act, 1985, which this subsection overrides, relate to the tenure of office of the members of the board. They state that every member of the board shall hold office for a period of five years and that no member shall hold office for more than two consecutive terms of five years.  As some members of the current board have served two consecutive terms of five years, their membership could not be extended without this provision.  Subsection (2) provides that the Minister may, once only, extend the term of office of the members mentioned in subsection (1) by a further period not exceeding 12 months.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) was inserted by way of a Ministerial amendment during the Committee Stage in the other House.  It allows the Minister to make the order with retrospective effect.  The term of office of all 29 members of An Bord Altranais expired on 3 October 1996.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock raised the issue of the choice that boards sometimes make between leasing and purchasing properties. If there are specific difficulties there perhaps the Senator would communicate them to the Minister.  I will see that he expects the Senator's representations in that regard.</P>
    <P>The other issue was the proposed abolition of the local health committees. Section 16(3) of the Bill provides for the formal dissolution of the local health committees.  The Health Act, 1970, required the Minister to make regulations establishing local health committees to advise the health boards on the provision of services in the functional areas of the committees.  Local committees were duly established for each county with additional committees for Dun Laoghaire and the county boroughs of Limerick and Dublin.  In the <Col N="2102" /> case of Cork, three committees were established, covering Cork North, Cork West and Cork City South.</P>
    <P>In July 1987, the Government decided as part of a review of health spending that the local health committees should be abolished.  An appropriate reduction was made in health board allocations from 1 January 1988 but the necessary legislative changes were not made. While most of the local committees ceased to operate, committees continued to meet in Cork North and South for some time afterwards.  The members did not receive any expenses during this period.  Eventually these committees also ceased to operate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had representations from Senator Sherlock on this matter and representations opposing the abolition of the local committees have also been received from the Association of Health Boards in Ireland, which represents the collective view of health board members.  The Minister's view is that that the committees were ineffectual and their absence has not had a negative impact on the provision of services or on local democracy, since public representatives continue to hold the majority on all health boards.</P>
    <P>The case for restoring local health committees has been considerably reduced by new functions given to local authorities in the Local Government Act, 1991.  Section 5 empowers local authorities to represent the interests of the local community in such manners as it thinks appropriate and, in particular, to ascertain and communicate to other public authorities the views of the local community on the functions of those authorities.  I will convey the Senator's views to the Minister as expressed in the debate here today.</P>
    <P>Senator Maloney spoke of the provision of services for those who are using drugs and I assure him, as someone who represents a constituency outside the greater Dublin area, that I share his view that resources should be shared evenly throughout the country. The fundamental distinction is between the opiate problem in the Dublin area and the so-called softer drugs.  Perhaps <Col N="2103" /> that is the wrong term to use but it is used to differentiate between these drugs, opiates and harder drugs.</P>
    <P>After the Government decision last February, each health board was asked to produce a plan on the development of drug services and those plans were returned to the Department.  Further recommendations are part of the recent report of the ministerial task force in the matter.  The health boards have the responsibility for providing the services in the first instance.  I assure Senator Maloney that I am very committed, as is the Government, to ensuring that the full services are provided over time in all areas of the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell spoke earlier in glowing terms of the North-Western Health Board.  I was in their functional area today at a very encouraging project which is being launched in County Leitrim. All the children who have entered fourth class in primary schools in Leitrim are now part of a project to make Leitrim smoke free.  The children will be monitored from fourth class in primary school until the end of second year in secondary school.  The important aspect of this project is that the whole community is involved in it.  A statistic which I used today, and which I use very often, is that 6,000 people die in this country every year from smoking induced ailments such as cancer, chronic bronchitis and emphysema.</P>
    <P>I stress that the bottom line as far as health promotion is concerned is that people should take responsibility for their health and make lifestyle changes that can have a good effect on their health.  No lifestyle change would have a greater effect for good than if people stopped smoking and, more importantly, if young people did not take up smoking.  There are other aspects to health promotion such as healthy eating, exercise, etc.  Basically the health promotion strategy seeks to change the Department from what some would regard as a Department of disease into a Department of health.  It seeks to encourage people to adopt <Col N="2104" /> much healthier lifestyles so that there is less need for hospital services.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their constructive and worthwhile contributions to the debate.  I welcome the general approval for the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State for sticking to his guns as regards smoking.  He is a credit to us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health should provide the necessary funds to alleviate the serious overcrowding at the County Hospital, Roscommon.  I raise this matter as a result of consultations with staff, patients and people from the local community who have made representations to me.  There is broad consensus in Roscommon that the problem of overcrowding in the county hospital should be resolved.  The county hospital has a bed complement of approximately 85 beds.  This is made up of 35 medical beds in St. Coman's Ward, 16 beds in St. Teresa's ward which is used for geriatric and acute patients, mostly for acute ones in recent times, 25 surgical beds and 4 coronary care unit beds.  Recently the hospital has suffered serious overcrowding. It has been running at a capacity of 140 per cent.  There are many dangers to this, especially that of cross-infection.  These numbers above <Col N="2105" /> and beyond the complement of the hospital are in breach of fire safety regulations.  Apart from that, the patients, nursing, medical and ancillary staff suffer major trauma.</P>
    <P>The hospital's level of activity has increased at a dramatic rate over recent years.  In 1993, some 4,037 patients were admitted; in 1994 the figure was 4,370; in 1995 it was 4,526 and up to 1 September 1996, the figure was 3,382.  This shows that the hospital is moving towards an extra admission rate of 25 per cent over a four year period.  The hospital is playing its part as an acute general medical hospital in the Western Health Board area and is performing its duty alongside general hospitals in Galway and Mayo.  Bed occupancy has been at 133 per cent for the first six months of this year.  Between 1,100 and 1,200 people per month attend the casualty unit.</P>
    <P>Staff are under such strain they have threatened industrial action.  A strike ballot began last night in the hospital and if the problem is not solved it is intended that some level of industrial action will take place before the end of November.  This position I outline is fully supported by the Western Health Board and I have documentary evidence that as far back as August this year the decision of the management of the hospital, in conjunction with the Western Health Board was to write to the Department of Health requesting funds to open an extra 15 medical beds in the hospital.  To date there has been no reply.</P>
    <P>The decision of the programme manager in charge of the acute hospitals in the Western Health Board areas states:</P>
    <P>I support the request for extra beds despite the fact that the current national policies seem to shift resources from hospitals to the community. Roscommon County Hospital satisfied all the criteria that categorise a busy general community hospital and there appears to be a genuine resource shortfall i.e. not enough of accommodation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2106" /> That is the consensus after full investigation and consultation with the management and staff of the hospital by the programme manager.  I understand the union representing the nursing staff sought a meeting with the Department of Health.  There has been no response to this either.</P>
    <P>It is widely rumoured, and with some foundation, that there is an attempt to cap the number of beds in the hospital, particularly in the medical ward.  An instruction may be given that nobody is to be taken above the 35 bed level. There are often 40 beds in use but if an instruction is given to keep it at 35 that would amount to capping.  While it will keep the numbers down, it will not address the problems that exist.  It may resolve the fire safety issue or stop overcrowding in the corridors, but it will not solve the problems of the people of Roscommon who need to be admitted to the hospital.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for a joint decision by the Department and the Western Health Board to stop the overcrowding in the hospital but not to do it by capping the bed numbers.  I propose that what was known originally in the hospital as St. Teresa's ward be reopened.  I understand that has been decided at health board level provided clearance is received from the Department for funding of capital works and staffing.  The capital costs involved would be very little.</P>
    <P>A fire escape and some minor refurbishment is all that is needed and the ward could be staffed by seven or eight nurses.  For the sake of the Roscommon people, those who run our fine hospital and the peace of mind of the patients, give them the facility of the extra 15 beds and allow the staff to do their work in a proper fashion and give the care necessary to the people who seek treatment in the county hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me this opportunity to speak on behalf of the Minister for Health on this important issue.  The Minister has been aware for some time <Col N="2107" /> that there have been difficulties in overcrowding in the County Hospital Roscommon and the Department has had close discussions during the year with the management of the Western Health Board regarding the situation in the acute hospitals generally in the west.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Western Health Board that the current situation as regards overcrowding in the County Hospital Roscommon stems mainly from increased activity in the medical wards.  The board has informed the Minister that the present situation is unacceptable in terms of safety of patients and staff and has stated that it is taking the necessary steps to alleviate the current pressure on beds in that hospital.</P>
      <P>I understand there are practicable solutions which can be taken in the short term and which are aimed at providing an integrated approach to the resolution of the difficulties of overcrowding at the hospital.  These include the setting of an acceptable limit on the number of beds in the medical wards at any given time which cannot be exceeded; the review of admission and discharge policies in the hospital &mdash; in this regard I commend the hospital authorities on their efforts to date which have resulted in a much reduced average length of stay for patients and the review of communications with general practitioners with a view to moderating the demands on the hospital services.  The Minister is confident that such a pragmatic approach to relieving the overcrowding at the hospital will lead to improved conditions for patients and staff alike and he will be monitoring the situation closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On his visit to Roscommon County Hospital in June last, the Minister announced details of a comprehensive capital and revenue funding package to alleviate the pressure on acute hospital services in the Western Health Board area.  The Minister expressed his desire <Col N="2108" /> that Roscommon County Hospital would be considered for some element of relief given the step up in the hospital's activity in recent years.  I am pleased to say the hospital received a substantial element of these additional moneys to address its revenue funding difficulties which had arisen in part from taking on additional nursing staff.</P>
    <P>On the Minister's behalf I would like to reiterate the Department's commitment to the continued development of services in Roscommon County Hospital for the benefit of patients in that area.  In this regard, the Minister has recently approved the additional post of consultant surgeon at the hospital and it is expected that this investment will help address the current demands on the hospital while at the same time giving this service a high profile among the community.  Among other investments which the Minister has made in Roscommon is the provision of a capital grant last year of £117,000 for the purchase of vital equipment for the hospital's coronary care unit.  I understand this funding also enabled the hospital to purchase much needed additional equipment.</P>
    <P>The investments in Roscommon County Hospital I outlined above are aimed at its full integration in the delivery of health services in the area.  In light of the pragmatic approach being taken by the Western Health Board to deal with the current overcrowding problem at the hospital, the Minister looks forward to a favourable outcome soon and will be in regular contact with the Western Health Board.  I am confident that this approach together with the substantial investments being made by the Department of Health will help secure the long-term future of Roscommon County Hospital as a vital and flexible part of the acute hospital service in the west.</P>
