      <P>I have notice from Senator Hayes that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to outline her views concerning the operation of a &ldquo;league table&rdquo; of schools similar to that which exists in Britain.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Enright of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to review the regulations under the sports capital programme whereby swimming pools are specifically excluded under section 1.1 of the sports capital programme, in view of the fact that swimming pools are most important for recreation; and if she will consider funding for new pools and maintenance of existing pools under this scheme.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to make representations to the British Home Secretary to have an early transfer to <Col N="1362" /> the Republic of Padraic Mac Fhloinn, a republican prisoner at Full Sutton Prison, York, and to ensure that he receives appropriate treatment for his medical condition until he is repatriated.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to outline his attitude to the recent Consumer Association of Ireland survey into the country's 13 big mortgage lenders.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Hayes' and Senator Enright's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is item 1, item 18, motion 33, and item 2. Item 1 will be taken from the end of the Order of Business until 6 p.m. and I suggest 20 minutes per speaker.  Item 18, motion 33, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and item 2, Committee Stage of the Refugee Bill, 1995, will taken from 8 p.m. until late, but not later than 12 midnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed and 20 minutes is acceptable. The Leader intimated that he would be supportive of changes, at Committee on Procedure and Privileges level, to Standing Orders relating to Private Members' business.  I ask the Leader to place this on the agenda for the next Committee on Procedure and Privileges meeting so that we can discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of myself and my party I extend our heartfelt sympathy to the Maher family and the people of Portarlington following the tragedy that has gripped the nation.  We hope with our <Col N="1363" /> prayers that the remaining family will be able to overcome this tragedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended at the outset to join with Senator Wright in extending the sympathy of the House to the Maher family in light of the terrible tragedy which has befallen them, and the people of Portarlington.  I am sure all our sympathy goes out to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to that because it is the part of the country from which my family originated.  It is an appalling tragedy.  It is difficult to understand how the remaining family members can recover from such a traumatic experience.</P>
      <P>I have been approached by a group from the North of Ireland who are planning an international day of peace and reconciliation.  They requested that I raise this matter today and ask the Leader of the House if he could find some formula for transmitting to Government the suggestion that, as we enter the six months of Ireland's Presidency, it might consider taking international peace and reconciliation as a theme.</P>
      <P>Will we have a debate on broadcasting? I certainly have something to say on that issue.  I was in Belfast during the recent elections.  It is virtually impossible to get RTE radio in large sections of Northern Ireland.  One can get Raidió na Gaeltachta, but if we are interested in reconciliation between the two parts of the island, a strong broadcast signal from Dublin would be one method of informing people in the North of Ireland.  Could the Leader find a way of raising this with RTE?  Its signal should be clearly audible throughout the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Members in extending sympathy to the Maher family and the wider community in Portarlington on this dreadful tragedy.  It almost defies belief that an ordinary domestic accident could have such devastating effects.  The loss will be greatly <Col N="1364" /> felt not just within the family but in the wider community.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Senator Norris is on the wrong wavelength.  If he tuned into the medium wave he might be able to hear RTE in Belfast.  When is it proposed that we discuss the Forfás document <i>Shaping Our Future</i>, which is a strategy for enterprise in Ireland?  This document is important and merits debate. There were suggestions that if a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration were in place, the document's proposals might not be implemented. They are more likely to be implemented by that possible Administration than by any other.</P>
      <P>With regard to Northern Ireland, we congratulate those who were elected to the forum and the parties which will be represented at it.  We express the desire that all parties will come to the table to decide their future and that the ceasefire will be restored.  I do not know if it would be useful for the House to debate the matter at this time, although it was indicated that we would debate it before the forum meets on 10 June.  Perhaps in the circumstances all we can do is wish the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste well in London.  We hope there will be a fruitful outcome to those talks and that the forum will proceed on schedule.  Perhaps we should leave it at that until the forum meets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I wish to join with other speakers in extending sympathy to the Maher family and all the people of Portarlington. They must be stunned and shocked and it will take them a long time to recover from this tragedy.  As Senator Dardis said, this tragedy will touch every member of that community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Dardis's call for a debate on the Forfás document.  I welcome the fact that it indicates the need for a discussion on long-term planning with regard to the economy and enterprise development.  I do not think it would be appropriate for us to have a debate on Northern Ireland in the immediate future in view of the speed of <Col N="1365" /> activity there at the moment but I wish everybody involved well.</P>
    <P>The KPMG report on the financing of local authorities is with the Minister at the moment.  It has not yet been published but the Minister has indicated it will be fairly soon.  When it is published, we should have an early debate on the financing of local authorities.  This is a particularly interesting subject and needs detailed and widespread debate but action should be taken sooner rather than later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago it was agreed that there would be a discussion on the Irish language.  Ós rud é go mbeidh Teilifís na Gaeilge againn tar éis na laetheanta saoire, beidh cothrom na féinne ag gach éinne a bhfuil ábalta cúpla focail a rá.  I would like a general discussion which would not be confined to particular items.  Such a discussion could cover the use of Irish in the House, the impact of Teilifís na Gaeilge and any other matters related to the language. It could be open to Members to contribute in Irish or English.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Leader to ask the Minister for Finance when funds will be released so that the reports of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs can be printed.  Since this session started, that committee and its subcommittees have met at least once a week.  When I looked for some past reports, I received a copy of a letter the committee secretariat sent to the committee's chairman, Deputy Dukes. This stated that no money has been allocated to the committee to report on its activities.  That might not seem to be anything extraordinary, but it is diabolical that a joint committee of the Oireachtas cannot have the range of issues it discusses each week published.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a disgrace when Ministers are printing thousands of words on glossy paper every week.  If they have money to produce these <Col N="1366" /> glossy PR jobs they should at least allocate money so that Oireachtas committees can be properly reported.  Many people are looking for these reports in libraries but they cannot obtain them.</P>
      <P>There have been disturbing reports from the hospital services in Britain over the past number of weeks concerning the condition of mechanical devices used in hospitals.  The reports concern machines used for ECT and defibrillators used for heart resuscitation.  It was proven that in a large number of cases people were not adequately trained to use such electrical or mechanical devices.  They are supposed to be life saving devices but, in fact, they were killing people.  Hospital staff did not know how much electricity was going through the defibrillators or the ECT machines with the result that patients in psychiatric hospitals were coming out much worse than they were admitted.</P>

      <P>I suggest that this issue is more appropriate for the Adjournment than the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader find out from the Minister for Health whether staff are being trained to use these electronic devices in hospitals, and whether the devices are being adequately maintained? Is there a national maintenance or safety programme for these items?  In view of the alarming statistics, we should have a report of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on the two initiatives he launched last week.  The job start programme and the work experience element are two extremely important initiatives.  Can the Leader ask the Minister to clear the way for younger people between 18 and 21 to avail of these opportunities?  The 18 to 21 year old group is an important one, yet these projects are for people over 21.  If the 18 to 21 year olds were brought into this scheme it would be a fine one.  The Minister for Enterprise <Col N="1367" /> and Employment should examine the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at reports from Bonn, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, in relation to discussions which the Taoiseach had with Chancellor Helmut Kohl.  I have no reason to doubt <i>The Irish Times</i>' report which says that:</P>
      <P>The two men did not agree a joint approach to the beef crisis, and Mr. Bruton was unable to present Dr. Kohl with a new initiative to resolve it...</P>
      <P>That in itself would be very serious, but we read in the same article that:</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach... has backed British demands for a framework of measures to remove the worldwide ban on British beef exports...</P>
      <P>I find it incongruous that the Taoiseach could not present any initiative to Chancellor Helmut Kohl to deal with the beef crisis in which we could not only promote but insist on the highest possible standards that will guarantee the most stringent consumer requirements.</P>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach, in his discussions with Chancellor Kohl, could lay down very clearly that nothing less than the highest standards will satisfy us in the interests of consumers.  In view of the fact that we will insist on the highest standards, how can the Taoiseach back British demands for a framework of measures to remove the worldwide ban on British beef exports which is a consumer reaction?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader convey our concern to the Taoiseach and have this matter clarified in this or the other House as quickly as possible?  It defies comprehension that an industry here is in crisis because of problems in another country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice when the proposed legislation on defamation will be brought before the House?  The Leader will recall that either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice gave a commitment to the other House before voting down a Private Members' Bill on defamation that a new Bill would be brought forward.  The Leader will be aware the National Newspapers of Ireland called for the reform of the law on defamation which dates back to 1961.  Perhaps he will give me an answer tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I was pleased when the Leader informed me that he would arrange a debate on agriculture in the near future.  Given what Senator O'Kennedy has said, there is an urgent need for such a debate.  Will the Leader indicate when such a debate will take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Wright raised an issue which I will put on the agenda for the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which I am sure will meet in the near future. Senator Norris raised the question of a theme for the EU Presidency and I will pass on his suggestion to the Taoiseach. I cannot help him as regards the faulty RTE signal in Belfast as that is a matter for the station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis called for a debate on the Forfás report, which will take place soon &mdash; I will have a definite date tomorrow.  I agree with him and Senator O'Sullivan that a debate on Northern Ireland at this time would not contribute very much as events are moving too rapidly.  I join with them and others in hoping that the talks which are to begin will be as comprehensive as possible and that they will be undertaken in a spirit of genuine reconciliation.  All Members join with me in saying that.  Senator O'Sullivan raised the question of the KPMG report on the financing of local government.  As soon as the report is published, we will have a debate on it <Col N="1369" /> because it is a matter of great importance.</P>
    <P>Last year attempts were made to have a debate on the Irish language which is long overdue.  We will have one before the end of the session.  Senator Lanigan raised the non-publication of the reports of the Foreign Affairs Committees. That is a matter for the committee to take up with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I agree the publication of all parliamentary reports should be given priority.  I will convey my views on this to the Minister.  Senator Finneran could raise health matters on the Adjournment to get fuller replies.  I noted what Senator McDonagh said.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will make a full statement in the other House today on the Bonn meeting with Chancellor Kohl. We should wait to hear what he says in his comprehensive statement rather than referring to paragraphs in newspapers which, even if they are accurate, may not be in context.  Senator Mulcahy raised the question of defamation.  I understand the legislation, which is with the parliamentary draftsman, will not be published until the next session.  The Government awaits the publication of the Finlay report on the newspaper industry which, among other issues, will look at defamation.  That is one of the reasons the legislation has been delayed.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely called for a debate on agriculture.  The Government is to publish the Bord Bia Bill.  Although it is a short Bill, it deals with consumers and the beef industry which are of concern to Members.  I requested that it be a Seanad Bill.  If so, it will be in the House shortly.  While that does not mean we will not have a wider debate, this Bill, which will be in the House next week or the week after, would be a good start to that debate.</P>

    <Title>Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was first introduced in 1994 and it has undergone a number of changes since then.  The Bill was concerned with two issues in 1994, the exemption of mergers from the Competition Act and the introduction of proper enforcement proceedings to underpin the existing 1991 Act.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was introduced in 1994, the merger provision caused considerable controversy.  Many people were concerned that the exemption of mergers from the Competition Act would have opened the opportunity for many mergers to pass through, allowing large companies to acquire smaller ones without proper scrutiny.  This caused a degree of debate across the House.  On taking Government, we undertook to review that element in discussion with the social partners and that has been done.  I have decided to drop that element from the Bill and to establish a mergers and competition review group to look at that, among a number of other issues relating to competition law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second major new element in this Bill introduces criminal offences and penalties in respect of competition law violations.  Ireland has stood out for a number of years as having a weak competition law.  When that was corrected by the 1991 Act we provided legislation that only introduced the notion that the Competition Authority would certify and licence certain agreements.  We also allowed for third parties to take court action.  However, we did not introduce, like other countries, enforcement procedures where an independent third party, such as the Competition Authority, could take enforcement actions and investigate third party complaints and on foot of those investigations, take the necessary steps to deal with alleged <Col N="1371" /> abuses of competition.  The reliance of the 1991 Act on private actions by individuals in the court has proved less than fully effective and this Bill is changing that.</P>
    <P>The major issue, as an introduction to this Bill, is to stress the importance of competition and effective competition laws.  We are a small open economy dependent on trade.  Increasingly, what is traded are no longer manufactured goods but services.  The competitiveness of our exports is dependent not only on the direct production of goods and services but increasingly on non-traded services provided to business in the direct trading sector.  It is important that we establish a broad competitive environment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Culliton and various NESC reports emphasised that the competitiveness of our economy does not depend solely on labour costs or any one dimension but on competitiveness across a range of both public and private sector activities.  It is important that we sustain the strong competitiveness of our economy with a system of law that says that anti-competitive agreements are not acceptable, that they restrict production and employment, increase the cost to consumers and business and damage the economy.</P>
    <P>Estimates regarding the potential gains from a more competitive environment in the Irish economy indicate that conservatively 1 per cent of GNP would be saved if more effective competition law was in operation.  This would amount to £360 million a year. Any loss of employment or excess charging on that scale is unacceptable and effective and modern competition law, with proper sanctions, must be enforced to deal with the problem.  This is the background to the Bill and the reason the Competition Authority is being given enforcement powers.  The Bill will also provide for the imposition of fines in serious criminal cases.</P>
    <P>Most Senators appreciate it is not realistic to expect a third party, a small <Col N="1372" /> player or even a consumer, to have the resources to challenge a much larger player, anti-competitive agreements or abuses of dominant positions in the courts.  This was never a practical avenue and it is not surprising in retrospect that few companies have been in a position to take that route to try to enforce their rights and ensure there was no anti-competitive behaviour.  It is correct that provision is made not just for direct action by an individual who claims to have suffered damage going to the High Court but also for the appointment of a director of competition enforcement.  The director will have powers to act on behalf of consumers and companies which are being damaged by anti-competitive behaviour.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains proposals to introduce new powers of enforcement through the appointment of the director of competition enforcement.  The Bill also gives the Competition Authority power to undertake wide ranging investigations on its own initiative.  Hereto-fore, such investigations could only be conducted at the explicit request of the Minister.  It is unsatisfactory that competition law is dependent on political action.  A strong independent agency, which is committed to ensuring that competition law is effectively pursued, is required.</P>
    <P>The new changes will not be achieved without cost.  A major change which is required to underpin the legislation is the provision of additional resources, for example, an increase of 50 per cent in the staff of the Competition Authority. This will ensure a much more effective pursuit of competition law. The investment of these resources will be fully justified by the potential improvement in economic performance.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, I have established a competition and mergers review group.  Its work, which will start when the Bill is enacted, will be extremely important.  Many serious matters need to be addressed in this area, not least the consolidation of competition and mergers legislation which is currently spread over a large number of statutes, <Col N="1373" /> including the 1978 legislation relating to mergers, the 1991 competition legislation and this Bill.  The review group is chaired by Mr. Michael Collins, SC, and is representative of various bodies, including large and small firms, consumers, trade unions, the legal profession, academics and my Department. It will obtain the views of all interested parties in the competition field and will make recommendations on the medium to long-term effectiveness of all our competition legislation, particularly the mergers legislation in the context of legislative consolidation.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the original proposals were an attempt to balance the claim that there was excessive bureaucracy &mdash; it was described as double jeopardy &mdash; in relation to mergers under mergers and competition legislation and the concern that large companies would have a clear field to take over small companies without proper scrutiny.  This is an important area which requires the group's attention.  It will look at things like the groceries order and take into account changes and developments at EU level and world-wide competition policy.  At EU level there is a considerable move to try to consolidate their own competition law and to promote new areas of national competence.  There is a lot of change in this area and it justified a review by a well qualified group which I have put in place.</P>
    <P>The Competition Act, 1991, is based on Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  Throughout the old cumbersome procedure of the restrictive practices legislation a Minister introduced specific orders to govern competition in a particular sector and those orders created criminal offences which the Minister could pursue.  In practice this proved to be very unwieldy.  It did not get to grips with many anti-competitive practices in the economy.  It was very slow to respond and there were few effective enforcement procedures undertaken under it.  That was repealed in 1991 and instead we went with Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of <Col N="1374" /> Rome.  Those Articles essentially made it illegal to enter into anti-competitive behaviour or anti-competitive agreements and they made it illegal to abuse a position of market dominance in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>The basic elements of the competition law were the introduction of those concepts into Irish law.  The Competition Authority was established to implement it.  Its principal functions under the Act up to this have been to either certify agreements that are notified to it which are not anti-competitive or, alternatively, where the agreement was in principle in breach of the Act to licence it as an acceptable agreement on grounds that there were other issues in the public interest that superseded the anti-competitive aspects.  That was the basic machinery of the original legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is filling a deficiency in the original legislation.  We are to have a Competition Authority that not only does the reactive things of leasing through agreements notified to it and deciding upon them but it also has the active powers of investigation responding to third party complaints of anti-competitive behaviour and, ultimately, of taking enforcement action either under the civil code or, in extreme cases, under the criminal code. The old system of depending on third parties to take actions has proved ineffective and we are correctly moving on from that stage in our competition law.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of Senators to specific provisions of the Bill.  Sections 2 and 3 set out the offences and penalties with regard to breaches of the rules of competition, that is dealing with the criminal aspect of the legislation.  Section 7 gives the Authority public enforcement powers under the civil code and also in relation to summary offences in the criminal code.  Section 8 allows the Authority at its own initiative to study and analyse any practice or method of competition. Section 9 provides for the appointment of one permanent member of the Competition Authority with the title Director <Col N="1375" /> of Competition Enforcement who will concern himself with the enforcement aspect of the Authority's work.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the creation of a criminal offence in respect of breaches of the rule of competition and section 3 sets out the penalties.  It creates offences where an undertaking breaches the existing competition law as defined under sections 4 and 5 of the old Competition Act.  Effectively, what were originally civil offences are now becoming criminal offences with separate provisions in relation to good defences in order to provide for the change in making something a criminal offence. Sections 4 and 5 are being transposed to a criminal section.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the original Act spells out offences in relation to anti-competitive behaviour.  Those offences refer to rules of competition and state that all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade in any goods or services in the State are prohibited and void, in particular those which directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions, limit or control production, technical development or investment, share markets or sources of supply, apply dissimilar conditions to similar transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage and agreements which make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which by their nature and according to commercial usage have no connection with the subject of such contracts.  The original section provides for those specific offences and for a more general offence of anti-competitive agreement.</P>
    <P>The other element, abuse of dominant position, which will now be criminalised in certain cases under this Bill again refers to section 5 of the original legislation.  In addition, section 5 (1) provides that any abuse by one or more <Col N="1376" /> undertakings of a dominant position in trade for any goods or services in the State or in a substantial part of the State is prohibited and shall be an offence. Such abuse may consist in directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions, limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers, applying dissimilar conditions to similar transactions with other trading parties thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage and making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by other parties of supplementary obligations which by their nature and according to commercial usage have no connection with the subject of such contracts.</P>
    <P>Prosecution for a criminal offence under the above headings will be initiated either at the level of summary conviction or conviction on indictment. Summary proceedings would be initiated in the District Court by the Competition Authority in less serious cases.  Where on summary conviction an undertaking is found to be guilty it shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £1,500 or where the undertaking is an individual, he or she shall be liable to a prison sentence not exceeding six months plus the fines or either of those punishments.</P>
    <P>Where conviction on indictment is involved, cases would be taken on behalf of the State by the Director of Public Prosecutions on foot of a file prepared by the Competition Authority and, where conviction results, the provision is for a fine not exceeding £3 million or 10 per cent of turnover &mdash; whichever is the greater &mdash; of the undertaking in the financial year ending in the 12 months prior to the conviction.  Where an individual is convicted on indictment, the same fine and percentage applies but there is also, at the discretion of the court, provision for a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years or both.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of debate about these criminal sanctions, specifically debate concerning the higher level of proof required in order to obtain criminal convictions.  The debate <Col N="1377" /> centred on whether criminal offences should be confined to a limited number of specific offences &mdash; that is, <i>per se</i> offences &mdash; along the line of US competition law, whether criminalising a civil offence raises the burden of proof to beyond reasonable doubt and whether the good defences provided in section 3 undermine the chances of possible conviction.</P>
    <P>With regard to specific offences, the offences which we are creating are more specific than those which exist under US competition law which has been developed on the basis of case law.  We sought legal advice about the best way to create a criminal offence.  Our advice was that the existing sections 4 and 5, which have their root in competition law have more specific offences and provide for a more general possibility of the courts recognising, as case law evolves, particular types of anti-competitive behaviour that were not envisaged by the original authors, would have the opportunity to evolve case law based on the specific cases with which it was presented.  We have taken advice and are of the view that this is the best way forward.  In some cases it creates specific offences, such as price fixing, and in others it gives the courts scope to evolve law.  That is a sensible and pragmatic way to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>As regards the burden of proof, a much higher burden of proof is required to prove a criminal case than is needed to take a civil action.  A criminal case must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  This is a difficult hurdle to cross, and rightly so, because a criminal offence is very serious and carries with it the potential of imprisonment.  There will be a need to establish proof beyond reasonable doubt.  In the case of a conviction on indictment, this must be obtained when a jury has been convinced beyond reasonable doubt that an offence has taken place.  It is right that the criminalising of such offences be incorporated in the Bill because of their potential gravity.  These offences can affect people's livelihood and have the <Col N="1378" /> potential to be seriously damaging.  On the other hand, it must be recognised that, if such offences are criminalised, the legislation must contain requirements relating to proof.</P>
    <P>Some people have made the contention that the ante will be raised in civil cases if tests are introduced to examine whether criminal offences are proven beyond reasonable doubt, which they must be.  This argument, advanced by people within and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas, was assessed and we are satisfied that it does not hold water. Proof will be required in civil cases on the balance of probability as it always has been.  There is no support for the proposition that where an individual set of events gives rise to potential civil and criminal liabilities the civil claim falls to be determined on the same standard of proof as the criminal claim.</P>
    <P>Another issue which gave rise to concern was that relating to good defences. In that area, the Bill provides for a good defence for defendants in criminal cases under specified conditions.  A defendant, for example, can prove that he did not know, nor in all the circumstances of the case could he be reasonably expected to have known, that the acts concerned done by him would constitute a breach of the competition legislation. Concern was expressed that this was an easy escape clause and would undermine the effectiveness of the Bill. However, the important issue here is that the defendant will have the opportunity to prove this.  It is most likely in such cases that he would be subject to cross-examination and to prove by reference to the legislation that he did not know, nor in the circumstances of the case could he be expected to have known, that what he was doing was in contravention of competition law.  A defendant who chooses to use this defence will be required to establish that that is the case.  This will not undermine the effectiveness of the legislation.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on us to provide a good defence clause in cases where new criminal offences are being established. Such cases involve certain specific <Col N="1379" /> offences but they also give the courts potential to consider new areas of anti-competitive behaviour which have not been envisaged or listed.  To balance this, there must be a reasonable provision relating to good defences.  That balance has been well struck in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Concerns were also expressed about potential avoidance of the provisions of this legislation through the way in which companies were constructed, or by their directors stating that they had no responsibility for decisions taken by someone down the line and that the buck does not stop with those who control the company.  This matter was the subject of considerable concern during the Committee Stage debate in the Dáil. Under the penalties provision I am providing to meet those points by making it possible to link the undertaking to people working there down to a director, manager or similar officer level in regard to an offence.  The provision is that where a person is proceeded against, it shall be presumed until the contrary is proved that that person &mdash; the director or manager &mdash; consented to the committing of the offences, unless they establish the opposite is true.</P>
    <P>In the definition of &ldquo;director&rdquo;, a director includes a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the undertaking concerned are accustomed to act.  The purpose of this provision is to ensure that those who are influential in the running of a company but are not listed as directors are encompassed by this Bill.  Concerns were expressed in the Lower House that we should have effective ways of pursuing those who control companies but are not listed as the directors.</P>
    <P>Expert evidence is another area related to a reasonable prospect of achieving convictions.  A great deal of concern was expressed in the Lower House that the convention of criminal courts has been to not admit expert evidence. It was believed that would undermine the possibility of effectively pursuing competition law because, due to the technical nature of the offences, <Col N="1380" /> the evidence presented to the court by the Competition Authority, for example, would be a very important element in a case.  I have provided explicitly for the admission of expert evidence in criminal commercial cases, which has not been the norm to date. I have made a provision, subject to the court's discretion, that such expert evidence will be admitted if the witness appears to the court to possess the appropriate qualifications relating to the matter at issue.</P>
    <P>This section also provides that the court has jurisdiction to rule out the admissibility of such evidence when it considers the ends of justice would be best served by so doing.  In other words, we are not trying to circumscribe the court to say it must admit expert evidence in all cases but are introducing a presumption it will admit expert evidence unless it would be unfair to so do. Under the section, the expert cannot express an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the party concerned.  The expert will provide technical expertise regarding offences and some of the agreements in place, but will not reflect specifically on the guilt or innocence of the person concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 5 introduces the notion of category certificates, which business will generally welcome.  Category certificates mean it can be provided <i>en bloc</i> that certain types of agreement are not anti-competitive in nature.  That avoids businesses having to submit detailed notification of all the individual agreements within that class.  For example, certain areas of mergers would benefit from a category certificate because they would not have to make individual notifications to the Competition Authority and wait for certification.  That provision will be generally welcomed because it will reduce the bureaucracy of competition law and improve the flow of work through the Competition Authority.</P>
    <P>Section 7, as I mentioned earlier, is probably the key section as it extends the right of civil action under the existing section 6 of the Competition Act, <Col N="1381" /> 1991.  It provides that either the Minister can take an action in the High Court or a damaged individual can take a court action.  I strongly believe it is inappropriate for Ministers to be the determinants of those actions.  It is not appropriate for our competition law to be dependent on ministerial action and intervention in business in this way.  We need a strong, independent, arm's length competition enforcement agency. Therefore, we are providing that the enforcement powers will be extended beyond the Minister, or third parties, to include the Competition Authority. That is typical practice throughout Europe and will be broadly welcomed here.</P>
    <P>It will ensure that if small suppliers or small players who are being victimised cannot, because of various relationships or their lack of resources, take effective court actions, there will be an independent third party capable of taking those actions on their behalf.  This will be a welcome improvement in the existing competition provisions.</P>
    <P>The Authority can now take civil action for an injunction or a declaration by the court for breaches of sections 4 and 5 of the Competition Act, 1991. This provision will also benefit the Competition Authority where it succeeds in taking a civil action and achieves a declaration that a practice was anti-competitive.  It also gives the damaged party an opportunity to take an action and claim compensation. Under the Bill, the aggrieved person will have a right of action against an undertaking and against any director, manager or other similar officer who authorised or consented to anti-competitive activity.</P>
    <P>In relation to consent, where it is proved that an activity unlawful under this Bill was carried out by an undertaking it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that each director, manager or other similar officer authorised or consented to that activity.  These provisions are being inserted to make directors responsible for their activities.  The issue of consent was debated in the <Col N="1382" /> Lower House where it was felt strongly that the onus should be placed on a director or manager to demonstrate whether they had authorised or consented to anti-competitive behaviour rather than the other way round.  This approach was agreed to and has been incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 allows the Competition Authority, on its own initiative, to study and analyse any practice or method of competition.  Under the 1991 Act, the Authority had to await a request to them by the Minister.  This provision gives the Authority better scope to initiate investigations and studies and generally promote a more competitive economic environment.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the appointment of one permanent member of the Competition Authority with the title of director of competition enforcement.  I am also providing for the appointment of back-up staff, including professional economists, to ensure the Office of the Director of Competition Enforcement is effectively staffed.  Some concern was expressed that the same body should not be engaged in certifying, licensing and enforcing.  However, the office of the director of competition enforcement will be separate from the Competition Authority.  The duties of the director are clearly set out in section 9 of the Bill. The idea of licensing and enforcing is not new.  The Environmental Protection Agency licenses and enforces also.  The decision on whether an offence took place or a liability was incurred is a matter for the courts and not for the Authority. I do not see a problem here and I am satisfied we have struck the right balance.  Section 10 provides for the payment of fees for merger notifications to the Minister under the Mergers and Take-overs Act, 1978.</P>
    <P>In my survey of this Bill, I hope I have given some flavour of what the legislation is about.  We are living in a global market where competitive forces are increasing daily and we have to be effective.  We have to bench-mark ourselves against the very best.  There is no room for a non-trading sector which <Col N="1383" /> practises anti-competitively and adds to business and consumer costs.</P>
    <P>Ireland must have a strong competitive culture which is backed by proper competition legislation that is independently executed by an organisation such as the Competition Authority.  This legislation will benefit the economy in the long term and respond to reports such as the Culliton and the NESC which have encouraged us to go down this route.  I commend this legislation to the House.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, because of a Government meeting, I will have to leave the House at a certain stage but I will be taking careful note of what is said and I will respond to issues raised in my absence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his worthwhile explanation of the sections of the Bill.  I read his contribution when he was in Opposition when the legislation was first introduced in 1994.  I am pleased that he has incorporated some of what he said then into this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is especially welcome that the Bill is aimed at correcting the shortcomings in the 1991 Act by providing for civil enforcement of that Act in the public interest.  There are major anti-competitive and restrictive practices in this country which are a high cost to the Irish economy.  It is losing up to £300 million per year, or 1 per cent of GNP. This is of major significance to a small economy.  I welcome efforts to root out these anti-competitive and restrictive practises which, with increased competition from overseas, limit the ability of Irish industry to compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome many specific aspects of the Bill.  There is a provision which adds to current legislation by conferring the right of action on the Competition Authority in the case of breaches of sections 4 and 5 of the Competition Act, 1991.  In addition to allowing the Authority to respond to third party complaints, it enables it to initiate action at its discretion.  This is a significant <Col N="1384" /> improvement on the 1991 Act.  It should greatly increase the Authority's ability to react swiftly to the anti-competitive situations.</P>
    <P>In this increasingly complex world it is vital that the Competition Authority can respond quickly and effectively to changing developments and consequently the provisions in the Bill which allow for a more pro-active authority.  It is in all our interests to ensure a proper system of checks and balances in commercial life.</P>
    <P>I am also in favour of the section which allows the Authority to undertake research on its own initiative.  Section 7 provides that the Minister may appoint a director of competition enforcement. This will give it the ability to undertake investigations on its own initiative or at the Minister's request.  As the role and scope of the Authority develops it is likely that such an appointment will be considered worthwhile.  However, if this individual is to be truly effective, he or she must be well resourced.  While I am pleased to note that the Minister has given some indications of the type of additional resources which will be provided, I would have preferred if he had detailed more clearly the arrangements for the resourcing of the Authority.</P>
    <P>This is good legislation.  The Minister is to be complimented for the way in which he has strengthened the original legislation which was introduced in 1994.  I could not but recall the debate we had on the consumer credit legislation some months ago where we put in place good legislation for the improvement and enforcement of a much more attractive climate for consumer credit.  However, we have not put the resources in place to make that legislation as effective, consumer friendly and beneficial to the economy as it might be.</P>
    <P>The sections of the Bill detailed by the Minister contain good proposals. However, how effective will we be in implementing this legislation?  While the Minister advised that additional resources would be available &mdash; there will be an increase of 50 per cent in <Col N="1385" /> staff, etc. &mdash; if the legislation is to be effective the Competition Authority will have to be adequately resourced.  Since the introduction of this legislation a strong lobby consisting of lawyers, economists and spin doctors from the big companies are flaunting anti-competition and anti-restrictive practices in this country.  It will, therefore, take a significant effort to implement the legislation. While I accept and welcome the provisions in the Bill the Minister should detail the kind of resources he will make available on its enactment and the way in which they will be deployed.  He should also spell out more clearly how he will tackle the big boys in the anti-competition area.</P>
    <P>One only has to look at the semi-State sector to see how the big boys operate.  While there have been responses to change by the bigger semi-State organisations, such as the ESB and Telecom Éireann, they are not interested in facing up to competition. They want to maintain that <i>status quo.</i> It is frustrating that the efforts to bring about competition are being continually thwarted by many companies.  In addition, many other sectors are also cleaning up their act because anti-competition legislation of the kind one finds in the USA or in Europe is alien here; it will be difficult for some of the bigger companies to change their competitive practices.</P>
    <P>It will be very difficult to implement the provisions of this legislation effectively. Nevertheless, I compliment the Minister on the mechanisms he has put in place.  The competition and mergers review group, under the chairmanship of Michael Collins, SC, which will begin its work when the Bill is enacted, is a welcome development.  It will tackle many of the areas about which I have expressed concern.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 deal with offences and penalties relating to breaches of rules of competition.  The increased penalties are welcome.  The powers given to the Authority in section 7 for public enforcement are a strong weapon which has not been available to date.  Section <Col N="1386" /> 9 provides for a permanent member with the title of &ldquo;Director of Competition Enforcement&rdquo; which is also a welcome development.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the Competition Act, 1991, it has been possible for firms and persons to have recourse to the courts to seek redress from those involved in anti-competitive activity. This Bill develops this measure by introducing the concept of criminal sanctions, stiff fines and imprisonment for such offences.  How will this be policed and how much will it cost?</P>
    <P>The courts system already experiences difficulties with backlogs of cases and serious criminal activity cannot be brought to court quickly.  One wonders what priority will be given in the courts to cases involving anti-competitive behaviour.  A heavy workload is to be put on a courts system already bursting at the seams.  Such cases are likely to be pushed into the background and sidetracked despite the Minister's best efforts to ensure that does not happen.</P>
    <P>There may also be difficulties providing proof of the anti-competitive practices which the Minister described in his speech.  He referred to practices which would be targeted in particular, including those which&mdash;</P>
    <P>... directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions, those which limit or control production, technical development or investment, those which share markets or sources of supply, those which apply dissimilar conditions to similar transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage and agreements which make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which by their nature and according to commercial usage have no connection with the subject of such contracts.</P>
    <P>Given the practicalities of price fixing or production control, it may be difficult to prove that people are in breach of the specific practices the Minister outlined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> One of the most worrying trends in Irish business is the development of wholesale cartels in certain industries.  I am aware of examples in which the suppliers of specific products are involved in a nationwide cartel and they are sharing out the customer base in a price fixing arrangement.  However, it would be difficult to prove that is being done.  I wonder how effectively proof can be provided for the courts for such practices.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to other abuses, such as &ldquo;... directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions, limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers&rdquo;.  Will the Minister indicate how he sees the Competition Authority and the other policing arrangements being put in place getting to grips practically with those problems?</P>
    <P>Prosecution for a criminal offence under the Bill at the level of a summary conviction initiated through the District Court by the Competition Authority is good for less serious cases.  The provisions for more serious cases, convictions on indictment, which will carry a fine not exceeding £3 million or 10 per cent of turnover, are also good, assuming they can be properly policed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of the burden of proof, I note the concerns the Minister has expressed in drafting the Bill and those expressed on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  I would be grateful if the Minister would expand on the practicalities involved.  There is an easy escape clause from the offences provision because the top lawyers will be able to get around many aspects of the Bill.  I worry about the language used by the Minister when he said a defendant would have to prove &ldquo;... by reference to the legislation that he did not know, nor in the circumstances of the case could he be expected to have known, that what he was doing was in contravention of competition law&rdquo;.  Good arguments and excuses will be advanced <Col N="1388" /> to escape guilt in anti-competitive practices cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister's efforts to make the legislation as watertight as possible are welcome.  I would like him to indicate the level of resources that will be provided to implement the Bill, to make it effective and achieve the desired results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is two years since this Bill first came before the Dáil and in that time a number of things have changed.  When in Opposition the Minister made comments about the Bill and he has endeavoured to make the changes he felt necessary to bring the legislation into line with the further development of the economy.  I welcome the establishment of the mergers and competition review group, which will be an ongoing body to look at the overall position, take on board changes which are required and have them implemented.</P>
      <P>This legislation is interesting.  Over the last 12 months or so the Minister has been criticised for not agreeing to a merger or purchase of the <i>Irish Press</i> titles because he wanted to prevent them becoming part of a monopoly. When we consider what the Bill is trying to do, we see the decision made in that instance was correct, although the Minister and his colleagues felt the wrath of many pens for not allowing this monopoly to be formed.  The decision was correct because, as a result of it, a competitor newspaper was launched, the <i>Evening News</i>; if he had not made that decision, there would be no competitor in the marketplace.  No individual or group should have full control of any area, in the press or otherwise.  I fully support the line taken by the Minister; the fact that he bore the brunt of criticism makes his decision even more correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A proposal was made to Fingal County Council recently for the provision of a new terminal at Dublin Airport. This is another example of possible competition but the biggest single objector was a State owned monopoly. The Minister says we are losing up to 1 <Col N="1389" /> per cent of GNP or £300 million per year from anti-competitive practices. How will we gain that money back if we do not provide competition?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It will take great effort to catch Aer Rianta with this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It will but there are other examples.  Many companies are frustrated and annoyed about monopolies. Aer Rianta is in business in other countries; if the same protection it has here was afforded to companies in those countries, would it be as successful today?  I say it would not.  I take my hat off to private sector companies who wish to get into competition if they see a niche in the market.</P>
      <P>I take on board Senator Fahey's point that the legislation is good but there are issues relating to its implementation. Cases currently before the courts are being put on the long finger and this Bill could lead to more of the same.  At the lower end of the scale, where a minor offence has been committed, is there a case for on the spot fines?  If an inspector finds a company is in breach of a regulation he could levy a fine payable to the State, which would prevent further clogging of the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fahey also asked how we would prove a company had directly or indirectly imposed unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions.  Multinationals have caused job losses by setting unfair purchase or selling prices.  They have made decisions or entered agreements to purchase substantial amounts of product over a period of months and later decided not to go ahead with the purchase.  They are fully aware that people have lost jobs and companies have failed as a result of being dependent on one outlet for their goods.  Those companies have then been taken over, often by the multinationals which caused their problems.  Will the mechanisms the Minister is putting in place ensure that this will not happen or, if it does, that the substantial fines mentioned in the Bill will be imposed and paid by the companies concerned? <Col N="1390" /> No one in either House would deny that sharp practice in certain areas has led to events such as I described.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us that he intends increasing the staff by 50 per cent; what is the current number of employees?  He has established a review group &mdash; how often does he expect it to report?  To whom will it report?  When it makes proposals, what mechanism will be in place to implement them?  I welcome the Minister's decision to appoint a person to oversee this work &mdash; the group will be under the chairmanship of Mr. Michael Collins, SC.</P>
    <P>It is important to give the lead and to inform the general public and those who will be affected by this particular legislation that it will not be left on the shelf to gather dust and no action will be taken when people do not obey the rules.  Would it be possible for the Minister to inform us each year of the number of cases, if any, that were reported and investigated and fines imposed?  I do not believe this legislation will be successful unless the Minister shows the people concerned that he means business and that the legislation will protect jobs in monopolies and in other areas that I have mentioned.  I believe jobs are not being protected.  On the information already given, the penalties imposed under this Bill are severe but it is only when they are implemented that we will know if the legislation has teeth.  I would ask the Minister to consider the possible clogging up of the courts system.  I wonder if on-the-spot fines up to a certain level might be considered.  If this were agreed to, it would relieve a substantial amount of work and reduce the number of cases coming before the courts.  The sooner we have on-the-spot fines for driving offences, the sooner the more serious cases will be dealt with in the courts, and more quickly than at present.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation.  I concur with and congratulate the Minister on bringing forward many of the ideas he enunciated in the other House in 1994. I believe the legislation is all the <Col N="1391" /> stronger for it but I would like the Minster to give his opinion on the implementation of many aspects of it.  I would not like to think we were passing legislation that would not become forceful as soon as possible and, with the staff the Minister intends employing, ensure that people are protected and that monopolies are kept from growing in certain areas.  We have quite a few of them, and some of them have not given a fair view of what is happening in many areas of Irish life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister but I am afraid I cannot extend the same welcome to the Bill.  I believe this legislation is fatally flawed.  If it is passed, it will be bad for the customer, bad for the economy and bad for our legal system.  The only way forward is to throw this Bill out completely and to start again with a clear grasp of the principles involved.  I have deep sympathy with the Minister because I know he has put a lot of work and effort into this. However, what has happened is that he has built this legislation on a foundation of sand.  He has to go back to the original principles and start again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me begin by nailing my colours to the mast.  I am strongly in favour of competition; I am in favour of the State encouraging and promoting competition and of prohibiting and punishing commercial behaviour that is genuinely anti-competitive. Unlike many people, I have no doubts or reservations about the benefits of competition.  I believe effective competition is the best friend of the customer.  All businesses should be customer driven but many of them are not.  Competition is an excellent discipline that forces businesses to put the customer first and always to act in their interest.  It is a tough and painful discipline but it is rewarding for the customers and the businesses they patronise.  Competition spawns win-win situations.  Effective competition produces lower prices but that is far from the end of it.  Nowadays, businesses have to compete on a whole <Col N="1392" /> range of fronts.  They compete on quality, service, the range of goods they offer and innovation.  On every front the customer benefits.  If we have the interests of the customer at heart, we should always be in favour of competition and promoting the maximum amount of competition.</P>
    <P>We have to realise that our culture is not particularly friendly to competition; quite the reverse is true and this has been mentioned by Senator Farrelly and Senator Fahey.  If we look back at our economic history since independence &mdash; and I have no intention of pre-empting the expertise of Senator Lee in this regard but in his book he often touches on this &mdash; we find that we have been remarkably energetic in the way we have perpetuated monopolies, created new ones and protected the interests of both old and new.  Only a few short years ago we were claiming that monopolies were the only way forward in telecommunications, postal services, energy, transport, broadcasting and, until very recently, voluntary health insurance.  We put a lot of energy into protecting those monopolies from the real world of competition and we would probably still be doing so if the EU had not stepped in and liberalised the European marketplace.</P>
    <P>I was in Paris yesterday and listened to Peter Sutherland address a large gathering.  He did a marvellous job representing Ireland.  He made the point that the reason the EU has had to move in to break up monopolies and put in competition is that not only Ireland but most states try and protect their own.</P>
    <P>Even today, our new found zeal to deregulate key sectors and dismantle all those monopolies we had in the past has a very tentative feel to it.  We go forward at a snail's pace, so much so that I often think the patron saint of deregulation should be St. Augustine.  Let us put the words in his mouth: &ldquo;Oh Lord, make me competitive &mdash; but not just yet&rdquo;. That is the way we tend to act in Ireland.  When we do deregulate, it is often to put a duopoly in place instead of a monopoly.  We have at last awarded <Col N="1393" /> a second mobile telephone licence but let us not kid ourselves.  We are a long way from turning that market into a genuinely open marketplace.</P>
    <P>Another way in which our culture is anti-competitive is shown in the way people often succeed in using the rhetoric of competition to actually restrict the amount of competition they have to face.  Let me make it clear that I believe nobody should be allowed to abuse a dominant market position.  We should be alert against this and crack down on it at every opportunity.  Equally, we should be vigilant against being misled by those who want to resist all change by pleading that they are being competed against unfairly.  Unfortunately, in this day and age some people still believe that the marketplace owes them a living simply because they have been in that marketplace on their own up to now.  Some people even think that the marketplace should always owe them a living even if they fail to perform.  When we give in to this sort of thing, we act against the interests of the customer which should always be paramount.</P>
    <P>As Senator Fahey said, the State is not absolved from all blame.  A short few years ago Aer Lingus and British Airways had a monopoly on the Dublin/London route and argued very strongly that there should be no more competition because it would endanger jobs.  Thankfully, a colleague of the Minister's created competition.  The outcome is that more people than ever are travelling on the Dublin/London route at a much lower price and the number of people employed is much greater. That came about from competition, not protection.  Senator Farrelly mentioned the possibility of another terminal in Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>We must find a way to encourage and create competition because everybody benefits.  The customer is rarely served by attempts to freeze the marketplace. The true marketplace is inherently dynamic and changes in response to customers' changing needs.  It is against this background that we should approach competition legislation, that is, with a <Col N="1394" /> clear view that the customer's interest is what should dominate our thinking and a sober realisation that our history in this area has not been very good.  Our culture has not been particularly supportive of open markets and free competition.</P>
    <P>How did the Principal Act, which this Bill proposes to amend, deal with this challenge?  It was far from ideal.  If I ask how much it has benefited the customer, I am not sure there is much evidence that it has at all.  What it certainly has done is put yet another straw on the long suffering camel's back.  It has increased the cost of doing business by putting in place another bureaucratic hoop through which companies must jump.  It has provided them with yet another distraction from their fundamental task of competing for the customer's business by meeting the customer's needs.  There is no greater indictment of the approach enshrined in the Principal Act than the massive backlog of licence applications that has built up as a result.  The broad way in which the Act is drafted means that one must apply for a licence for virtually any activity.  It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>The Act's strategy was to declare illegal practically everything and let companies apply for a licence exempting them from it.  The sheer number of applications for licences &mdash; the last figure I saw was in the region of 1,300 &mdash; should surely show us how far from practical reality were the drafters of the Act.  My purpose in mentioning this is merely to point out that the legislation on which we seek to build is not perfect.  We are amending an Act that has not yet proved itself in the central key task of promoting the customer's interest and which, despite that, has had a high price tag attached to it which ultimately the customer has to pay.</P>
    <P>The central thrust of the amending Bill is to criminalise certain practices which are prohibited by the Principal Act.  Up to now only a civil action could be taken against an offender.  The Minister has explained this very well today. The idea is to create criminal offences <Col N="1395" /> out of anti-competitive activities.  I want to make it clear that I have no problem whatsoever with the principle; in fact, I am in favour of it.  In anti-competitive activity the injured party is usually the customer and customers are often understandably slow to take on big companies. This is not like liability cases where lawyers are prepared to act on a no foal, no fee basis.</P>
    <P>It makes sense that the State, on behalf of the customer, should have the power as the Minister is proposing to prosecute anti-competitive activity and not leave it to the civil courts.  However, this Bill makes a horse's collar of doing just that.  It puts us into a perfect catch 22 situation.  Either there will be no successful prosecutions, in which case it can hardly be claimed as a deterrent to anti-competitive activity, or there will be successful prosecutions and they may well be totally unjust.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting the intensity of the objections to this Bill from the legal profession. Senators will be aware that the Bill has been exhaustively discussed since it was first introduced in quite a different form almost two years ago.  A whole issue of <i>Competition</i> magazine has been devoted to this topic and in April a high powered seminar of legal luminaries turned their attention to it. Of course, there has also been a lengthy debate in the other House.</P>
    <P>Everybody is terrified, and rightly so, of the vagueness of what has been criminalised. Instead of defining precisely what offences are to be punished, this Bill in effect leaves it up to the courts to decide what constitutes an offence. More precisely it leaves it up to a jury to decide what constitutes anti-competitive activity.  For the first time in our legal history, therefore, this Bill is attempting to establish the notion that a jury should rule on a matter of opinion rather than on fact.  That is a momentous change and not one that should be taken without full knowledge of the consequences. In my opinion, it is not a step that we should take.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> If, God forbid, I should lose the run of myself after the outcome of this debate, or maybe the Order of Business tomorrow, and take out a gun and shoot the Leader of the House, Senator Manning, the legal position would be very clear.  What constitutes murder is precisely defined by law.  A jury would have to rule on the facts, such as whether I did it and whether I was insane at the time.  These are facts in the ordinary sense of the word.  If we pass this Bill we will be asking juries to interpret facts in an area which is notoriously difficult to interpret.  The jury would be asked not whether I shot Senator Manning but whether some actions I took in the past might at some indeterminate time in the future be likely to be held as against the customer's interest.</P>
    <P>Fairly late in the day, the Minister realised the folly of putting such a burden on any jury.  However, his cure is worse than the disease.  It is to allow the evidence of expert witnesses.  Expert witnesses can be useful in matters such as ballistics to decide whether I shot somebody or to decide the sanity of an accused but in this case we are talking about economists.  I hope I do not upset the Minister by referring to economists; I know his background as an economist is very strong.  We should not be happy with the notion of economists in effect deciding whether people are to go to jail.  We all enjoy reading what they to say in the newspapers but I do not think many of us regard their utterances as infallible.</P>
    <P>This is the murky road down which this legislation is leading us.  It abdicates from the task of defining the offences precisely and opts to let the courts decide and make the law.  It is no wonder lawyers are objecting.  They know it is not the proper function of the courts. They know that so well that they turn their back on what would certainly be a lucrative playground for barristers. Where would this abdication to the courts leave the world of business?  It would leave it with a deep sense of uncertainty.  How can one keep the law if the law will not say what it is, but it <Col N="1397" /> will be decided when we get people into court.  What kind of arrangement is that in a country which claims to be in favour of business?</P>
    <P>Not only does the Bill seek to make criminals out of business people without telling them what constitutes wrong, but it also seeks to make criminals out of people who had nothing to do with it. At a stroke the Bill would extend greatly the liability of company directors and executives who would be presumed to be personally guilty and liable, irrespective of whether they knew about a practice of which the company was convicted.  What happened to the presumption that one is innocent until proven guilty?  The Minister enshrines the other principle.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P> Where it is proved that activity, unlawful under this Bill was carried out by an undertaking it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved that each director, manager or other similar officer authorised or consented to that activity.  These provisions are being inserted to make directors, etc., responsible for their activities.</P>
    <P>The onus of proving one's innocence is on the accused.</P>
    <P>The Bill puts yet another burden on companies, increasing their costs and distracting them from their true mission. It greatly increases the personal liability of people working in business, defining a radically new concept of guilt just for them.  It creates the serious doubt that any successful prosecutions could be brought under this legislation thereby removing any deterrent effect it might have and bringing the whole cause of promoting competition into disrepute.  It creates worrying new precedents in our criminal justice system which have clearly not been thought out fully.</P>
    <P>What are the benefits in return?  At the end of the day, will the customer be any better off?  I doubt it.  Will Ireland have become genuinely a more competitive place?  I doubt that even more.  We are being asked to pay a high price without receiving the corresponding benefit. <Col N="1398" /> That seems utter madness to me.  We need competition legislation which promotes and protects the interests of the customer but this Bill is not it.  I cannot support it and I urge my colleagues not to do so either.  I believe this Bill is flawed.  I know the Minister has put a great deal of work into it but he should go back to the Principal Act and start from scratch.  I find it impossible to support the Bill as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody would accept that commercial law and competition legislation are difficult areas.  This can be seen from the fact that the Bill has taken a long time to go through the Dáil.  It was introduced in 1994 before the change in Government and it has only now come to the Seanad.  On Committee Stage in the Dáil there was a great deal of debate on the issues raised by Senator Quinn and others.  I understand that people have different viewpoints on this issue.  Nevertheless, the OECD, NESC, <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the Culliton report argued there is a need for changes in our current legislation.</P>
      <P>The nettle must be grasped particulary given that we are a small open economy, must grow rapidly and are heavily dependent on exports.  We need effective competition legislation which deals with the current problems facing firms trying to exist in such a competitive market.  Difficulties increase every day as a result of preparing for economic and monetary union, worldwide trade extending and developing all the time into new areas and countries and competition emerging from these areas and countries.  Because we have a small population and are on the edge of Europe, we must depend on competitiveness not just at home but on a worldwide market.  We must adapt to change.  I would not presume to have the historical knowledge of Senator Lee but we moved from being a protective to an open economy and this was necessary as time progressed.  We could not have continued protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> This Bill faces the issues which must be faced.  It is somewhat changed from the legislation which was introduced in 1994.  The first main component of the 1994 Bill has been continued and strengthened in this one.  The main intention of the previous Bill was to change the system whereby it was up to private individuals and firms to take cases where they felt there were anti-competitive problems.  In this Bill the Competition Authority will have the power to make regulations and take action.  Firms will not be dependent on being able to afford to take action themselves. In the past few cases were successfully taken because it is difficult for a private firm, particularly a small one, to take such actions.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the vast majority of firms in this country are small and medium enterprises and we must protect them.  We must achieve a balance between adequate protection and allowing firms to grow and compete. I understand why the Minister has referred the second main component of the original legislation, dealing with mergers, to an expert committee, the competition and mergers review group. This issue was difficult to deal with because a balance is necessary between, on the one hand, allowing small firms to merge, grow and develop and giving them the kind of freedom where they do not have to refer to different pieces of legislation rather than one Act and, on the other hand, the need for proper control of competition.  I would like to know what is the timescale of the review group and when the Minister hopes to be able to deal with the issue because it will have to be dealt with sooner or later.  I accept that at this stage the Minister felt the need to acquire more expertise in this area.</P>
    <P>This Bill must be effective.  I do not have any great expertise in the area of company and competition law.  The Competition Authority is being given wideranging enforcement powers, staffing and finance.  It is correct that an independent body like it, rather than <Col N="1400" /> the Minister, should be involved in day to day enforcement.  It will have expertise in the people appointed to it.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with three areas &mdash; certifying, licensing and enforcing.  It is important that a director of competition enforcement has been given the separate function of enforcement because this is a separate issue.  What will be the director's relationship with the rest of the Authority.  Will he or she have an equal role with the other members of the Authority with regard to certifying and licensing?  There were licensing difficulties in the past.  A court case was taken with regard to petrol companies. Those who operated individual garages under the umbrella of petrol companies had difficulty establishing how they could operate competitively and what their relationship was with their parent companies.  I would like the Minister to elaborate on how the Competition Authority will operate with regard to individual firms who operate under franchises from larger companies.  I am not sure how these companies are covered in the Bill and I would welcome further information on this.</P>
    <P>On the question of mergers, it would be difficult for small firms to have full knowledge and power with regard to what they seek to achieve.  Senator Quinn referred to the part of the Minister's speech dealing with criminal offences and case law.  Obviously he has more day to day expertise in this area but I understood from what the Minister said that specific offences are listed in section 5.  However, I take the point that they are not limiting and that others might be developed under case law. That would be the case under US competition law which also has a criminal element in it.  It was through case law that specific offences were built up in the American system.  Competition law operates relatively well in the US, although I do not know if the situation is exactly the same here.  The area of criminal offences under competition law is new to us.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, in criminal law one is dealing with a higher level of <Col N="1401" /> proof than in civil law.  Therefore, there will have to be clear proof that the person involved knew they were committing an offence, as opposed to the civil law where a lower level of proof applies.</P>
    <P>We need to strike a balance between the right of companies to grow and the danger of dominance in the market.  We are all aware of the dangers where companies take over smaller ones thus achieving a dominant position.  That is not good for the customer who is, in effect, at the mercy of the larger company and who may have had more choice when a number of smaller companies were operating.  The legislation must get the balance right by ensuring that no one company achieves a dominant position.</P>
    <P>We are in an era where competitiveness is the order of the day.  In terms of services &mdash; and airlines are good examples &mdash; competitiveness has been good for the customer but there is also a need for social protection.  In the health care area, for example, weaker members of society must be protected even though they may not be a great proposition from the point of view of those delivering the service.  That is particularly true in health care where a person may have great needs but not great buying power.  In those and in other areas, we have to protect the customer in a way that does not provide for total free market competitiveness.  One must balance protection with competition.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the rest of this debate.  It is breaking new ground and inevitably differences of opinion will arise.  There is a need to amend the legislation and to provide for clear rules that are properly enforced.  In that way firms will have freedom to compete with each other both here and abroad in a way that will provide for stronger firms and more job opportunities here.  In that regard, the legislation should ensure that those who compete do so on an equal basis, having the opportunity to develop and build more jobs for our people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Competition is desirable in any business because it drives trade. No one was satisfied with the monopoly that existed in the public services, whether in the airline industry, postal services or telecommunications.  The public has not been well served in these areas due to the lack of competition.</P>
      <P>The greatest revolution has taken place in the airline industry.  When Ryanair set up in competition on European and cross channel routes, not alone was it good for Aer Lingus but it was very good for the Irish travelling public as well as for visitors.  Competition brought only a sense of reality to Aer Lingus, but I do not think there is a full sense of reality in that company yet.  This has been seen in the controversy over the seating of Delta staff members on particular planes.  This arose after protracted negotiations to try to get Delta Airlines on board with Aer Lingus which has to have major financial benefits because of Delta's operations throughout America.  In addition, it enables Aer Lingus' transatlantic passengers to reach internal US destinations which are not currently serviced by Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Competition has been beneficial to the State and to Aer'Lingus' staff, but it has also proven to be a bonus for Aer Rianta and for the travelling public.  We have had a serious lack of competition in public services.  Unless and until competition is introduced into these areas there is no point introducing this type of Bill which will not be of major help in these areas.  I am not too sure what has happened since 1994.  The only public acknowledgment was the use of the Competition and Mergers Bill when the Irish Press Group got into trouble.  It was suggested that further involvement of capital by Mr. Tony O'Reilly or the Independent Group would be bad for newspaper consumers.  I am not too sure how true this would have been but because of the Minister's intervention under the legislation the Irish Press Group failed to obtain Irish capital which was on offer and which could have saved the group.  There is a definite <Col N="1403" /> correlation between the Minister's legislation and the demise of the Irish Press Group.  Obviously, that was not good in terms of the competition and mergers situation.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the criminalisation of people in industry.  It is tough enough to be in any business at present without being turned into a criminal because of evidence that might come to light.  I am not too sure if the committee being set up under the Bill would have the legal and commercial expertise to beat the big boys in industry at international level.  I have a funny feeling that if they employ people with international expertise, the amount of money the Minister is talking about giving to this Bill would have to be doubled, trebled or quadrupled.  I have no doubt that in the end they would not be able to beat the financial and legal expertise in international company law that could be brought forward by someone involved in a case of the type mentioned in the competition area.</P>
    <P>I am not too sure what the issuing of category certificates means.  Does it mean that anybody who wants to purchase another business would have to go through a formula to get a certificate to say they could go through with talks? How far would negotiations have to go before a certificate would be issued?  We are reaching a stage where a person who becomes a company director must be a fool or a knave.  Under company law a company director could be struck off, thrown in jail or fined.  It is difficult to get outside people to join State or semi-State companies because of restrictions placed on those appointed as directors of companies.</P>
    <P>There were areas where a lack of competition was necessary, particularly in the technical area where people serviced equipment.  People had sole agreements with the manufacturers of the equipment which gave them a monopoly. I am not sure if, under EU regulations, such monopolies were broken or if the customer has benefited; perhaps the lack of sole agreements has not <Col N="1404" /> helped in the repair or maintenance of equipment.</P>
    <P>As regards the director of competition enforcement, where will we get somebody of such calibre to do that job unless we pay them a commensurate sum to what they would get if they worked for a multinational or a large Irish trading company in a competitive world?  Perhaps there is a person who wants to give their expertise.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not make a difference to 99.9 per cent of the people.  We have an open economy and there will be mergers in the future.  Competition will be eliminated as it has been to a large degree in the grocery and allied trades. The customer is getting good value from the small number of major stores.  Having said that, there is no real competition between the major stores who share 14, 21 and 9.5 per cent of the market. I am not sure of Musgraves' share, but it is catching up with Supervalu and Value Centres.  While there is a choice, it is really only between the four main stores.  Suppliers must supply the four main chains or they are not in the game. Competition means many things to many people.</P>
    <P>What we really need is competition where the customer gets the best value at the best price.  I would like to see comparison shopping done by independent people, especially in the non-food area.  Sometimes the cheapest item on the shelf might work out to be the dearest item in the long term.  As I said, this Bill will not make that much difference to 99.9 per cent of the people.  I have no great worries one way or the other but we should consider this matter a lot more before we pass this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by associating myself with an observation made by Senator Lanigan about the Aer Lingus-Delta arrangement.  At this delicate time, I join with him in saying I hope common sense will prevail and that the obvious long-term benefits will be seen to outweigh any perceived short-term disadvantages.  This is serious legislation and I do not agree with Senator Lanigan <Col N="1405" /> that it will not affect 99.9 per cent of the people.  The Minister gave a lengthy Second Stage speech from which he departed on a number of occasions to clarify parts of the Bill.  Nonetheless, it has implications which we must seriously address.</P>
      <P>In that context, a number of points made by Senator Quinn deserve to be fully considered as should the implications which might arise from them. However, I do not agree with him that this legislation should be thrown out. Nevertheless, I share some of his concerns and, strangely enough, some of what I have to say will echo a number of the reservations he expressed.</P>
      <P>I recall the passage of the 1991 Competition Act as I contributed to the debate.  It is important to recall that the emphasis and discussion at the time was that we were obliged to bring in the legislation to give effect to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  We should remember that was the motivating force at the time and everything else was incidental.  The Competition Authority was set up as a result of the 1991 Act and it has been successful in certain aspects of its dealings with the public. However, obviously gaps emerged in its capacity to deal with situations which were unacceptable from a consumer view point.  Since the coming into effect of the 1991 Act we have had an opportunity to consider what improvements are needed and what disadvantages should be removed.  This Bill attempts to improve and develop the 1991 Act.</P>
      <P>I would like to return to some of Senator Quinn's points.  I do not agree the Bill should be thrown out; I could not do so from where I stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>He spoke about the encouragement of competition and the situation in Telecom Éireann and Aer Lingus.  The encouragement of competition to the advantage of the consumer is the Minister's objective.  In pursuit of that objective, we must be careful that <Col N="1406" /> we do not build into the legislation anything which may cause serious concern later.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn said the Competition Authority would be an added layer of bureaucracy and that its effect would be to increase costs to business.  This may be the case.  He also indicated that its key task was the protection of consumer interests and that the Principal Act had failed to deliver on that.  It has partially failed and I hope to give examples of this later.</P>
      <P>The Senator was concerned about unjust convictions.  I want to deal with that issue on Committee Stage because I am concerned with such aspects, as the evidence of the so-called experts, how we will define them and their role and function.  We must also recognise that the Bill excludes these experts from expressing an opinion of guilt or innocence. Why then are we bringing them in?  We must first define their capacity and ability, but we already do that in a satisfactory way.  Why do we then say that their opinions on guilt or innocence must be discounted?</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn also expressed his concern about leaving it to a jury to decide on the offences.  We must discuss this matter in greater detail on Committee Stage.  Section 2 purports to define the offences.  It is as long a section as I have seen in any legislation since I came to this House; it runs to four pages.  We must get down to the nitty gritty of that section if we are to do our duty as a responsible House.</P>
      <P>I would like a better explanation why mergers have been removed from the scope of this legislation.  It has been referred to a review group, which is expected to report in due course and undoubtedly legislation will follow from that.  However, there is no adequate explanation for this in the Minister's speech.  I have no problem with subjecting the abuse of a monopoly or dominant position in the marketplace to criminal law provided we ensure the system is adequate to protect the interests of those concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> I accept that the broad competition environment about which the Minister spoke is necessary and desirable.  On the issuing of licences and certificates, Senator Quinn said there was a backlog of 1,300 applications.  It was necessary to put in that requirement.  However, I am aware of only one case of a decision by the Competition Authority being challenged before the High Court and that has not yet been heard.</P>
    <P>I support giving power to the Competition Authority to enforce competitive practice on behalf of the consumer. While the principle is all right, I am concerned about the methods which would be employed under the Bill.  Up to now the restriction on the Authority to act when there was an abuse of a dominant position was restricted by the direction of the Minister; I spoke against that aspect of the 1991 legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the additional resources being given to the Authority because it has been seriously understaffed.  We will have to define the role of the director of competition enforcement on Committee Stage.  Senator Lanigan was concerned about the calibre of the person appointed to that position and, to get the type of individual who would act effectively in this job, he wanted to pay them a very attractive salary.  I would be more concerned to have the role of the director more clearly defined and we can do that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Will the person who occupies the role of director of competition enforcement be additional to the present membership of the Competition Authority?  Is it proposed to increase its membership? These questions are interlinked but are not the same.  With the workload that may arise under this legislation, this may well be a necessary course to adopt.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority has been engaged in issuing licences and certificates. Will that function continue or is it proposed that it will be refined, redefined or altered in any way?  If it is, I would like to hear the Minister's reply.</P>
    <P>I said a number of times that I very much regard this as a Committee Stage <Col N="1408" /> Bill.  We must go through all of section 2 in great detail and be satisfied as to what extent we can define the parameters of the offences rather than leaving it to a jury or court.  The £3 million fine or 10 per cent of turnover on indictment are substantial and will act as a deterrent.  However, we must deal with enforcement.</P>
    <P>The Minister attempted to define all the offences in one page of his speech but they run to four pages in section 2. If a section is four pages long, many aspects will require elaboration and the Minister's one page explanation was not adequate.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of the burden of proof and, to a degree, Senator Quinn referred to that.  Of course, one could always take the view that only experience will show to what extent the legislation was adequate.  The House is obliged to define what is meant by experts.  Who are these people and what practical or academic qualifications will they require before they can be accepted as experts?  If the practical, business and academic qualifications required to be an expert are established, the legislation then denies them the right to express a view as to guilt or innocence.  This is difficult to understand in terms of the purpose of the legislation and I intend to raise this matter on Committee Stage.  If an expert is produced in a court case but they are denied an opportunity to give an opinion as to whether guilt or innocence is involved, why are they in court?  This is my problem with this provision.</P>
    <P>In relation to the presumption of guilt of every director, manager or similar officer, how far down the line does it go?  What does the term &ldquo;similar officer&rdquo; mean?  The position is clear regarding a director and a manager, but there is a presumption of guilt in every case until proven otherwise.  This is a sweeping measure.  The legal profession has expressed various opinions on this legislation but has anybody given a view on whether the presumption of guilt until proven otherwise provision is constitutional? <Col N="1409" /> I look forward to the opportunity to discuss the Bill in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for the high quality of the debate, which was informed by good commercial experience in some cases.  I listened with interest to the contributions.  The Bill received an extensive airing in the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy and it was also debated on Report Stage in the other House recently.  Changes suggested during those discussions have been taken on board and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, who will take Committee Stage in the House, will listen carefully to Senators' points.  I hope a better Bill will emerge as a result of the lengthy discussions.</P>
      <P>The Bill arises from the commitment in the Programme for Government to strengthen the Competition Authority. The Bill's main feature is that it will address the lacuna which existed that only private individuals could take a competition case.  The legislation provides that the Competition Authority can act in the public interest.  This is an important safeguard because it is often difficult for small businesses, which may be particularly squeezed by competition, to take a case.  It is also difficult for people to take cases against suppliers given that the cost of legal action in this country can be prohibitive; it can even be prohibitive for Governments.</P>
      <P>It is important to establish an independent body backed by an expert staff. On the enactment of the Bill it is intended to increase the staff of the Competition Authority by 50 per cent, including appropriate legal expertise, economists and clerical back up.  The appointment of the director of competition enforcement is also important and the Minister is considering the reconstitution of the Competition Authority on the completion of this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to mergers and competition and how the two are balanced. <Col N="1410" /> In this regard I am reminded of screaming Lord Sutch's policy which asks why there is only one monopolies commission.  There is a tension in providing for increased competition, which is in consumers' interest because it helps Irish companies to compete internationally if there is competition in the domestic market, but there is also the issue of securing companies of sufficient scale, such as those in the food industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn, who is familiar with this area, recommended more mergers of major food co-ops so they can acquire a sufficient scale to engage in the research and development of new products, such as new yoghurts and desserts, to line supermarket shelves and compete with food multinationals. There is an underlying tension between the need for greater competition in the interest of jobs and the need to ensure Irish companies can be of sufficient scale.  The two areas are being separated for this reason.</P>
    <P>On completion of the Bill it is intended that a mergers study group will be established and it is expected &mdash; Senator O'Sullivan raised this point &mdash; that it will take between a year and 18 months to tease out its work.  It is important to ensure a competitive climate, but also that the development of business on a sufficient scale is not prejudiced.  This relates to businesses which are competing in world markets in what economists call contestable markets; there can be competition even if there is only a single supplier in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey raised the difficulty of proving cases.  Following the changes made by the Bill, case law will build up over time as the matter evolves. Regarding the additional resources for the Authority, it is important that expert witnesses can be called.  Senator Howard asked about expert witnesses and their qualifications.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the courts to accept if a person's expertise is valid under the provisions of the Bill.  This applies to expert witnesses in many other areas, such as medical and legal expert witnesses and people who testify in personal injuries <Col N="1411" /> cases regarding the future employment prospects of an individual following an accident in the context of the person's previous employment.  The courts are well accustomed to dealing with expert witnesses and sifting through differing testimony.  This aspect can safely be left to the courts.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey asked if the loophole in section 3 &mdash; this relates to the so-called escape clause and somebody saying they acted in good faith and did not act in order to oppose competition &mdash; was too big.  A person who presents this type of defence will be subject to the usual cross-examination in court; such a defence must stand up.  The measure was included on the basis of legal advice to ensure the constitutionality of the offences and penalties provision.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard asked about the constitutionality of the Bill.  All Bills prepared by the draftsman in the Office of the Attorney General go to the legal advice section of the office and do not emerge until they have been stamped as meeting, in the opinion of the Attorney General and his advice staff, the test of constitutionality.  Ultimately, it is for the Supreme Court to decide if a measure is unconstitutional and the Government is always in its hands.  However, no legislation ever appears before the House unless it is based on the best advice available to the Attorney General that it is constitutional.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn asked about the resources to address the shortcomings of the 1991 Act and I covered this point. Legal advice was obtained in relation to points raised in the other House and the Department is satisfied that the Bill's provisions are watertight.  The Senator also raised the vagueness of offences. The intention is that the legislation is clear.  The courts will be the final arbiters and they will make judgements based on the views of the Oireachtas as expressed in the written text and as case law builds.  Directors will be able to prove their innocence and the Bill provides for this.</P>

      <P>We are satisfied of the constitutionality of the provisions.  It will be possible for a bona fide person to satisfy the courts.  Our courts have been exemplary in their interpretation of the law and somebody who is bona fide will have no difficulty satisfying the courts. Senator O'Sullivan raised the question of franchising.  It will come down to each individual case because there are different set-ups in relation to MacDonalds, etc., but the provisions of the Bill apply to all types of company whether they are franchised or not.  No distinction is drawn in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan asked about a category certificate.  A category certificate is simply a set of rules within which activities can take place without breaching competition law.  He also raised a point in relation to the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I would contest very strongly the view that it was the Competition Authority or actions on foot of its recommendations by the Minister which led to the demise of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  We have to look back at how that company was run and the unwillingness of investors to move into the company given that the original directors held a lien on the titles.  I am glad to see we have competition again in the Dublin evening paper market. Competition in the media is particularly important not only as it effects normal consumer competition but also in relation to what kind of tins of beans do you buy but it is particularly important in relation to freedom of expression and the openness of the public to different ideas.  I welcome the re-emergence of competition in the newspaper market; long may it continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will strengthen lacunae that existed in the 1991 Bill.  It will ensure a strengthened Competition Authority in terms of staff and resources, expertise, a dedicated competition enforcement officer.  I hope that as a result of this Bill we can continue to see increasing economic competitiveness.  We can ensure <Col N="1413" /> competitiveness extends not only to the open sector of the economy where there is natural competition on open markets but that we have competition in the more sheltered section of the economy where domestic businesses are simply competing with each other.  The cost of the sheltered sector of the economy are the inputs into the open sector of the economy.  The open sector of the economy is a taker of world prices and if its costs are artificially inflated because on the domestic market we have an absence of competition then our competitiveness in our very important export markets is being undercut.  This is important not only for consumer confidence but also for the performance of this economy.  We have enjoyed an unprecedented economic boom over the last couple of years which has been export led and led by improvements in our competitiveness, but we need to ensure that our legislative structure and our administrative systems encourage and reinforce that competitiveness and <Col N="1414" /> that we have legislation which is adequate to that task.  This Bill marks an important step forward in that respect.</P>
    <P>The contributions to this debate have been very detailed.  This was a Second Stage debate that was, to some extent, like a Committee Stage debate.  On Committee Stage these points will be teased out in further detail.  I look forward to enhanced legislation being enacted which will improve the situation in this area.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P> That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for the Marine to outline his proposals to protect the Irish Sea Fishing and Processing Industry from the massive cutbacks being proposed by the European Union Commissioner which will result in the national fleet being halved; curbs and limits the number of days fishermen will be allowed to fish; involves the decommissioning and destruction of fishing vessels; if he will indicate the financial and job losses which will result from the Commissioner's proposals; and the action he will take to prevent the plan being implemented.</P>
      <P>My party tabled this motion to discover the Minister's views and see if a consensus might be achieved on the future of the fishing industry in view of recent statements from the EU about further cutbacks.  I am not attaching blame to the Minister or anyone else for the position which currently exists in the fishing industry.  I wish to refer to a number of facts which the Minister will probably outline later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> Approximately 15,000 people are employed in the fishing industry.  Since 1975, the value of fish landings has risen from £15 million to approximately £300 million.  The fishing industry is vital to coastal regions and the west because in the past many small towns and villages suffered greatly because of emigration and fishing was the sole source of employment.  In this regard, I refer not only to the west, but to all coastal regions.</P>
    <P>Ireland is now the only island state in the EU and should receive special concessions. Ireland's territorial waters represent approximately 16 per cent of the waters of the EU.  I cannot say the figures I am quoting are accurate, but they are given out from time to time.  The total catch from Irish waters by all countries of the EU is in the region of £2 billion per year.  This approximate figure was quoted to me and I have no evidence to support it.  The Irish fishing fleet is restricted to about 4 per cent of the catch quota in Irish waters.  At the outset I stated that 16,000 people are employed in the fishing industry, onshore and in boats.  If the Irish fishing fleet had access to 16 per cent of our catch quota, up to 40,000 people would be employed in that industry.  That represents a very relevant amount of extra employment in a time when everyone is trying to reduce unemployment.</P>
    <P>Many small towns and villages &mdash; Moville, Killybegs, Rossaveal, Dingle, Castletownbere, Union Hall, Dunmore East, Kilmore, Skerries, Howth, etc. &mdash; are hugely dependent on fishing.  In most cases there is no alternative employment.  Fishing is the main source of employment in many of these towns. I may be wrong but I understand that there are approximately 2,000 people employed in the fishing industry in Killybegs.  In Dingle, the town in which I live, I estimate that there are 600 people employed in that industry.  Most of these people are the main breadwinners in their families and many of them would not have availed of a third or second level education.  Like their fathers and <Col N="1417" /> grandfathers, the only life they know is that of the sea and fishing.</P>
    <P>As I already stated, these towns and villages have no alternative source of employment.  It is not acceptable to have yet another restriction forced on us which would reduce our fleet by up to 40 per cent and impose stricter quotas. The Common Fisheries Policy was supposed to provide equal access to a common resource.  This has not happened in Ireland's case.  We are discussing sharing our waters and fish with other countries in the European Union and it is completely out of order to place further quotas and restrictions on coastal communities with a huge dependency on fishing.  If the present proposal succeeds, the fishing towns and villages on Irish coasts will be wiped out.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that Ireland received a bad deal under the Common Fisheries Policy.  I will not state who was at fault, but it is generally accepted that the Common Fisheries Policy was a bad deal for Ireland.  I stated on many occasions at meetings of my parliamentary party that agriculture gained from the fishing industry's loss.  I may be wrong, but I always believed agriculture gained.  I wish farmers, those involved in agriculture and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the very best in trying to obtain compensation for the beef industry.</P>
    <P>I ask that the Minister for the Marine make a major effort to obtain compensation for the fishing industry.  The Minister is very genuine in all that he is attempting to do for the fishing industry but it is time he called a halt.  There must be no further negotiations to reduce the Irish fishing fleet or its quotas.  However, the Minister must demand a renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy to ensure that Ireland receives a larger quota to safeguard its fishing fleet, the people living in coastal communities and the entire economy.</P>
    <P>Why should we accept cutbacks when we are aware that 20 per cent of foreign boats boarded while fishing in Irish waters are fishing illegally?  This is common knowledge to the Department of the <Col N="1418" /> Marine which receives information in this regard from the Department of Defence, the Naval Service and the Air Corps.  The fishing boats involved have secret holds and, when boarded, everything seems in order.  The species of fish found in these holds are not supposed to be caught because of the overfishing ban on certain stocks.  Many of these boats are new and were built with the help of EU funding in boatyards in countries such as Spain.  I believe those secret holds were built with the knowledge of inspectors from the fishery departments in those countries, particularly Spain.  If that is so, fishermen from Spain and other countries are being aided and abetted by their fisheries inspectors to deliberately break the law.</P>
    <P>Our backs are to the wall and we are being asked to endure further cuts.  I am a very reasonable and fair person but I have said to my party and that of the Minister that such cutbacks are not on. I did not ask the Minister to come to the House to accuse him of anything. However, if I have to ask him to come to the House in a year's time because he has failed to renegotiate, I will accuse him then.  I have said to him openly and fairly it is time to say stop.  We can no longer sustain cutbacks in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>We must go to the negotiating table with a good case.  We have a great case but we do not have the research and scientific knowledge to substantially back it up.  We are dependent on one small boat, the <i>Lough Beltra</i>, to conduct our research for us, which is almost an impossibility.  Our inshore fleets of smaller boats are also suffering because of the gross illegal fishing of stocks in outside waters which means the fish cannot spawn.  Everybody is suffering.</P>
    <P>They are our waters, although they are a common EU resource.  We joined the EEC with open arms but we have to be fair with it and it has to be fair with us.  The Minister has the full support of Fianna Fáil to call a halt now, to renegotiate and say we are not taking any more cuts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my pleasure to second the motion.  In 1984, as Senator Fitzgerald knows, I had the privilege of preparing the first draft of my party's policy document on the marine.  When I was researching that area I was fascinated to learn we had never focused on the benefits of our island status and the fact we possessed territorial waters which extended far beyond our land resource.  Central to that document was the creation of the Department of the Marine.  The contention at that time was that the Department would be a developmental agency aimed at exploiting Ireland's last, great, unexploited natural resource &mdash; the marine environment and the fish and minerals in the sea.</P>
      <P>Sadly, 12 years later, we still have not made the kind of impact we should have.  Our territorial and coastal waters far exceed our land bank.  Yet, perversely, we cannot at this stage exclusively, or even predominantly, exploit that resource for the benefit of the people of this island.  As Senator Fitzgerald said, because we have embraced the Common Fisheries Policy and membership of the EU we share that resource.  The tragedy, however, is that our partners in the EU have exploited a historic weakness in a policy area, which should be of considerable importance to the Irish people, and we have an unequal share in that resource.  While one accepts the idea of sharing the resource, it is difficult &mdash; and, I believe, impossible &mdash; to accept we should surrender outright the right to utilise the advantages of our island nation status.</P>
      <P>If Ireland goes along with the latest fishery proposals we will be abdicating our rights to develop an area of tremendous job creation and developmental potential.  The EU Commission proposals put forward last month call for cuts of up to 40 per cent in the fishing fleet.  There are, as the Minister and other Members know, slight variations on that on the basis of species, with cuts of up to 50 per cent in some species. Countries which do not meet the fleet reduction targets proposed by the Commission will be heavily fined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> The Commission has put forward these proposals in order to avoid what Commissioner Bonino calls the biological collapse of the fish stock in European waters.  In common with every Member of the House, I am most anxious to prohibit or prevent an environmental disaster and the collapse of the biological stock which is the patrimony of the people of Europe, particularly that which is the possession or asset of the people of this island nation. If we face biological collapse, as all the scientific evidence suggests is the case, we do so because of industrial fishing practices developed by major continental fishing nations which they have used irresponsibly over the years.</P>
    <P>The scientific arguments and the EU policy proposals can be faulted in a number of ways.  The most serious is that while they focus on the preservation of fixed fish stocks and the scientific evidence, they give very little consideration to the social, economic and depopulation impact on small coastal communities involved in the fishing industry, particularly those in this country. These proposals are a response to industrial fishing practices rather than to the kind of fishing practices engaged in by this country.</P>
    <P>Arklow, for example, is a small port with a tiny fleet but it gives valuable employment to a small number of people and supports employment onshore.  As a result of historic short-sightedness and past constraints, and because Governments and State agencies have been, if anything, prejudiced against the growth of the Arklow fleet, it has never really developed.  It still has potential but Commissioner Bonino's proposals will do away with any such potential.  The small fleet in Arklow faces stagnation at best; it faces contraction in the short term and absolute annihilation in the long term.  Jobs which were painfully created by people who showed great industry will be destroyed.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals include a scheme of support measures which will cost in the order of £2.5 billion. <Col N="1421" /> These are based on the early retirement and destruction of vessels from the fleet and do not address the loss of potential. There is no compensation for the young men and women whose tradition lies in the fishing industry, as was touched on by Senator Fitzgerald.  There is no way one can compensate the son, daughter, grandson or granddaughter of a fishing family for the closure of the only profession they know.  They face either internal migration to the cities or emigration if the job market abroad opens up.  That is completely opposite to the ethos of other areas of European policy.</P>
    <P>The argument of equity also applies. Why should an Irish fisherman be forced to answer for the sins of other fleets?  The stock problems in European waters have been caused by selfish and irresponsible behaviour by nations with huge industrial fleets and Spain stands particularly indicted in this regard.  The Irish fleet is small, under-capitalised, weather-bound and already restricted as to the amount of time that can be spent on the fishing grounds.  Our fleet is not to blame in any way for the kind of deprivation that has been seen.  The type of small, in-shore fleets which give the bulk of coastal employment would be devastated by the 40 per cent cut in EU fleet tonnage.  Any chance these fishing fleets have of expanding their activities, or small ports of expanding employment, would be gone.</P>
    <P>The upcoming Irish Presidency of the EU should be used to effect.  The Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, recently said the Irish Presidency should set the agenda for the Common Fisheries Policy. I urge the Minister and the Government to set a stern face in this particular matter.  The destruction of whole coastal communities is at stake and we have to resist it.  There has to be some sense of the social destruction that would be wrought if the Commission is allowed go down the path proposed.  I believe the Government will have abundant support from the Opposition side of both Houses if it takes a stern view and sets its face against the Commission's proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have this opportunity to advise the Seanad in detail of my views on the Commission's proposals for cuts in the European fishing fleet which were announced last week.  It is also a timely opportunity to brief this House on the background to the proposals and the negotiating process which will go forward from here, beginning at the Fisheries Council in Luxembourg next Monday.</P>
      <P>Let me begin by setting out my position on these proposals.  Everyone acknowledges that there is a major problem of overfishing in the European Union.  Appropriate measures, on all fronts, must be put in place to tackle the problem at source, to conserve stocks and to ensure a viable economic future for the fishing sector.  The Commission is proposing global cuts of up to 40 per cent over six years in overall EU fleet tonnage.  In so far as the Commission's proposals would apply to Ireland's specific situation they are totally unacceptable.  As they stand, the proposals would, at minimum, deny the Irish industry the ability to avail of its existing fishing opportunities, prevent further modernisation and development from our acknowledged low base and would have devastating impact on the livelihoods of many coastal communities. And the irony is that, given the size, structure and activity of our fishing fleet, the imposition of such drastic cuts on Ireland would not contribute in any significant way to the objective of addressing overall overfishing and overcapacity in EU waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These proposals will have to be negotiated and fought over line by line in the coming months.  I can assure this House, as I have assured the Irish fishing industry, that my overriding objective is to protect the national fishing interest throughout these difficult negotiations and to achieve an outcome which is acceptable and equitable and which takes all the dimensions of the problem into account.  I will return in a few moments to the specific concerns which I have regarding the Commission's proposals <Col N="1423" /> and my objectives for the Irish fleet.  First I would like to review the background to the proposals and the considerations which have produced them.</P>
    <P>There is, as I said at the outset, an acknowledged fundamental crisis in the European fishing sector.  Chronic over-exploitation of fish stocks and considerable excess capacity in the overall EU fishing fleet have long pointed to the need for steps to reduce fishing effort based on the known state of stocks.  It is not uniquely an EU problem.  Too many boats chasing an ever diminishing resource is the pattern worldwide.  In most recent years the high price that will be paid for uncontrolled fishing has been vividly demonstrated in the closure of fisheries in Canada and the huge job losses which followed in coastal communities there.</P>
    <P>The first EU framework of fleet cuts or the so-called Multi Annual Guidance Programmes was agreed in 1983 and was followed by further programmes in 1986 and 1992.  The first two programmes which were modest enough in their aims were not a great success, on the Commission's own admission.  Overcapacity remained and, combined with the effects of considerable technical progress in fishing methods and gears, resulted in continued overfishing.</P>
    <P>The third, and current MAGP, running from 1992 to 1996 is a much more stringent framework, with tougher overall targets geared at delivering cuts of 15 per cent and 20 per cent in demersal and flatfish fleet capacity.  After a hard battle with the Commission, Ireland succeeded in the negotiations on MAGP III in winning specific recognition of the underdeveloped state of its fleet which essentially meant that we have to hold at slightly above the <i>status quo</i> across the various segments of the fleet.  This, of course, is essentially a constraint on capacity.  The last time around, the Commission did finally accept that the particular characteristics of the Irish fleet warranted specific treatment, including facilitating the take up of substantially <Col N="1424" /> under-utilised whitefish quotas off the west and south-west coasts.  The case for renewal and modernisation of the fleet was also acknowledged within the bounds, however, of the national fleet targets set under MAGP III.  Like all member states, Ireland is legally obliged to deliver on those targets by the end of this year. Taking account of the evolution of the various components of the Irish fleet over the lifetime of MAGP III, our current licensing policy and decommissioning strategy aim to meet the national targets by the set date.  The Commission in its new proposals has clearly flagged that progress made in relation to meeting the current targets will be taken into account in the negotiations on the new targets.</P>
    <P>The Commission's own analysis is that while under the current round of MAGP there appears to be the beginning of a real decrease in the overcapacity generally of the European fleet, over 200,000 tonnes have been removed overall according to the Commission's own monitoring of available data.  However, the Commission concludes that continued over-exploitation is still resulting in stocks being depleted at an alarming rate.</P>
    <P>As part of the process of developing the proposed new programme the Commission has consulted the scientists, the fishing industries and member states. The advice contained in a report of a group of scientists from member states &mdash; the Lassen Report &mdash; is that the general situation of stocks has continued to deteriorate in European and international waters.  The report identifies a number of stocks where urgent measures are needed to prevent their biological collapse.  These include most of the stocks in the waters around Ireland.</P>
    <P>The scientific advice is bleak.  Clearly there is a major imbalance between overall fishing activity and available fish stocks in EU waters.  From that perspective the Commission's analysis cannot be disputed in that further reductions in overall EU tonnage are <Col N="1425" /> still needed.  I would stress that it is in Ireland's interest to see progressive reductions in the overall size of the EU fleet particularly those fishing heavily, and often indiscriminately, in the Irish EEZ, but I have a fundamental problem with the blunt instrument approach proposed by the Commission of across the board percentage cuts as the solution. I find myself returning time and time again to this question.  If global cuts in tonnage are the answer to the problem why, in spite of the various fleet reductions achieved since 1993, has over-exploitation continued at such a rate and key stocks continued to plummet? Are the fleet cuts being implemented where they are really needed?  Are member states committing themselves sufficiently to implementing and enforcing the control and conservation measures which already exist and which are equally essential for the protection of the resource?  In other words, is the EU tying itself into a straitjacket of capacity cuts while, at the same time, the rules are being regularly broken on all other fronts?</P>
    <P>This is a fundamental question and one which must be confronted and answered.  Getting the balance right between the EU fleet and the available fish resource involves a much wider range of factors than capacity control. Fishing methods, conservation control and enforcement are all equally related to the balance between fleet size and fish stocks.  They must be given due weight if they are to get to grips with the overall problem.  The differing impact of these factors for specific fleets and fisheries must be taken into account in developing a credible &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; response to the scientific advice.</P>
    <P>The Commission has also engaged in consultations with the national fishing organisations over recent months in the run up to these proposals.  Two meetings were held in Dublin and Cork last February at which Commission officials had the opportunity to listen to the specific concerns of the Irish industry and about future directions of fleet policy.  The industry made a strong case for Ireland <Col N="1426" /> to be allowed to develop its fleet further in the interests of safety and efficiency and to allow full take up of existing quota entitlements and emerging non quota opportunities.  The industry representative emphasised the vital regional importance of fishing to coastal communities and the need to sustain and develop the industry to give much needed employment.  The Commission, therefore, has been given a very clear and unambiguous message by the Irish industry about the likely impact of future severe cuts in fleet size for Ireland, given the underdevelopment of the fishing industry and the economic and social consequences.</P>
    <P>In addition to the consultation process with the industry, the Commission also consulted national authorities on the overall principles which would inform their proposals.  We clearly signalled to the Commission in considerable detail Ireland's position on the broad issue at stake and our specific national concerns and objectives.  I have already outlined some of those concerns and objectives in my earlier remarks on the need for the Commission proposals to strike the right balance between all the factors affecting the sustainability of the fisheries resource.</P>
    <P>The solution to the problem is not one dimensional.  In addition to taking into account issues of conservation, fishing methods, control and enforcement, the Commission must also take into account fundamental EU principles of economic and social cohesion.  The Union has given formal recognition to the need to address the problem of regions where local communities are especially dependent on fisheries.  This is enshrined in the Hague Agreement of 1976 and in the Common Fisheries Policy Regulation of 1992.  The special needs and position of the Irish fishing industry is thus acknowledged and should be reflected in the fisheries policy instruments, including fleet policy.  It follows that the specific nature and profile of national fishing fleets necessarily rules out &ldquo;across the board&rdquo; fleet capacity cuts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> Uniform proposals applied without taking account of specific needs will be discriminatory in effect.  What I have done already, therefore, is to put firmly to the Commission the case for specific treatment of the Irish fleet as follows: In the first instance I want to maintain existing capacity in the pelagic fleet to allow, in particular, for continued diversification into non quota species such as horse mackerel, blue whiting and Atlantic red fish.  The modern and efficient Irish pelagic fleet is capable of pursuing these opportunities while working to ensure viability within available quota levels for herring and mackerel.</P>
    <P>Second, my objective for the underdeveloped small whitefish fleet is to develop the capacity to allow full take up of existing quota entitlements and to catch increased levels of non quota species.  As the Commission acknowledges, this part of the Irish fleet is largely made up of small older boats often confined to base because of weather and in need of further modernisation for economic and safety reasons. It supports a large number of jobs on a modest take up of fish.</P>
    <P>Third, I am particularly concerned to enhance the safety operation of the fleet overall.  Safety improvements which do not affect capacity should not be penalised under any new proposals.  Fourth, high levels of effort are exerted by other fleets on the key stocks under pressure in the Irish EEZ including vessels largely in and out of member states other than their own flag states.  I am pressing the Commission to take specific account of the &ldquo;flagships&rdquo; issue in devising solutions with regard to specific stocks.</P>
    <P>The Commission has now unveiled its proposals in light of, presumably, its assessment of all the inputs so far.  The proposals are stark and uncompromising and we now have a huge uphill battle on our hands to have our specific concerns addressed.  I would emphasise that this is the Commission's opening position.  Months of long, tough negotiation lie ahead before an overall <Col N="1428" /> agreement is likely to be reached.  The Council of Ministers will be responsible for taking the overall decision on the guidelines and principles, following which the Commission will negotiate a separate bilateral programme with each member state.  I have spelt out our opening position and I assure Senators that we will be fighting the Irish case line by line.  The national position is clear and stands separately from our obligations as Presidency to work to advance EU business.</P>
    <P>I would summarise the Commission's opening bid as follows: Fleet cuts over six years in two phases totalling 40 per cent cuts in capacity in key demersal and pelagic stocks under pressure; 20 to 30 per cent cuts in less critical stocks and <i>status quo</i> on stocks in better shape. The Commission has also signalled that account will be taken of specific characteristics but talks about an equitable share of the pain.  It also undertakes to review financial aid to cushion the impact on the sector, but realistically there is not a shred of comfort on increased funding overall.</P>
    <P>There is no justification for major cuts in the Irish fleet based on any rational assessment of the part the fleet plays in the European problem of overfishing. However, make no mistake, there is a tough battle to be fought.  Other member states are not likely to accept a large cut in their own fleet while the Irish fleet is allowed to increase in size or even remain at its present size.  All member states are under extreme pressure to maintain their existing employment in fishing and to maintain their fleets without cuts.  Such an approach would be unacceptable to the Commission and to me.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the seas around our coast are overfished.  I have spoken earlier of the results elsewhere when necessary action to cut overfishing is not taken early enough.  Fisheries have been totally closed.  This must not happen in our waters.  We must push for strong action on all fronts to cut overfishing. We must also make our European partners recognise that we will not pay the <Col N="1429" /> price for overfishing by others.  This is the message I will be taking to the Fisheries Council next week when there will be a preliminary discussion on MGP IV. I know I have the support of the fishing industry and I am sure I can rely on your support in pursuing the best possible deal for Ireland in the months ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well next week in his negotiations.  There are choppy waters ahead.  Apart from the initial proposals made by the EU, reports commissioned by it indicate that the overall stocks and the prospects for certain species of fish are not good.  It is understandable, therefore, that in the light of these reports action is being proposed.</P>
      <P>The situation regarding fishing rights and the capacity of the fleets of member states is a major issue.  The Irish fleet is relatively small, accounting for less than 1.5 per cent of the total number of vessels in the EU.  Cuts in Irish capacity would make little difference overall and this could be a strong argument for our case.  However, I appreciate the difficulty the Minister will have, given that each member state will make a case for its fleet.</P>
      <P>The necessary measures must be put in place at European level to deal with the problem of overfishing so that stocks may be conserved.  However, Ireland does not cause the overfishing and its fleet should not be cut.  The Commission proposals involve a substantial cut in the Irish fleet, both the pelagic fleet in Killybegs and the white fish fleet.  As the Minister has indicated, this is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sea fisheries sector is of major importance to the economies of coastal regions.  Most of the employment is concentrated in these regions, particularly the north-west, west and south-west.  In these regions fisheries may account for up to a quarter of the local employment. A reduction in the capacity of the fishing fleet would have negative knock-on effects on employment in the fleet, processing and other related industries.  The <Col N="1430" /> Irish fishing industry is already disadvantaged in European terms by its distance from markets, and a reduction in the fleet's size would impact further on the sector.  Our distance from our main market is a factor that I am sure will be pursued.</P>
    <P>The white fish section of the Irish fleet comprises a large number of older vessels.  It needs renewal and modernisation. The vessels fish close to shore and are at sea for less than 24 hours.  The number of vessels capable of fishing at distance offshore is small.  Therefore, Ireland has a difficulty catching its quotas for all species.  The Irish fleet must be allowed to modernise and expand to a level which would enable it to catch its quotas.</P>
    <P>The inshore fleet also needs to be developed to allow it to catch non-quota species.  The non-quota species on which the smaller boats are dependent, such as lobster, crab and oysters, have developed and expanded through conservation and enhancement programmes. The harvesting of these species will lead to an increased requirement for inshore boats to service these fisheries.</P>
    <P>The boats which operate from Killybegs are capable of fishing long distances from the shore and in international waters.  Greater efforts will be directed at non-quota species over the coming years and a cut in the size of this fleet would prevent the development of these new fisheries.</P>
    <P>Other measures should also be put in place to improve our fish stocks which would include technical measures to reduce the number of young fish being caught and improved control and surveillance measures to reduce the incidence of illegal fishing.  While these measures in themselves will not solve the problem of overfishing, they are part of the solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us a full report and we are aware of the difficulties he faces.  I am glad to note he has all-party support and support from the industry.</P>
    <Col N="1431" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion put to the House is deliberately worded to assure the Minister of our backing for him in his work to deal with the crisis facing the Irish fishing industry and to demonstrate solidarity in the search for a reasonable solution for the greatest crisis to face the industry since we joined the EU.  We support the Minister's efforts at EU level to fight the Irish case and to endeavour to get the best possible outcome for the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>Since we joined the EU the fishing industry has developed from modest beginnings to a small yet efficient fleet. It would be a backward step if a small fleet was penalised for its efforts and efficiency; it would not augur well for the future development of the EU.  The fleet has made substantial advances but this has not been without cost.  The State has supported the fleet substantially in the acquisition of new vessels, the modernisation of existing vessels and the investment made in harbour and landing facilities.  Successive Governments have supported the industry and enabled it to meet the challenges of the new, enlarged European market.</P>
      <P>Given the present situation of the fleet, the EU must not be allowed to penalise the fleet because it is efficient, operating well and expanding.  The EU must keep in mind that the Irish fleet and its catch are relatively small in the context of the overall EU catch.  The crisis that faces the industry at present requires new policy initiatives.  Unless the proposals before the Commission can be substantially altered in Ireland's favour we will see an industry which has made significant advances drift into a terminal decline.  This would not alone affect those in the industry but a range of activities connected with the industry, such as processing and marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the Commission's attitude in proposing these harsh measures for Ireland.  Only a few short years ago the Union permitted increased fishing by the Spanish fleet in traditional conservation areas.  A limited but significant number of Spanish boats <Col N="1432" /> were allowed to fish in the Irish Box, which had been set up as a conservation measure.  The EU is now turning its back on people who abided by strict conservation measures over many years and at considerable expense both financially and in terms of the difficulties posed for fishermen in maintaining a strict conservation policy under successive Administrations and Ministers.  I was the Minister responsible for fisheries in two periods since we joined the Community. We enforced strict conservation measures and put fishermen in prison because they were not obeying the rules laid down by the EU.  Having embarked upon and enforced conservation measures to that extent, we now find that the European Commission is prepared to penalise the very people who upheld its conservation policy, which was so essential for the preservation of stocks.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to explain to fishermen, or to anyone who knows the business or has been connected with it over the last 15 years, how the European Commission could allow Spanish boats access to conservation areas and almost into our 12 mile zone.  Those who suffered conservation measures were thus further penalised by having high powered boats from the Spanish fleet in their fisheries.  Fishermen are right to be deeply concerned about what the future holds for them and their families.</P>
    <P>Also, given that Ireland's processing industry is so dependent on the level of catches being maintained, fishermen fear serious job losses in industries which add value to the fish catch.  This is a limited debate and in the time at our disposal it is not possible to go into detail; however, I strongly suggest to the Minister that it may be time to enter a bilateral arrangement with the Spanish fleet.  They are now landing sizeable catches in Irish ports and ferrying them out of the country.  It might be opportune to have a partnership with them, as it looks like we will have to live with them whether we like it or not.  It would be worthwhile to examine this further as it would increase the prospect of further <Col N="1433" /> jobs in the processing and added value area.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's decision to make it a priority to take up Irish quotas to the full, because some of them were not fully exploited for a period.  It is vitally important at this stage that every effort be made to avail fully of all quotas available to us.  It is also still necessary to modernise boats, to make our fleet safer and to develop our aquaculture business.  In his difficult negotiations with the EU the Minister can be assured of total support from this side of the House for his efforts on behalf of the Irish fishing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate and thank the Opposition for raising this important matter.  As a representative of the county with the biggest fishing fleet in the country, I am more aware than most of what is at stake here.  The Minister also knows the position only too well.  In places like Rathmullen, Ballywhoriskey and Fanad, 25 per cent of employment is in fisheries or fish processing, whereas in Killybegs, Burtonport and Greencastle it is more like 60 to 70 per cent.  In those areas, anyone who is not working in the fishing industry emigrates.  Something must be done to ensure the fishing fleet is not further depleted.  It is clear from the Opposition's remarks that it will support the Minister in his efforts during the Irish Presidency to secure the future of the domestic fishing industry.  This issue is too important to play party politics with and I hope both sides will resist the temptation to score points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike many issues which come before this House, this is not a complex matter.  All Members accept that there are two factors involved.  The first is the problem of overfishing in European Union waters &mdash; there can be no disputing the central logic of the EU Commissioner when she said that without fish there will be no fishing.  The second factor is that the Irish fleet is not responsible for the overfishing over the last two decades which has created this <Col N="1434" /> problem.  Current estimates put the Irish share of EU fleet capacity at a paltry 1.5 per cent.  This problem has been with us for some time and has been exacerbated by the accession of Spain and Portugal to the EU in 1986.</P>
    <P>The current proposal from the Commissioner is to reduce the EU fleet by a further 40 per cent.  I am not qualified to question her figures, although some experts do.  It seems clear, however, that previous EU measures aimed at fish conservation have proved unsuccessful. About 60 per cent of fishing stocks are biologically at risk, which is the highest figure in over 30 years of monitoring of stocks.  Perhaps we do not believe all the figures produced by scientists and analysts, but it is clear the position is nothing like as good as it was ten to 15 years ago.  If the Commissioner's proposals are adopted they will impact upon Irish fleets fishing for whitefish, mackerel and herring in both the North and South.</P>
    <P>A fundamental issue of equity is at stake.  If we are not responsible for the problem and cannot even reach our existing quotas, why should we be penalised?  If Ireland is required further to reduce its fleet capacity it will undermine the attempts made by Irish fisherman to modernise their fleet.  This modernisation has been essential on two grounds.  Our whitefish fleet is manned by small and dated vessels.  This has not only undermined our capacity to fish in adverse weather conditions, it has also mitigated against safety in the sector as recent accidents &mdash; such as the <i>Carrickatine</i> disaster, in which six lives were lost &mdash; have borne out.  I commend the Minister for the help and support he gave during that search.  While it is probably fair to say that the fleet could compensate for loss in some areas by concentrating on non-quota inshore produce, this will in no way make up for losses elsewhere.  Irish fisherman, who are now only beginning to fulfil their potential, should not be asked to go down this road.</P>
    <P>Our new pelagic fleet operating out of my county is among the most modern <Col N="1435" /> in Europe.  It is in place because of substantial investment by the Killybegs skippers.  As a result of its development we now have the capacity to fish in international waters for the first time and to concentrate on non-quota fish.  If these proposals impact on the size of this fleet we will lose an opportunity that has just opened up.</P>
    <P>Newspaper reports last week suggested that the Commissioner intended to make concessions from the regulations to small fisheries whose boat size did not impact on the overall figures. Looking at the figures, I would be of the view that this argument could be applied to all the Irish fishing areas.</P>
    <P>There should be no underestimating the importance of the fishing industry to certain regions in this State.  When ancillary industries like fish processing are taken into account, this sector can account for 25 per cent of all employment in this region.  I would urge the Minister &mdash; and I am confident that he is as aware of this as any Member of this House &mdash; to resist these proposals when they come up for final decision in December of this year.</P>
    <P>I recognise the importance of the fishing industry to the member states of the Iberian peninsula and I hold no grudge against them.  However, if they are responsible, as I believe they are, for the level of overfishing prevalent at the moment, then they should bear the burden for the problem they have created. It is ludicrous to suggest that other member states, whose right to a fishing industry is equally as great, should be made to pay the price for their misdemeanours. I would also like to see these countries play a greater role in enforcing the existing regulations.  Irish fishermen have already made sacrifices. The disappearance of the Irish Box at the end of last year is the best case in point.  Rather than restrict their capacity in recent years, the Iberians appear to have been able to expand their fishing grounds and this is completely unacceptable to us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> We must be realistic about this problem. It does not lie solely in the Minister's hands to solve it.  We can only achieve our ends through co-operation with other member states who share our concerns.  This decision will be decided by qualified majority voting.  We have no recourse to a veto in this situation. Unfortunately, because many member states do not have similar problems, their interest in this issue may not be as great as ours.  Senator Daly touched recently on co-operation with the Spanish, but greater co-operation with the British authorities may be an avenue worth pursuing, although their current attitude to the EU does not augur well for constructive engagement on any issue at all.</P>
    <P>The task ahead of the Minister is a difficult one.  He will require the support of all parties in this House and I am sure that on this issue, when the national interest is at stake, that support will be forthcoming.  I wish the Minister well in his endeavours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always held the view, even though I live inland, that our fishing industry was never exploited to the full extent of its capacity.  The present proposals would constitute a serious assault on the economies of Europe's coastal states and I call on the Government to ensure that a strong negotiating team is in place to resist them.  I am delighted to see in the Minister's speech that, in so far as the Commission proposal would apply to Ireland's specific situation, they are totally unacceptable.  This is important and it is a relief to hear that comment coming at this time.  The axe has been hanging over the Irish fishing industry for some time and has now been sharpened by the latest proposals put forward by the EU Fisheries Commissioner, Mrs. Bonino.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In putting forward these blanket fleet-cutting proposals, the European Commission is seeking to make Ireland pick up the tab for a problem not of our making.  Let us be clear about it: the Irish fleet, which is hampered by age, <Col N="1437" /> adverse weather conditions and a lack of technical capability, is not responsible for the depletion of fish stocks in European waters.  We must make that perfectly clear.  Rather than examining the specific circumstances in each country, the European Commission has based its proposals exclusively on broad scientific estimates of what various stocks can sustain, categorised in terms of region and catch type.</P>
    <P>If these proposals were implemented, the net result for Ireland would be devastating. Not only would the European fleet as a whole be slashed by around 40 per cent, but it is proposed to make cuts of 40 per cent in the mackerel and herring fleets fishing off the coast of Scotland and around 50 per cent in the salmon fishing fleet.  This has been referred to previously.  No one would deny that European fish stocks have been seriously depleted in recent decades, but those depredations have been caused by the large high-tech Baltic and Iberian fishing fleets.  They have not been caused by the Irish fishermen, who because of our weather conditions cannot even spend time in the fishing grounds.</P>
    <P>I understand that the European Commission is trying to sweeten this pill by allocating £2.5 billion in the first phase to cushion the blow.  A once-off sweetener will not compensate fishermen, their families and communities for the ongoing hardship which these cuts would represent.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals will simply result in the European fishing industry becoming grant-and subsidy-led, rather than market-led.  If implemented, they will lead to the gradual decline of our coastal areas which will be deprived of their economic backbone.</P>
    <P>A final decision on these proposals is due to be taken at the Fisheries Council meeting in December during the Irish Presidency.  It is imperative that Ireland be represented at all negotiations by a strong and effective team which is capable of forming the necessary strategic alliances with other coastal states in order to resist the Commission plans.  In <Col N="1438" /> this regard I look forward to the full and ongoing involvement of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister.  I was heartened by his statement and speech tonight.  If he goes to the EU to negotiate in the positive manner of his speech, he will be successful.  To sum it up, I take one line from his script &mdash; this is one of the most important lines I have ever heard spoken &mdash;&ldquo;We must also make our European partners recognise that we will not pay the price for overfishing by others&rdquo;.  That is where the answer is, because we are not blackguarding the system.</P>
      <P>Most of us live in fishing towns or are not far from the coast, and because of the size of our country nearly every Member of this House is familiar with the fishing industry.  If you live in the middle of the country and go on holiday to the seaside, one of the first places you go is down the pier to see the boats etc. That makes us all very familiar with the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>We have a lot of problems.  There is no doubt about that.  One of the things the Minister should point out at the negotiating table is that it is a long journey to the French or Spanish markets with fish from Donegal, Rossaveel, Dingle or Castletownbere.  When we reach the market, we find that fish caught outside our own door are there before us.</P>
      <P>I was in La Coruña on my own factfinding mission about two or three years ago.  I was talking to the captain of a boat that came in and he knew the people with me.  He had enough English to tell me more about the Blasket Islands than I knew myself because that is where he had come from that evening. That is one of the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get our fish to market is a big problem for us.  As Senator Maloney knows from Killybegs, it is a long road before one gets out of the country.  A case should be made to the Department of the Environment that the roads into these places, especially the last 30 or 40 <Col N="1439" /> miles, are in an appalling condition for huge trucks.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a couple of points to help the Minister.  Within the House there are Oireachtas Committees on Foreign Affairs and various other things.  I suggest that for a short period of time the Minister should establish a fisheries committee made up of Deputies and Senators like the other committees.  Almost all speakers tonight used the words &ldquo;I read in the newspaper&rdquo; which shows that we are all trying to get our information from newspapers. A committee would help us until we get over this hump and renegotiate. We could involve people who know about fishing, as well as some of the civil servants from the Department. They could put their heads together and come to a valuable consensus.</P>
    <P>How many people in this House ever visited a fishing port in northern Spain, such as La Coruna, Vigo or Finisterre, to see at first hand what happens? If a committee was established it would get full support from this House, especially over the summer recess while the Minister is negotiating.  The committee would be there as a back up and lobby for the Minister and the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>In spite of all the cutbacks over the last five to ten years and the supposed reduction in quotas by other countries, waters are still being overfished.  In effect, the Minister is saying that neither he nor the Department envisage a decrease in the amount of fish being caught, despite what is happening.  If there is a decrease, it will inevitably lead to job losses.  In any walk of life where there are job losses &mdash; for example where a factory lays off people &mdash; monetary compensation must be given.  If one takes four boats out of Dingle and 30 jobs are lost, one cannot just leave them there and forget about them.  The EU must ensure that where there are job losses proper compensation will be paid and a type of redundancy payment made to those fishermen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" /> I thank the Minister and I am delighted with the way in which he is renegotiating.  I hope that if the Minister is back in the House I will have words of praise for him.  As I said at the outset, our backs are to the wall.  The Minister is in the hot seat and he will have to stay there, even if it gets too hot.  He is that type of person.  I thank him for his very good speech about what he is going to do.  However, I ask him to think about establishing a committee.  I am very genuine about it because I take these matters very seriously.</P>

      <P>The Minister has proposed an entirely new appeal procedure in the context of section 22.  This section informs the country, probably for the first time, of the existence of the Dublin Convention.  As I understand it, under this section the Minister will have the power, pursuant to the provisions of the convention, to send people who apply for asylum in Ireland back to third countries which may or may not be safe.  It will be for the Minister to explain that, but I am only speaking in the context of the Minister's own lately published amendment to subsection (2) of section 22 which states:</P>
      <P> Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), an order under this section may&mdash;</P>
      <P>The substance of my amendment to sub-section (2) of section 22 is to substitute the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. This is an important amendment because later on in section 22 the Minister proposes a totally new appeal procedure for somebody who may or may not be a subject of the Dublin Convention. You will have to bear with me, a Chathaoirligh, if these things are a little bit complex.  There should, not &ldquo;may&rdquo;, be a right of appeal by somebody who will be subject to the Dublin Convention.</P>

      <P>I am putting it up to the Minister loud and clear and I want to <Col N="1443" /> see her response to this.  Will the Minister leave it totally up to herself as to whether somebody has an appeal from a decision of the Minister in relation to the Dublin Convention?  As regards the Dublin Convention, the Minister, who has perhaps a greater experience in these matters than I have, will know the UN itself declared that certain countries which are members of the convention do not meet the necessary standards of procedure for asylum applicants.  If this Bill is passed in its present form there is a danger that people will be sent back to their country of persecution because certain member states which signed up to the Dublin Convention do not apply the procedural standards for asylum seekers required by the UN.</P>
      <P>We will not gloss over this debate.  I want it to appear on the record of the House if the Minister doggedly goes against the right of people to an appeal procedure here under the Dublin Convention. I do not blame the Minister for it, but the Dublin Convention seems to have come from nowhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disagreeing with that, but we are trying to improve the law here.  It is a matter of the greatest concern that the Dublin Convention has nothing like the status of the Geneva Convention.  The latter convention was a historic treaty brought about after the Second World War to deal with the persecution of people.  The Dublin Convention was signed by <Col N="1444" /> Governments, almost in secrecy, and is now being thrust upon us in the Bill. The purpose of my amendment is that by replacing the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; the applicant would have a right of appeal against the Minister's decision to transfer that person to what could be an unsafe country.  I will elaborate more on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say that, rather like the Senator's rhetoric last week, it is extremely difficult to deal with the logic of his various arguments, which flow in many different directions.  If the Dublin Convention was carried out in great secrecy, it was done by the then Fianna Fáil Government and the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice at the time of Ireland's last Presidency of the European Union.</P>
      <P>I have heard many faults laid at the feet of Fianna Fáil but I did not realise that they carried on the last EU Presidency in total secrecy.  I actually remember rather a lot of publicity about almost all of it.  In fact, the degree of publicity which the actions of various Fianna Fáil Ministers achieved was a remarkable success.  If the Senator has a complaint about secrecy he should take it up with his own party colleagues and in particular with Deputy Burke.  The remedy lies in his hands.  I wish him well in his reforming zeal for Fianna Fáil in the future and in his revisionist picture of the Fianna Fáil Presidency of the European Union the last time out.</P>
      <P>I thought we were speaking to specific amendments.  When the Seanad debated the Bill on Second Stage, many Senators made points about the Dublin Convention, which is a European Union document. It is subject to the Geneva Convention, if the Senator cares to read the Dublin Convention appendix at the back of the Bill.  That is stated in the convention on two separate occasions, so perhaps the Senator would care to read it.  That is possibly why his colleagues, when formerly in Government, felt free to act as they did, even if that was in some secrecy.  It states that very clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> I felt that what Senators had to say on Second Stage was of fairly substantial significance.  One of the points made by a number of Senators &mdash; I am not sure if Senator Mulcahy was one of them and I do not think the amendments were in his name &mdash; which was also mentioned by the NGOs and the UNHCR, was the lack of an appeals procedure in relation to the Dublin Convention.  The purpose of my amendment, as I tediously explained to the Senator on previous occasions, having had the advice of the Attorney General's Office and the parliamentary draftsperson, is to give effect to the points that Senators eloquently made on the issue.  That is what the amendments are about.  I would appreciate debating the function, purpose and reason why those amendments are in the form they are in, when we come to them.</P>
    <P>I find the arguments that the Senator is advancing next to impossible to understand.  Having sought to accommodate Senator Mulcahy's need for an extensive and intensive, but bewildering, series of points on any and all aspects of this Bill, I am disappointed that we are again faced with a farrago of incomprehensible comments by the same Senator.  I have no doubt that the Senator's intentions are good, but I fail to see what they are doing in terms of improving the Bill.  The Senator's amendment has nothing to offer whereas my amendment seeks to meet the points that other Senators, as well as NGOs and the UNHCR, made.</P>
    <P>I hope we will not face, as happened on earlier sections of the Bill, an extended discussion which appears to be about nothing.  I appeal to the Senator's good sense to read my amendment, the Dublin Convention and the references to the Geneva Convention therein.  He will then realise that his earlier comments are nonsensical.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to speak on the substantive issue, the appeal process, until we come to it because otherwise the debate will be all over the place.  The effect of amendment No. 39a would be to oblige the Minister to include every item listed in the section 22(2)(a) to (I).  This would place too rigid a fetter on the Minister in drafting the regulations.  I am satisfied that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the correct word to use in connection with an explanatory list of this nature.  It is essentially an enabling provision to move forward in relation to the Dublin Convention.  The substantive amendment addressing the issues of concern to Senators on the appeal procedure is dealt with in a later amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her explanation.  I see value in Senator Mulcahy's proposal.  However, I accept the practicality of the Minister's point and I agree it would be unnecessarily restrictive and demanding.  However, both points would be covered by the inclusion of two words, which are great friends of parliamentary draftsmen, &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo;.  There is nothing wrong with considering the inclusion of these words.  The Minister was correct in saying that having to use them as parameters is unnecessary and needlessly restrictive, but they are of some value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am unhappy with the amendment &mdash; I appreciate Senator Mulcahy had to draft it very quickly &mdash; in that it might be exclusive.  It is excessively demanding and unnecessary that this should be required in every regulation.  I do not know enough about it to know the percentage of cases in which it might be necessary.  I recognise the value of Senator Mulcahy's proposal in that these issues should be considered in all cases.  The Minister said it is not always practicable to do so.  Therefore, the easy way out is to give her discretion and to consider the inclusion of the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; on Report Stage. Those words have the same impact as the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, although the issues referred to would have to be considered. <Col N="1447" /> We should look at it in context. Senator Mulcahy was right to say it is impossible to discuss this without considering the entire section.  I ask the Minister to consider this point and to come back to it on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I thought the Minister said something like that.  Leaving the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; will mean that the Minister retains discretion as to whether somebody may have an appeal under the Dublin Convention which, in itself, goes against one of the finest principles of natural justice, that is, that nobody should be a judge in their own cause. If the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is retained and the Minister decides an applicant is not entitled to an appeal, he or she has made the initial decision that this person will be transported to a third country under the Dublin Convention and that they are not entitled to an appeal.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is offensive because it allows the Minister to make two decisions.  Having said that, I am all for the speedy progress of this Bill.  I would like to hear the Minister's response to the Independent Senators' contributions.</P>

If Senator Mulcahy reads the Dublin Convention <Col N="1448" /> carefully &mdash; I understand his concern on this matter &mdash; he will see that it is a statute which was entered into by his party when we last held the Presidency of the European Union.  The Senator should not shake his head because this is a historical fact and a distinguished historian is present in the House.  It was signed by his colleague, Deputy Ray Burke, when Ireland last held the Presidency of the European Union.  We will come to the substantive matter later.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly speaking, the purpose of the Dublin Convention is to lay down criteria for determining which member state is responsible for examining an asylum application.  It is important to understand that this convention is essentially a set of procedural or technical rules, as opposed to being a development in the area of asylum philosophy or thinking.  It has a limited objective and it is not intended, for example &mdash; I hate to cross swords with Senator Mulcahy &mdash; to expand on the Geneva Convention.</P>
      <P>I listened with great care to the Senator's contributions on the Dublin Convention.  While I am of the opinion that the Dublin Convention is basically a procedural tool, I agree that any decision made to send an asylum seeker to another state under the terms of the Dublin Convention would be open to review in our courts.  We have hitherto regarded the specifying of a review mechanism as a matter of spelling it out in the implementing regulations rather than in the Bill, as Senator O'Toole referred to earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in light of Senators' comments and taking account of these comments as articulated in amendment No. 42, and also bearing in mind submissions made to me by the UNHCR and other interested parties, I have <Col N="1451" /> sought further advice from the Attorney General on the matter.  He advised me that there would be merit in including further provisions in section 22 which would specifically introduce a review mechanism in the Bill as opposed to the regulations.  I have accepted his advice and amendments Nos. 39a and 39e provide a mechanism for establishing an appeals process.  It is not a new appeals process overall; it is in the context of the Dublin Convention and for the appointment of a person to consider such appeals.  By introducing this amendment, I hope that I have met the concerns expressed and which are the subject of amendment No. 42.</P>
    <P>The amendment spells out a specific enabling provision allowing for the inclusion in the order of procedures for an appeal against a decision to return a person to another convention country. As I have already stated, the Dublin Convention is essentially a set of procedural or technical rules as opposed to being a development in the area of asylum philosophy or thinking.  It is, accordingly, proper that the statutory instrument should spell out a procedure to deal with the situation where an applicant, whose application is to be transferred under the Dublin Convention, can appeal against what he or she considers to be a misapplication of these rules based, for instance, on the incorrect interpretation of factual evidence.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the order should specify a time limit for the making and determination of an appeal.  Such a limit will of necessity be of short duration due to the nature of the process.  An open ended time limit would frustrate one of the intentions behind the convention and this Bill &mdash; timely consideration of all requests of asylum in the appropriate member states.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate two points for the benefit of Senators.  First, subsection (4) provides that an application cannot be transferred unless the other convention country has agreed to accept responsibility for the examination of the application. Of course, the other Dublin <Col N="1452" /> Convention countries are our European Union partners.  This is a very important safeguard.  Second, Article 3.4 of the Dublin Convention provides that each state may decide to examine a claim for asylum even if that responsibility lies within another state under the terms of the convention.  In other words, we are not obliged to implement the Dublin Convention; it is a matter of choice.  A state does not have to implement it.  It could decide to deal with the application of an asylum seeker, who had earlier been in another European Union country, in this country rather than refer it back to the first country.</P>
    <P>The order to be made under section 22 (2) (a) of this Bill will provide for this.  In making a decision to return an individual to another convention country, the official appointed by the Minister by virtue of the new subsection 4 (a), will take all issues into account before issuing a decision.  These two points should go a long way to meet the concerns expressed by Senators.</P>
    <P>So far as the person to be appointed to hear the appeal is concerned, amendment No. 39e provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that such a person will have at least seven years experience as a practising lawyer. While it is probable that the person to be appointed to hear appeals will be the Refugee Applications Commissioner, subsection (4) (c) is flexible enough to allow for another suitably qualified person to be appointed in the event that the commissioner is unable to deal expeditiously with an appeal due, for example, to being out of the country or being indisposed.  In these circumstances, I ask the Senators to accept my proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>The Senator's amendment to the Government amendment would have the effect of limiting the appeal procedure to the grounds specified in the Senator's wording.  This is clearly unacceptable as it would preclude an appeal on, for example, the simple grounds that the Minister's appointed officer had misapplied the rules or had misinterpreted factual evidence.  There-fore, I cannot accept the Senator's <Col N="1453" /> amendment to the Government amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection <i>per se</i> to any appeal procedure for somebody who will be subject to the Dublin Convention.  While I respectfully disagree with the Minister in the words I proposed to add, I will not make a big deal of it.  My amendment proposes to add the words &ldquo;on the grounds that the applicant if transferred to a convention country, will not be afforded a proper opportunity to assert his or her rights under the Geneva Convention&rdquo;.  If the Minister entered into the spirit of my amendment, she would have accepted it and come back on Report Stage to add the words &ldquo;or other&rdquo;, &ldquo;such other reason&rdquo; or &ldquo;other reason&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are talking about somebody who is afraid they will not be able to assert their rights under the Geneva Convention in another European country. When we come to amendment No. 40, I intend to give the Minister, if she is not already aware of them, a long list of cases where third countries, members of the Dublin Convention, are considered by the United Nations not to be safe or to be countries where the correct degree of appeal procedure, etc., under the Geneva Convention is not available.</P>
      <P>My amendment to amendment No. 39e relates to an issue which the House discussed previously.  It is preferable that the person who will hear the appeal is a practising solicitor or barrister of not less than seven years standing.  As Senator O'Toole indicated on the last occasion, if a practising solicitor or barrister must be appointed, it excludes the possibility that somebody working in the Minister's Department who may have seven years previous experience could be appointed to hear appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister's amendment is rushed.  I do not know when it was finalised by the parliamentary draftsman; but if it was not rushed, Members should have had more time to table amendments to it.  This is always the difficulty when amendments are published at the last minute.  Perhaps <Col N="1454" /> the Minister will outline the position in that regard.</P>
    <P>In general, I support and welcome the right to appeal.  I have no problem with that, but I ask the Minister to consider my wording in relation to amendment No. 39a and to come back with an amendment on Report Stage.  I also ask the Minister to consider the point made in the previous debate that a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than seven years standing should be appointed to hear appeals.</P>

      <P>The House is dealing with an amendment to an amendment, something a well known organisation would not allow.  How will the amendment be dealt with in technical terms if a vote is called?  Which amendment will be put first, as the question cannot be &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo;?  On what basis will the vote be taken?  Will there be two votes, one after the other?</P>

      <P>I welcome the appeal procedure proposed in the amendment; it is essential to the Bill.  An important point made by the Minister which is not mentioned in the amendments is that there will be a timeframe for the appeals.  An appeal without a suspensive effect would be useless because it could be made and yet one would be transported out of the country within three hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy is right to point out that what some EU countries consider third countries are not considered as such by other members of the EU.  For example, the United Kingdom still considers Nigeria a third safe country, but many other members of the EU have difficulty considering it safe.  I will not go through the list of problems in other European countries but complaints have been made to the UNHCR about Austria, Greece, Italy, Belgium, France <Col N="1455" /> and the Netherlands.  For example, the police at Schipol airport were described in a most unpleasant way regarding the way they treated foreigners who wished to lodge an application for asylum. However, I am glad these matters were dealt with in the various countries in which complaints were made.</P>
    <P>An appeal without a suspensive effect would be pointless and I hope the Minister will ensure the suspension is not just for 12 hours or a similar length of time.  It must be sufficient to enable a person to get their appeal together.  The person must also have access to counsel. They need to be in a position to rebut the presumption that they are being sent to a safe third country because they may have much better knowledge of what is happening there.  The Minister is aware of the fears in recent days of people who fled to Hong Kong following the Tiananmen Square massacre that when Hong Kong is no longer a British protectorate they could be deported to China.  Many people in areas of turmoil have real fears.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Convention will probably come into effect during Ireland's EU Presidency in the next six months. Ireland and the Netherlands are the only countries which have yet to ratify the convention and I hope it will come into effect.  The legal advice I received is that it is superseded by the Geneva Convention.  I am not a lawyer and I do not have Senator Mulcahy's legal training so I must abide by that advice. However, the Minister stated there will be a period in which a person may lodge an appeal, and this is most important.</P>
    <P>One could quibble about the fact that the appeal will be heard by just one person; my amendment requested an appeals board.  The proposal is for one person, but they can be hired and fired by the Minister and, therefore, they are under the Minister's control.  In addition, there is no time limit on the appointment.  However, the amendment is an important improvement to the Bill and I am grateful for it.  I am also glad the Minister said there will be a timeframe <Col N="1456" /> for appeals.  Perhaps the Minister could provide more detail on the timeframe because this aspect is most important to asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>The way appeals are dealt with in different European countries is interesting.  For example, a high rate of appeals are sustained in France but only a small percentage are sustained in other countries.  When somebody is sent back to another Dublin Convention country we do not know what faces them and it is most important we are in a position to assess the place to which they are being sent.  We will have a fair idea about their feelings regarding what they consider safe countries.  I am sure the person appointed by the Minister will be well informed and take cognisance of all the facts.</P>
    <P>I understand the point made by Senator Mulcahy that the person appointed should be a practising barrister or solicitor.  However, that would preclude judges, who might be ideal people to appoint to such a position. Experience in judicial matters of more than seven years could be of great benefit to whoever is in charge of the appeals.  I am most grateful to the Minister for introducing the amendment.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion I was more than a little annoyed by the Minister's responses to some of our needs.  I was most critical of the Minister and I was unable to participate for much of the time because I felt we were not making any progress.  I had some sympathy for the frustration expressed by Senator Mulcahy and others.  However, the Minister's amendment is a major move forward and I hope it is a water-shed in the debate.  It shows remarkable progress and it is most welcome.  As the Minister pointed out, it meets a point raised by many Members.  This is the good news, but we must also examine what it means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a clear view about the idea of an appeal and the principles of natural justice.  Whether it is by way of judicial review or an appeal, people should have some device by which to check why <Col N="1457" /> something was done or how it was done. It is clear that an appeal governed by regulation or statute is the most attractive option.  This relates to the previous discussion on an earlier amendment regarding &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;may&rdquo; when I referred to the possibility of a middle line which would include the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo;.  I am not reopening that debate but I wish to put the current discussion in context. Nobody is above accountability and the Government has set itself the target that it will be accountable and transparent in decision making.  This matter is an example of where this comes into play. I argued from the Minister's point of view on the last occasion that it may be unfair and impractical for us to insist that all the bits and pieces in the section would be required by regulation.  On the other hand, the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; are always used by Governments to soften and give space to a Department; but leaving the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; on its own effectively leaves the right to an appeal at the whim of the Minister.</P>
    <P>There should be a right to an appeal. If there is no right to an appeal, there should be a right to question why there was no appeal to fall back on.  With the inclusion of the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo;, it would be open to challenge by somebody who felt they were entitled to an appeal having taken everything into consideration and who did not have an appeal allowed to them.  Therefore if the words were to remain as they stand now &mdash;&ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash; a Minister would just say that having taken everything into consideration he decided there should be no appeal.  There is very little that any judge could do with that if it did come to court.  If on the other hand the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; were included, a Minister would have to argue that having taken everything into consideration he or she came to the conclusion on the following basis and give the reasons. That is if somebody chooses to question or challenge the Minister's judgment in that case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> The only way that could be done is through judicial review, but nonetheless it would allow it to happen.  This is a major step forward.  It has to added to the baby step which we recommended earlier, which is the inclusion of the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo;.  That gives a more complete package.</P>
    <P>I am not clear about the first amendment to the amendment.  I argued on the last occasion on amendment No. 39e and I would concede this point.  It was for a different kind of job and a more permanent job.  I am seeking information here.  We talked about the commissioner on the last occasion.  Am I right in assuming that this is a different person?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the kinds of things which we do need to know about. On a casual reading of it a specific decision would be taken on every occasion.  I am not arguing against it being the commissioner.  I do not know about it.  I will have it give it consideration and read the Bill with that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made important points about somebody who will be working full-time on it.  I am not sure if it is so important, if it is somebody who is asked simply to rule on a particular appeal case, that it should be somebody who is practising today.  It would be utterly and completely unacceptable and against the principles of natural justice if the person appointed to do this job happened to be somebody, for instance, in the Minister's Department. I would like the Minister to clarify this. Any judge would throw that out, but the Minister has made the distinction in her own amendment that the officer appointed to determine matters in sub-section (2) (a) would be a different person to subsection (2) (b).  How does the Minister of State see the relationship between this person and her Department, the relationship between the two people referred to here and the relationship between these two people and the <Col N="1459" /> commissioner working if they are or should be one and the same person?  It is only on receiving this clarification that we can come to a final decision, but the fact that we need clarification means that the words need to be changed somewhat as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment in this regard and it takes on board a crucial point in the proposed amendments.  I would echo Senator Henry in asking for clarification in so far as the Minister is able to give it at present on the time factor involved. In amendment No. 42 three of the four clauses referred to the implications of the time factor.  It would be helpful if the Minister were to elaborate on that. I saw the Minister shaking her head negatively when Senator O'Toole was talking about his understanding of the meaning of &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  My understanding of &ldquo;may&rdquo; accords with his in normal parlance.  If that is not the Minister's understanding I would be grateful for an elaboration on her reasons for that.  I am troubled by the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; because of the obvious uncertainties of what it may mean, but also because in the preamble to the Dublin Convention, which governs this section, there is the clause &ldquo;determined to co-operate closely in the application of this Convention through various means with our European Union partners.&rdquo;  That presumably has some influence on our response on the implementation of the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible the thinking in other European countries will go in a very different direction in the years to come from the liberalising intentions behind this Bill.  That may not turn out to be the case at all with several of our European partners and it may well be that the Government here could come under pressure from people who are thinking very differently from the way we would wish to think.  I do not know what latitude the preamble gives, but these are not just words.  We should take cognisance of the possible implications of them on the possible interpretations <Col N="1460" /> that can be put on permissive phrases and directions in our phraseology.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendment to introduce an appeal system against the determination of a transfer for asylum to a Convention country.  I agree with the other Senators that it is a positive approach by the Minister.  In amendment No. 39e the Minister of State has catered for the appointment of a person to determine the appeals system. It is welcome; it is open and is in response to a considerable amount of debate which took place in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Senator Henry's point, what is the suspensive effect of this proposed amendment?  If, for example, the Minister makes an order transferring a person to a Convention state and there is an appeal, will that have the effect of suspending the Minister's decision?  If the answer to that question is yes, where in the Bill or the amendment is that suspensive effect contained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>On Senator Henry's point, an appeal under the Dublin Convention will have a suspensive effect. The removal of someone who has such an appeal outstanding is specifically precluded by section 9 (2).  The timeframe will be a matter of days rather than hours and there is no intention to have undue haste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Convention is a two way option.  If there are asylum seekers in this country who have previously been in another European state we have an option to apply the Dublin Convention, but we do not have to apply it.  We can decide for various reasons to hear their application in this country rather than to seek to remit them to their country of origin.  Alternatively, our European Union partners have the same rights and if, for instance, they find that somebody is in France who was previously in Ireland, they have the right under the Dublin Convention to remit them.  We would be obliged under the Dublin Convention to hear their asylum appeal <Col N="1461" /> in this jurisdiction, but equally France would have the option whether to do that in accordance with the convention and French law.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Convention was introduced to stop the phenomenon of refugees &ldquo;in orbit&rdquo;, whereby refugees could end up travelling around the countries of the European Union without ever securing a place where their application for refugee status had to be heard.  In that sense it is procedural and is designed to deal with that problem.  The UNHCR welcomed that element in the convention.  The content of the Dublin Convention was laid down during the last Irish EU Presidency.  This is enabling legislation in the context of a convention which already exists, having been established by the European countries during that Presidency.  The Dublin Convention is an option and we are providing for an appeals mechanism, a mechanism sought by the Senators and by a number of NGOs.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides that the Minister shall appoint one of his or her officers to determine the matters referred to in subsection (2) (a), the Minister shall appoint a person to hear the appeal and the person shall have not less than seven years experience as a practising barrister.  The consequence of Senator Mulcahy's amendment would be that the person would have to be a currently practising solicitor or barrister. That would mean that somebody working for a NGO but not practising as a barrister would be disqualified; a retired judge would be disqualified; an academic lawyer of great distinction in human rights matters but who is not a practising lawyer would also be disqualified. That is the reason for the Government's wording.  Senator Mulcahy's amendment would limit the choice unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole expressed concern about the use of &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; with regard to enabling the making of regulations.  I gave an undertaking earlier that there will be appeal provisions in the regulations.  I do not know <Col N="1462" /> how far the Senator wants me to go but I cannot put it more strongly than the solemn undertaking I gave, which is already on the Official Record, that I will make regulations that will include an appeal provision.  The effect of this structure is to enable an appeal to the courts with regard to all elements of this Bill.  In setting out the appeal criteria I have sought to provide reassurance and structures in those areas that concerned Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that section 9 (2) (a) can be interpreted to mean that there is a suspensive effect pending appeal.  When section 9 was drafted an appeal procedure under section 22 was not envisaged.  That is of some concern. Perhaps the wording of section 9 (2)(a) should be tightened by the inclusion of new words which would make it clear that there is a suspensive effect.  That could be done on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I am not particularly hung up on the wording of my amendment regarding a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than seven years standing.  The Minister of State's arguments are valid. However, the point made by Senator O'Toole, that it should not be a person from the Department, is equally valid. The amendment does not rule out such a possibility.  It would not be appropriate if somebody working in the aliens' section of the Department of Justice and who had that amount of experience was appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference is to seven years experience as a practising barrister or solicitor.  I am not aware of anybody in the Department of Justice who has seven years practising experience. The effect of the Senator's amendment is to deem when that practising experience must occur and my point is that such wording is unduly restrictive.  A practising barrister or solicitor might go to work with a NGO and be appointed a judge or become an academic.  That person then ceases to practise in the formal sense but has the necessary qualification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree and do not have a problem in that regard.  However, the Minister must accept that frequently the State advertises for barristers and solicitors of seven or more years standing to join the public service.  One could have somebody who was recruited to the Department of Justice, who had seven years relevant experience and who was still employed by the Civil Service in the Department, being appointed to hear the appeal.  If the Minister of State agrees that she would not want that to happen, she should return on Report Stage with an amendment to exclude that possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no positions in the Department of Justice which require seven years practising experience.  There are such positions within the public service, for example, in the Legal Aid Board, where people who practise as lawyers are required.  I do not know if the Senator intends that they, or somebody who has worked in the Office of the Attorney General, should be excluded.  The words mean what they say.  The intention is to provide for the appointment of somebody who has relevant practising experience as a barrister or a solicitor.  However, the wording does not confine the appointment to currently practising barristers or solicitors because a range of people might be available to offer their services in this regard whom it would be wrong to exclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister of State's point that section 9 has a suspensive effect.  It can only mean that section 22 cannot be brought to its conclusion while there is an appeal procedure.  It is clear that the person cannot be removed from the country. Senator Mulcahy has conceded the point with regard to his amendment to the Government's amendment and I agree with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, a number of Members have raised another point.  If the person happens to work in the Department of Justice, or in any Department, and if that <Col N="1464" /> person was required to find for an appeal against a ministerial decision, such a decision could put a career at risk.  It would be utterly inappropriate if that should happen.  However, there is a saver, which is why I will not push the point.  If the wrong person were appointed and if that person had an interest in the decision going one way or another, the decision could be appealed in court.  The law is strong enough to sustain that.  If an inappropriate person were appointed, the appointment could be challenged and I am confident that would happen.  It would be a stupid Minister who would make a wrong decision in that regard.</P>
    <P>Anything can be done by means of an order under this section.  Section 22(1) refers to &ldquo;orders under the section&rdquo; while section 22(2) refers to &ldquo;an order under the section&rdquo;.  It appears that section 22(2) refers to an order which would cover any and all aspects of paragraphs (a) to (i).  I am not sure that this can be done in practical terms or that one order could deal with all that is required under paragraphs (a) to (i) and subsection (3) which states that:</P>
    <P> An order under this section may make provision for such consequential, incidental, ancillary and supplementary matters as the Minister considers necessary or expedient.</P>
    <P>It is highly unlikely that an order could deal with these provisions and also include an appeal procedure.  An order for an appeal procedure would only be required when a person indicated that they were going to appeal.  Is the Minister of State saying that an appeal procedure would be determined by the issue of the first order?  In such a case the order would probably be issued without the full facts being available or on the basis of expecting a decision to go one way or another.  There is confusion between section 22(1) which states that &ldquo;The Minister may make such orders as appear to him or her to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of giving effect to the Dublin Convention&rdquo;, <Col N="1465" /> and the reference to &ldquo;an order&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interests of being helpful, perhaps an equivalent wording for &ldquo;an order&rdquo; would be &ldquo;a regulation&rdquo;. These are not orders against individuals, they are the regulations under which the Dublin Convention would be enforced or arranged.  Subsection (1) refers to the Minister making &ldquo;such orders as appear necessary&rdquo;, in other words, there may be one or more orders or regulations. Perhaps the Senator is confusing this with the order that might be made against an individual in relation to the hearing of his or her case.  This section refers to the regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, I misinterpreted the provisions of the section. I must confess, however, that I am not sure of the difference between a statutory order and a regulation; I will go to the trouble of discovering what is that difference.  The implementation of statutory orders and regulations is clearly covered by many pieces of legislation which I have taken the trouble to read, and I must admit they are confusing. Is the Minister of State stating that when the legislation comes into operation the Minister of the day would introduce a standing order?  That is news to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of the day will make the regulations and statutory instruments which will set out how the section is to operate.  That must be subject to the overall provisions of the Bill, including the appeal process which is being inserted by amendment No. 39e. That will be the normal process in relation to aspects of this particular Bill &mdash; for example, making an application, the format of the forms which must be used and all matters for which statutory instruments and regulations are required.  I apologise that I am not a lawyer but these are the working orders or regulations.  They are not orders made in favour of or against individual asylum seekers.</P>

If she is correct, the question of having any discretion about whether a general order covering the operation of this Bill should or should not include an appeals procedure does not arise.  It must include an appeals procedure.  If we are putting together a general regulation &mdash; I may not be using that word in the context of its proper legislative meaning &mdash; and there are a series of standing orders for the operation of this section to deal with cases, that order or regulation must include an appeal procedure.  The question relating to &ldquo;The Minister may&rdquo; does not arise and we return to a harder line in the original point.</P>

      <P>Senators made the point that they wanted the appeal procedure to be included not in the regulations attaching to the Bill but in the Bill itself. We are doing that and I assume that is why Senators welcomed it.  The appeal procedure is now included in the Bill whereas previously I undertook that it would be in the orders.  It is now stronger because it is in the main Statute rather than in a subsidiary regulation. Earlier I gave a specific under-taking in relation to the appeals procedure.</P>

    <P>Various reasons for this are provided in subsection (2) (a) which uses the terms &ldquo;specify the circumstances&rdquo;, &ldquo;shall be examined in the State&rdquo;, &ldquo;shall be transferred&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall be accepted for examination&rdquo;.  Subsection (2)(b) states that an order under section 22 may &ldquo;specify that person who shall be responsible for determining the matters referred to in paragraph (a),&rdquo;.  In that instance, there is no reference to the <Col N="1467" /> fact that a person must have served for seven years as a practising solicitor or barrister.  That subsection is a very relevant part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 39e does not specify whether the officer involved should be a person in the Department, the Minister or someone else.  Subsection (b) of the amendment states:</P>

      <P>If the Senator reads the wording of amendment No. 39e, he will see we are talking about two people. The amendment states, first, the Minister shall appoint one of his or her officers to determine the matters referred to subsection (2) (a) and, second, the Minister shall appoint a person with the requisite legal qualifications to decide appeals.  We are meeting the concerns previously expressed by Senators that the procedures in relation to the Dublin Convention were not incorporated in legislation and were a matter for regulations only.  Bearing in mind the principles of natural justice, to which the actions of any Minister are subject, one could argue this would have been ultimately decided by the courts. However, on the basis of what Senators said in their earlier contributions, we are providing for a determination mechanism followed by an appeals mechanism. That was put to me in previous comments in this House.</P>

      <P>There is no indication in the Bill it has to be someone of long-standing legal qualification.  The amendment states the Minister shall appoint someone to determine the matters. However, it is only after the determination of these matters that the question of seven years' experience arises.  Why should somebody with seven years' experience be brought in afterwards when the person who made the decision does not, according to the Minister of State, have to have seven years' experience? I have to wait seven years whether I am a genius or fool.  Why should the person who initially determines the matters not have to have seven years' experience?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider it necessary. I consider it appropriate for an official in the Department &mdash; probably at principal officer level &mdash; to examine the application and make an initial determination on it.</P>

      <P>Why should this official of the Department who will determine a legal situation not have to have four or five years' experience or be qualified as a solicitor or barrister?  A person appointed as a Circuit Court judge has to have experience.  The Minister of State's amendment states &ldquo;The Minister shall appoint one of his or her officers to determine the matters referred to in subsection (2)(a)&rdquo;.  Where is this person to come from?  They are just an official of the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">

      <P>I would hesitate to refer to civil servants as just officials.  Civil servants at principal officer rank, for example, have considerable experience and expertise.  Perhaps this is particular to Fianna Fáil, particularly the Senator's colleague, but there is an excessive desire to turn everything relating to the asylum process into a major court of law which is entirely an appropriate matter for solicitors and barristers at, I presume, considerable cost to the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The asylum process is about someone who comes here explaining why under <Col N="1470" /> the Geneva Convention they qualify as having a well-grounded fear of persecution. The forum is not a court of law.  It is a question of a person making an application and giving information to satisfy the person or persons hearing the application they qualify for refugee status under the Geneva Convention.  It is not meant to be an adversarial court of law structure.  If it becomes that it will be at considerable cost to the taxpayer, because there will be another bonanza for lawyers with no particular consequent benefit for the asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>The UNHCR has stressed that the Geneva Convention is for people who meet the terms of the convention.  Other people may seek to stay in Ireland to better their situation or for work opportunities. That is another area which is not dealt with in this legislation as it deals strictly with the Geneva Convention. Each stage of this process is not meant to be a court of law.  However, to provide Senators with the appropriate assurance that asylum applicants will get a suitably considered hearing of their appeal, we are providing at the appeal stage in relation to the Dublin Convention for an appropriately qualified legal person.  The initial determination is to be made by a senior official.  Senior civil servants act in cognisance of the law and I am not aware of cases where they abused their powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is not as the Minister of State said.  Asylum seekers arrive under various programmes. We are talking here about non programme refugees who arrive here and it has to be determined whether they are legitimate asylum seekers.  The Minister of State introduced the question of whether they want to work or are economic asylum seekers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> I am not criticising civil servants, but some of them do not understand the attitude of those seeking asylum.  There are politicians who do not understand why people want to live in another country.  We have a little problem here. The Minister of State should not suggest that just because someone is a civil servant they know the attitude of asylum seekers.  An officer might have experience of Third World asylum seekers and be the best person in the world.  Why then appoint someone who has to have seven years' experience as a solicitor or barrister to decide appeals?</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher has never had an asylum seeker coming into her in Monaghan and she has seven years experience as a lawyer.  Seven years experience does not give anyone the right to determine such matters.  There are solicitors in this country who, even though they have seven years experience, may never have dealt with asylum seekers. People with two years experience who have dealt with asylum seekers might be brilliant as the officer.  There are solicitors and barristers in this country who have never seen an asylum seeker.  If the terms &ldquo;the Minister shall appoint a person to consider and decide appeals&rdquo; and &ldquo;seven years&rdquo; were left out, we might get away from all the hassle.  The Minister of State will do what she wants anyway.  She will appoint the person and if they can do the job, let them do it. The provision for seven years is a load of rubbish.  Why not four, six, eight, or ten years?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I will attempt to shed some light on this matter, especially for Senator Lanigan.  The proposed Government amendment No. 39e states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) (a) The Minister shall appoint one of his or her officers to determine the matters referred to in subsection (2) (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment determines the matters referred to in subsection (2) (a), which is the application of the Dublin Convention, not the application for asylum. <Col N="1472" /> The Dublin Convention deals solely with what country will deal with the actual application.  It is this alone which is being determined by the officer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Which is us or the place they come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a judicial decision.  For that reason, an officer within the Department of Justice is perfectly capable of making that decision. It is an administrative, not a judicial, decision.  The Minister has introduced the appeal procedure in amendment No. 39a.  I welcome this provision, which we sought from previous discussions.  In amendment No. 39e, under subsection (4) (b), the Minister provides that the person involved in the appeals procedure would have judicial experience. This is in order to determine an appeal from the decision of the officer.  Senator Mulcahy is wrong to put forward the amendment to amendment No. 39e as it excludes people eligible to hold the position of determining that particular matter of appeal.  Any barrister or solicitor with seven years experience, not necessarily currently practising, would be perfectly capable of holding, and entitled to, that position.  The Minister's amendment in this particular area is perfectly correct.  I hope it is clear that the Minister of State appointing one of her officers to determine the matter in relation only to the Dublin Convention is legitimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I signalled to the Chair's predecessor so long ago that if I do not get in now I will have forgotten what I was going to say.  I may have forgotten it already because the debate has moved on, or sideways, since whatever we were discussing at that stage.  I agree with the Minister's reading of section 9 (2) (a), if any of us can remember what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Senator O'Toole's concerns about page 24 and the various subsections of section 22.  Even the Minister's amendment lodges under the general <Col N="1473" /> permission of that three letter word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, although I know there will be regulations.  One should consider the possibility of a malign scenario in the area of EU refugee legislation in ten or twenty year's time.  I am not suggesting this will happen and one hopes it will not.  There cannot be complete confidence there will not be a movement in an illiberal direction in either public opinion or legislation.  In such a case I would not want our Ministers, who may be unsympathetic to some of the provisions of this Bill, to interpret it illiberally. Ministers who may be sympathetic to the Bill should not find themselves in a position where they can be pressurised to co-ordinate with EU interpretations which would not be in accordance with ours.  I would like this to be kept in mind in relation to the drafting of the Bill.  This is why I am still uneasy about the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in amendment No. 39a.  I would prefer Senator O'Toole's formulation or the Minister's alternative, if she thinks there is one which would be more effective.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State that Senator Mulcahy's amendment to amendment No. 39e should not be phrased in a way that excludes qualified people who are not currently practising barristers of seven years standing.  The position between the Minister for State and Senator Mulcahy refers specifically to whether current civil servants should be eligible.  I agree with the Minister for State that there are qualified people for the position other than currently practising barristers of seven years standing. The Minister of State has not shown her hand on the issue of whether she accepts it should not be a current civil servant.  If the Minister of State accepts that, it will be a simple matter on Report Stage to put in a few words to that effect.  If the Minister does not accept that, the core of the difference between us should be made clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister of State regarding the situation of practising barristers and solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> However, Senator Lee has a point when he says we should be clear about whether the position could be filled by another departmental official.  I sympathise with Senator Lanigan in relation to having someone with experience as a barrister or solicitor in the seeking of asylum and refugee status within the courts.  These people are pretty rare at the moment and it might be extremely difficult to get someone to take a position like that.  People who have experience in this area are certainly not precluded from what the Minister has provided for in the amendment.  I hope this will be taken into consideration when a person is being appointed.  Common sense generally applies to appointments and I would hope that anyone who had experience in the area of asylum seeking would be in a better position than someone who did not.  It would be very useful to whoever was trying to adjudicate these appeals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the rationale of the Minister of State's comments and I do not think this is a controversial matter.  The Minister of State could do us all a favour if she indicated on Report Stage that the person hearing the appeal would not be an officer of either the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  That is all we want.  I do not want to exclude every civil servant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point has been eloquently made by Senator Lee.  My concern is that there is no duplication of roles and that the person who would hear the appeal would not be an officer of the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The way Senator Lee described the situation is very apt &mdash; the Minister of State has not shown her hand.  She now seems to want to include the possibility that the person who hears the appeal could be someone from her Department.  If that is not the case, it would take about seven words <Col N="1475" /> to put down an amendment on Report Stage.  Is there a problem?  Is there such a backlog in the Attorney General's office that they cannot draft a simple amendment, or is the Minister of State so proud that she will not allow us to put down a simple amendment.  What is the problem?</P>

      <P>I can only reiterate that these provisions relate to the Dublin Convention and the Dublin Convention only.  I assume that the Senator will accept the undertaking I have already given and outlined here on several occasions that there is no such person in the employment of the Department of Justice who holds these qualifications.  It would be a foolhardy Minister, where the Bill has established for the purposes of the Dublin Convention an appeals mechanism, who would seek to undermine that mechanism by a dubious quality in terms of the appointment.  It does not make any sense because we are setting out something here which is to meet the concerns expressed by the Senators.  I reiterate that this section deals with the Dublin Convention only.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention a further matter which arose as a consequence of the reexamination of these provisions in the Bill to provide specifically for an appeal mechanism under the Dublin Convention. It may happen that some persons who are advised that their applications are to be transferred to another state may lodge an appeal against the decision and then disappear in an effort to frustrate their possible removal.  Such an action would be a complete abuse of the asylum process.  Where there is a <Col N="1477" /> reasonable suspicion that such would be the case it is proper that such a person be detainable and this should be a ground for detention under section 9.  I will be bringing forward a suitable amendment on Report Stage.  In the meantime I ask Senators to support my proposed amendments.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;was to refer to the Dublin Convention.  Its strongest statement in this regard is in the preamble which states:</P>
      <P> [The members states] DETERMINED, in keeping with their common humanitarian tradition, to guarantee adequate protection to refugees in accordance with the terms of the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951, as amended by the New York Protocol of... 1967.</P>
      <P>That is a guarantee given by EU member states that they will comply with their obligations under the Geneva Convention.  However, it is the opinion of the UN that many countries which signed the convention do not take that guarantee seriously.  That is why my amendment is essential.</P>
      <P>The preamble also states:</P>
      <P>[The member states] DESIRING to continue the dialogue with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in order to achieve the above objectives;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>DETERMINED to co-operate closely in the application of this Convention through various means, including exchanges of information, <Col N="1482" /> HAVE DECIDED TO CONCLUDE THIS CONVENTION AND TO THIS END HAVE DESIGNATED AS THEIR PLENIPO-TENTIARIES:</P>
    <P>Article 1, subsection 1 (b) states:</P>
    <P> Application for asylum means: a request whereby an alien seeks from a Member State protection under the Geneva Convention by claiming refugee status within the meaning of Article 1 of the Geneva Convention....</P>
    <P>All the above is simply a restatement of obligations under the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>Article 2 states:</P>
    <P> The Member States reaffirm their obligations under the Geneva Convention, as amended by the New York Protocol, with no geographical restriction of the scope of these instruments, and their commitment to co-operating with the services of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in applying these instruments.</P>
    <P>That is all very well; it is laudable and we can all agree with it.  However, it does not give a guarantee to asylum seekers that their rights under the Geneva Convention will be given priority.  I am amazed the Minister of State expresses opposition to an amendment which would have the effect of doing that which she says she supports.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State says the supports the proposition that the Geneva Convention is superior and antecedent to the Dublin Convention.  She has said the Dublin Convention is subordinate to the Geneva Convention.  If we are to believe her, why does she object to the simple and plain formulation of words in the amendment?  If the Minister is going to oppose the amendment we have to ask why.  She may say the amendment is not needed; that it is superfluous because the point is obvious from the text.  However, I have challenged her to give one example from the <Col N="1483" /> Dublin Convention or from the Bill which specifically states that the Dublin Convention is subordinate to the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should accept the amendment because if there is any doubt or conflict and somebody is sent back to a dangerous third country, it is not the Minister of State or any Member of the House who will pay the price. The person who has come to this country via a third country in the EU and who is sent back to another country may be oppressed, tortured or murdered. The onus is on the Minister of State to say why this amendment should not be accepted.  This is a matter of conscience and I do not say that lightly.</P>

      <P>The letter of 3 March 1994 states:</P>
      <P> The UNHCR's concerns relate to the case of asylum applicants who have not come to Greece directly from their country of origin.  The asylum procedure and practice in Greece are still in a transitional phase since it, until recently, considered itself to be a transit country rather than a country of permanent asylum.  [This is a member state of the EU.]  A second concern relates to Greek law and practice concerning removal to third countries.</P>
      <P>This is clear concern expressed by the UN about a fellow EU member state in relation to this matter.  Amnesty International issued a paper in 1992 entitled &ldquo;Europe: Harmonisation of Asylum Policy &mdash; Amnesty International EC Project&rdquo;.  I can make this paper available to the Minister if she does not already have it.  The paper states:</P>
      <P> The arrangements set out in the Dublin Convention could in practice mean that a person seeking asylum in a member state may be compelled to lodge his or her application in a country whose procedures lack essential safeguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that, for example, certain EU member states do not have suspensive effect in their official procedures? Is she aware that if someone is sent back to one of those convention countries and goes into an appeal procedure that does not have suspensive effect, that person may be sent back to a country where he or she will be tortured <Col N="1485" /> or murdered?  I may not have a record similar to the Minister's on this matter, but what I seek to achieve in my public life is absolute consistency.</P>

The UN Convention on the Protection of Refugees is a high and solemn document which was debated internationally and in this House.  It is one of the most important international treaties.  As far as I know, the Dublin Convention has never been debated in this House, other than in the debate on this Bill.</P>

      <P>I presume the Minister will tell Amnesty International either that its opinion is wrong or that it need have no concern.  However, under this Bill as drafted the Minister cannot &mdash; and, if she opposes my amendment, will <Col N="1486" /> not &mdash; exclude the possibility that persons will be returned to countries in Europe which have signed the Dublin Convention which will send people to their demise.  The Amnesty paper also states:</P>
      <P> In Finland, an asylum seeker whose case is considered to be manifestly unfounded is subject to an accelerated procedure and is interviewed in person only by the police while the actual decision is made by the Ministry of the Interior in consultation with the Ombudsman for Aliens in the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. The final decision is made by way of an automatic review by the chair of the asylum appeals board in the Ministry of Justice but this review is cursory and done without personal interview with the asylum seeker.  There is no possibility of appeal against a decision.  An asylum seeker whose application has been rejected in this procedure may appeal against expulsion or deportation, but in the case of such asylum seekers who have been in the country less than three months who are issued with an expulsion order, such an appeal has no suspensive effect on the expulsion.  [Norway is not a member of the convention but the Amnesty document indicates that some of our European partners feel they have obligations under it.]  In Norway an appeal against a decision is possible but it does not have suspensive effect.</P>
      <P>This is overwhelming evidence that there is a problem.  The Minister will do her best to sweep it under the carpet but my amendment gives her an opportunity to deal with it.</P>
      <P>The UNHCR has provided statistics for cases in the UK.  It lists where there were grounds for cases being referred back to the Secretary of State, where the third country was an EU member state &mdash; Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.</P>

      <P>The document details adjudicator decisions in third country cases between September 1994 and December 1995.  In 68 cases the adjudicator was not satisfied that procedures in the third country were adequate for the appellant to be returned and an asylum claim considered.  In 15 cases the adjudicator based a decision on a statement of an official in a third country and/or specific inquiries to a third country regarding safety.  The following category is interesting.  In 27 cases the adjudicator based a decision on the possibility of an appellant being returned to unsafe &ldquo;fourth countries&rdquo; by the authorities in the third country.</P>
      <P>We can see experience, not a few hundred miles from here, has led to concern at the very highest authority of those dealing with asylum cases that people may be sent back to unsafe countries.

      <P> The cornerstone of refugee protection, codified in Article 33 of the 1951 Geneva Convention prohibits the return in any manner whatsoever of a refugee to the frontiers or territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</P>

      <P>It continues:</P>
      <P> By not ensuring that an asylum seeker can gain access to the territory and to a fair refugee determination procedure in the receiving country, sending States risk, directly or indirectly, violating the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i> and thereby abrogating a fundamental principle recognised in customary international law as applying to all States, and not merely those signatory to the 1951 Geneva Convention and the 1967 New York Protocolumn</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware that all of the agencies involved in this area are concerned that the Dublin Convention will <Col N="1492" /> have the effect of sending people back to countries where they will not be safe.</P>
    <P>Lest I am not believed, I would like to quote some case histories.  This is an extract from <i>First Safe Country</i>, a booklet compiled by ECRE, the same organisation from which I just quoted.  Case history No. 7 refers to a Togolese national who travelled from Toga to Belgium and on to Germany.  His date of arrival was 5 July 1994,</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>What does that have to do with the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>He was removed from Germany to Belgium and from Belgium to Togo and the date of removal was 5 July 1994.  The conclusion reads &ldquo;Returned to country of origin, now in hiding in Benin.&rdquo;  The document continues:</P>
      <P> A Togolese national left Togo on 4 July and claimed asylum at Munich Airport in Germany on 5 July.</P>
      <P>The German border police refused to entertain his claim on third country grounds as the asylum seeker had previously spent a few hours in transit at Brussels airport.</P>
      <P>This is very relevant because one of the rules under the Dublin Convention is that where a person has travelled through a convention country to their ultimate country of asylum application, they will, under the Dublin Convention, be sent back to the first European country they entered and it is in that country that their asylum application will be considered.  The case history continues:</P>
      <P> Despite having a relative in Germany he was subsequently returned to Belgium where he applied for asylum on 5/6 July 1994.</P>
      <P>His application for asylum was refused on the grounds that his claim had previously been examined in Germany, combined with the evaluation that the asylum seeker had left Togo &ldquo;for economic reasons&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An expulsion order issued by the Belgian authorities on 29 July stipulated <Col N="1493" /> that the asylum seeker should be removed to his country of origin immediately.</P>
    <P>According to a statement by a cousin of the asylum seeker, who is resident in Lome, the asylum seeker, upon his arrival in Togo, fled to Benin where he is now in hiding.</P>
    <P>I have details of a similar case which relates to somebody who came from Algeria through Belgium into Denmark. The last line reads: &ldquo;After intervention by his relatives in Algeria, the applicant was released two days later and is now in hiding in Algeria.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister failed to provide one whiff of evidence that there is any wording in the Dublin Convention which says it is subordinate to the Geneva Convention. I can only anticipate that she will deal with the wording of the Dublin Convention and the rules contained in it.  Having read it, I believe there are essentially five different rules or criteria under which persons subject to it will be examined.  When its rules are examined &mdash; this is completely pertinent to my amendment &mdash; it is easy to see not only that there is a possible conflict between it and the Geneva Convention but that in certain cases the exercise of the former will have the effect of making it superior to the latter.</P>
    <P>Article 4 of the Dublin Convention states that:</P>
    <P> Where the applicant for asylum has a member of his family who has been recognised as having refugee status within the meaning of the Geneva Convention, as amended by the New York Protocol, in a Member State and is legally resident there, that State shall be responsible for examining the application, provided that the persons concerned so desire.</P>
    <P>The family member in question may not be other than the spouse of the applicant for asylum or his or her unmarried child who is a minor of under eighteen years, or his or her father or mother where the applicant for asylum is himself or herself an <Col N="1494" /> unmarried child who is a minor of under eighteen years.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;provided that the persons concerned so desire&rdquo; would be the only safeguard which might protect persons from being effectively deported to another Dublin Convention member state where they had a relative who had been processed under the Geneva Convention. However, from the earlier examples I gave it is obvious that under this Bill, if the Minister decides, the person loses on appeal and is sent back to Greece where a relative already has the protection of the Geneva Convention, that person might not get a proper hearing in Greece and may end up being transferred to an unsafe third country.</P>
    <P>Article 5 of the Dublin Convention states that:</P>
    <P> Where the applicant for asylum is in possession of a valid residence permit, the Member State which issued the permit shall be responsible for examining the application for asylum.</P>
    <P>If a person was temporarily in one of the countries which signed the convention but do not operate correct procedures with regard to refugee applications and that person obtains a residence permit, he or she could be transported from Ireland back to that country and, as per the examples I have already given, be deported to an unsafe country.</P>
    <P>Article 6 is even more dangerous and has no mirror or cognisant part in the Geneva Convention.  It states that:</P>
    <P> When it can be proved that an applicant for asylum has irregularly crossed the border into a Member State by land, sea or air, having come from a non-member State of the European Communities, the Member State thus entered shall be responsible for examining the application for asylum.</P>
    <P>If somebody from Hungary irregularly crosses the border into Greece and then comes to Ireland and the Minister returns that person to Greece&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Article 7 of the Dublin Convention states that:</P>
      <P> The responsibility for examining an application for asylum shall be incumbent upon the Member State responsible for controlling the entry of the alien into the territory of the Member States, except where, after legally entering a Member State in which the need for him or her to have a visa is waived, the alien lodges his or her application for asylum in another Member State in which the need for him or her to have a visa for entry into the territory is also waived.  In this case, the latter State shall be responsible for examining the application for asylum.</P>
      <P>I will not lengthen the proceedings by giving specific examples of where this could apply.  Suffice it to say that there is enough scope here for persons to be sent back to a Dublin Convention member state in circumstances where they will not be able to properly assert their rights under the Geneva Convention.</P>
      <P>Article 8 states that:</P>
      <P> Where no Member State responsible for examining the application for asylum can be designated on the basis of the other criteria listed in this Convention, the first Member State with which the application for asylum is lodged shall be responsible for examining it.</P>
      <P>This is a good provision because it makes clear that if the first country in which an application is lodged is Ireland, then it is only Ireland which will examine it.  The Dublin Convention was discussed and debated considerably on Committee Stage of this Bill in the Dáil. I await with great interest what the Minister will say.  Earlier she said she is not well versed in legal matters.  I hope she will not exclude the possibility that, unfortunately, there will be court cases on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> It is the object, role and duty of legislators to make legislation clear, forthright and understandable.  The Minister may say this will never be a problem, but if this is the case why should she object to the amendment?  Of all the issues not just in this Bill but which have been debated in this House for a long time, the issue of whether the Dublin Convention is subordinate to or takes precedence over the Geneva Convention is one of the most significant human rights issues this House will debate for a long time.  I hope the Minister will rise to the challenge of accepting these amendments or saying reasonably why they should not be accepted.  The onus is on her.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is similar to that of Senator Mulcahy's.  Like the Minister, I am not a lawyer, and Senator Mulcahy has an advantage there. However, I have consulted international experts on refugee law.  The information I have been given is that the Geneva Convention is an international treaty subscribed to and ratified by more than 100 countries.  The Dublin Convention is a regional convention originally subscribed to by 12 countries, and now by 15.  It is inferior to the international Geneva Convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Article II of the Dublin Convention says that &ldquo;The member states reaffirm their obligations under the Geneva Convention as amended by the New York Protocol&rdquo;.  That means those who framed the Dublin Convention realised that their convention was inferior to the Geneva Convention.</P>
      <P>Before moving my amendment, which is the next to be discussed, I did not have the benefit of this advice but, having discussed it with international refugee lawyers, I have been informed that this is the factual position.  Am I right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Henry in saying that the Dublin Convention is subordinate to the Geneva <Col N="1498" /> Convention.  Many of Senator Mulcahy's arguments concern the setting up of an appeal system which the Minister introduced earlier and with which we agreed.  Senator Mulcahy's speech totally dismantled the Dublin Convention which was organised, developed and introduced by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Ray Burke.  At the time we accepted it as an important progressive document dealing with refugees.</P>
      <P>While I had strong differences with Deputy Burke, he was quite a progressive Minister who did a lot of good.  I cannot accept the dismantling of a document which he brought in during the last Irish Presidency of the EU.  I totally disagree with the way in which the Dublin Convention has been dismantled by Senator Mulcahy.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry has clearly stated that the Geneva Convention, as an international convention, supersedes the Dublin Convention which is a regional one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>As a non lawyer, I accept that the Dublin Convention occurs within the framework of the Geneva Convention and the thinking occurring in it, although I do not know whether it is inferior or subordinate to it.  Having said that, there are some things in the Dublin Convention which would not make me averse to having something included along the lines of the Geneva Convention, as an international convention takes precedence over the Dublin Convention in the event of a possible conflict of interpretation between them.  That would be something along the lines of Senator Henry's and Senator Mulcahy's amendments even accepting the assurances that have been given about international law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are phrases in the Preamble to the Dublin Convention which we have to sign for reasons of common courtesy. They include &ldquo;in keeping with their common humanitarian tradition, to guarantee adequate protection to refugees in accordance with the terms of the Geneva Convention&rdquo;.  In that light, <Col N="1499" /> there could be a very considerable question mark over interpretations of the &ldquo;common humanitarian tradition&rdquo; of certain member states of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Not to linger over words, I am concerned with where we may be going. Earlier I cited the phrase &ldquo;determined to co-operate closely in the application of this Convention through various means&rdquo;.  The Minister said we had options and I accept that in principle but we all know that as things develop, particularly in a move towards an ever closer Union, pressures can be exerted that one might prefer not to happen.</P>
    <P>Article 16.2 of the Dublin Convention says that:</P>
    <P> If it proves necessary to amend this Convention [&ldquo;necessary&rdquo; is a loose word.  Who decides what is necessary, when and for what reasons?] pursuant to the achievement of the objectives set out in Article 8a of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community [I hope the Minister's memory is better than mine about what Article 8a says] such achievement being linked in particular to the establishment of a harmonised asylum and a common visa policy...</P>
    <P>I would wish us to enter any such discussions from the strongest possible base in terms of the principles that all of us in this House wish to see observed in terms of our own refugee and asylum law.  I do not want to go through Articles 17 and 18 in detail but it is clear that the signatories to the Dublin Convention envisaged circumstances where it might need to be suspended, maybe for what at the time would seem to them to be good reasons and maybe even to us.  But presumably the suspension would include a suspension of phrases referring to the Geneva Convention in that context.</P>
    <P>Not being a lawyer and realising that arguments can be presented both ways, <Col N="1500" /> there is an open ended potential for the Dublin Convention which it behoves us to take seriously even if it seems hypothetical at this stage.  Even if we all, except Senator Mulcahy, agree that it seems to be self-evident at this stage, I would not be averse to having specific phrases included to make our understanding of the relationship between the two conventions crystal clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Relating directly to Senator Lee's point, there is a difficulty there because in terms of international law it would not be within our power to determine the balance between the Geneva Convention and the Dublin Convention.  It would not be for us to decide; it is a matter of international law.  While I would like the Minister to have that type of power, it is not within her authority to put that forward.</P>
      <P>I am aggrieved that while the priority is to pass legislation that would protect refugees, at this rate we will not achieve that.  I am also concerned that we have been subjected to Senator Mulcahy waxing eloquent on his ego trip or legal trip when a bit of intelligence and information would have sufficed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that Senator Henry has clarified the matter in terms of which would take precedence. It is clear that where there is a conflict the Geneva Convention will prevail.  The Geneva Convention deals in a comprehensive way with all matters relating to refugees.  It must be accepted that the Dublin Convention relates only to the procedural matters within its own membership in the European states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the UNHCR felt many of the documents, read word for word by Senator Mulcahy, were that important, I am amazed it did not send them to any other Member of the House to enlighten us on the debate.  Be that as it <Col N="1501" /> may, it is clear that the documents quoted by Senator Mulcahy refer to the need for an appeal which has been introduced by the Government in this debate.</P>
    <P>The other matter of concern with regard to the possibility of people finding themselves in non-friendly states is comprehensively dealt with in section 5 (1) which requires that:</P>
    <P> A person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where, in the opinion of the Minister, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</P>
    <P>That deals with many of the concerns that were raised.</P>
    <P>We have wasted much time arguing about precedent.  The precedent of the Geneva Convention <i>versus</i> the Dublin Convention is clear; the latter is simply an administrative and procedural convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lee mentioned the common humanitarian tradition.  If that was to apply to the British, for example, I do not know what we would do because they have continually indulged in human rights abuses against the nationalist population of the Six Counties and have been brought before the European Court of Human Rights and found guilty more than any other state.  I would like to see something more specific included in the legislation. Senator Mulcahy is not doing this for a reason other than to bring about good law.  I was surprised Senator Gallagher said he was lacking in intelligence, which is obviously not the case.</P>

Much has been made of the Dublin Convention <i>versus</i> the Geneva Convention.  The Dublin Convention &ldquo;means the Convention determining the state responsible for examining application for asylum lodged in one of the Member States of the European Communities&rdquo;.  It would hardly refer the case of an asylum seeker unless that state was subject to the terms of the Geneva Convention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The nub of this amendment is to ensure that asylum seekers get justice.  As Senator Lee said, there are differing levels of what are considered humanitarian issues even in the European Union.  That is why it is important that there is an appeal procedure. The Minister promised that not only would there be an appeal but that there will be a sustained period before the person can be deported and that they can have counsel.  Senator Mulcahy may have consulted greater experts on international and refugee law than I, but those I consulted told me that the international conventions supersede regional conventions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to understand that the Dublin Convention is essentially a set of procedural or technical rules as opposed the development of asylum philosophy or thinking.  Its overall object is therefore limited and it is not intended to expand on the Geneva Convention.  The Convention's starting point is that it guarantees the commitment of member states to honour their obligations under the Geneva Convention and the New York Protocol and to give effective protection to refugees in accordance with the Geneva Convention. It specifically provides for this in the Preamble and in Article 2.  It is clear from the texts of the two conventions &mdash; in particular, the Dublin Convention &mdash; that it is subservient to the 1951 Geneva Convention, the point Senator Gallagher made.  Obviously, that would be a matter for international law to determine but we are offering that as our opinion.  I cannot determine international law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to the best international advice which she received, presumably from Trinity College.  I sought the advice of the Attorney General in this matter and he confirmed my opinion.  In addition, he pointed out that the amendments are inappropriate as neither Convention is being transposed directly into Irish law and that such a provision would have to be seen as a reservation to the Dublin Convention, which is not possible as we already signed the Convention.  It was signed by no less an authority than the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Ray Burke, who was fully aware of the humanitarian, legal and other implications.  The <Col N="1504" /> original form of this Bill was brought before the House by no less a person than the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.</P>
    <P>In Senator Mulcahy's long voyage around the amendment, if I may classify it as such, serious aspersions were cast on the people who led us into the Dublin Convention.  Grave doubts were cast on the bone fides of two Ministers from his party.  While it is not my job or role to defend those people, they do not pose a threat to humanitarian society and solidarity as we understand it.</P>
    <P>I would like to address the general point raised, which perhaps Senator Mulcahy sought to address but did not get to it in his voyage.  There are concerns in relation to asylum practices in a number of EU member states.  We must remember this Bill is probably the most liberal legislation brought before any European Parliament and it is widely acknowledged as such.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be reluctant &mdash; I say this in a considered way &mdash; to cast stones at the traditions of our European partners in relation to asylum matters. Many of the partners referred to have given asylum to hundreds of thousands of people in extraordinarily difficult situations. As recently as the conflict in former Yugoslavia, a region of Germany had 400,000 asylum seekers in one year.  However, that is not to say we may not find fault with German asylum procedures, but I would be reluctant to cast doubts on the humanitarian traditions of our European partners when we have produced a Bill at such a late date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Had the Senator gone further in relation to the UNHCR's comments on different countries of the European Union he would have found that the primary comment in relation to Ireland was that we had no legislation, not that it was defective.  We only had the procedures <Col N="1505" /> we discussed earlier.  While the Senator and his party may find flaws and strenuously criticise other European Union countries, the former Ministers for Justice, Deputy Burke and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, did not seek to do so as recently as a year and a half ago.</P>
    <P>If Senator Mulcahy wants to criticise European asylum developments, he is talking about changing the Convention in the future by amendment or Protocol by putting forward a case, having first put in place our own asylum legislation. I am prepared to say to our European partners that there are areas of concern to us in relation to their asylum legislation and that we may seek to amend or to add amendments or Protocols to the Dublin Convention.  However, we are talking primarily about the necessity for our own legislation as an independent State.</P>
    <P>As it was Members of the Senator's party who are essentially responsible for the genesis of this Bill and who were motivated by strong and sound humanitarian impulses, the kind of aspersions he has cast on this area are, to say the least, unfortunate in terms of the consequences for his party.  That is not to say that all is right with European asylum provisions.  This convention seeks only to regulate the area of refugees &ldquo;in orbit&rdquo; and to provide the country which will make the hearing.  We can opt into the Dublin Convention for specific cases if we so choose.</P>
    <P>I would be prepared, perhaps at another time, to criticise at some length the asylum provisions of certain European countries; but I would do so in the knowledge that our record in terms of the numbers we have taken does not allow us to point the finger at other European countries in a totally irresponsible way.  The magnitude of what they have done up to recent times is out of all proportion to the burden we are now entering.  It is a significant burden <Col N="1506" /> for the Irish taxpayer.  We have taken in more than 400 asylum seekers this year, all of whom received full social welfare provisions etc.</P>
    <P>I must ask myself, having listened at great length to the Senator's contributions, if it is his intention to filibuster this Bill to the point where we do not have one?  We would then be back to being at the bottom of the pile with no legislation at all.  I do not think that is the intention of the Senator's party nor was it that of the ex-Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, when she previously introduced the first version of this Bill.</P>

I did not put down an amendment calling for the cancellation of the Dublin Convention or for its deletion from the Bill.  I am prepared to accept the Minister's statements on it being a procedural matter.  My only concern is that if there is a conflict between the two, the Geneva Convention should prevail.  That is all my amendment says.</P>
      <P>The Minister said I was casting aspersions on various countries which had carried a far bigger burden in this area than Ireland.  I was not; I was quoting from reports available to me from United Nations sources.  That was not my opinion.  I am entitled to quote those sources.  The Minister cannot sweep those concerns under the table; they are real.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(11) The Minister shall, when issuing an order under this section, send to the applicant a noticewriting stating that the applicant may appeal to the Appeal Board against the order within 5 days from the sending of the notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(12) Where any notice of appeal is not given to the Appeal Board within the appropriate time limit, it shall nevertheless be treated for all <Col N="1514" /> purposes as having been given within that time limit if the Chair &mdash; person is of the opinion that, by reason of special circumstances, it is just and right for the notice to be so treated.</P>

    <P>(14) The Appeal Board may if necessary extend the time limit so prescribed to enable it fairly to determine the appeal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's amendments have now made it possible for an asylum seeker to appeal against their summary deportation.

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 24 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express the sentiments of myself and Senator Daly about this section.  Section 24 deals with programme refugees and is totally inadequate for their needs.  An earlier section of the Bill gives the Minister the power to revoke a declaration of refugee status.  There does not appear to be a corresponding power with regard to programme refugees.  When we discussed that provision the Minister of State's response was that it was a matter for the Government.  That is not good enough.  This Bill appears to make fish of one and flesh of the other in the context of refugees.  Why will programme refugees not have the same protection as people who obtain asylum on an individual basis pursuant to this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been only three or four Government decisions regarding programme refugees in recent years.  They <Col N="1516" /> applied to the Bosnians, Vietnamese and Hungarians.  We are not dealing with large numbers of people.  Is section 24 all we have to say about programme refugees and their rights?  The section comprises about 16 lines.  Unfortunately my proposed amendments were not properly tabled before today's debate and unless the matters to which they refer are raised in this debate I will be unable to raise them on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>My party's view is that there should be a programme refugee board which would co-ordinate the activities of the Department of Justice, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the non-governmental agencies in connection with the protection and resettlement of programme refugees as registered in the register established and maintained by the Minister for Foreign Affairs under section 24.  We also believe the programme refugee board should consist of people who are knowledgeable and experienced in refugee matters.  We intend to table an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>It appears that if the Government decides to send programme refugees back to their country of origin the decision cannot be challenged under this Bill.  There is no review procedure if the Government decides to return such refugees if circumstances have changed in the original country of oppression &mdash; as is the case, arguably, in parts of Bosnia &mdash; and the reason for the oppression no longer exists.  It is dangerous that the Government has untrammelled power to end the refugee status of programme refugees.</P>
    <P>We have already debated the question of public policy, &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo;, under section 4 and the Minister of State gave a commitment to revert to the House with regard to proposed new wording for that section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's lack of knowledge about refugees and refugee practice in this State is astonishing.  He <Col N="1517" /> has obviously never heard of the Refugee Agency even though the previous Labour-Fianna Fáil Government did. The membership of that agency comprises the type of people the Senator would like to see looking after programme refugees.  Where has the Senator been?  In what part of the world has he been living?  Does he not know about the existence of the Refugee Agency?  Is he not aware of the huge amounts of money that were committed to it by his party when it was in Government with the Labour Party and that was only a few years ago?  Perhaps the Senator is only a recent member of Fianna Fáil but he must have read the newspapers.  I am astonished.</P>
      <P>Large sections of this Bill are not applicable to programme refugees by virtue of the fact that the Government makes a block decision to admit a group of people, such as 500 Bosnians.  These people do not need to use the application procedures because, in conjunction with the UNHCR, the Government decides to admit them.  Playing politics with Bosnian refugees is rather dangerous. I will reiterate what I said earlier.  I speak in good faith and I wish the Senator would respect that.  When this matter was raised previously the Senator's colleague, Senator Daly, accepted and endorsed my response.  I put it on record that, with regard to the Bosnian refugees and the Dayton Peace Accord, the Government was happy to accept that those Bosnians who wished to remain in Ireland were welcome to do so.  We equally accepted that some members of the Bosnian community might wish to return home.  That statement is a matter of record, lest the Senator's careless comments could cause concern to certain people, many of whom have been traumatised by their experience and might not understand the context in which the remarks were made.  I am sure that was not the Senator's intention but refugees are vulnerable people so I reiterate what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1518" /> I also wish to point to the work of not only the current Minister for Social Welfare but that of his predecessor, Deputy Woods.  I was Minister of State for that Department and I and Deputy Woods gave community welfare officers in each area the power to deal with the needs of programme and other refugees. The Senator's remarks are superfluous in the context of the situation and also when we consider the kind of people who are members of the board of the Refugee Agency and the money expended on that agency by the present and previous Governments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is aware that a refugee who is resident in Ireland for a suitable period of time &mdash; any of the NGOs could explain this issue &mdash; has the right to apply for Irish citizenship. People do not remain refugees for their entire lives.  We hope that being a refugee is a transitory position.  If a person arrives in Ireland and obtains refugee <Col N="1519" /> status, it is hoped that they will ultimately become an Irish citizen.  It is a transitory state, although the transition period may be a long one.  Refugees, including Bosnians, are currently in the process of applying for Irish citizenship. Such applications relate to people who have been in this country for more than three years.</P>
      <P>The issue of &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; was debated at great length.  I do not wish to discuss individual cases but questions could arise about the history and background of a person admitted to this country.  Such a person might be involved in certain serious matters and it might be considered inappropriate to give them travel documents for fear that they might escape international tribunals of justice by entering another jurisdiction.  If they were admitted to Ireland as an ordinary asylum seeker or programme refugee and were subsequently the subject of allegations by an international criminal tribunal in relation to their actions in their former country, we might not wish to see them depart this country because we might wish to make them available to that international tribunal.  This is a hypothetical situation because we have not had such cases.  However, that is clearly a case where it might arise.  It has already arisen in a number of European states.</P>

Contrary to the way in which the Minister of State attempted to demean my contribution, I have spoken to refugees and programme refugees.  Many of these people are uncertain as to their status and are unclear about the role, activities <Col N="1520" /> and responsibilities of and the relationship between the Department of Justice and the Refugee Agency.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister of State is aware that many people who are refugees in Ireland under a programme genuinely query their status and the role of the Refugee Agency.</P>
      <P>Returning to the issue of citizenship, the Minister of State is also aware &mdash; I am open to correction in this regard &mdash; that there is no absolute right to citizenship, even where the correct period of residence exists.  Refugees who have lived in the country for a suitable period apply under naturalisation provisions and the Minister retains a discretion to see that the various conditions of citizenship have been complied with.  The Minister of State's contribution seemed to indicate and could have given the misleading impression that refugees would receive citizenship as of right when the five year period elapses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that Members wish to conclude our deliberations on this Bill. However, programme refugees in this <Col N="1521" /> country are only catered for under one section and six subsections of the legislation.

    <P>Many refugees live in the Dublin West area and I meet them on a constituency basis.  I would be grateful if Senator Mulcahy would bring to my attention the cases to which he referred.

      <P>&ldquo;The Commissioner shall be conversant with and have experience of human rights issues&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a broad discussion on Committee Stage on whether the commissioner should be a practising barrister or solicitor or one with seven years experience.  The Minister gave convincing arguments, which were repeated here tonight, that experience was not essential and the commissioner should be a practising barrister or solicitor.  The Minister of State cannot disagree that the refugee commissioner should be conversant with and have experience of human rights issues.  The Minister of State made the case for not stipulating a <Col N="1526" /> practising barrister or solicitor of seven years standing.  She argued that some of the positions &mdash; for example, the Refugee Appeals Commissioner or the person hearing the appeals &mdash; would be held by people who are recruited from agencies such as the Refugee Agency and various Government Departments.  The Minister of State has unfairly chided me for my lack of experience in this particular area, notwithstanding the fact that I accepted throughout the debate that I was not as experienced as her in relation to refugee matters.  Nobody can deny that &mdash; and the Minister of State heard the debate in relation to safe third countries &mdash; it is imperative that the Refugee Appeals Commissioner would be fully conversant with human rights issues.  This is a critical point.  The phrase &ldquo;shall be conversant with and have experience of humans rights issues&rdquo; adequately deals with this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1978 and 1979 I had the honour to be a human rights fellow with the United Nations.  During that time it struck me with great interest that the head of the section was from the Soviet Union and there were a variety of people from other countries with extraordinary records in the human rights field.  The primary interest most of them seemed to have was balancing their accounts.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Minister and Senator Mulcahy that it is not a prerequisite that there should be a barrister or a solicitor.  However, there should be somebody, whether from the NGO, the public service or the <Col N="1527" /> outside world, who has a track record and a real interest in human rights.  An appeals commissioner without that prerequisite would be a nonsense.</P>
