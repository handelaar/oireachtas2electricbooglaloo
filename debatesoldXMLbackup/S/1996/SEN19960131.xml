      <P>Unfortunately, today we must pass a vote of sympathy to the family of the late Seán Conway who was a Member of this House in the early 1980s.  Seán Conway was known to everybody in public life throughout Ireland because of his involvement in the IVEA, the Irish Vocational Education Association, of which he was president for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first encounter with him was in 1969 during the general election of that year.  Even though he was on the opposite side, Seán, being the gentleman he was, informed my uncle, God have mercy on him, and me of all the houses to visit where we had a chance of getting support.  He was a very helpful colleague; I had the pleasure of being a member of Meath County Council with <Col N="2" /> him for many years.  His love of education came through.  There are many vocational schools around the country that will have fond memories of Seán Conway and the effort he made to improve the educational system.</P>
    <P>I offer my deepest sympathy to his wife, Carmel, and his family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Senators I join in the expression of sympathy to the widow and family of the late Seán Conway.  As Senator Farrelly pointed out, Seán Conway was a Member of this House in the early 1980s and I had the privilege of serving with him.  He was an excellent contributor to the debates.  He was a fluent Irish speaker and frequently his contributions were made in Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He had a deep interest in political life and in education.  He was involved with the IVEA for many years and, in more recent years, was its president.  In that <Col N="3" /> capacity he gave it positive and decisive leadership.</P>
    <P>His passing will be a great loss to political life and will be a tremendous loss to his widow, Carmel, and his family. On behalf of my colleagues I wish to join in the expression of sympathy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>At Seán Conway's funeral a woman told me that he was very good to the local people and that he was above politics.  I replied that I was not sure if he would have agreed with the last part of her remark because he was steeped in political life and in all that was good about public representation.</P>
      <P>He was committed to the country.  I knew him for 26 or 27 years.  My abiding memory of him is when he came to me in a hostelry in Ashbourne in the late evening 24 years ago last Sunday night with tears in his eyes because the news of Bloody Sunday had just broken.  He was shattered and broken, as was everybody, on that occasion.</P>
      <P>I often disagreed fundamentally with his views on how educational issues should be dealt with, but his commitment was beyond question.  He was a Gerilgeóir ó thús.  Ba gaeilgeóirí a chlann ar fad agus a driofiúr agus a athair roimhe.  They always had a commitment to the Irish language.</P>
      <P>He was always available in his local community &mdash; he was a neighbour of mine &mdash; whether it was in respect of the tennis club, the local cumainn, the credit union, the community council, looking for a secondary school, etc.  He was always there, providing a service, being one of the people and representing them.</P>
      <P>His family can look back and speak of the contribution he made.  He had a lot of sadness in his life.  He always spoke well of his political colleagues.  I am delighted Senator Farrelly spoke about him, because I know that Seán Conway always held his comrades and colleagues in different parties in the highest regard.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I associate the party with the vote of sympathy and acknowledge the national service the late Senator Conway gave to the country and to education.  We mourn his passing and sympathise with his wife Carmel, his family and his Fianna Fáil colleagues. May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour group I join in the vote of sympathy to the wife and family of the late Seán Conway.  I did not know Senator Conway but I knew of him when I was a member of my local vocational education committee.  He will be most remembered for his contribution to the vocational education sector and his commitment to education, particularly in his role on the IVA.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left I join with the other Senators in conveying our sympathy to the wife and family of the late Seán Conway.  I knew him briefly in the early 1980s and I knew of his contribution to the vocational education system.  He was also a Gaeilgeóir; ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an rún chomh bhrón lena bhean chéile agus a chlann.</P>

      <P>I welcome everyone back.  I hope we all have a happy new year.</P>
      <P>I have notice from Senator McGowan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to discuss the lack of additional funding provided for the southern Border counties.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Toole on the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to facilitate <Col N="5" /> the proposal for the establishment of a marina and mooring facilities at Albert Lock, County Roscommon.</P>

      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the proposed extension to replace the prefabricated classrooms at Pallaskenry national school, County Limerick, is constructed in 1996.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Fahey on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to outline the regime in our prisons for prisoners convicted of serious crime, including details of confinement, leisure facilities and other amenities and if she will consider the imposition of more Draconian measures for habitual criminals.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to sanction and provide funding for a public sewerage scheme in the villages of Ballintubber and Cloonfad, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cotter on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to examine the possibility of increasing the grant aided financial assistance made available to postgraduate students involved in research programmes in the various higher education colleges and universities.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave on the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that Dún Laoighaire-Rathdown County Council retains its <Col N="6" /> vocational education committee committee in light of the new boundaries.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Daly on the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide funding this year for the second phase building programme at Kilrush community school; and when such work will commence.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator McGowan's and Senator O'Toole's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is item 1 and Motion No. 23.  We will take Second Stage of item 1, the Domestic Violence Bill, 1995.  Each speaker will have 20 minutes, if that is acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now outline the business for the next three or four weeks.  Tomorrow, as requested many times during the last session, there will be statements on agriculture. Next Wednesday we will take Second Stage of the Waste Management Bill, 1995, and on Thursday we will take Second Stage of Senator Henry's Bill on the prohibition of child sex tourism.  On Wednesday, 7 February, we will take the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Bill, 1996, which is a Seanad Bill to relocate the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency in Johnstown Castle.  A number of other Bills will also be taken in the next few weeks, including the Irish Steel Bill, which has not yet been published but which is an urgent Bill relating to payment; the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 1995, is on Report Stage in the Dáil and it will be taken in this House as soon as it is completed there; the Refugee Bill, 1995, is also on Committee Stage and the merchant shipping Bill, which is a Seanad <Col N="7" /> Bill, has not yet been published but it is expected shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for allowing time for statements on agriculture tomorrow which this side of the House asked for on many occasions.</P>
      <P>He pre-empted a question I was going to ask about proposed legislation for this session.  I thank him for outlining the legislation which will come before this House in the near future.  Although there will be a major debate on crime tonight, only one piece of legislation on crime will be taken before Easter.  It is important that the Minister for Justice knows that this side of the House will co-operate when she introduces such legislation.  Fianna Fáil has published six Bills and I welcome the decision by the Minister for Justice to accept the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996.  On the Order of Business this morning the Taoiseach said he may also welcome another Fianna Fáil Bill.</P>
      <P>In view of the decision made by the Government about Baldonnel, which I welcome, will the Leader ask the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to reconsider the decision not to bring the light rail transport system to Dublin Airport before he introduces the Dublin light rail transport Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Leader's decision to outline the legislation to be taken in the next few weeks.  I too am delighted there will be a debate on agriculture tomorrow.  I hope the speakers will take issue with those in the agriculture sector who have failed to provide jobs over the past couple of years. I will contribute to that debate to give the other side of the story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed the Leader did not mention the debate on the report of the Institute of European Affairs on the single European currency and the intergovernmental conference.  It is crucial that we allow time for a debate on this issue because if we do not have one in the next few weeks we will lose the <Col N="8" /> opportunity for informed public debate. I do not want to discuss the issues now, but this is the best place to start a discussion so that people can offer their views on the subject.  Since this report is not written from a political party point of view it provides an opportunity for a debate on an issue which will have more impact on our lives than any other Government decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for outlining the legislation to be taken in the near future and for allowing a debate on agriculture tomorrow, which we have sought for a long time.  We have important Private Members' business this evening but the time will be restricted and many people will want to speak on this matter because it concerns everyone on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader consider providing more time at a later date to discuss crime because I suspect the debate this evening will be quite restricted?</P>
      <P>In terms of the legislative programme &mdash; perhaps we can get this question answered this evening &mdash; am I to assume there will be legislation on the Garda Representative Association?  If so, when is such legislation likely to come before the House?</P>
      <P>I wonder about Senator O'Toole's incursion into Roscommon.  Is there some profound significance in this assault across the Shannon?  I also get worried when there is a queue of matters on the Adjournment because it always leads me to believe that we will shortly have a general election. However, I think this is more a hangover from Christmas than anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter I find of profound interest is the tremendous amount of statutory and non-statutory papers which have been laid before the Seanad. Perhaps this is done at Christmas so that it will not attract a lot of attention.  I note that Statutory Paper No. 7 is the <i>Registration of Electors (County of Kildare) (Special Difficulty) Order,</i> 1995 (S.I. No. 354 of 1995).  Maybe the <Col N="9" /> Leader can tell me whether I should be concerned about that particular matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Fianna Fáil spokesman on Northern Ireland, I ask the Leader if he will convey to the Taoiseach our request to convene an immediate meeting of the British/Irish Interparliamentary Body.  I know the Taoiseach is not a member of the body but Deputy Paul Bradford is its cochairman.</P>
      <P>I say this in the light of the impasse that has developed since the announcement of the positive conclusions reached by the Mitchell commission which was followed immediately by an extraordinary statement from the British Prime Minister on proposed elections to a Northern Ireland Assembly. Obviously, there is at least a little tension between the Governments and this is understandable at this point.  I make this case because the British/Irish Interparliamentary Body has established a good working relationship over the years, both between the individual members and the representative parties. In view of the fact that all parties, including the SDLP and the Unionists, who have a right to be there although they do not attend, could meet and discuss the issue, it is of vital importance that the British/Irish Interparliamentary Body would meet in plenary session as soon as possible to support the central needs of the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I too call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  We all waited with bated breath for the Mitchell report and have been disappointed by the British attitude to it.  We all must praise the Government's stance on this issue but it is important that we debate the matter here in the House.  I call for a debate as soon as possible because both the nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland have genuine concerns about the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also call for a debate on the White Paper on mental health.  This House was <Col N="10" /> promised a debate on this matter in December but nothing has happened. This matter is of major concern to professionals and those who are incarcerated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader will be aware that on a number of occasions we have endeavoured to raise the issue of the state of county roads.  He will also be aware that the Minister for the Environment will make a statement on his policy on county roads and his plans to deal with the problem on Monday in a hotel in town.  Can that statement be circulated to Members of the House or made available to us next week so that we can have a discussion on the Minister's proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Leader's statement that Second Stage of the Waste Management Bill, 1995, will be taken next week.  Waste management is one of the most controversial issues at present.  In view of the fact that the Leader outlined the legislative programme for four or five weeks, will he consider having that Bill concluded as soon as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Health to come to the House at an early date?  I support Senator Maloney's call for a discussion on mental health.  I would like to be reassured the Minister for Health is doing all in his power to ensure there is not a national nurses' strike.  I would also like to know the state of the Department of Health's discussion document on mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse in view of the publication yesterday of the Church's response to allegations of child sexual abuse.  Mandatory reporting was recommended in the Kilkenny incest report and the discussion document still has not seen the light of day.  How soon can we expect to see it?  A debate on health was requested a number of times in the last session and it should be a priority this session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of what I was going to say has been said by Senator Wright and Senator Dardis.  We received a list of proposed legislation in the criminal justice area from the Chief Whip indicating ten Bills to be published by the Government before Easter. We intend to co-operate fully with all strong criminal justice and law enforcement measures the Minister will propose and to co-operate with the introduction of new legislation.  It would be appropriate if some of those Bills were to be initiated in this House.  There is so much legislation to be dealt with, especially in the other House, that in response to the national crime emergency, we would be in a better position to process speedily the initial debate on some of these Bills.  Will the Leader ask the Minister if some of the Bills can be initiated in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request for a debate on health.  We have sought and were promised a debate on health during the last session.  I am disappointed that today's announcement by the Leader does not include an overall debate on health.  While I welcome the VHI legislation there are many other pressing matters, in particular the White Paper on mental health.  The administration of the psychiatric services is governed by legislation which is 50 years old.  It is inappropriate that a White Paper is not to be debated in the House although a debate has been called for on numerous occasions and is long overdue. I ask the Leader to consult with the Minister for Health to see if we can have a debate on the White Paper on mental health at an early date.</P>
      <P>We will all support the Minister in his efforts to avert a nurses strike and I hope the negotiations will continue.  The nurses have a case but I do not see a strike as the way to resolve matters. However, they cannot be ignored and I hope the Minister will pursue the negotiations.</P>

      <P>An EU information sheet issued on 26 January highlights <Col N="12" /> preparations for the information society.  We had an IT and information centre in Donegal for nine years but it is now closed.  It had £1.9 million worth of business from Europe and was 90 per cent viable.  It was in competition as an information park with Belfast.  Will the Leader arrange an early debate on the value of information technology?  The EU clearly states that jobs can be provided in the IT area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The centre was established with the assistance of the regional technical college in Letterkenny, Eolas, IDA, Telecom Éireann and the Department of Education.  It is a nine year old information technology centre which won business from all over the country, including the Office of Public Works.  I urge the Leader to arrange a debate in view of the fact that the Minister has stated that he is overworked and does not have time to meet Dr. Vincent Murphy, the director of the information technology centre in Letterkenny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Senator will be able to deal with that during his matter on the Adjournment tonight.  I ask him to put a question to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  In view of the fact that the Minister does not have time to meet the director of our information technology centre, I ask for a debate on this issue as we have a crisis in Donegal.  I am confident that the Leader will respond favourably to my request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Maloney's request for a debate on Northern Ireland.  The House should use the opportunity to put on record its abhorrence of the British Government's treatment of republican prisoners in Britain.  They are treated in an <Col N="13" /> unnecessarily cruel and vindictive way and those of us who visited them recently are aware of the deteriorating situation there.  We should use the occasion to put our views firmly on the record.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader for the list of proposed legislation, especially the VHI Bill.  I agree with my colleague, Senator O'Toole, that we should have a debate on monetary union.  We are often accused of being reactive rather than proactive and this gives us a unique opportunity to be proactive in this area. I ask the Leader for a debate on that matter as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>When does the Leader propose to have a debate on broadcasting? Yesterday we witnessed the interviews for the new radio licences. However, to the detriment of the Irish music business, only 2 per cent of the music played by new radio stations, such as FM 104 and 98 FM, is Irish.  That should be discussed in this House and our views made known to the chairman of the Authority.</P>
      <P>We put a question to the Minister some time ago on piracy in Ireland.  This Christmas was a disgrace in that regard. If there is not a debate on that matter in this House within one month, I intend to introduce a Bill to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Leader about a non-statutory paper laid before the Seanad, No. 31 on the Order Paper.  It concerns the 1995 report of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment.  I am a member of the National Economic and Social Forum and this matter has exercised the minds of the forum over the last six to nine months.  It had an input into the task force report issued by the Government in December.</P>
      <P>Specific initiatives in last week's budget centre around a reorganisation and introduction of local employment services in 14 areas.  That is a new targeted exercise which I hope will address the issue of long-term unemployment. However, a debate in this House &mdash; perhaps in Government time &mdash; might be useful because my impression is that while the initiative is in place, the philosophy behind it is still in an evolutionary stage and it has not been decided yet how it will be approached.  If we had a debate, similar to that on agriculture and specific to the report, ideas and propositions might be forthcoming which could be helpful to the effective administration of the service.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Kennedy's request that the Tánaiste come before the House to reopen the debate on Northern Ireland.  Major concern exists in this regard.  There is a perception that the talks have broken down, especially this telephone diplomacy which exists between the two Governments.  It is sad that the peace process is being undermined by who said what.  It is timely that the Tánaiste should come before the House to clarify the position because the peace process seems to be under threat.</P>

      <P>I would like to bring the Leader's attention to a situation which arose when the President of the United States visited the country and this House.

      <P>I thank Senator Wright for his promise of co-operation on any legislation in the area of justice.  I know that his promise will extend to all areas and I am grateful for it.  The Dublin light rail Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation and should be before the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer recess.  I will convey the ongoing concerns of the Leader of the Opposition for the extension of the light rail system to Dublin Airport to the relevant Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator O'Toole's contribution, when providing the list of Bills with which the House will deal during the coming weeks, I was very specific in relation to legislation that will definitely be placed before the House. Further legislation will be forthcoming. The Senator is correct to raise the issue of a debate on the intergovernmental conference.  Members are aware that it was suggested, during the last session, that former Senator James Dooge &mdash; a former Cathaoirleach who is one of the authors of the Institute of European Affairs document on the European Union &mdash; should address the House. Plans for this are at an advanced stage. It is envisaged that we will have a question and answer session with former Senator Dooge regarding the document to which Senator O'Toole referred.  The debate may take place as early as 15 <Col N="16" /> February, but it will certainly occur in the near future when a suitable date is decided.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised the issue of crime.  I agree that tonight's debate may only scratch the surface of the problem. I had asked the Minister to appear before the House, independent of tonight's debate during Fianna Fáil Private Members' time, and perhaps that proposal can be reactivated.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Garda Representative Association, legislation is being prepared.  This legislation is complex and difficult as it attempts to regulate the affairs of two separate bodies.  I suspect it is the view of all Members that it would be infinitely preferable if we did not have to deal with this matter through legislation.  The behaviour of the two representative bodies has been extremely unedifying to the public and has created a very bad impression of all gardaí &mdash; despite the fact that only a small number are involved.  It would be to everyone's advantage if they could sort out their problems rather than request that we, as legislators, do so.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised the question of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  I agree with everything he stated in this regard.  It has been extraordinarily helpful in breaking down barriers between the parliamentarians of both countries.  However, it is my understanding that the body is autonomous and may, itself, convene a meeting.  I believe that its members would resent the Taoiseach taking a lead in a matter which is proper to its own deliberations. I will convey the Senator's point to that body.</P>
    <P>Senator Maloney and Senator Finneran raised the question of mental health.  During the current session, it is intended to deal with topics which were not covered during the last session.  We will begin tomorrow by dealing with the subject of agriculture.  I have placed the White Paper on mental health high on the agenda.  It is hoped to debate the matter in the near future and I hope to have more significant news for the Senator next week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" /> Senator Daly raised the issue of county roads.  The Senator and others are obviously very pleased at the progress that has been made on county roads over the past year.  I will arrange that the paper, of which I am not aware, will be made available to all Senators. Like everybody else I would prefer if these announcements were made in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As for Senator Sherlock's question, there will be no delay on the Waste Management Bill, but it is not one that we want to rush unduly.  We hope to clear it over the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan raised the question of a debate on health.  I am conscious that it has been promised and I will get back to it pretty soon.  I cannot give her an answer on the status of the document to which she referred but I will make inquiries for her.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy's point was raised already.  Senator Finneran also raised the question of mental health.  I can assure him that such a debate will take place very soon.</P>
    <P>I did not understand Senator McGowan's intervention but I will not ask him to repeat it.  Perhaps it would be more appropriate to raise it on the Adjournment if he could phrase it more precisely.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville raised the question of republican prisoners within the context of a debate on Northern Ireland.  I will talk to the Tánaiste about that to see when a debate would be helpful.  The question raised concerning the intergovernmental conference has been dealt with.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy sought a debate on broadcasting and the Minister is anxious to have such a debate.  As he is currently receiving submissions he does not want to come in at this stage to give what would be his considered response to those submissions.  However, it could be arranged in such a way that the debate here would, in effect, be a submission from this House without tying the Minister's <Col N="18" /> hands on his final position.  If that is agreeable we could do that.</P>

      <P>I would welcome a Private Members' Bill on piracy from the Senator.  It would be a useful contribution.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney mentioned the task force on long-term unemployment.  Such a debate could be arranged but we do not want to duplicate work being done in the forum.  Perhaps the Senator and I could have a chat about how that could best be done.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde sought a debate on Northern Ireland.  It is a tribute to the durability of the Anglo-Irish process that, even though there have been difficulties in the past week, there are mechanisms to resolve them.  We should not be too pessimistic about the events of the past week.  The process is still working, people are still talking and I am hopeful the difficulties will be resolved.</P>
      <P>I am sure Senator Cashin will have the support of Senator Lee in his attack on revisionism, whether it be of statues or of history.  I will convey his observations to the appropriate authorities.</P>

    <Title>Domestic Violence Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill repeals and re-enacts with substantial amendments the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981. Senators will immediately note the title which has been given to the Bill.  It is a Bill about domestic violence.  While it contains provisions to protect persons against such violence, I think the House will agree that the title of the 1981 Act is too modest in identifying the subject matter as being protection rather than violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> Violence in the home is a horrible act and society, I think, is now more aware of the insidious, cowardly and brutal measure it can be against its victims. The title of the Bill is intended to put that subject to the forefront, not to hide it as the 1981 Act appears to do.</P>
    <P>The House will readily accept that the problem of domestic violence must be addressed by proper legislative provisions and, where necessary, by the involvement of a range of agencies, including the Garda Síochána, the social services and other support services, including mediation, counselling and legal aid.  It is the Government's intention to keep under review all avenues of approach in this difficult area to best protect and support victims and to provide that the perpetrators can be dealt with quickly and effectively under the law.</P>
    <P>As far as civil law is concerned, the Bill provides a legal framework within which the victims of domestic violence can seek a range of remedies in the courts to suit the circumstances of a case.  Underpinning the legislative provisions contained in the Bill are measures to improve access to justice, extend the protections under the 1981 Act to a wider class of persons, make changes in those protections and strengthen the powers of arrest and entry of the Garda.</P>
    <P>The most widely availed of remedy in the area of domestic violence is the civil law remedy of a barring order, which was introduced in 1976.  Prior to that, the main civil law remedy available was an injunction in the High Court or Circuit Court.  The barring order remedy was a radical innovation at the time, although it was and continues to be limited to violence by a spouse against the other spouse and children.</P>
    <P>The Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, strengthened the law on barring orders following representations by various women's organisations.  The main changes made were the extension of the District Court's time limit from three to <Col N="20" /> 12 months, the granting of a statutory power of arrest without warrant to the Garda for breaches of orders and the creation of a new type of order called a protection order.</P>
    <P>These orders were designed to provide immediate protection for the applicant spouse or child pending the determination of the barring order application.  They fell short of barring the offending spouse from the family home.  The remedy for violence in the home does not stop short at barring orders.  Violence is also a ground for judicial separation and on the granting of a separation decree the court may confer on one spouse the right to occupy the family home subject to such conditions as it thinks proper or it may transfer ownership of the home to the other spouse in suitable cases.</P>
    <P>Court statistics show the average annual number of applications to the courts for barring orders over the past three years was 4,365 and the number of decrees granted was 2,248.  This appears to indicate at first sight that just over half the applications for barring orders result in the granting of orders and the courts show a marked reluctance to grant orders.  However, further analysis reveals that a good number of applicants withdraw their applications or fail to turn up for the court hearing.</P>
    <P>The experience of the Legal Aid Board is that 90 per cent of those who turn up in the District Court for the hearing of their applications for barring orders are successful and the vast majority of orders granted are for the full 12 month period.  The reasons victims do not proceed with their applications vary.  It may be as a result of intimidation by the other spouse or a genuine change in circumstances where the respondent spouse stops the violence. It may be that the applicant spouse does not want to go so far as to have the respondent barred from the home or the victim spouse is prepared to give the respondent another chance. We must be careful in amending the law in this area to ensure that change will be for the best in what is a very complicated <Col N="21" /> area, involving family and other relationships, high emotions and, most importantly, circumstances in which the protection of life itself may be at stake.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) (Amendment) Bill was initiated in the House to amend the 1981 Act.  This was intended to allow the court to grant a long-term protection order.  The Bill was eventually withdrawn due to opposition from women's organisations based on the fear that, if the Bill was enacted, the courts might almost invariably take the soft option of granting a protection order rather than a barring order, thus diminishing the existing legal protection for victims of family violence.  Senators should note that I am addressing this problem in the Domestic Violence Bill, 1995, but in a way which will obviate the concerns which arose in 1987.</P>
    <P>A feature of the barring order remedy which has been most often criticised is that it is confined to inter spousal violence. Increasingly over the years, patterns of social behaviour have changed. Many households are established on the basis of non-marital arrangements and violence in those households, as in households with married couples, is not, unfortunately, absent.</P>
    <P>It is also the case that violence is not confined in the main to spouses or cohabitants.  It can occur between parents and children, brothers and sisters and other members of households.  The Government accepts that the law in this area needs to be updated in the light of these realities and as part of its programme of family law reform is committed to the changes now provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In providing for the changes encompassed in the Bill I have taken into account various recommendations of submissions from, for example, the Law Reform Commission in its report on child sexual abuse, the Second Commission on the Status of Women, the Kilkenny incest investigation team and groups like AIM and Women's Aid.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the result of a comprehensive review of the civil law in relation to <Col N="22" /> the protection of persons from domestic violence which I carried out in my Department.  All the submissions which have been made about the present system have been taken into account in the course of my review.  I am most grateful for the information which has been put at my disposal by the various organisations concerned.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the details of the Bill. Section 1 defines a number of terms for the purposes of the Bill, one of which, the definition of &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;, I should like to explain further.  That definition makes clear that the word includes psychological welfare in addition to physical welfare.  This will help allay a perception among some groups that actual physical violence is a necessary prerequisite to the granting of a barring order.</P>
    <P>Section 2 introduces a new type of long-term protection order to be called a safety order.  The need for such a remedy &mdash; a remedy which falls short of barring the respondent from the home &mdash; has been advanced by the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the Kilkenny incest investigation team among others.  Specifically a safety order will prohibit a respondent from using or threatening to use violence against, molesting or putting in fear the applicant or a child.  In this respect it is identical to a protection order with the exception that the new type safety order may be granted in its own right and not as an interim measure.  In addition, it may prohibit a respondent who does not actually reside with the applicant from watching or besetting the residence.  The reports of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the Kilkenny incest investigation team recommend that provision be made for the granting of orders of this nature.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that a safety order procedure will be available to persons in domestic relationships.  It will be available on the application of a spouse against the other spouse, a cohabitant against the other cohabitant, a parent against an adult child and an adult person against any other adult person who <Col N="23" /> resides with him or her.  The term &ldquo;cohabitant &ldquo; is not used in the Bill. That class of person is referred to technically in various sections of the Bill as a person who is not the spouse of the respondent but has lived with the respondent as husband or wife.  In the case of a safety order it must be for a period of at least six months in aggregate during the period of 12 months immediately prior to the application.</P>
    <P>Violence in the home is not confined to violence by one spouse against another or children.  It transcends all relationships.  For this reason I have provided that the safety order remedy will be widely available.  An exception is made where the relationship is primarily contractual in order to ensure that the remedy is confined to what are genuine domestic disputes and does not, for example, become a feature of disputes between landlords and tenants for which there are separate legal remedies. Of course, the nature of a relationship may change over time from being primarily contractual to primarily non-contractual. Each case will have to be decided by the court on its merits and subsection (1) (b) sets out some factors to which the court must have regard in reaching a conclusion.  These factors include, for example, the amount of rent paid and the nature of any duties performed by one person on behalf of the other.</P>
    <P>The section also provides for the variation of safety orders on the application of any of the parties concerned.  The maximum duration of a safety order granted by the District Court is limited to five years, although it may, of course, be of shorter duration at the discretion of the court.  However, on or before the expiration of an order, a further safety order may be made at the applicant's request either for the full five years or for such shorter period as the court may specify.  On the other hand the Circuit Court will have jurisdiction to grant safety orders of unlimited duration although it may, of course, choose to limit the duration of an order in accordance <Col N="24" /> with the circumstances of a particular case.</P>
    <P>The section also contains a range of ancillary provisions in relation to safety orders.  It provides for the variation of orders on the application of any of the parties concerned.  The duration of a safety order granted by the District Court is limited to five years renewable on application for a further five years and the Circuit Court will have unlimited jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Provision is made to ensure that the type of objections which arose when attempts were made to introduce safety order type legislation in 1987 will not arise again.  Accordingly, section 2 prohibits the court from granting a safety order where the applicant applies for a barring order.  The same will also apply in reverse &mdash; the court will be prohibited from granting a barring order where the applicant applies for a safety order.  This will give the applicant a degree of control over the proceedings which, according to my Department's research, victims perceive to be lacking in such cases.  The court may consider the alternatives to a safety or a barring order where the applicant chooses to apply for both remedies in the same proceedings.  I am providing in section 17 that a breach of a safety order will be punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to £1,500 or imprisonment for up to one year or both.</P>
    <P>Section 3 in general re-enacts the barring order procedure while providing in addition that the remedy will be available to a wider class of persons than spouses and their children.  The effect of a barring order will remain &mdash; it will operate to bar a person from entering his or her home.  The class of persons who may apply for a barring order is being extended to cohabitants &mdash; one against the other &mdash; and the remedy will be available also to a parent against an adult child.  So far as cohabitants are concerned, they must, under section 3, have lived with the respondent as husband or wife for a period of at least six months in aggregate during <Col N="25" /> the period of nine months immediately prior to the application.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 3 (4) is that, except where the applicant and respondent are spouses, the court will not be able to bar a respondent with an ownership interest in the property unless the applicant also has an equivalent ownership interest.  I am advised that a proposal to bar such a respondent with an ownership interest on the application of a person with any lesser interest could be open to serious constitutional challenge on the basis that it may infringe that person's property rights which the State in its laws must respect under Article 40.3 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The position is different where the parties are married &mdash; an infringement of the spouse's property rights is presumed to be justified on the basis that the rights of the family founded on marriage are protected by the Constitution and take precedence over property rights.  The difficulty I mention was recognised in the Report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  It is not a difficulty with which many people, particularly non-legal people, may be over-impressed but it is something which, unfortunately, given apparent constraints in our Constitution, cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (5) contains a general saver which protects the rights of persons other than the applicant or respondent who have a legal or a beneficial interest in the dwelling.  For example, the fact that an applicant has succeeded in having a respondent barred from a property will not render him or her immune for ejectment proceedings instigated by the landlord for non-payment of rent.</P>
    <P>The maximum duration of a barring order granted by the District Court will be three years as opposed to one year at present.  Breach of a barring order, under section 17, will be an offence punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to £1,500 or imprisonment for up to one year or both.  This is an increase on the present law of a fine of up to £200 or imprisonment for up to six months or both.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> Section 4 empowers the court to make an interim barring order in emergency situations and on an <i>ex-parte</i> basis if necessary.  This power will significantly increase the ability of the courts to react quickly in situations of domestic violence.  The section empowers the court to grant, subject to certain conditions, an interim barring order pending the determination of an application for a barring order.  Such interim orders may be granted without notice to the respondent where the court considers it expedient in the interests of justice to do so.  Nevertheless, it is important to guard against the danger of a misconceived or malicious application, particularly when one considers that a respondent could be barred from the home on the basis of an allegation which he or she has had no opportunity to refute. For this reason, the granting of an order is confined to extreme cases, that is, cases where there is evidence that there is an immediate and serious risk of significant harm to an applicant or dependent person if the order is not made immediately and the court is satisfied that the granting of a protection order would not grant sufficient protection.</P>
    <P>Section 5 re-enacts section 3 of the 1981 Act and provides for the granting of a protection order pending the determination of an application for a barring order.  A protection order may also be granted pending the determination of an application for the new type safety order provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is a significant new provision which allows a health board to apply for a barring order or a safety order on behalf of a victim of domestic violence.  Such provision has been recommended by the Law Reform Commission and the Kilkenny incest investigation team.  The health board will be obliged to consult with the victim before applying for a barring or safety order.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) specifies the circumstances in which a health board can apply for a safety order or a barring order.  The section applies where a health board (a) becomes aware of an <Col N="27" /> incident or incidents which in its opinion puts into doubt the safety or welfare of the victim; (b) has reasonable cause to believe that the victim has been subjected to violence or otherwise put in fear of his or her safety or welfare; (c) has reasonable grounds for believing that the victim or parent of a child victim would be deterred or prevented from applying for a barring order or a safety order and (d) considers it appropriate to apply for an order having ascertained, as far as reasonably practicable, the wishes of the victim or parent of the victim.</P>
    <P>Another aim of the section is to allow a child stay in its own home where possible and to have the perpetrators of violence rather than the child removed from the home.  However, in making any order where children are concerned the court will have to be satisfied that there remains a parent in the home who is willing and able to provide reasonable care for the child.  This will avoid a situation where a child could be left in the home with a parent whose capacity or willingness to provide care is suspect.</P>
    <P>Section 7 empowers the court to adjourn proceedings for a barring or safety order which affects the welfare of the child where it considers that a care or supervision order under the Child Care Act might provide a more appropriate remedy.  It may order a health board to investigate circumstances with a view to arriving at the best possible solution in the child's interests.  The objective is to ensure that the barring or safety order solutions are not viewed in isolation but are considered against the backdrop of other services which can be provided by a health board.</P>
    <P>Many of the remaining provisions of the Bill are based on the provisions of the 1981 Act and mirror those provisions closely.  There are some important exceptions, however, with which I intend to deal specifically.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is an important provision which empowers the court to deal with maintenance, barring, family home protection and child care applications in the <Col N="28" /> same set of proceedings.  This provision reflects the fact that the problem of domestic violence is often intertwined with a variety of other problems which may arise during the course of domestic violence proceedings.  For example, a wife who is being abused by her husband may also be anxious about obtaining maintenance from him for herself and her children.  The purpose of this section is to allow the court to deal with all these matters as a package.  In some cases of course such extension of the scope of the proceedings would be agreed to as a matter of convenience by both parties.  Alternatively, there may be emergency cases involving children where, despite the objections of one of the parties, the court finds it necessary to make, for example, an emergency care order for a short period of time in accordance with its obligations to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for the discharge of orders on the application of any of the parties concerned.  The court will not be empowered to discharge an order unless it is of the opinion that the safety and welfare of the victim is no longer at issue.  This represents a stronger test than the safety and welfare test which is currently applied.  If the courts are asked to discharge an order which was originally made on safety grounds, they must be satisfied that the psychological welfare of the victim, as well as his or her physical safety, no longer requires it.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that section 17 of the Bill makes contravention of orders under the Bill a criminal offence and that the fine and term of imprisonment will be higher than under the present law in the 1981 Act.  The gardaí will continue to have a power of arrest without warrant for breaches of barring and protection orders and that power is being extended to the new safety order and interim barring order procedures.</P>
    <P>The present powers of arrest without warrant of the gardaí in domestic violence situations are unclear.  The gardaí can arrest for breaches of barring and <Col N="29" /> protection orders but, where those orders do not exist and violence has occurred, they are not in a position to arrest for many of the acts of violence which occur.  The difficulty arises because of certain common law distinctions between different types of assault which permit arrest without warrant in some cases but not in others.  Subsection (2) of section 18 removes those difficulties by making clear that a power of arrest without warrant will exist for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm or grievous bodily harm.</P>
    <P>I am also making important new provisions in relation to the powers of the gardaí to enter a home or other place for the purpose of an arrest for breaches of barring, protection or safety orders. The gardaí will have power, if need be by force, to enter any place where they suspect the perpetrator to be.  At present, when gardaí are called to a scene of domestic violence they may not be able to gain entry.  The perpetrator may have forced or convinced the victim not to admit the gardaí.  Scenes of domestic violence are difficult but too often it may be said that the gardaí are not in a position to investigate fully the violence against the victim, be it adult or child, and this new provision in the law &mdash; to enter by force if necessary &mdash; is deemed necessary by the gardaí and the victims of violence themselves.  Similar powers of entry will apply when gardaí wish to effect an arrest for criminal assaults.</P>
    <P>These then are the main provisions of the Bill.  Other Departments also have responsibilities in relation to the problem of domestic violence.  The Department of the Environment makes special provision for the housing of victims of domestic violence.  The Department of Health provides, through health boards, financial assistance to organisations involved in providing assistance to victims, and it is also responsible for reform of the law in relation to the care of children.  The Department of Justice has responsibility for criminal law and the Garda Síochána operate special policies to deal with domestic violence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> Counselling, for which my Department has responsibility for funding, must continue to have a part to play. Over the past two years I have more than doubled State funding to the many groups who are engaged in marriage counselling throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Bill will commend itself to Senators on all sides of the House.  I look forward to a good and constructive debate.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and this Bill.  The Minister referred to the various groups who met with him and advised and assisted him in the preparation of this legislation.  I am sure he is aware of the recent survey on domestic violence commissioned by Women's Aid which highlights the degree to which domestic violence occurs in all social classes.  Women's Aid has been telling us this for years.  The minds and bodies of women and children are broken by both the well-heeled and the down at hell.  To look at domestic violence as a male reaction to unemployment and poverty is, therefore, a fallacy.  The survey has shown that 18 per cent of women whose education ended at primary school said that they had been subjected to some form of domestic violence; the figure was as high as 20 per cent for women with third level education.  The propensity to engage in this destructive behaviour is as prevalent among men with a good education as among those with little or no education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than 600 women, chosen at random, completed the questionnaire in the Women's Aid study which was administered by the ESRI.  It is a reliable piece of research and gives the lie to those who suggest that domestic violence is a feminist fantasy.  The Minister is familiar with the presentations which Women's Aid and other groups have made to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  The reality which has been highlighted again and again is that there are only 16 refuge spaces in Dublin.  If we are to accept the <Col N="31" /> findings of this survey, this is an appalling lack of refuge spaces.  Women's Aid indicated that they would need an additional 80 places to cope with the problem as identified at present.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I know the Minister spent much time on its preparation. He indicated that there have been problems satisfying all the requirements and needs identified by the groups he met and by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  I welcome the additional powers which are being given to the gardaí to enter family homes in cases of suspected assault.  In the presentations to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, it was illustrated graphically that a woman could lie half dead in the family home but, if the husband answered the door, he could refuse to allow the gardaí enter the house.  Unless the gardaí could see through the window that somebody was in extreme danger, they had no power to enter.  This places in context the change in the title to the Domestic Violence Bill, 1995.  Perhaps we were too coy with the title of the 1981 Act, because it may have sent a message to the Garda and the social services that this was something that should be dealt with within the four walls of the home.</P>
    <P>The approach taken by the Minister, specifically on the strengthening of the powers of the gardaí to enter the home, puts the lie to this.  It sends the message to those men, who are mainly the perpetrators of violence, that such behaviour is not acceptable within the family home.  It has much wider implications and society is giving the gardaí powers to intervene and help women and children caught in such situations.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the introduction of the safety orders.  Although it does not remove the perpetrator from the home, maybe it strikes a balance between the final break in a relationship and the attempt to provide an opportunity for matters to be put on a healthy footing.</P>
    <P>The involvement of the health boards was a recommendation in the Kilkenny report, and I am pleased to note the <Col N="32" /> Minister has taken it on board.  Do the same restrictions apply to situations regarding cohabiting couples or can they make a recommendation for a barring order if there is a property problem with such couples?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the aim of section 6 (6) is to allow a child to stay in its own home where possible and to have the perpetrators of violence, rather than the child, removed.  This is excellent but the Minister also advised that, in making such an order, cognisance must be taken of the fact that there should be a parent remaining in the home to look after the child.</P>
    <P>Society tends to take the view that it is better to keep the home together and to leave the children in a situation where, perhaps, the social services could cope.  We have been reluctant to remove children from situations of violence, and I am not clear if this is what will happen again under the terms of section 6.  What happens where there is no parent to look after the child in the family home? Is the child taken into care?  Is a safety order enacted or is the offending and violent parent left in the family home? I am not clear as to the Minister's intention on this aspect.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 9 is very sensible; I only wish this kind of coherent approach was applied to other legislation. The need to drag people through the various arms of the law, for example, to apply for a barring order in the family courts on a Monday and then to apply three weeks later for a maintenance order etc., is a waste of time, energy and is bad for the morale of those involved in violent situations.  It must also be a huge waste of the resources of the courts, the time of staff and so on.  We know, for example, the problems being experienced by the courts because of the backlog of cases. I welcome section 9 and wish that other legislation with interrelated aspects dealt with them in a similar manner.</P>
    <P>The extension of the definition of safety and welfare to cover psychological welfare, which was not in the 1981 Bill, is an excellent improvement. <Col N="33" /> However, prior to the publication of the Bill, submissions to the Minister referred to the need to educate the Judiciary, especially in cases of mental cruelty.  One submission highlighted a case involving a wife who went to court to seek a barring order against her husband. She explained to the judge that he regularly produced two bullets in his hand telling her that one was for her and the other was for him.  However, the judge said her fears were unfounded.  I think this case was brought to the attention of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights and indicates that members of the Judiciary do not understand what is mental cruelty or the psychological welfare of a victim.  The Minister's strengthening of section 13 to ensure that the psychological well being of the victim is considered will only work if the Judiciary has some understanding of what is the psychological well being of victims.  I urge the Minister to ensure that we consider this aspect in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Having acknowledged the very good aspects of the Bill, as I always do when the Minister presents proposed legislation, I have serious concerns regarding the restrictive nature of the way in which cohabitees can secure a barring order.  I am aware that constitutional restrictions mean that the Bill does not go as far as it should.  Perhaps we should have amended the Constitution before this excellent legislation was introduced, although if we had done this many more women may have been battered and bruised.</P>
    <P>Many of the protections which this excellent legislation will provide will not extend to those who are not owners of, or do not have a substantial interest in, the family home.  The court will not have the power to grant an order where the respondent has a greater legal or beneficial interest in the home than the applicant.  The previous legislation sent out similar signals, even in its title and in the fact that the gardaí were not allowed to enter property because domestic matters were involved and those concerned should be left to resolve <Col N="34" /> them.  We are now saying again that, even if it is because of constitutional restrictions, property ownership dictates whether one can beat one's spouse or one's partner to death.  This is the effect of certain restrictions in section 3 (4).</P>
    <P>At a recent submission, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights suggested to the Minister that there were many Articles in the Constitution which required updating. In this context, the law on bail was referred to on the Order of Business. This Bill is good legislation but it is seriously hampered because the rights of property appear to supersede not only the common good but the right to life of somebody who is in a violent home.  I ask the Minister to urge the Government to act on recommendations made by the commission established to examine the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Where there is violence in the home can the health boards apply to the courts for a safety order, barring order or protection order?  Will they be constrained by the greater legal or beneficial interest in the family home being with the male rather than the female, or is there some way in which the Minister has allowed the health boards to get around this obstacle?  The Bill may have been amended since it was in the Dáil because it appeared that a cohabiting couple had to live together for six of the previous 12 months.  Has the Bill been amended since then or does it apply to any six month period in the previous 12 months?  It has been shown that in violent relationships there are often periods of absence when the perpetrator goes missing, so there may not be a continuous six months before going to court.  If the Bill has not been amended, that is another serious problem with the legislation. Those who are expert in this area will say that after inflicting violence, harm and hurt on a spouse or partner, the perpetrator will often go missing and come back when he thinks things have quietened down.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is not the role of this Bill but, like the Family Law Act, one thing it does not do is attempt to examine or <Col N="35" /> address the reasons men are violent in family situations towards their children or spouses.  The research Women's Aid carried out is the first serious research on the subject.  That body made a pre-budget submission to the Government to secure additional finance to further extend its knowledge in this area.  I welcome what the Bill does but unless there is an attempt to tackle and eradicate the underlying causes of domestic violence, the problem will persist and children who have grown up in those circumstances may become perpetrators in time.  I ask the Minister to work through his office and the Government to ensure not only do we tackle the crisis but we try to eradicate the problem, which is becoming more evident in society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Domestic Violence Bill and congratulate the Minister for bringing it to the House.  If one looks at the order of the most severe and vile crimes, after murder and the taking of life, domestic violence must be near the top of the list.  It is sustained over a long period, often years, and creates severe emotional difficulties. It is important that society deals with the situation, which has emerged from the hidden Ireland and is being addressed by our legislators.</P>
      <P>Anyone would in conscience support the combating of domestic violence. Violence in any form, particularly that which affects women and children, is a tragedy.  Those who witness it are appalled but those who live with it know its reality.  This Bill takes a firm stand in the fight against domestic violence, a problem which has for too long haunted victims in our society, who have suffered in silence and felt they had to present a front and portray the domestic scene expected of them by society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although currently statistics on domestic violence are unavailable in Ireland, evidence of the problem has become painfully obvious.  It is estimated that 25 per cent of British women experience physical abuse and this number does not include women who suffer the psychological <Col N="36" /> effects of mental cruelty.  Similar statistics on women and violence are reported in countries throughout Europe and Ireland is not immune to domestic violence, so while we do not have statistics we can assume we are nearing that level.  In 1994 alone the Women's Aid board fielded 6,000 cases of women reporting violence and it was estimated that in the Dublin area between 10,000 and 15,000 assaults on women take place every day.  The Garda obtained 5,000 cases involving family violence in 1995.  These numbers are completely unacceptable when one realises it is estimated that only 10 to 15 per cent of victims report attacks.</P>
    <P>No one can deny domestic violence is a serious problem in our society.  It is important to consider why past legislative efforts have failed to handle this problem effectively.  In studies, women admit being deterred from reporting abuse because of threats to their personal safety or the safety of their children. Others report that they could not economically survive without their spouses income.  In the past women who reported their spouses to the Garda knew they would have to face their spouse unprotected, possibly within hours.  Interim barring orders can protect women while due process of the law is being carried out.  Extending powers to the Garda give women an added sense of security that there would be authority there to support them in their decisions to tackle their unfortunate problem.</P>
    <P>It is particularly commendable that the Bill provides to a woman the ability to choose the action she wants to take. Not allowing judges to interchange requests for safety and barring orders gives women control over the proceedings. The Bill is designed to give women options to take protective measures for themselves and for their children and also the option to live without fear and abuse.</P>
    <P>While extending options to women, the Bill takes into account every measure to protect those who are often the greatest victims in our society, children, <Col N="37" /> who are the most vulnerable and least able to respond to their circumstances. Section 7 introduces a significant measure to deal with this.  It states that if issuing a barring order or a safety order is not a relevant solution to the problem, alternative action may be taken.  Specifically, the Bill allows the court to implement the Child Care Act where necessary.  This is further insurance that child victims will not be pushed aside but will be protected within our legal system.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis and I are Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights and we are only too aware of the details of some of the cases which were presented to us in various submissions over the years.  In the past the Garda and the courts have been frustrated by the limitations on their powers, as the Senator showed with reference to an example presented to us at a meeting of that committee eight months ago.  In the past, legislation did not allow barring orders to be issued in cases involving non-married individuals. It is important to remember that while the majority of domestic violence cases are against women and children, violence does not totally discriminate. This Bill moves forward and reaches out to protect wider varieties of people, including cohabiting couples and parents of violent offspring.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be commended for the revising of the Family Law Act, 1981, to provide assistance to more people.  Making cohabitants eligible for application for safety and barring orders not only protects more women but protects the children of these relationships also.  The Bill also protects the interests of elderly parents or vulnerable siblings who may be exposed to violence.  We are all conscious today how important it is too protect the elderly from violence and ensure they live their final years in the comfort and safety of their homes. The Bill takes a crucial step in acknowledging that domestic violence can affect all members of the family.</P>
    <P>This legislation is not the entire solution to the problem of domestic violence. <Col N="38" /> Important research is being done to reverse the growing rate of violence in this country.  Groups, including Women's Aid, have suggested the need for more family courts and roving District Judges for family law in rural areas. There is an urgent need for an extension to social services.  There is a need for more shelters and social workers to assist families who have been victims. There is, however, only so much that laws and the Garda can do to resolve the problem of domestic violence.  This legislation will not eliminate domestic violence on its own but it is an important step which paves the way for future action in the matter.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, violence against women is a feature of life in the latter part of the 20th century.  Women are the usual victims and men are the perpetrators. Domestic violence is not confined to one class alone and it occurs in both rural and urban areas.  Men use violence to exert control over women. Persistent violence undermines women's confidence and breaks their spirit.  Women and children are psychologically and physically at risk if there is violence in the home.</P>
    <P>I refer to the findings of the study commissioned by Women's Aid and published in September 1995 which illustrates that violence against women in the home is extensive.  I commend Women's Aid for the excellent work it does in this area and for the contribution this study has made to our understanding and knowledge of the level of violence in the home.  The study states that 18 per cent of women reported that they had been subjected at some time to mental cruelty, threatened with physical violence, experienced physical or sexual violence, or had their pets or property damaged.  Many women experienced multiple forms of violence and 11 per cent of women experienced physical and-or sexual violence.</P>
    <P>The rate of reported violence is likely to underestimate the true level of violence. Like everything coming from hidden Ireland, it will take time to understand <Col N="39" /> or evaluate the level of violence experienced by women in such circumstances. Some 71 per cent of women in the study who experienced physical violence reported that it resulted in physical injury which included broken bones, head injury, loss of consciousness and miscarriages.  Among the mental health effects reported were loss of confidence, depression and increased use of medication and alcohol.  It was also reported by 64 per cent of women that their children had witnessed the violence.  The negative effects of violence on children include poor school performance, sleeping problems and children being fearful and withdrawn.  The symptoms are similar to those experienced by children who have been physically or sexually abused.</P>
    <P>The severity of the violence is also shown in the high level of reporting of such incidents to doctors and gardaí. One fifth of women in the Women's Aid study who experienced violence reported it to the gardaí, 29 per cent reported it to a doctor and 16 per cent reported it to a solicitor.</P>
    <P>The ill effects of violence on women in the home may be more severe and persistent for those living in poverty and on low incomes.  Almost three times the number of women who qualify for medical cards and who attend doctors' surgeries reported that they had experienced violence than those without medical cards, despite the fact that domestic violence is not class related.  Living in a violent relationship results in changed economic circumstances for many women who then qualify for a medical card.  The results suggest that the long term ill effects of violence on women living in poverty and on low incomes is greater than in the population as a whole.  This is consistent with the view that women living in poverty are likely to experience greater ill effects than other women and that the cumulative effects of a life in poverty exacerbates the effects of any one illness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> Special circumstances relating to violence against women in the travelling community include the early age of marriage and arranged marriages.  The difficulties travelling women face in terms of leaving violent relationships are related to patterns of kinship marriage and the fact that the economic and kinship base is interlinked, resulting in pressure to maintain family relationships.  Travelling women also have larger numbers of children which makes it difficult for them to leave.  However, broader kinships have facilitated some travelling women leaving violent partners.  Many have gone to England and Northern Ireland to seek refuge and have access to services which they feel have supported them.  It is important to address this area of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>Statutory services specifically designed to respond to the needs of women who have experienced violence in the home should be introduced immediately.  There is no overall community care strategy for women who have experienced violence in the home. With the centralisation and streamlining of social services, social work has become less accessible to women, with the exception of an inadequate number of emergency refuges which are inadequately funded.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Women's Aid and Women's Aid helpline which provides crucial support to women in violent relationships.  The State must introduce a strategy to ensure that women who seek help receive a response.  Several agencies such as the Garda, community welfare services, community homemaker services, the accident and emergency services at hospitals and voluntary organisations have noted the lack of support services in the community to which they could refer women who have experienced violence in the home.  Some 75 per cent of women who experience violence in the home suffer from depression.  Other psychological illnesses are also reported.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which will be crucial in terms of developing the powers of the Garda whose primary role is protection. <Col N="41" /> Central to the success of the Bill is the need for ongoing training for gardaí and the need to monitor information. It presents an opportunity to tackle one of the most serious problems in society today.</P>
    <P>I refer to a report, <i>Breaking the Silence,</i> which was compiled by the Midwestern Health Board and Adapt House in Limerick.  This report describes the experience of women who have been subjected to violence by their male partners in the home.  It shows that for many women violence begins early in their lives, either through witnessing assaults on their mothers or other family members, or through personally experiencing physical or sexual violence.  Violence begins early in a marriage and there are often warning signs during the courtship of what is to come.  However, many women are not alert to such warning signals or, if they see them, often ignore them.  Once violence occurs in the relationship it tends to become progressively more frequent and severe.</P>
    <P>The extent of the violence inflicted on women is often difficult to imagine unless physical injuries or permanent marks and scars are seen.  The report states that injuries leading to unconsciousness or requiring hospitalisation are not uncommon.  Violence is not confined to physical attacks but also includes emotional, verbal and sexual abuse which are often seen as more dramatic than physical violence.  The most frequent issues which trigger immediate violent attacks include alcohol abuse, argument, jealousy, possessiveness and the desire to obtain control over the woman.  The circumstances which trigger violent attacks are almost always trivial.</P>
    <P>The first attack experienced by the woman is usually unexpected and evokes a reaction of shock, confusion and fear.  The man often expresses repentance for the first attack and the woman is likely to believe him when he says it will not happen again.  Few women seek help outside the home at this stage.  It can take many years for a woman to finally decide she has reached <Col N="42" /> her limit in terms of the number of violent attacks.  It is only when the woman has finally realised the man will not change that she can begin to take definite action to leave the violent situation.</P>
    <P>When the woman seeks outside help she will probably go to the gardaí and to social workers.  The Adapt House report shows that women who contact such agencies find they are helpful.  Other agencies which provide assistance are often not seen by women as helping them to break the cycle of violence. Refuges provide one of the most immediate effective forms of help for women.  They provide safety, comfort, support, counselling and practical advice and information on women's circumstances. An important part of the refuge is that women feel someone will listen to them without judgment or blame.  This constitutes the first step in their self-empowerment.</P>
    <P>The violence reported in the Women's Aid and Adapt House studies is but the tip of the iceberg and it is likely that much violence, particularly among women of the higher social economic backgrounds, remains hidden.  To ensure this problem is removed from the shame of this country, it is important that not only the Bill before the House is enforced with all the vigour which the authorities can apply but that we look to long term prevention.</P>
    <P>To that end, the Adapt House report's recommendations include the promotion of policies which will ensure gender equality in economic, educational, employment and political spheres; the confrontation and change of sex role stereotyping, which reinforces gender inequalities and confines men and women to rigid ways of expressing maleness and femaleness and the development of a widespread public attitude whereby violence is not tolerated in the community as an acceptable means of handling conflict.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends the provision of parental training to alert fathers and mothers to the different ways in which they can act to prevent the development of violence in their <Col N="43" /> children's future lives by providing, for example, non-violent role models, teaching non-aggressive means of handling anger and conflict, encouraging responsibility for an open expression of feelings and facilitating the development of self-reliance and self-esteem.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends the training of teachers to enable the education system to play its full role in teaching conflict resolution and anger management skills; preparing young people for future intimate relationships, providing non-violent and non-sexist role models and the confrontation of media images which facilitate women being regarded as natural victims of violence and which allow violence to be seen as an acceptable option in dealing with conflict.  The report recommends the identification of groups which are at risk so that early intervention measures may be initiated.</P>
    <P>With regard to intervention for those currently suffering violence, the MidWestern Health Board and Adapt House recommendations include the provision of an adequate number of refuges across the country and adequate funding to enable current refuges to provide their service; prompt action from the Garda when called upon by a woman who is being victimised, as the treatment of violence in the home is a crime to be dealt with in the same way as any other violent crime; recognition of violence in the home as a public concern and not the women's sole responsibility to handle; the training of social workers and others in the caring professions, such as GPs, hospital doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, counsellors and clergy to be aware of the problem of violence in the home, to be alert and sensitive to the warning signals and to be aware of the kind of help required and where such help might be found.</P>
    <P>The report recommends the provision of practical help to women who want to leave violent relationships, for example, the provision of affordable and suitable housing, economic assistance, childcare facilities, training and employment <Col N="44" /> opportunities and a variety of psychotherapy and counselling options for women who wish to stay with their partner despite the violence, and for the perpetrators themselves.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there are no simple or quick solutions to the problem of violence in the home.  The problem is complex and involves traditional, social and cultural factors in the interaction with individual life histories and personalities. An attempt to tackle the violence must include strategies aimed at long-term prevention in conjunction with interventions designed to alleviate the suffering of victimised women and children. The situation of the woman who is subjected to violence is so fraught with medical, psychological, social, legal and economic problems that no single professional agency could adequately deal with it.  The complexity of the problem makes it essential that the different agencies involved work together to pool their experience, knowledge and resources in order to facilitate a concerted effort.</P>
    <P>Finally, the strengths and resources of the women who suffer the violence must be recognised, acknowledged and brought to bear in enabling them to end the violence in their lives.  I would commend anybody who is interested, concerned or who feels they can make a contribution, to refer to the Adapt House survey which lays bare and open to the reader the real suffering of women in such situations.  I commend the Minister for taking this step which is but one step in trying to control and eliminate this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I too welcome this excellent Bill which must have required a great deal of work in the Department.</P>
      <P>When Séamus Heaney addressed those of us who were lucky enough to be invited by the Taoiseach to celebrate his Nobel Laureate he said that we are falling into modernity and we must construct our own safety net.  I see this Bill as part of that safety net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" /> Domestic violence is not new but our attempts to recognise and reject it as a proper form of conduct is.  This Bill is a most welcome step in showing the perpetrators of domestic violence that it is not considered a type of private and permissible struggle within the home but as criminal behaviour which will not be tolerated by our society.</P>
    <P>Today and for the past few weeks there has been much focus on some horrific crimes, several of which were murder. This has led to a debate which has focused solely on the public aspect of crime and ignores entirely the fact that, as far as women are concerned, violence, even murder, is far more likely to come from the hand of a husband, partner, ex-partner, friend, acquaintance or neighbour than from any stranger. Anger, rage and jealousy, &ldquo;If I cannot have you, no one else will&rdquo; and sexual desire are far more likely motives for violence than robbery or murder by a deranged stranger.  Dr. Enda Dooley's book on homicide in Ireland from 1970-1990 makes really interesting reading because it shows that a very small proportion of women who are murdered in this country have been murdered by strangers.  The vast proportion are murdered by people they knew well.  Most violence in the home is male against female, I think the figure is about 95 per cent.  While physical size is important in physical violence, emotional and psychological violence can be just as important and, indeed, women have been driven to suicide by it.</P>
    <P>The Constitution makes the family central but some families are sour and lonely places for its members.  In the last few decades we have recognised physical and sexual abuse of children and the abuse of adult women and elderly people is addressed in this Bill.  Men need to be challenged about this type of behaviour.  Different explanations are given for it.  Alcohol has often been blamed but many women will tell you they are beaten irrespective of whether the man is drunk or sober.  In fact, alcohol can sometimes be used as an excuse to minimise or justify the violence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> Domestic violence is one of the most serious social problems affecting us.  It is not just those who are involved in the violence who are affected, it debases society in general.  This Bill and other legislation, such as the Family Law Act, 1995, which the Minister introduced last year, have gone a long way towards addressing the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>There have been many studies on domestic violence.  Women's Aid is to be particularly commended for the study it brought forward with the help of the Economic and Social Research Institute.  The study to which Senator Neville referred, the one by Ms Ruddle and Professor Joyce O'Connor for the Mid-Western Health Board and Adapt House in Limerick, and other studies have given us a lot of insight, helped elucidate the causes and suggested preventative measures for this problem.  I am thinking, in particular, of the one which was undertaken last year in Northern Ireland by Ms Monica McWilliams and Ms Joan McKiernan, <i>Bringing it out into the Open: A Study on Domestic Violence in Northern Ireland.</i> It would be well worth our while looking carefully at its recommendations.</P>
    <P>Once we have identified and tried to look for the causes of domestic violence within society, it is important to note that attempts have already been made to deal with the problem within the social services and they, of course, must be reinforced.  Others have been started, such as Alternatives to Violence, a programme originally set up in America and which is now being pioneered in our prisons by a voluntary group &mdash; mainly Quakers &mdash; which has been astonished by the response from men who want to get involved in the scheme.  I would be grateful if the Minister were to look at these programmes to see if he can give them additional help.</P>
    <P>Within and outside the prisons it is important to get people to address their violent behaviour and look at alternatives. Violent men have recognised this and some of them have set up an organisation <Col N="47" /> called MOVE &mdash; Men Overcoming Violent Emotions.  It is important to recognise that men find this behaviour unacceptable within themselves and we must try to find methods whereby they can avoid this horrific behaviour.  I was disappointed with the Bill in that there seems to be an emphasis on custodial sentences and fines.  I would have liked more sociological and community based sanctions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with the clarification of the powers of the Garda is most useful.  At present the gardaí are often at a loss to know what to do despite increased training in this area and the establishment of the domestic violence and sexual assault investigative unit in 1993, which was a major step forward. In general, women do not criticise the gardaí when they become involved in cases.  In the past they were often in a position where they had to advise the woman to go out and take a walk while the man cooled off but this Bill will put them in a better position.</P>
    <P>However, their role could have been expanded.  The Garda juvenile liaison scheme, in which a child involved in suspected crime is not charged in court with the crime but is cautioned and put under Garda supervision, has been a spectacular success.  According to their own figures, only 11 per cent of children so dealt with over the last 30 years came before the courts before they were 18 years old.  This is incredible and the scheme is not publicised enough.  Could a scheme not be set up with the Garda for violent adults &mdash; usually men admittedly? It would be much easier for women to report violent behaviour if they felt the perpetrator would still be in the home and would not be before the courts but would only be cautioned. Taking such action is serious, particularly getting a barring order &mdash; it involves getting a husband and father thrown out of the house.  The juvenile liaison scheme has worked very well and I wonder if it would be possible to set up something like it for cases of first offences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> The withdrawal of barring orders often takes place because the woman feels some desperate action will be taken or none at all.  The old solution of threatening to call the gardaí may be no harm.  I urge the Minister to seriously look at this proposal.  The Garda might be receptive to doing something like it. Having seen how important and successful the juvenile liaison scheme has been, I hope it might be considered.</P>
    <P>This legislation will be applied mainly in the District Court.  I sometimes think most people do not realise that a great deal of family law work is carried out in the District Court.  Women have told me they receive polite, kind and efficient treatment from the District Court office when they go there.  They often turn up without any legal representation and may look for a barring order when a safety order would do and the Bill does not allow people to change it.  They may ask for more extensive measures than are felt necessary.  The Minister has put a great deal of effort into expanding the civil legal aid scheme and that is appreciated by all.  It is essential that women have legal representation before they get to the District Court because no depositions are taken there as they come in on summonses.  It is essential they know what they are going into before the case begins.</P>
    <P>As Senators have said, more probation officers are needed and more social workers so reports can be made back to the court speedily.  It is important that the facilities in the courts be improved as rapidly as possible.  It is difficult for opposing parties to be interviewed in the same corridor.  Women tell me they try to keep their heads down and keep talking to their solicitor about what is happening.</P>
    <P>The delays in court cases are also worrying.  Urgent cases can be taken quickly, but the courts do not sit over the whole weekend and Saturday night can be a bad night.  In some cases the people involved may not just be sharing the same house but the same bed.  There may be immediate difficult cases and the courts should be given as much <Col N="49" /> facilities as possible to deal urgently with these cases.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville and others referred to refuges, which are most important for women who feel they have to leave their home &mdash; often with their children.  The places available must be increased.  It is regrettable that people object to refuges being established in their communities because women have to flee somewhere from violence and in charity we should be able to take them in.  These are of particular importance to travellers who often have difficult circumstances and few places to go.  They are also of importance to rural women.  It can be easier to get shelter in urban areas from friends and neighbours but rural women can be very isolated.  Setting up refuges around the country will have to be addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>Women with adolescent sons may also experience difficulty.  A lot of refuges will refuse to take in men; they may rightly feel it is difficult to take in a big 15 year old.  The involvement of men in the refuges may cause difficulties because the violent person, be they a partner or ex-partner, is barred from the refuge.  We have to consider what a woman is to do with her adolescent sons.  A woman said to me that all her children only came with her on her fourth attempt to flee the home.  On the first time she fled she failed to find anywhere they could stay.  Her boys had to go back home to their father where they were beaten for their mother's removing herself from the home.  This matter should be looked at.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of non-marital relationships is another good feature of the Bill. However, some aspects are a little unrealistic &mdash; for example, the requirement of evidence of cohabitation in six of the previous nine months for a safety order or six of the previous 12 months for a barring order.  How is a woman to prove whether or not a man was living with her and how long it is since he has left etc.?  Men can often have been gone from the home for some time before they become violent and decide to go back &mdash; they may have left years beforehand <Col N="50" />&mdash; or the man and woman may not have lived together at all but have a child in common.  I do not think such women are protected.  The geographic protection is not enough.  The woman may have to attend a place of work, a hospital or a school and the violent person will have to be warned off those areas also.  The geographic protection is not wide enough and I would like to see it expanded.  I hope to table amendments to this section on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill a large number of other pieces of legislation, such as the Family Home Protection Act, the Guardianship of Infants Act and the Child Care Act, can come into play in the District Court.  These are all complex areas and I am anxious that people will get sufficient legal advice and time to respond to these Acts.  I know that there is provision for an adjournment to be made, but I do not want that to be an adjournment for ten minutes to speak to a social worker outside the door who is trying to deal with 60 other cases that morning.  This area must be taken very seriously because the summons may not say anything about the fact that other legislation may come into play.</P>
    <P>This is a very difficult area for me to address because I do not have any legal training.  I know that the Minister said that people such as me will find it very difficult to understand how property can be put ahead of people.  Under this section those who are not married do not have the same rights as those who are married in regard to the ownership of the home, although they may have paid quite an amount of money towards the home.  The children of non marital relationships are being treated less justly than those of a marital relationship in this situation.  I thought that we were supposed under the Constitution to treat all the children in the State equally.</P>
    <P>I can comment with more expertise on the involvement of the medical profession. A recent study by Women's Aid and the casualty department in St. James Hospital on injuries to women <Col N="51" /> makes terrifying reading.  Non urgent cases of injuries to women who came to the casualty department were tactfully diverted into a side room where specially trained doctors and nurses tried to discover the cause of their injuries. In the vast majority of these cases, the injuries were caused by male members of their households.  Even more shocking than the broken noses, ribs, teeth and jaws and multiple bruising, was the fact that many women had waited for up to a week before coming to the hospital with fractures.  This did not occur in any other circumstances. Shame or fear of the perpetrator had made them afraid to attend the hospital. Another important factor was that many of them could not be delayed for too long because they had to leave the hospital to go home to protect their children, who were also being physically assaulted.  This is a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>General practitioners in Northern Ireland, in the booklet on domestic violence to which I referred earlier, said that there was great under reporting of domestic violence.  However, they admitted that they did not question women too closely because the floodgates would open if they did.  They recognised that violence within the home was very extensive.  The problem is so widespread that it is essential for the medical profession to address it at once.</P>
    <P>Pregnancy is not a protection from violence, as a recent study in the Rotunda Hospital showed, and miscarriage and the early onset of labour can often result.  Marital rape, which is quite common, can often be done to deliberately impregnate women.  The training of nurses and doctors in this area is vital.  Perhaps, we could set up within some casualty departments some pilot schemes with women doctors, as we did in regard to sexual assault cases.  Separating the perpetrator of the violence from the victim can be a great help in allowing the women to give an accurate history.  Many women claim that there is <Col N="52" /> no follow up to their treatment; they are given tranquillisers and not referred to any of the caring agencies, social workers or Women's Aid who might help them.  Doctors now ensure that no non accidental injury to children goes unexplored and we should extend that to women.</P>
    <P>Violence towards the elderly is an extraordinarily important area.  Old people of both sexes are at risk, particularly those with psychiatric problems such as Alzheimer's disease.  Dr. Margo Wrigley and others have done work on this area.  A study commissioned by Women's Aid, which was carried out in the accident and emergency unit in Beaumont Hospital last year, as well as the report in St. James Hospital, pointed out severe abuse of the elderly. However, some of it was by men who had been separated from their elderly wives for years and decided to go home.</P>
    <P>Stress on carers of elderly people should be catered for before old, frail and disabled people are assaulted in their own homes.  Is a person in receipt of a carer's allowance covered by this Bill?  We need to establish respite care for old people and to consider giving tax allowances to adult children to employ help for elderly parents.  This would help to prevent the resentment which can occur if a woman, in particular, has to give up good employment to care for a difficult elderly parent, knowing that she may have great difficulty in reentering the workforce.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the Bill.  I hope that the Minister will take to heart some of the points I made and perhaps these amendments could be made on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill. The first real legislation dealing with the protection of the more vulnerable members of the family was only introduced in 1981 in the form of the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act.  Since then, there has been a major change in society and how it deals with abuse of power.  A great deal of new family legislation has been <Col N="53" /> introduced since 1981, which is very welcome.  On that basis, it is time to look again at the 1981 legislation and ask if it is sufficient to properly protect our citizens from physical and other forms of abuse within the family home. It is clearly the case that it is not.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that the various forms of abuse and violence about which we now talk openly have, sadly, always been part of our society.  It is part of the make-up of the human being which comes to the surface in a percentage of us and serves to remind us all of our animal origins.  I sometimes watch nature documentaries on television and I am surprised to see the care and protection given by animals to their mates and young.  I often wonder how far human beings have actually advanced in that regard.  It may be funny to refer to the Stone Age image of the man hitting the woman over the head with a club and dragging her along by her hair.  However, sadly, for many women in Ireland today that image is not far from the truth.  Domestic violence has always existed; the only change is that it is no longer brushed under the carpet and is, at least, discussed as an issue in the public domain.  We still have a huge mountain to climb before we achieve a society which does not tolerate domestic violence and allows all those who have been abused to come forward and get help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While our education system produces very academic and bright students, it often fails to produce excellent citizens. It should be part of every school's curriculum to teach tolerance and care for every individual in our community, respect and value for both sexes and self-respect in an effort to break what is often a cycle of inherited violence.  How else can we tell ten year olds who often see their father batter their mother that such action is wrong?  Those children know nothing better and regard that as normal.  Sadly, many grow up to perpetrate the same abuses.  It is, therefore, very important that while we introduce much needed improvements to legislation, we must also recognise the value <Col N="54" /> of education in tackling the causes of the problem.</P>
    <P>On a practical level, it is more cost-effective to put additional resources into education of this nature, on a long-term basis, than to spend increasing amounts on prisons, social workers, refuges and all that is associated with, and needed to deal with, the results of such abuses.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to Womens' Aid which is a particularly marvellous organisation.  Last year it obtained 100,000 signatures from people who believe that a zero tolerance attitude must be adopted towards violence against women and children.  The Womens' Aid document, <i>Making the Links,</i> deals with the huge array of issues connected with domestic violence and offers many valuable proposals. This document argues for an integrated strategy for the elimination of violence against women and for changes in society to ensure that domestic violence be treated as an unacceptable crime.</P>
    <P>The legislation before the House travels some way along that long road.  The Bill will extend the law on barring and protection orders beyond spouses and their children, to a much wider range of people including most co-habittees and their children and the parents of abusers. This expansion of protection is very welcome.  I am personally aware of an elderly woman who is waiting for the enactment of the legislation.  She raised a large family in difficult circumstances, having lost her husband, and now suffers abuse from a son who remains at home.  She is forced to hang up the telephone when he enters the house because she fears that another argument will ensue.  Such people deserve peace of mind in their latter days.  It is our role, as legislators, to introduce laws to protect them.  It is for this reason that I welcome the expansion of the range of people covered by the protections which previously only existed for lawful spouses and their children.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the legislation enters into such great detail in defining the groups who may apply for barring and protection orders and <Col N="55" /> excludes co-habitees who may not have lived together for six out of nine or 12 months and those women who, in many cases, share houses with violent blood relatives such as brothers or cousins. From reading the legislation, these people appear to be excluded.  I do not understand why that is the case.  I appreciate the constitutional difficulties with permitting an unmarried, sole owner of a family home to be put out of it on the application of a temporary partner.  However, I would challenge a Constitution which protected the perpetrators of cruelty and violence and placed property rights on a pedestal above the right of people to live free from the awful fear and affliction of violence.</P>
    <P>This Bill should deliver a clear and unambiguous message to society that violence toward all women and children is beyond the bounds of acceptability.  A way should be found, through the legislation, to balance the constitutional property rights of the abuser with the right to bodily integrity of the victim.  I suggest that the courts be given guidelines in this area and be granted discretion to balance those conflicting rights. An effort must be made to deal with this matter in the proper interests of justice. Property should not come before people.  I urge the Minister to examine this area of the legislation more thoroughly to see what is possible in the context of providing protection for all citizens.</P>
    <P>The third area I wish to address is the role of the Garda Síochána.  As a solicitor I deal with quite an amount of family law and I have discovered, during recent years, a vast improvement in the way the Garda deal with domestic violence. In many cases they are now more proactive in dealing with the issue. Additional training in this area is always welcome but I accept the fact that many gardaí are inept in dealing with such issues.  I have found that most gardaí are very willing to help the victims of domestic violence and take on more responsibility than their duty requires.  I <Col N="56" /> take this opportunity to congratulate the members of the Force on how they deal with domestic violence within the legal constraints under which they operate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill which will give gardaí greater powers to enter the family home &mdash; which is a must &mdash; and the power to arrest without warrant.  The legislation will enable the gardaí enter a house for breach of any of the orders and also where an assault has taken place or where such an assault is suspected.  This provision is crucial.  It will allow the gardaí to carry out an arrest, even when a victim is afraid to admit the abuse to them in the presence of the abuser, which is often, and naturally, the case.</P>
    <P>Individual gardaí have built up a wealth of experience in dealing with domestic issues.  They often advise and encourage women to pursue legal rights and remedies and show great empathy and understanding in doing so.  Their role is very important because they operate at the coalface of the problem and are called upon to deal with very distressful situations and circumstances. Therefore, it is important that their hands are not tied in tackling the problem. For that reason, I welcome the provisions in the Bill relating to the powers granted to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The fourth area I will address is the role of the medical services to which previous speakers referred.  Perhaps our experience, or what we hear through the grapevine, influences how we perceive the way in which a particular profession deals with a particular problem.  When discussing the medical profession in general, it is often the case that its members are in the front-line of those who can be confronted with domestic violence.  In my experience, many women suffer severe physical abuse within the home.  The song which says that &ldquo;Nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors&rdquo; is more than correct for many people.  This is particularly true of women perceived as &ldquo;well off&rdquo; in our society, who are afraid to admit their marriages are failures in so <Col N="57" /> far as they have become the victims of violence within the home.  This is something which is not suspected by people outside those homes.</P>
    <P>From my limited experience of the subject, I have discovered that, in such situations, the perpetrator of such violence will get away with it.  The more they get away with, the more they continue to do it until the woman suffers serious injury, for example, being pushed down the stairs.  She must then get herself to her doctor or to the hospital for emergency assistance.  At that stage it is crucial that the medical profession be in a position to identify the nature and cause of her injuries.  It is not helpful or good enough that many practitioners prescribe Valium for women who appear before them on a regular basis, hoping that this will deal with the problem, when they suspect that domestic violence is one of the causes for concern.</P>
    <P>In this day and age, nobody in the medical profession should be permitted to turn a blind eye to the possibilities of domestic violence.  It should be more focused in terms of the training of the medical profession.  As with childcare, perhaps we should consider placing an onus on practitioners to report such suspicions. That is only a suggestion but it is something about which I feel strongly.</P>
    <P>Increased funding is required in the area of education and healthcare and for groups such as Womens' Aid which deal with the problem itself.  It does not make sense that thousands of women are forced to telephone the helpline serviced by Womens' Aid, apply for barring orders and that hundreds leave their homes each year on a temporary or permanent basis.  At present there are very few refuge places available.  If the legislation being introduced is to be effective, we hope that the need for refuge places will be reduced.  It should not be the case that the victim is the one who is forced to flee.  The victim should be allowed to remain in the family home with her children and the abuser should be put out of that home.  Be that as it may and as the aim of the legislation, <Col N="58" /> there will still be a need for refuges, as there always has been.  More attention must be focused on the other services that are required in terms of counselling, etc., which accompany the issue of domestic violence.  Additional funding is needed in this area.  It should be remembered that it is not just a matter for the Minister for Equality and Law Reform but for others sitting at the Cabinet table also.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes great improvements in the law dealing with domestic violence. The provision of a safety order as a new remedy is valuable.  A woman who came to my office this week &mdash; and who has been married for over 20 years in a small town &mdash; said she did not want to throw her husband out of the house because it would badly affect the children. Yet, she has been the victim of severe verbal and psychological abuse for a long number of years.  Such a woman would consider the safety order as a remedy while finding it impossible to consider a barring order.  Our legislation should seek to deal with people who have real problems like that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extended role of the health boards in the area of domestic violence.  While some fears have been expressed at the interference of the health services in these areas, as well as the balance of rights between spouses, health boards should take a proactive role in initiating applications on behalf of a spouse or children.  We must always be careful of over indulgence in terms of how a particular family might be viewed by a health board or by social workers.  The family's rights must always be balanced.</P>
    <P>Another provision of the legislation which will be crucial if the law is to be effective is the increase in fines for breaches of orders.  It is beyond me how you can tell a man he must obey an order to keep away from his family home when he will only be fined £200 if he does not.  If we mean business we must increase fines for breaches of such orders granted by the courts.</P>
    <P>I take the point by Senator Henry that financial penalties are not always <Col N="59" /> the correct answer.  While they might hurt one's pocket, compulsory counselling or some other form of redress linked to a fine should be considered. In their youth, perpetrators of violence have often been victims themselves and they certainly need help.</P>
    <P>I want to query the grounds for renewal of a safety order or barring order because, from reading the legislation, it is not quite clear.  Does the applicant need to have fresh grounds to apply for the renewal of these orders? Must he or she have suffered recent violence to obtain a renewal of the order?  The Bill does not elaborate so I would like the Minister to come back on that matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the length of time for which barring and safety orders may be granted.  Women who obtain barring orders for one year &mdash; perhaps when family violence forced them to do so over the Christmas period &mdash; are in constant worry and turmoil knowing that they have to go to court and do it all over again the following Christmas.  The fact that such orders have now been extended to a three or five year period is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be complimented on introducing legislation with so many effective steps which can often be skipped over yet make the law more workable.  The fact that proceedings can now be combined is a practical provision. In addition, safety orders will prevent the victim from being watched over at a distance or from being followed. Up to now, women who obtained barring orders were often followed around by their spouse &mdash; when they collected the children from school, for example &mdash; who remained a constant torture to them.  That new provision is a thoughtful one.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier of the need to teach our children that violence is wrong. Another important facet of this, however, is the education of women themselves.  I was surprised when a businesswoman came to me before Christmas and asked whether her husband <Col N="60" /> had conjugal rights.  She did not know that she was entitled to refuse his advances.  This is a man who was physically violent towards her, yet she did not know what her basic rights were.</P>
    <P>Another women rang me after hearing me speak on local radio about domestic violence.  She asked me to come to her house where I found her lying on the floor, battered black and blue.  It was a vision I will never forget.  She had taken an overdose and her kids were screaming all around her.  That woman had been violently abused for at least 25 years.  To date she has still not taken out a barring order because she feels financially reliant on her husband who has worn her down psychologically.  She lacks independence.  Those type of women need to be educated about their basic rights.  They need to know that they are entitled to seek maintenance as well as a barring order.</P>
    <P>A public campaign would be helpful, but if that is not possible then extra funding should be given to women's groups for courses on how to deal with domestic violence.  We must empower women to tackle the problem themselves. Education and awareness is necessary to challenge the myths and stereotypes surrounding domestic violence.</P>
    <P>Zero tolerance is still the aim.  Meanwhile, I welcome the Bill which is an important and well thought out piece of legislation.  I know of thousands of women who are waiting for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly recommend this important Bill.  It is high time that the 1981 Act was amended and updated. I would, however, like to comment on some of the things that have been said by my colleagues, Senator Henry and Senator Gallagher.  It is neither attainable nor desirable to take the violent strain &mdash; if there is such a strain &mdash; out of mankind or womankind entirely. Senator Henry seemed to be going down that road.  No matter how much we would like to disguise it, the human being is an animal which responds to animal stimuli.  That is not an apologia <Col N="61" /> for violence to any extent.  In my book, all forms of violence are unacceptable but we must understand better the nature of mankind and womankind.  We must try to understand better why people who are living together can, on occasion, be violent towards one another.  The Minister is more familiar with the statistics than I am but I would confidently predict that domestic violence has increased in the latter half of the 20th century.  There are good and logical reasons for that.  There has been more poverty, higher expectations, greater pressures at work, greater financial pressures and unemployment.</P>
      <P>We are fooling ourselves if we suggest the Bill will eliminate domestic violence. As long as human beings exist on the planet, men and women will be violent towards each other.  This applies to all animals and not just to men being violent towards women in human society. One extreme example is the praying mantis where the female of the species consumes the male as the nuptial breakfast. I do not advocate that women should attempt to consume men as their nuptial breakfasts or that men should ever be violent towards women. However, we should try to be as realistic as possible regarding the fact that some humans are prone to violence.</P>
      <P>I read a women's magazine, <i>MarieClaire,</i> recently &mdash; I read it more than my wife &mdash; which is widely published in England, Ireland and France.  It said studies show that female spousal violence towards men in the UK has increased sixfold in the last 20 years. Perhaps it is difficult to understand how women could beat up men but it happens. It has not happened to me yet but perhaps some Senators could outline unfortunate experiences.  However, I hope it has not occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is most useful in that it will address a problem in a realistic manner. However, we should not deceive ourselves that it will eradicate domestic violence or its causes.  One of the Bill's principal features I favour is the length of time a barring or safety order will be <Col N="62" /> in effect, which is, I understand, three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Three years for a barring order and five years for a safety order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Gallagher said, women who have been subjected to spousal or other abuse worry constantly about the expiry date of barring orders, whether it is in six or 12 months. They are forced to look over their shoulders.  The Bill will ensure a longer period of time for which barring orders will be in effect and a greater sense of stability in the home, whether it is matrimonial or non matrimonial.  The Bill is realistic in that it recognises the large increase in non marital relationships. People are living together and having sexual relations both inside and outside marriage.  In many cases, people who live together are not contemplating marriage.  The Minister and Government have correctly identified that society is changing widely.</P>
      <P>As far as non spousal relationships are concerned, I understand the Bill proposes that people must have lived together for an aggregate of six months in a 12 month period to avail of the relevant measures.  I am sure there is some logic behind that timeframe or perhaps the figure was plucked from the air.  We will return to this matter on Committee Stage but I am sure the Minister will explain that feature in greater detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the role proposed for health boards to deal with vulnerable people.  The Bill's provisions in this regard are most welcome.  However, I do not want &mdash; I hope the Minister does not want it either &mdash; the development of a Rochdale type situation where over eager health boards and officers pried, sometimes unnecessarily, into the lives of adults, children and other dependent people.  In many cases, it was found that the inquiries were not justified.  I am not sure the mechanisms contained in the Bill in relation to safeguards surrounding health boards are sufficiently strong. Perhaps the Minister will consider this <Col N="63" /> aspect between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the discretion of health boards should not be fettered.  For example, in the Rosemary West case the health boards in the relevant area were notified approximately 13 times that things were perhaps going drastically wrong in that household.  However, for some reason the health authorities never successfully intervened, with terrible and tragic results.  Perhaps I misread it, but the Bill does not provide for interim safety orders.  There are measures for interim barring and protection orders and it should be possible to apply for interim safety orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>For practical purposes, a protection order would be an interim safety order.  The difference between the two is that one is permanent and the other is interim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be incorrect but that point might bear a little closer examination.</P>
      <P>The enforcement measures are the crux of this matter.  A person who breaches an order, during the full or interim stage, will only be fined £1,500 or, at the discretion of the court, receive a 12 month term of imprisonment. Under the law as it stands, the maximum custodial sentence the District Court can impose summarily is two years.  In the Bill the Minister is limited to the imposition of a two year custodial sentence in the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will debate crime this evening and I support judicial discretion regarding sentencing, but only in certain cases.  However, given this type of provision, is it possible that people who were in flagrant breach of an interim or permanent barring or protection order will emerge from the court with only a small fine of perhaps £50 or £100?  If that is the case the measure should be amended because if somebody is in breach of a barring or protection order, the taxpayer is already put to the expense of the machinery of the State <Col N="64" /> going into operation against that person. It is not good enough that a court will have the discretion to impose a small fine on somebody who is essentially in contempt of court.</P>
    <P>The matter will be discussed on Committee Stage but I ask the Minister to consider setting a minimum financial fine and custodial sentence.  I favour a minimum custodial sentence so it is plain to anybody who breaches an order of the court regarding spousal abuse that they will serve such a sentence and there will be no messing about.  Violence may be part of our nature, but it is unacceptable.  I compliment the Minister and his Department for bringing forward what is in general terms an excellent Bill which will be supported on this side of the House.  Subject to those comments I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which deals with violence in the home. This violence affects all members of the family.  In many cases the victims, usually the wife and children, suffer because the other spouse has a drink or drugs problem or may be suffering from a mental illness.  The 1981 Act did not provide enough support for these victims, nor did the Garda have proper support in dealing with them.  It is necessary to act very quickly in these situations. The Minister has addressed many of the outstanding issues in this Bill and it is most welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been looking at situations in my own area, Donegal.  For a long time there was little refuge support for women and children enduring domestic violence.  Thankfully that has changed; we have a refuge in Letterkenny and people living in Donegal who have such problems at least have some place to go. Before this refuge was available we had to depend on services in places like Derry and Coleraine.  In the past, if there was trouble in the home and the wife and children had to run away, they had to go to the North.  Over the last 18 months that situation has changed with <Col N="65" /> the support of the Department and the health board and this is most welcome.</P>
    <P>Victims need to know that help is available.  We swept this problem under the carpet for many years.  In my experience, the people who looked for help would probably approach the Garda as a last resort.  They would approach the clergy first, but in many cases the clergy did not want to get involved.  I saw women coming into the service beaten black and blue; rape was not out of the question.  I have seen massive violence against women.  I have seen psychological violence against women which drove them to have nervous breakdowns.  If this Bill helps to solve even some of those problems it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In my work I have never come across a man admitted for reasons of domestic violence; it was always females.  Their psychological mindset at the time was usually such that they accepted everything that was thrown at them and would not report the perpetrators to the Garda. People have changed over the last ten years and there is now a greater willingness to report domestic violence to the Garda, but the Garda does not have sufficient power to deal with these situations. I have spoken to a number of gardaí in this regard and they say they do not have enough powers.  I know we must guard the powers we give the Garda but there is a fear that the Garda do not have the power of arrest in that situation.</P>
    <P>I have an unhappy memory of seeing a person with a drink problem coming through the service in which I was involved.  A barring order was made against him.  He came home one night and murdered his wife.  It is impossible to allow for these things, it is impossible to keep a guard on a person 24 hours a day.  In this case, a combination of factors, including jealousy and drink, led to this tragedy.  The children were left without a father or mother.  Barring orders are breached left, right and centre. Barring orders were introduced in 1976 and were very welcome but for many years people did not use them. The gardaí are limited by their powers; <Col N="66" /> I hope this Bill gives them enough powers to deal with those cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he wondered sometimes why women did not stand up to the perpetrators of such violence.  I have seen women in fear of their lives. They are afraid to tell the authorities. They come to hospital, get counselling and try to get help.  I have even seen them being visited by the people who perpetrated the violence on them.  It is sick, although I know that often the pre-petrator is there trying to make up for what he has done.  In many cases the perpetrators are sick but many of them are not.  It is a crazy situation for any woman to find herself in.  It does lasting damage to the children and anything we can do to change that is welcome.</P>
    <P>Violence does not occur only between husband and wife, I have seen the worst forms of violence perpetrated on sons and daughters and nothing is ever done about it.  I remember another infamous case where a girl who was living with her family attempted suicide a number of times.  She came through the psychiatric service and it was discovered, after this violence had gone on for eight or nine years, that the girl was being raped by two members of her family regularly. One can understand why she wanted to take her life.  Nobody tried to investigate the circumstances of the case; all the services failed.  It may not always be possible to find out what is going on in certain homes if the person affected does not want to tell, but the psychological effects are horrific.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a move in the right direction but we must see that the punishment fits the crime.  More help is needed in cases of domestic violence, matters need to be investigated earlier when they are brought to the attention of the Garda or the health board.  That has happened to some degree through the years.  If the clergy had brought many of the cases they were told about to the attention of the authorities they might have been dealt with sooner.  I know many members of the clergy helped people.  In my home town one excellent member of the clergy went to <Col N="67" /> people's homes regularly and if alcohol was the problem convinced that person to seek help within the psychiatric service, but they did not all do it.  It is important that the punishment fits the crime.  That might mean a perpetrator has to attend the Garda station daily, but the victim at least needs to know that help is available.</P>
    <P>There is always a danger that false allegations may be made.  If a person has moved into a second relationship they may tell lies about the first.  We must have as many services as we can to see that this does not happen.  If the powers are there for the Garda, if support from the health boards and counselling services is available, this Bill will go a long way towards alleviating these problems. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister and pay tribute to him for introducing this Bill which is a significant reform of the law in relation to domestic violence. It will offer a strengthened degree of legal protection to women living in violent relationships and, in protecting women, it will also protect children.  For these reasons I wholeheartedly support the Bill.</P>
      <P>Violence against women is a social evil of the worst kind.  It is a violation of women's human rights.  It causes serious and often permanent physical and psychological harm to the women and the children affected by it.  It occurs in every class of society, right across the social spectrum; yet because it occurs behind closed doors it is one of the most difficult crimes to detect and prevent. We still do not have any national statistics showing the level of domestic violence. However, the voluntary organisations which work in this field are in no doubt that the levels are high and frightening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women's Aid, which runs a free telephone help line, receives tens of thousands of calls each year.  In the first year of its existence, the Garda special domestic violence and sexual assault unit in Dublin received over 5,000 calls.  This <Col N="68" /> figure is even more horrific in the light of international experience which shows that only between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of women who are assaulted by their partners will report the offence.</P>
    <P>For many years social attitudes and those of the Garda, the legal profession, legislators and the public to domestic violence conspired to serve the interests of the abuser, not the woman who was abused or her children.  The family home was seen as the man's personal fiefdom in which his power was absolute. Behind closed doors the man of the house had absolute rights over his wife and children.</P>
    <P>For many years women who were assaulted or abused by their husbands were expected to put up with it by society.  If they left the family home, they were often seen as having abandoned their marriage vows.  Many women who left because they were abused by their husbands were often sent back by their families.  On the other hand, women who stayed with an abusing husband, usually out of economic necessity, were assumed by many to have asked for it.  These attitudes are still alive and well and are a major underlying factor in the continuing problem of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>Róisín McDermott from Women's Aid prepared a paper on violence against women in the home.  She said that it is only when we look at the services available to women who are being physically, sexually and mentally abused that we fully understand why so many stay.  Factors which keep women in violent relationships are poverty, economic dependence and cultural attitudes which blame women and protect the offender. Our political system does not prioritise its support services, which are badly needed, and our judicial system, unfortunately, can fail to treat the issue with the seriousness it demands.  Furthermore, society often insults women by asking them why they stay instead of asking why men abuse women.</P>
    <P>All the legislation the Minister has introduced has done much to improve the lot of women in Ireland.  The provision <Col N="69" /> of additional funding to the free legal aid centres has made a huge difference to the lives of many women.  We have spoken about women in the home trying to obtain barring orders or trying to take legal action against spouses or partners abusing them.  The extension of the law centres and the shortening of the length of time women must wait to be seen by a solicitor to get their cases through the system has been a considerable help and I compliment the Minister in this regard.  I realise many areas &mdash; for example, the provision of refuges for women and changes in the education system &mdash; are within the brief of other Ministers.  I ask the Minister to raise these issues with his Cabinet colleagues because domestic violence is not only the charge of one Minister &mdash; it requires support from the Departments of Justice, Health and Education.</P>
    <P>The Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, was the first law to give a degree of protection to battered women.  It introduced new legal remedies &mdash; the protection order, which prohibited the man from using or threatening violence against his wife, and the barring order, which excludes him from the family home. These remedies were welcome and necessary in so far as they went, but they only applied to situations in which the parties were married.  People cohabiting as husband and wife or other persons living together in a domestic situation were not protected by the provisions of the Act.  This Bill is a significant reform because for the first time the deficiency in the 1981 legislation is being addressed and for that reason it is welcome.</P>
    <P>Domestic violence is a problem which will not be solved by legislative action alone.  This Bill will not stop domestic violence from occurring.  The incidence of domestic violence will only be reduced by attitudinal change.  This Bill will not assist thousands of women whose only way out of an abusive relationship is through the front door.  I am not being critical of the Bill, but I realise we must change attitudes and <Col N="70" /> look at why men batter women.  We need to educate young boys and girls about relationships and the unacceptability of violence in our society.</P>
    <P>Women who must leave their homes need a refuge &mdash; a safe place where they and their children will be protected from the abuser and where they will be helped to get their lives back on track. The greatest difficulty facing an abused woman and the voluntary agencies that work in this field is not only the lack of legal remedies, which this Bill is trying to fix, but the lack of refuge spaces. Access to adequate safe refuges is essential and if the Government is serious in its commitment to action on domestic violence it must look at this area.  Only 79 family places are available throughout the country for victims of domestic violence.  In my area of Laois-Offaly there are no refuge spaces.</P>
    <P>We may ask why do women stay, but where will they go?  Many women are financially dependent on their spouse or partner and do not have an independent means of support or access to a car to drive to a refuge in Dublin.  Many of these women do not know where refuges are located.  Research in the United Kingdom in 1978 said that a city the size of Dublin should have 100 family spaces.  Yet in 1996, it has only 79 places.  Belfast, for instance, has 104 places, which is more than in the entire country.  While it is a scandal, I do not doubt the Minister's good intentions in this regard.  I urge him to press these urgent issues with his Cabinet colleagues.</P>
    <P>The problem of domestic violence requires study, which will be difficult and demanding.  If the Government is serious about tackling this problem, it must be done.  If possible, research should be carried out on the levels of domestic violence and why men abuse women.  Women's Aid has done some analysis on this and, obviously, it would be the main party to be consulted in this regard.  We need wide-ranging educational initiatives directed at the legal and medical professions, social workers and the Garda.  Attitudes are changing <Col N="71" /> and more people are aware of the problem, but we have a long way to go. Women who leave refuges need housing and their children need intensive counselling &mdash; they need to rebuild their lives.  These issues must also be tackled.</P>
    <P>While my party welcomes the Bill, we have some difficulties with it.  The main difficulty is this.  Where parties live together as husband and wife and where the woman has no legal or beneficial interest in the home, she is precluded from applying for a barring order; neither can she apply for one in circumstances where her interest in the property is less than her partner's.  This will create a problem because many women move in with a partner permanently and they may have children together.  She has supported him in his career and has contributed directly and indirectly towards the establishment of the family yet, because the woman's name is not on the title deeds of the house or because she is not named in the lease, she has no rights whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Of course, it would be open to the court on a preliminary basis if the woman in question did have a legal or equitable interest in the home but this would confer jurisdiction on the court to proceed to hear the woman's application for a barring order.  This type of hearing would be lengthy, complex and costly and would have to take place in the Circuit Court.  It would mean additional costs and difficulty for the parties living far from the nearest Circuit Court.  More importantly, because of the continued failure of successive Governments to alleviate the appalling pressure on Circuit Family Court lists, it would mean extremely lengthy delays between the issuing of proceedings and the hearing itself.</P>
    <P>In view of the foregoing, the remedy of a barring order will not be a practical option for the vast majority of women who are cohabitating with men.  The only effective remedy for this group will be to continue to flee from the house and to seek shelter in a refuge wherever they can find one with sufficient room. <Col N="72" /> The Minister believes there will be constitutional difficulties in granting a woman an order which barred a man from property which he owns.  However, a woman's right to bodily integrity and her right to safety in her home should be superior to the property rights of the man.</P>
    <P>If there are children in the relationship they should not be forced into homelessness for the sake of the father's property rights.  Children should have a right to a safe and secure home and in such cases it should be possible for women to obtain a barring order.  My colleague, Deputy Keogh, argued strongly for this anomaly in the Bill to be dealt with in the Dáil.  I ask the Minister to look at this again so that we can protect all women from violence in their homes.  If a man is abusing the children he has brought into the world and whom he has an obligation to house and maintain, the law should have the power to exclude him from the family home on the application of the mother and irrespective of who owns the house.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty we have with this Bill relates to the powers and responsibilities of the Garda.  The Bill provides that where an officer has reasonable cause for believing that an offence under this Bill has taken place, he may arrest the alleged offender.  Women's Aid has, on a number of occasions, expressed its concern that there is a worrying lack of clarity about Garda powers of arrest in domestic violence situations.  This Bill does not clarify the situation.  Gardaí ought to be put under a positive obligation to effect an arrest where they believe a violent incident has occurred.  While the Garda have made great strides in learning about and understanding domestic violence and have, in some areas, undergone a huge change of approach in dealing with it, there are still areas in which the gardaí will refuse to arrest a husband. Imposing an obligation on the gardaí to arrest would do much to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the voluntary organisations which have campaigned tirelessly <Col N="73" /> over the years to assist and empower victims of domestic violence.  In particular, great credit is due to Women's Aid who must be congratulated on the sustained way they have campaigned for legislative and institutional reform.  Fortunately, they have encountered a sympathetic Minister which is why this Bill has seen the light of day.</P>
    <P>Women who are victims of domestic violence need this Government's support. Women's Aid, the voluntary agency dealing with such women, needs the Government's support.  They need this Bill but they need more.  They need to be given the resources they require to continue to provide refuge spaces, support, advice and counselling for women and children.  They need resources to continue their public awareness campaigns and their educational initiatives.  Their efforts to provide housing for women who leave refuges, including sheltered housing, must be supported.  This Bill is a welcome start.</P>
    <P>Róisín McDermott, in her paper on violence against women in the home, says that in Ireland women are most unsafe in their homes and are most unsafe from their husbands and partners. We must ensure that women become safe in their homes; we must stop the violence against women.  We must provide the support and information services they require and the Garda and the Judiciary must treat violence against women in the home as the serious crime it is.  As a society we must break the silence and educate; we must particularly educate our young people about violence against women.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire agus roimh an Bille.  We welcome this Bill because violence in any shape or form is not acceptable anywhere. However, many of our problems with violence today arise because we have lost respect; respect appears to be a thing of the past.  Over the past 20 years we have spent billions of pounds on <Col N="74" /> education, we have talked about rights but we have forgotten to talk about responsibilities.  Today nobody is held responsible for anything.  When we encounter violence our response is: &ldquo;God help them, they are not responsible for it; it is the society in which they were reared&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I grew up near a town 40 years ago where there were housing estates and I cannot understand the problem of violence. I had a friend who lived in Ballymun during the 1970s.  I often drove up from Sligo and arrived at Ballymun flats at 12 midnight.  I could park my car and travel up to my friend's flat in the lift.  I could leave my car there for three or four days and nobody would interfere with it.  Ballymun was an area of young people at the time.  They did not know each other and were only starting to build a community.  However, today one would not be safe going there in daylight.</P>
      <P>What has gone wrong?  There was more unemployment then than there is now.  What has gone wrong is the fact that discipline, responsibility and respect have gone out the window. Pupils no longer have respect for their teachers.  Nowadays, if a teacher says the wrong word to a child the teacher will be before the court.  If a criminal kicks the guts out of a garda and the garda retaliates, the garda will be brought before the court.  If somebody breaks into one's house and one wins the battle and puts them out, the criminal can take action against one for grievious bodily harm and damage.  The house owner is now the culprit.  Is this not where we have gone wrong over the last 20 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day discipline went out of the national school was the day we threw everything out the window.  Thank God I went to a school that had very good teachers; I could never say a bad word about any of them, although I know of people who went to schools where there were brutal teachers.  When we took over this country we threw out everything without putting anything back in. Many of our beautiful old estates were <Col N="75" /> so weighed down because of rates that people could not afford to pay them and we knocked down the lovely houses that today would be centres of architecture; we threw out or smashed everything; we parcelled out land through the Land Commission, etc.  We never looked to the future; we became a destructive society.</P>
    <P>I was born and lived quite near a pub. There was always a little family violence, nobody need say there was none, but it was only on the evening of a fair because generally there was not enough money for the abuse of alcohol.  On the evening of a fair everybody knew the man who would come home abusive and contrary but a neighbour would be in the house before he arrived.  There was community spirit then; today nobody goes into another person's house.  Now we have social classes, we are no longer families.  When I was young there was no &ldquo;kipping&rdquo; together; one was either married or one was not.  Now people are cohabiting.  We have lost all respect for ourselves and for our way of life.  Until we bring back respect we will never come to grips with violence.  Even on the worst fair day, it was a fist fight and anyone who attempted to use an ash plant would get the worst of it.  Someone would take it out of his hand, throw it away and tell him that if he wanted to fight, he should fight fairly.  There were fights in dance halls but they were always fist fights.  Now people use knives and shoes; it is all kicking and abuse.  Violence in the home involves smashing the delph, breaking everything and wrecking the house.  This was not the type of violence there was in the home when I was growing up.</P>
    <P>The greatest cause of violence is the abuse of alcohol.  It always amazes me that there is so much talk about smoking cigarettes.  A smoker will never break up a house or wrap a car around a telegraph pole but the drunkard will. We seem to be ambivalent about this; we should have stronger regulations to prevent abuse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> Violence in the home goes right across society.  We see violence in some of the best homes and those which one would think are good homes.  We see violence from people with university degrees, men and women.  There is violence not only in the ghettos or among the unemployed; it is in all strata of society.  What has gone wrong?  It is not lack of education.  In the days of matchmaking, people said we could not expect any different because couples were brought together against their will.  We were told that when people could pick their partners and make their own arrangements for getting married we would have no problems.  What is happening?</P>
    <P>It is strange that people who come from abusive families go into another abusive family.  People who leave a marriage with an alcoholic get involved with another alcoholic.  Any counsellor will tell you that they cannot come to grips with this phenomenon.  People just do not learn.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about men abusing women.  Are people living in the real world?  Many men are abused but they are afraid to talk about it.  Many men come home to learn that their wives are drunk in the pub.  That is abuse but they must look after the children and put them to bed.  I travel quite a lot and I have seen a great deal of this type of violence.</P>
    <P>Violence is not just against women or men, children are also violent towards parents.  On some American and English programmes one hears a mother saying that her seven year old son kicks her and she cannot control him.  In their time their grandmothers would have controlled them and there would be none of that nonsense.  It is time we faced reality.</P>
    <P>Television is another factor.  Even RTE is not content unless each programme contains a variety of four letter words.  It is the in thing now.  It is not entertainment unless the lowest of the low in terms of language is used.  This is another form of violence and we are accepting it on television.  We should get <Col N="77" /> back to where we were 20 years ago.  If we were back where we started in the 1970s, when no one had ever done anything, we would be a rich and wealthy country today.  There is no point in talking about how this problem started or who caused it, we are all part of it and we must try to solve it.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill because it gives the health boards a little more power. They knew things were happening but they could not go into houses to investigate or take people out of the houses. As each Bill is passed, people say we need more resources.  &ldquo;Resources&rdquo; is the buzz word which means we need more money.  Since there are only 1.5 million people working in this country, from where will the money come?  No health board will be able to implement this Bill if we do not provide more money, and that is a hard fact of life. A large amount of finance is required.  I often wonder if we ever consider where we will get the finance.  Can the Minister tell us how much it will cost to implement the provisions in this Bill?</P>
    <P>We have a problem with violence in the home and elsewhere.  People are not safe going home at night.  A person's car is safe in the Oireachtas car park but it may not be safe if parked on the street. We must do something about society but, in the meantime, we have a big problem with violence in the home between married or cohabiting couples. I can never understand why a person who is going out with another does not leave them the first time they are abused.</P>
    <P>I always advise young girls, before they even think of getting married, to visit their boyfriend's home.  The old way of judging a man's character was whether he was good to his mother.  If he is a blackguard at home, he will be a bigger blackguard to his wife.  Every girl should be told she will never change her man and every man should be told that if he is going out with a girl who is not on the same wavelength, he should forget about her.  We cannot change people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> The North-Western Health Board has done much work in this area.  I appeal to the Minister to make money available when this Bill is passed to ensure its implementation.  If he is does not, the Bill will not be worth the paper on which it is written.  Money should not be wasted on administration because it will not get to the root of the problem.  It will create more jobs for bureaucrats, the courts and judges but it will not help the people it is designed to help.</P>
    <P>We have to educate people to have respect.  At one time if a man saw a woman getting on a bus, he gave her his seat or carried her bags.  Now, a person is afraid to help a woman because he could be accused of attempting to rape or abuse her.  Fear has been driven into people.  They are afraid to buy sweets for a child in case they are accused of trying to molest them.  This fear has created a bad society.  I do not know where it will end.  Let us hope this Bill will in some way remedy the serious problem of broken marriages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be relieved to hear that I will be very brief. If I am talking at one minute to six, he can stop me.  I welcome the Bill which is a big improvement on the current situation. I will put down some amendments as will others but the Minister dealt with the amendments in the other House in a reasonable manner.  We will have a rerun of some of the arguments but it was dealt with quite cerebrally in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because there is a hideous situation in the field of domestic violence.  I would like to say that it will make a significant improvement, but I am more inclined to think, if I can speak in terms used by Garret FitzGerald, that it will slow down the rate of increase in domestic violence rather than reducing or abolishing it because the fundamental problem confronting the State is that, while we are enacting a good deal of specific legislation which is well intended and often well designed for a specific problem, it is swimming against the tide of the way general <Col N="79" /> values are going and of the impact of what may be termed &ldquo;modernity&rdquo; on society.  While the specifics are designed to try and cope with the consequences of this, we are either importing, or perhaps fostering, the types of mentalities and mindsets which can only be curbed but cannot be fundamentally changed by this.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to consider the specific proposals of the Coolock submission, many of which were based on experience, and to look at the final paragraph, even the final sentence, which made clear that it is not beginning to tackle the underlying causes, whatever they may be, but that it is preventive as far as possible and is making some attempt to ensure that when violence occurs it will not recur and to save the victims from the continued brutalisation of situations.</P>
    <P>Preventing violence from occurring in the first place and changing the mindsets of individuals is something that is very difficult to achieve through legislation. Nevertheless, if it cannot at least be assisted through legislation, it is hard to see the motives for change that are going to take place in society.</P>
    <P>Over the weekend the <i>Irish Independent</i> dealt, as did other newspapers, with those horrible recent events in County Kildare and elsewhere.  Turning to the television review, one could then read about a new programme being described in its first episode as mingling sex and violence with expertise.  This was not said in criticism, but with admiration at the technical skill of the programme. How do we convince ourselves that 100 per cent of viewers of this kind of thing will be able to distinguish in their own minds the technical virtuosity of a programme from the values contained in such virtuosity?  I do not see how we are going to be able to do this. I am not sure we even fully realise the problems involved.  I do not suggest that everybody is dominated by media images, but a sufficient proportion can be influenced by them to affect their behaviour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> I welcome the emphasis on psychological welfare, which is very important, and the emphasis on the elderly, which is also very important.  I welcome the Bill as there are a number of good things in it which we can discuss on Committee Stage.  Perhaps I am becoming more gloomy in my old age, but I welcome it almost in a Canuteian sense that it is the best that can be done against the tide that is threatening us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Lee for allowing me to conclude in what will be a very inadequate way, given the short time available to me.  I also thank all the Senators for contributing to the debate and for the broad welcome given to this legislation.  It is a subject on which Senators have strongly held views and I look forward to a constructive and informed debate on the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Domestic violence is a particularly insidious form of violence.  It is an attack in the sanctity of the home on victims of all ages and of all social classes by those to whom they are or should be closest, be it an attack by a husband on his wife, by a parent on a vulnerable child or, indeed, by an adult child on an elderly parent.  It is this combination of circumstances that generates the seemingly confused reaction of victims, which includes the desire on the one hand to stop the violence and on the other hand to protect the integrity and good name of the family unit by hiding it.  As a result many victims have suffered in silence over the years and continue to do so.</P>
      <P>The effect of this legislation largely depends, therefore, on the willingness of victims to avail of its provisions.  Thankfully, victims have shown an increased willingness to take action in recent years; however, there is a lot more work to be done.  What is needed more than anything is a change in traditional social mores, especially those governing the relationships between women and men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>References were made by many Senators &mdash; Senator McGennis, Senator <Col N="81" /> Neville, Senator Henry, Senator Honan &mdash; to the question of the funding of women's refuges.  Approximately 90 per cent of the funding for hostel facilities in women's refuges comes from the health boards.  Additional resources continue to be provided, and in the past two years emergency accommodation has been provided in Navan, Letterkenny, as referred to by Senator Maloney, and Castlebar.  In addition, the Minister for Health has provided over £500,000 to meet the running costs of the new Bray Women's Refuge and capital grants towards the development of refuges in Dublin, County Kerry, Galway and Dundalk.  In addition, increased financial support is being made available for counselling and telephone helpline services for victims of domestic violence. The Government is fully committed to the further development of appropriate services within the health areas for victims of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>During the debate reference was made, especially by Senator McGennis and Senator Henry, to the fact that the safety order remedy is limited to a respondent cohabitant with whom the applicant has lived for an aggregate period of six months during the preceding 12 month period.  The purpose of the Bill, as evidenced by the long Title, is to make provision for the protection of persons in domestic relationships.  This includes persons living together as husband and wife.  It is considered that limitations must be placed on this provision, given that the existence of a safety order renders a person liable to arrest in respect of behaviour which might not otherwise constitute any criminal offence.  Thus, if two people happened to have lived together for a period of time and subsequently break up, and have had little or no contact for a year to two, there would appear to be no good reason why the safety order remedy should be available between them without also being available in every other context of personal conflict or aggressive behaviour.  For this reason, therefore, the scope of section 2 (1) (a) <Col N="82" /> (ii) of the Bill has been limited in this way.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis, Senator Neville and Senator Henry referred to the difficulty of barring a respondent with an ownership interest in the home.  This has been a matter of much controversy in the other House and in general debate. I wish to emphasise that the need for this restriction is not of my making.  The reality is that I am advised that any proposal, no matter how framed, to bar a respondent with an ownership interest on the application of a person with any lesser interest could be open to serious constitutional challenge on the basis that it may infringe that person's property rights, which the State in its laws must respect under Article 40.3. of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, the position is different where the parties are married. Senators may wish to refer to the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, which dealt with the problem of domestic violence and which specifically recognised this difficulty.  It is a difficulty to which I have given a great deal of detailed consideration, both before the Bill was published and during its passage through the Dáil.  The crux of the matter is that the many good measures in the Bill, acknowledged by many Senators, and Deputies in the Lower House, measures which are recognised to be so badly needed, could be rendered inoperable if a provision in the Bill was found to be unconstitutional. This is a risk which I am not prepared to take.</P>
    <P>I have much pleasure in commending the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann deplores the abject failure of the Government and the Minister for Justice to respond with any adequate legislative, tactical and pragmatic measures to combat escalating crime levels throughout the country; and in particular vicious attacks on and the murder of elderly people living in rural areas; and accordingly Seanad Éireann calls upon the Government to abandon its lethargy and implement the following measures:</P>
      <P>(i)  ensure a sufficient Garda presence in rural areas;</P>
      <P>(ii)  provide adequate resources to improve community policing;</P>
      <P>(iii)  provide a sufficiency of prison places;</P>
      <P>(iv)  terminate the system of early and temporary release for habitual criminals and convicted drug traffickers;</P>
      <P>(v)  provide grant aid to the elderly living alone or with other elderly people to assist them to install Telecom Éireann's medi-alert system in their homes;</P>
      <P>(vi)  adopt Fianna Fáil Criminal Procedure Bill, 1995, and Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996; and</P>
      <P>(vii)  introduce emergency legislation to provide for minimum sentencing in respect of certain serious indictable offences including aggravated assaults on persons and drug trafficking.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="84" /> I welcome the Minister to the House. She has taken the time to give us the benefit of her knowledge and insight into the crime situation as it now pertains. I am in total agreement with her statement yesterday that the provision of prison places alone will not solve the crime crisis.  That statement should perhaps go further; neither legislation alone, nor the Garda alone, nor education or the family alone, will solve the crisis.  What we have to do in a mature and supportive way in all efforts to tackle this problem is to bring all the agencies and parts of the State and our community together to fight the problem.</P>
    <P>Tonight's motion has been put forward by the Fianna Fáil membership of Seanad Éireann.  The Minister will recall the last time we discussed a crimerelated motion in the House was the drugs debate last November.  She gently chided me for saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I will not say there is a crime crisis because I do not have to do so; the Minister claims to be in touch with people's concerns in this area and they tell us there is a crime crisis.  This is not a personal matter which only concerns the Minister or the Department of Justice; it is an issue for the entire Government.  I have not heard one member of the public who would say this Government's record on law and order is anything but abysmal.</P>

      <P>Why has it taken 12 months to make a decision on extra prison places?  Why has the Minister not yet reached a conclusion and a decision on amending our bail laws, given that she has had the Law Reform Commission <Col N="85" /> report on bail since October 1995?  Why has it taken her this long to introduce one Bill concerning criminal justice?  What has been happening for the last year?  Notwithstanding the fact that yesterday's announcement about moves to provide more prison places is welcome, or that the proposed regionalisation of the Garda Síochána is an excellent idea, the public does not have the impression &mdash; even if is the reality, which I doubt &mdash; that this Government is moving in a unified way to combat what people see as a crime crisis.</P>
      <P>I will discuss the bail system in particular. The Minister may have more accurate figures than I, but my information is that in the region of 4,416 crimes were committed by persons on bail in 1994.</P>

The figures for crimes committed while on bail have oscillated from 4,000 to 2,000 and back up to 4,000 and we can assume that for 1995 the number of crimes officially recorded as having been committed by persons on bail will be of the order of 4,000 to 5,000.  That is only reported crimes, it will not be the total number of such crimes.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister outline her intentions on reform of the bail laws?  Is she in favour of reforming them and, if so, will she introduce legislation to hold a constitutional amendment?  If she is not in favour of this proposal, will she explain her reasons?  The public <Col N="87" /> shares my belief that the Government is not united on this issue.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (v) of the motion states: &ldquo;provide grant aid to the elderly living alone or with other elderly people to assist them to install Telecom Éireann's medi-alert system in their homes.&rdquo;  Paragraph (vii) states: &ldquo;introduce emergency legislation to provide for minimum sentencing in respect of certain serious indictable offences including aggravated assaults on persons and drug trafficking.&rdquo; We have all been appalled by the recent spate of murders, rapes and assaults.  We do not know if these crimes were committed by people on remand or on bail, but we know that sometime earlier this year the State paid out substantial sums of money to the victim of a crime committed by somebody on temporary release.  We must tighten up this area.  There is widespread public alarm that many dangerous people are at large because of the temporary release scheme, the bail laws or a shortage of prison spaces.</P>
      <P>Recently the Minister for the Environment published a Bill to abolish the remaining provisions of the Malicious Injuries Acts.  The 1986 Act amended the 1981 Act and limited compensation for malicious injuries to property which was damaged as a result of riotous behaviour or events stemming from the conflict in Northern Ireland.  It is extremely insensitive to abolish that legislation.  Victims of crime need more protection, not less.  I call on the Minister for Justice to ask the Minister for the Environment to consider withdrawing that Bill because it is inappropriate to proceed with it given the current situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue called for the reintroduction of the murder squad.  Is the Minister satisfied that the present structures, resources, etc., of the Garda are adequate to deal with the current spate of vicious crimes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and I hope we will take an objective and positive approach to this issue.  The <Col N="88" /> crime wave throughout the country has reached such a critical level that it is no longer enough for any of us to bemoan the failure of the Government to take effective remedial action.  There is understandable concern for the victims and families of violent crime, particularly when they are attacked, brutalised and murdered in the sanctity of their homes.  The agony and suffering of these victims and of their grieving families demand a comprehensive and vigorous response from the Government, the Oireachtas, the courts and all law enforcement agencies.  There is growing public demand for protection and compensation for the victims of crime as well as an effective and vigorous action campaign against the criminals who are undermining the basis of our society.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has been the target of vigorous and consistent criticism. She is a victim of this outrageous surge of crime and inhumanity because the composition of this Government, especially the minority leftist elements which dominate the Government, prevent her from taking the necessary steps she wants to take.  It is outrageous that the Minister for Justice should be left in such a defenceless and helpless condition by the lack of adequate resources to implement an effective policy at all levels and by the proclaimed concern of the parties of the Left for individual rights as distinct from responsibilities and community rights, for State responsibility as distinct from individual responsibility and for agencies and advisers as distinct from family support and parental responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the roots and origins of crime are multifactorial, so also must the solution be multifactorial.  This generation has seen a preoccupation with rights as distinct from responsibility and we all pay the price for this selfish, anti-social preoccupation.  It is a great irony that when the rights of children are being proclaimed in this generation more than in any previous one, the <Col N="89" /> level of juvenile crime has soared, particularly in recent years.  Just as President Clinton proclaimed in his visit to Belfast that the children of this generation in Northern Ireland have a right to be born and raised in an environment free from terrorist violence, so too do the children of this generation throughout Ireland have the right to be born and raised in an environment free from criminal violence and abuse.</P>
      <P>From the early 1960s the courts took a radically different approach to the basic rights of citizens.  It was the era of vindication of individual rights.  A Supreme Court decision in the O'Callaghan case in 1964 struck down the long established judges' rule on bail and brought about a major change in the balance between the victim and the criminal.  The vindication of individual rights may have been appropriate in those days but it is now clear that the vindication of the most fundamental rights of all, the right to bodily integrity and the right to life, must take precedence.</P>
      <P>It is long past time for the referendum on bail to be introduced and passed to enable judges to take into account the background and character of people charged with serious offences in determining whether they should be allowed bail pending trial.  It is ludicrous that judges are only entitled to refuse bail on the grounds that a person is likely to abscond while on bail.  The decision to put this matter to the people needs no further study group, task force or Government special advisers.  It should be immediately referred to the people who will sanction the Government's authority to prevent any further abuse by offenders of the bail system at the expense of the life and limb of law abiding citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of our system must go further.  Our system of criminal procedure derives from the English common law procedure of centuries ago. This procedure is an adversarial one where the presumption of innocence against the accused is such that the burden of proof on the State prosecuting <Col N="90" /> authorities must be established beyond all reasonable doubt.  This is a heavy onus and can justify accused people remaining silent when charged with any offence.  Furthermore, it prevents the court at the trial from bringing to the attention of the jury this basic fact which it might consider in its deliberations on the guilt or innocence of the accused.</P>
    <P>Even the old common law system pointed out at the same time that an accused person who was mute of malice was not entitled to the benefit and protection of silence in the face of criminal charges.  This exception has long since passed out of our criminal procedures, which only underlines the fact that the criminal has learned all of the protections on individual rights to his advantage in a professional way.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, essential that people should not be intimidated or pressurised into making statements and that they should continue to have the right to make a voluntary statement after full professional advice, but this right should not be asserted to the point of making the offender a protected species while the unfortunate victim remains fair game.</P>
    <P>Now that we have become full and vigorous members of the European Union, is it not time that we considered the system of criminal procedure which operates by and large throughout Europe?  There is no reason for clinging slavishly to the old common law adversarial system which has proved to be inadequate in current social conditions when the much more searching and effective inquisitorial system, which is in practice in France and other European countries, seems to establish a better balance between the victim and the accused.  The preliminary procedure there of an examining magistrate conducting investigations on which he can draw conclusions for consideration at the plenary trial has certainly been more effective in the ratio of convictions to charges under that system than under our adversarial common law system.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the citizens, the State is entitled and, indeed, obliged not just to <Col N="91" /> investigate a charge but also to prosecute the people eventually charged. The presumption of innocence until proved guilty must, of course, remain; but the victims, dead and alive, of violent crime in our society have for some time now cried out for a restoration of a proper balance between the rights of offenders and those of victims.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate for me to conclude this contribution without acknowledging the fact that we have a special responsibility to young people to protect them against the spread of the virus of crime, particularly in our heavily populated cities.  Local authority housing in Ireland provides physical accommodation of an order that will not be matched in any country in Europe, many of which are much wealthier.  Due to the lack of any enlightened social policy on the part of our housing authorities, particularly in our big cities, we have created the community of crime by rehousing vulnerable groups, such as unmarried mothers, unemployed fathers, battered wives and alcoholic husbands in one major local authority housing conurbation.  The old street culture that was an effective guarantee against crime because of the community cohesion in our towns and cities has been recklessly cast aside at great cost to our society.  The mix of generations from young to grandparents and, indeed, even great-grandparents, was always a stabilising element in the streets of our towns and cities, but local authority planning has shown no awareness of this and it is time to restore the security of community in a harmonious blend of youth and age, of employed and unemployed and of healthy and disabled in our housing programme.  This requires a radical change in our housing allocation system which can only react to the benefit of all, young and old, in an integrated and harmonious society. What I am talking about is the need for radical change in all our procedures, including criminal procedures.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>

      <P>&mdash;notes the determination of the Garda Síochána to bring the perpetrators to justice and supports the Garda strategies recently put in place in the West of Ireland to combat attacks on the elderly in rural areas;</P>
      <P>&mdash;commends and supports the Government and the Minister for Justice on the series of measures approved by the Government on 30th January, 1996 to provide additional prison places both in the immediate and in the longer term;</P>
      <P>&mdash;recognises that the crime problem must be tackled in a co-ordinated and structured way and that the fundamental causes must be addressed;</P>
      <P>&mdash;commends and supports the Minister for Justice on the measures she has already taken, and proposes to take, to provide the Garda Síochána with the resources necessary to prevent and detect all forms of crime;</P>
      <P>&mdash;notes the measures being taken by the Minister for Justice to tackle the drug problem in the prison system;</P>
      <P>&mdash;welcomes the establishment of the Working Group on a Courts Commission which is carrying out a major reappraisal of the organisation and structure of the Courts including an examination of establishing an independent body with financial and management autonomy; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" />&mdash;welcomes the administrative and procedural reforms introduced by the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, which will maximise the resources of the Courts and enhance the overall efficiency of the system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There has been an unacceptable level of crime in society for many years and everything must be done to control and reduce it.  People must feel safe in their homes and the State has a duty to protect people and ensure they feel safe in their homes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice's announcement yesterday is a worthwhile step on that path and must be welcomed by everybody.  In particular, the provision of 278 places in the next 18 months, 223 of them in 1996, is a positive step towards solving the problem.  This also includes the provision of a new wing at Limerick Prison which will provide an additional 55 places and I welcome this, in particular, because I have communicated with the Minister on that matter.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the editorial in today's <i>Irish Independent.</i> It states:</P>
    <P>Additional prison space will mean the end of the revolving door system which saw people serving only a fraction of their time because other prisoners were turning up on the doorstep.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on what the <i>Irish Independent</i> refers to as the end of the revolving door system by virtue of her decision yesterday.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the decision to take advantage of the opportunity for better use of prison space as presented by the peace process.  As a consequence of the move to Castlerea and following some internal adjustments, 105 places will be available at Portlaoise Prison.  This policy in the treatment of republican prisoners is in stark contrast to the approach of the British Government, which has introduced a much harsher and cruel regime for Irish political prisoners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> I congratulate the Garda on the efficiency with which it has introduced &ldquo;Operation Shannon&rdquo; to detect the cruel, ruthless, inhuman and vile criminals who attack the elderly in their homes in the west.  The people there are looking carefully at this operation.  Two elderly people in my parish in Limerick were attacked in their home some six weeks or two months ago and we are carefully watching the situation.  The actions of the Garda has engendered a belief that something is now being done and there is growing confidence in the system that this vile approach to the elderly will now be stopped.</P>
    <P>Crime against the elderly, where people are maimed and killed, is new and has become more frequent.  There are drug related problems and offences in every village.  I welcome the approach the Minister has taken to this and look forward to the introduction of the measures which she announced previously. There is a shortage of money to feed the habits of drug users and there is a general belief that old people have money hidden and do not use banks.</P>
    <P>The perception is often put abroad that the high level of unemployment and changes in society are contributory factors to the increasing level of crime. While there may be some truth in this, we must at all times ensure that we uphold the position that the criminal is responsible for his or her acts.  Civil rights should favour the victim.  Society must be protected from those who commit violent crime and the punishment must fit the crime.  People who decide to commit violent crime must be responsible for their actions and drugs or alcohol must never be accepted as an excuse.</P>
    <P>Crime has changed over the past ten years and is now more nasty and violent. Criminals hand out violence for no special reason.  There has been an alarming growth in sex crimes, which must be targeted with the same level of efficiency as the present approach to what has taken place in the west.</P>
    <P>I want to refer especially to a short important statement which the Minister <Col N="95" /> made yesterday.  She referred to the importance of the wider response to crime, which, she said, cannot be over-stressed. She said:</P>
    <P>We need, as a society, to reawaken our tradition of caring for those around us; our neighbours, those who are alone; the infirm; the elderly.</P>
    <P>The value of positive voluntary input is enormous.  We need also to coordinate input by educators, by health workers and other welfare agencies if we are to ensure that today's child-at-risk will not become tomorrow's threat to society.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil motion calls on the Government to ensure a sufficient Garda presence in rural areas, but they did not do so when they were in power. The motion calls for the provision of adequate resources to improve community policing.  Why was that not done before last year?  They seek the provision of sufficient prison places.  Why was that not done?  I could read the list of measures and ask why each one was not done when Fianna Fáil was in power.</P>
    <P>On that last provision, I want to refer to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 6 August 1993, which states that up to 200 new prison places are to be created by the Government at Wheatfield Prison in Dublin.  It adds:</P>
    <P>In order to speed up such a building programme while keeping initial costs down, the Minister for Justice, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, is giving consideration to the possibility of employing a lease-back arrangement with private sector builders . . .</P>
    <P>A Government spokesman said the Minister for Justice would like to see work on the new building programme start later this year or early next year . . .</P>
    <P>There has been growing criticism . . . . of what has been described as &ldquo;a revolving-door&rdquo; prison system, under which some prisoners are released prematurely in order to make way for <Col N="96" /> others.  The lack of prison space has also given way to a practice whereby criminals are charged and immediately released, pending a hearing of the cases in court.</P>
    <P>What happened up until the end of 1994?</P>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 7 August, 1993 an article entitled &ldquo;Prison doors will keep revolving&rdquo; stated:</P>
    <P>With the announcement that up to 200 new places are to be created at Wheatfield prison in Dublin, the Government have moved to ease pressure on an overcrowded system that is bursting at the seams.</P>
    <P>But it will also be hoping that the plan will stem the public's growing realisation that the duration of custodial sentences handed down by the courts often bears little resemblance to the length of time convicted criminals spend in prison...</P>
    <P>The result is that prisoners &mdash; with the exception of sex offenders and subversives &mdash; are released early to make way for newcomers.  Dozens walk free every day, according to prison sources, long before they have completed their sentences ... many are simply released to relieve overcrowding, often having served terms measured in days.</P>
    <P>Given the political implications of convicted offenders, some of whom have committed serious crimes, walking the streets, it is hardly surprising that official statistics are hard to come by.</P>
    <P>What happened between then and the end of 1994?</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another article from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24 July 1993 relating to Limerick.  Senator Mulcahy has great concern for crime committed by people on temporary release from prison.</P>
    <P>[A named person], one of two young women charged last weekend with the murder of [a named person] in Limerick city, was on temporary release from Limerick Prison at the time of the crime.  [She] was granted <Col N="97" /> the temporary release by the prison section of the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State for Justice, Mr. Willie O'Dea, told <i>The Irish Times</i> that he did not make representations to have [the person] released during the period of the crime.  He had made representations to the prison section of the Department of Justice to have her temporarily released some six weeks earlier, he said. . . .</P>
    <P>She was discharged on temporary release on 2 July . . .  The prison authorities were contacted on July 5th by telephone to have an extension of the temporary release.  This was granted until July 8th.  She returned from temporary release at 6 p.m. on July 8th and was granted a further temporary release at 2.50 p.m. on July 9th.  [She] returned from the temporary release at 5.05 p.m. on July 13th according to the prison records.  She was granted another temporary release at 5.20 p.m. the same day . . . until July 16th.</P>
    <P>There were three other releases and she committed murder while out on release.</P>
    <P>Everything is now being blamed on the Minister for Justice.  We are being told the present situation has gone out of order since this Minister took office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little upset by the Senator's contribution.  As an Independent Member I have seen the to and fro of debate in the House.  The present incumbent of the office of Minister was as good at giving it out to her predecessors. We might learn one small lesson &mdash; the rate or state of crime does not increase or decrease with Ministers, rather there is a plan that is worked towards.  The justification that matters were no better under a previous Minister than they are at present brings politics into disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is the politician who is answerable.  She has to take the stick at this time and she knows that as well as everyone.  We must adopt the approach that any attempt to personalise the matter or blame it on the <Col N="98" /> party in Government is wrong.  We lose credibility with the public if we try to introduce to the debate the idea that for some reason there is more crime now because somebody else was in Government or that if another party was in Government there would be an immediate drop in the crime rate.  The voters are not stupid and we need to catch ourselves on.  The Minister for Justice has to take blame for things that go wrong and if things go right the Minister can take credit &mdash; that is the nature of her job.</P>
    <P>The Government has made mistakes and the alarms initiative in the budget is one example &mdash; it is a disaster.  I live in the country and I have had an alarm on my house for the last ten years.  During that time I have been burgled seven to ten times.  Alarms are not a cure for all ills.  The initiative was an elastoplast idea that someone thought should be included in the budget.  The Minister should admit it has been a disaster; it has not worked, so let us move on from it.</P>
    <P>We need to introduce a little common sense into how we deal with the issue and respond to it.  Speaker after speaker has put the view that there is a way to stop crime and we can then end the ills of society.  Crime and violence are simply the effects and we have to examine the causes, whether of violent crime against the person or drug abuse.  There are people in the Government who think there is a way of stopping the supply of drugs and thereby curing the drugs problem.  There are even more foolish people in the Government &mdash; I heard one of them speak recently &mdash; who feel that if the supply of drugs is stopped people would not make or design any more of them.  As long as such thinking is involved and the Department of Justice allows Ministers to believe that one can control the supply of drugs or stop crime simply by looking at the impact of crime and addressing violence with roadblocks &mdash; although such measures are welcome &mdash; we will not stop the causes of crime.  We need to go back much further.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> I ask the Minister to give a commitment that all our legislation should make a clear distinction between crimes against the person and crimes against property.  There is a difference and people feel the robbery of money is not nearly as important as old people being put in fear of their lives and being unable to face the world as they had been.  Crime against the person is the issue for the voters.</P>
    <P>From a teacher's point of view the recent upsurge of crime makes it imperative to recognise the intrinsic link between educational disadvantage and crime.  This week a 16 year old girl has been questioned by the Garda about a brutal murder.  I am not saying who is guilty or innocent in the case; that is for the courts to decide in time.  The relevant fact is that a 16 year old girl has been questioned.  That is what has changed in society.  We have to ask why and where it changed.</P>
    <P>The Minister's new proposals include a constitutional referendum to allow changes to be made.  It is a progressive and welcome idea but it fails to address the obvious root causes.  The Minister should look at another aspect of the Constitution that has been ignored by every Government since the Constitution came into effect.  There is a requirement in the Constitution that every child gets a minimum level of education. Many Governments tried to pass a law to establish the minimum level of education.  The intervention of right-wing, reactionary groups, Church groups in particular, challenged the constitutionality of the legislation in court as an interruption of family life and it was not passed.  Consequently, that constitutional imperative has never been dealt with.</P>
    <P>In any move to eliminate crime we need to focus in the first place on identifying the areas, social conditions, ages and immediate causes which generally tend to provide the genesis and the ambience of crime.  If it is a fact that most of our prison population comes from the same identifiable areas of our <Col N="100" /> cities, is there not a question we need to ask?  In many cases it might be nearly cheaper to build walls around some housing estates because we have abandoned them.  Children are born without an innate tendency towards crime or violence.  Something happens between the time they are born and the time they commit crime to lead them in that direction and we are not intervening soon enough.</P>
    <P>The School Attendance Act only takes effect for children aged six or older.  On occasion I have gone into the background of some of the most high level and vicious crimes committed &mdash; crimes of brutality committed by people in their twenties against other people.  In four cases over the last four years, involving people whose names may be familiar to Members, the teacher who taught each of the offenders at infant level pointed out to somebody in authority that there was a problem.  The number of deaths caused by those four people is very close to ten, with multiple deaths in three cases.  There is something wrong with a society which cannot deal with that.  It is not just a matter of putting more gardaí on the beat but of dealing with uncontrollable, vicious five year olds who need treatment and counselling. I do not have time to develop some of the other areas but early intervention is essential; we need to get to the root and genesis of crime.</P>
    <P>I will be voting against the Minister tonight as a protest about all these issues.  I do not subscribe to the view that she is personally responsible for the crime wave or that crime levels worsened with the coming to power of this Government &mdash; if those who are now in Opposition were in power tonight I would vote the same way.  This is a crucial issue and we are not addressing it. We need to get back to basics and to intervene at a much earlier stage when the professionals &mdash; teachers, social workers, psychologists, gardaí, probation officers or home visitors &mdash; identify a problem.  I urge the Minister to take that on board.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate.  I thank Senator O'Kennedy, who is an experienced Member of this and the other House, for his very thoughtful remarks which contrasted with those of the younger, less experienced Member who opened the debate. I also thank Senator O'Toole, who is also an experienced Member of this House, for his non-partisan approach.  I would like this debate to continue in the vein begun by Senator O'Kennedy and continued by Senator O'Toole.</P>
      <P>Senator Neville wisely tried to point out how little changed the situation is from a couple of years ago and how quickly people's memories fade and fail with the passage of time.  In the 1994 Official Report when a Progressive Democrat Bill was put before the House, the then Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, said much of what I am now being heavily criticised for saying by members of her party.  There is a touch of <i>déjà vu</i> about this as we have seen and heard it all before.</P>
      <P>Some very practical and realistic debates take place in this House.  That is not to say that they do not take place in the other House, but this forum tends to allow for a more realistic debate at times.  I thank those Senators who spoke in a measured way and highlighted the fact that these problems did not begin today or yesterday.  I thank Senator O'Toole for highlighting the fact that the matter is one of social and public health which requires a multi agency approach.  Senators Neville and Mulcahy also made that point.  It is important to have a realistic approach to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to express my deepest sympathy to the victims of recent horrific attacks and to the relatives and friends of those who have lost their lives in such tragic and awful circumstances.  I assure them that all necessary Garda resources will be allocated to finding the perpetrators and bringing them to justice. We know that one person has been taken into custody.  He will be taken through the system of justice and it is <Col N="102" /> not right for any of us to decide now whether he is guilty.  I am very concerned about the apprehension and fear which recent events have engendered in the community and I will continue to take the steps open to me to allay those fears.  However, I wish to open my response to this motion by making a plea for a degree of honesty and realism.</P>
    <P>Wrongdoing is a part of the human condition and its extent is governed by the nature of the society in which we live.  It is not just one or two factors which contribute to crime, but a range of influences whose complexity and interrelationship have teased and exercised the professional skills of sociologists and criminologists for years.  It is extremely dishonest to pretend that the problems are of recent origin.  It is dishonest to pretend that we have moved within the past week or one, two, three or four years from a way of life in this country characterised by absolute tranquillity, perfect order and model citizenship to one characterised by chaos, anarchy and the total breakdown of law and order.  Neither the former nor latter pictures accord with reality.</P>
    <P>The false impression that the move from tranquillity to disorder has been both sudden and unprecedented may make &ldquo;good copy&rdquo;&mdash; of which there has been plenty &mdash; and could even provide the temptation to engage in opportunistic political gamesmanship, but is far from being honest and has nothing to do with reality.  In the end, it serves only to scare rather than help those about whom we claim to be concerned. That is unforgivable.  It is heartening to note that some of the more thoughtful media commentators and politicians, over the past few days in particular, have acknowledged that hysterical reaction simply preys on vulnerability and drives fear beyond all reasonable bounds.</P>
    <P>I believe that realism is required on two broad fronts.  First, is the reality that the problem of crime cannot be addressed successfully in the longer term by relying exclusively on law and <Col N="103" /> order responses.  We all know that, even as we debate here tonight, there are children of tender years in the community who, because of today's neglect, will be tomorrow's criminals.  We must, as a society, find ways to help them now before they, like many thousands before them, turn their anger on their fellow citizens.  It will be too late when the law and order system intervenes.</P>
    <P>We all have responsibility for the kind of society we have built up; we must look at the elements in that society which cause crime and see what we can do about it.  We must then take the necessary action to address the elements which lead to the kind of crime we are witnessing today.  That means starting well before today's child becomes tomorrow's threat to society.  It requires considerable voluntary as well as official help and intervention, and the reawakening and co-ordination of caring instincts in society as a whole.  The law and order system, however efficient, cannot meet the challenge on its own. We are all challenged and must accept that challenge.</P>
    <P>The second reality is one which I, in common with all my predecessors, have talked about several times, both inside and outside the Oireachtas.  It is absolutely essential, if one is to address any problem, to begin by looking objectively and dispassionately at the actual facts. I am not talking about the facts as we imagine them to be, or as some would misleadingly wish to present them, but the actual facts about crime.  The statistical data available to me do not support the suggestion that we are caught in an unprecedented crime wave.  I know that statistical data are no consolation to the victims of the crimes which have occurred, and I am not suggesting for one moment that they ought to be, however, if we are to tackle the problem we must do so with a clear understanding of the facts.</P>
    <P>During 1995 crime increased by an estimated 1 per cent compared with 1994.  The increase in Dublin was, in fact, an estimated 4 per cent with a <Col N="104" /> reduction of 2 per cent outside Dublin. The overall increase of 1 per cent compares with an overall increase of 2 per cent in 1994 and 4 per cent in 1993.</P>
    <P>Horrific as recent crimes have been, it is sadly the case that they are not unprecedented.  In the case of attacks on the elderly, the basic fact I want to mention is that in 1984 there were 432 attacks where the injured party was 65 years or over living in a remote area. Garda action, supported by the rural community, succeeded in reducing that number to 118 in 1988 and a low of 66 in 1991 and 1992.  There is evidence of a recent overall increase in such crimes but nothing approaching the 1984 level.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the commission of serious crime involving the use of firearms decreased from 723 in 1993 &mdash; comprising 593 aggravated burglaries involving firearms and 130 robberies involving firearms &mdash; to 582 in 1994 &mdash; 403 aggravated burglaries involving firearms and 179 robberies involving firearms. This downward trend continued in 1995 with an estimated decrease of 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is true that there are also extremely worrying upward trends within the category of crime involving offences against the person.  It is clear, for example, that there has been a very large increase in the level of reported sexual crime, including rape.  Reports of rape doubled during the period 1990 to 1994.  In the latter year, 184 rapes were reported to the gardaí and this upward trend is continuing. Provisional figures for 1995 &mdash; I stress that these have yet to be finalised &mdash; indicate that the number of reported rapes increased by 28 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that these statistics can be put down simply to a greater willingness on the part of rape victims generally to report such offences.  While this may be a factor, it seems reasonable to assume that the real, underlying trend is towards a higher incidence of abuse.</P>
    <P>Sex offending, by its very nature, is very difficult to prevent and is sometimes quite difficult to detect.  It occurs at all levels and among all classes in <Col N="105" /> society.  The laws are comprehensive and quite stern, and the attitude towards those imprisoned for sex offending is strict &mdash; they are not, for example, among the categories who would be considered automatically for early release concessions.  I have asked my Department to produce a paper on further options that may be open in terms of law reform in this area and I hope to publish that paper in the near future.</P>
    <P>Probably the most seriously misleading piece of information which has got about, in recent times, is that homicides have rocketed out of all proportion.  It is an allegation devoid of substance. Last year I launched a Department of Justice study on homicide in Ireland in the period 1972 to 1991.  The author of the study &mdash; Dr. Enda Dooley &mdash; discovered that, while violent crime had increased over the period in question, this had not been mirrored by an increase in the overall homicide rate.  In fact, the actual figures were remarkably consistent throughout the years covered by the study.  A further point worth noting is that the homicide rate here was the lowest of 11 other European jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>There was an increase in the number of homicides towards the latter half of 1995 and that is obviously a cause for concern.  However, the fact remains that, considered professionally over a 20 year period, the basic finding is that our homicide rate is relatively stable and well below European levels.</P>
    <P>While emphasising, as I have, the need for honesty and realism, and the need to avoid unnecessary scare-mongering, there is no doubt that, at present, some specific law and order responses are called for and I now wish to deal with these.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recent spate of savage crime, I have had detailed discussions with the Garda Commissioner. A specific issue in these discussions was that of resources.  I can again advise the House that I have been assured by the commissioner that he has all the resources he needs to respond to the <Col N="106" /> problem.  I am aware that, from time to time, suggestions to the contrary are made &mdash; sometimes by anonymous Garda sources, sometimes by Garda representative associations.  However, like my predecessors, I must rely on the advice of the commissioner who is head of the police force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be aware that at the weekend, the commissioner put in place a special rural crime task force.  This has already involved intensive Garda activity in western counties with widespread and mobile road-checks accompanied by air surveillance provided by the Army-Air Corps.  Every possible resource is being directed to apprehending the perpetrators of recent killings and the hunt for them will continue until they are found and brought to justice.</P>
      <P>The House will also be aware that at a meeting of the Government yesterday, Tuesday, 30 January 1996, I received the approval of the Government for a series of measures to tackle crime &mdash; immediately and in the longer term.  Those measures include the provision of 278 prison places during the next 18 months by making 223 additional places available in 1996 &mdash; including the return to use of 30 places in St. Patrick's Institution and making a further 55 places available within 18 months; agreement for further expansion of prison accommodation with the immediate recommencement of the planning and development on the women's prison in Dublin and on the remainder of the site at Castlerea for prison purposes; implementation of the Garda restructuring plan &mdash; regionalisation &mdash; as a result of the appointment, by the Government, of four new assistant commissioners and the allocation of assistant commissioners to head the five new regions and approval for the appointment of new judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go any further I believe it correct to dispose of the suggestion that <Col N="107" /> yesterday's decisions are the first that have been taken by me and the Government to address law and order issues. Since taking office, I have also taken the following measures to assist the Garda response to crime.</P>
    <P>I have secured the approval of Government for a comprehensive set of measures to take on the drug traffickers and intensify the fight against drugs. The measures being implemented are as follows: the Garda national drugs unit has been established; the memorandum of understanding between the gardaí and the Customs and Excise has been signed and will lead to enhanced liaison arrangements between the two agencies and allow for the setting up of the joint task force for particular operations; the National Co-ordinating Committee, chaired by Deputy Brian O'Shea, Minister of State at the Department of Health, has been re-established, the committee has established two new subcommittees to deal with the supply and demand aspects of the problem.  That committee could have been re-established at any time during the past four or five years, but it was not; the position regarding dance hall and public house licences has been reviewed and the relevant legislation is being updated; the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill will be published shortly; additional powers will be given to Customs and Naval Service personnel; the review by the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners of certain Law Reform Commission recommendations regarding co-operation between the two agencies will be completed in the near future; the issue of drugs in prison is being attended to urgently and my colleague, Deputy Howlin, the Minister for Health will be bringing forward&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All these measures add up to substantial action which could have been taken years ago.  These measures represent the most radical, comprehensive and integrated plan ever put in place to deal with the problem. They show the determination of the Government to deal with drugs and those who engage in this evil traffic. That determination includes all parties in Government and I refute the contention that some members of the Government are soft on some areas of crime.  I know because I am on the inside looking out.</P>
      <P>As far as the Garda Síochána is concerned, I have taken some very important steps to enhance its effectiveness.  I have already referred to the regional command structure in this regard.  I agreed to put the new structure in place specifically to deal more effectively with determined and ruthless criminal gangs which are highly mobile and equipped with the best technology. There are no shortages for the criminals. They have the best of cars and if they do not have them they steal them. The new command structure will provide the Garda Síochána with a much greater operational focus in terms of its leadership and will provide for a much more co-ordinated and cohesive approach on a cross-division basis in tackling all facets of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, of course, the fight against crime is not just a matter for the Garda alone. The whole community has a critical part to play.  This community effort is best <Col N="109" /> reflected in the excellent work being done by members of the 800 community alert schemes and the 1,946 neighbourhood watch schemes which are operating throughout the country. Based on research carried out on the crime levels for the three year period before and after the community alert scheme was established, the following results were recorded: a 17 per cent decrease in attacks on the elderly; a 25 per cent decrease in burglaries; and a 21 per cent decrease in other crimes.</P>
    <P>These results convinced me that further support should be given to the community alert schemes, and in this regard I informed Muintir na Tíre at a meeting earlier this month that I would make £50,000 available to provide them with the resources to significantly expand the number of community alert schemes in operation.  In response to their request, I also told them they could come back to me with any further proposals they might have.</P>
    <P>Returning briefly to the question of prisoners, I would like to refer in particular to the question of temporary release of offenders.  The statutory authority for the release of most sentenced prisoners rests with the Minister for Justice under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  That Act came into force in 1960, not in 1995 as some people would contend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It even predates that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Temporary release is, in effect, our system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems in similar jurisdictions worldwide and has been used extensively by all Ministers for Justice since 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that all Members of this House are aware that I receive frequent representations from Deputies and Senators from all parties on behalf of individual offenders seeking temporary release.  In many of these cases the representations concern offenders serving sentences for very serious offences, often involving violence.  While the temporary <Col N="110" /> release system has attracted considerable controversy recently, I still believe it is soundly based.  I am aware, however &mdash; and again it did not happen recently &mdash; that due to a shortage of prison accommodation some offenders are granted temporary release earlier than would otherwise be the case.  Indeed, when Deputy McDowell moved his Bill in 1994 he made exactly the same case and I quote from column 1650 of the Official Report of 14 June 1994:</P>
    <P>It is a fact, and one we will have to face up to, that many people are released from prison simply because a batch of remand prisoners is sent from courts to Mountjoy and room has to be made.</P>
    <P>So, the then Minister had also to contend with those kind of allegations.  I hope that the provision of additional prison places which I referred to earlier will go a long way to rectifying the present problems in this regard.</P>
    <P>The House will, I am sure, be aware of my efforts to address the problem of drugs in prisons &mdash; I have spoken about it here &mdash; and the management of addicted offenders.  In addition to recent successful measures to prevent smuggling of drugs into prisons, a secure drugs free unit will be opened in Mountjoy in March 1996.  This will incorporate a strict drug urinalysis (testing) programme which will enable the prison authorities to accommodate those prisoners who do not have a background of drug abuse, or who have decided to opt out of the drugs culture, in a drugs free environment within the prison.</P>
    <P>In April 1996, a new drug treatment facility at Mountjoy will provide prisoners with an opportunity to avail of controlled detoxification and methadone maintenance programmes.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of prisons, which has probably attracted more attention than any of the other decisions I announced yesterday, let me deal with the suggestion from some quarters that it is simply a &ldquo;knee-jerk&rdquo; reaction to the problems we face.  There are three brief <Col N="111" /> comments I would make.  First, it is hardly rational to demand more prison places and then proceed to argue, when they are delivered, that it is simply a &ldquo;knee-jerk&rdquo; reaction.  Second, anybody who believes that you can overnight, or in a week or month, produce an extensive package for prison places, such as I announced yesterday, can feel quite secure in the knowledge that he or she knows precious little about the operation of a prison service.  I refer here to some of the more experienced Members of this House who have served as Ministers. They will know that it is not possible to provide a package like that as simply a &ldquo;knee-jerk&rdquo; reaction.  Third, I have made it abundantly clear in everything that I have said &mdash; and I do so now again &mdash; that prison places alone will not solve all our problems.  More than once I have made the point that without a broadly based response to crime we will not, as a society, win the battle.</P>
    <P>I have outlined some of the actions which the Government has been taking, and is continuing to take, in dealing with crime and criminals.  In concluding I would urge all Members of this House to send out at least one positive message to the general public.  We should make it clear that as responsible politicians we will not allow ourselves to play games with the fears of the vulnerable in our society for political advantage.  We should give the unequivocal message that we are united in our resolve to tackle crime in all its forms.</P>

      <P>I join with other Members of the House in welcoming the Minister for Justice.  I have no doubt the Minister is as concerned about the crime situation as anybody else.  Unfortunately, the public perception at the moment, rightly or wrongly, is that there seems to have been a lack of activity. There are some facts to back that up. My party has submitted a motion under a number of headings, asking for certain measures to be taken.  Some of those were addressed in the Minister's statement of yesterday.  The background to this debate is the great fear that exists in the community because of the breakdown of law and order and the lack of respect for persons and property.  It is now accepted that on any given day in the media one is liable to hear of more heinous crimes.</P>

    <P>This debate is important in that it provides elected representatives with the opportunity to air what has been brought to their attention.  It is generally accepted on both sides of the House that at any one time, up to 1,000 people who should be in jail are out and about. Some perhaps do not pose a major threat to society, but the courts convicted them and imposed jail sentences. In some cases I question whether a jail sentence is merited &mdash; for example, where four members of a family are fined £35 for not having car insurance.  I cannot see the logic of taking up the time of gardaí and using public money to ferry four members of a family to Dublin for the sake of £35 or £50 fines. The prison authorities usually must pay the train fares of the gardaí for the return journey and give them a subsistence allowance also.  This is not of benefit to the convicted person or the State. It is an imposition on the State and it <Col N="113" /> suffers a major loss financially and in terms of the time of highly qualified, experienced and highly paid gardaí who could be addressing other crime matters.</P>
    <P>It is now generally accepted that the number of young people, from the ages of 12 to 19, involved in crime has increased dramatically.  In the past many people who found themselves slightly outside the law spent time in industrial schools.  This is no longer the case and the lack of that facility was not addressed in recent years.  The industrial school system was not beneficial in all cases but probably was so in some cases. However, the lack of this option was not addressed to any great extent and this aspect should be tackled.</P>
    <P>Through the years the psychiatric service also dealt with many social cases involving people who were just outside the law.  People were dealt with medically rather than through civil law and many were incarcerated in psychiatric institutions.  This system was phased out some years ago but no alternative was considered.  These two aspects have led to crowding in the system in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Minister is attempting to address the provision of extra prison places for people convicted of crimes.  It is totally inappropriate that such people are roaming the streets because no prison space is available for them.  The revolving door or temporary release is not an answer to the problem; it plays into the hands of criminals.  They know prison places are not available to cater for them and so what if they are caught again because they will not spend much time in jail one way or the other.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned the bail system.  It is obnoxious that people commit crimes while on bail.  It is a dreadful reflection on the system and I hope this matter will be addressed.  The Garda Síochána is involved in many areas in which it should not be involved.  In particular, the amount of Garda time taken up with administration and clerical work is unnecessary.  It is a waste of manpower; I mentioned this aspect previously. <Col N="114" /> The work of the Garda in licensing matters, fines and other areas could easily be done by others.  For example, gardaí sit in barracks waiting for people to sign on for unemployment assistance.  Why is a member of the Garda required to oversee that type of procedure?  It should be done by somebody from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>There was uproar in my county at the time of the Government decision in 1995 to postpone or defer the construction of a prison in Castlerea.  The general opinion of groups representing the local community was that they had taken the prison project on board on the basis that it would address problems associated with crime and be of financial benefit to County Roscommon and Castlerea.  This may not have been a major reason to provide a prison but it was considered a fact of life.  It was proposed to close a hospital and a hotel to accommodate the project.  The general view in Castlerea and the county is that not only have they lost a hospital and hotel but also a prison.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the direction of the debate.  Members are concentrating on a multi layered approach rather than an initial, although necessary, urgent response to the provision of prison places and extra gardaí and judges. However, the more fundamental aspects of the issue must be examined also.  We will not do the public any favours if we do not look to the future in addition to considering the horrific violent crimes which occurred in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>The Minister made it clear that her response to the Cabinet yesterday is not the end or beginning of her efforts. Many measures have been taken already and will continue to be taken; there is continuing reaction to the problem. There is no doubt that we live in a violent society and there have been many disturbing manifestations of this recently.  Politicians and the media face a dilemma in terms of how to respond to those incidents and I am not sure of the answer to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been very moved by some responses, such as that of Ms Mary Cummins in <i>The Irish Times</i> and the people who wrote to her regarding the fears of women in a violent society.  I was particularly moved by the story of Mr. Pat Gardiner on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night.  I am not sure how many Members saw the programme but that gentleman's experience and his description of it was most frightening and moving. However, the people watching that programme <Col N="116" /> were more likely to have been elderly people living alone &mdash; I happened to have been on my own when I was watching it &mdash; rather than those who perpetrate such crimes.  People are afraid and we should not add to that fear.  I do not know how we should deal with it because the individual stories must be told, but at the same time we should not concentrate too much on the individual stories because they make people even more frightened.  We have to concentrate on practical responses rather than heightening fears.</P>
    <P>Everybody in this House has attended public meetings in the last few weeks on responses to crime.  People have been very responsible, they have tried to find solutions in co-operation with politicians and the Garda and that is the kind of response they want from us as well.  It has to be a positive response and we should not be party political about it.  Having said that, I have to respond to the direct allegations that were made in relation to my party.  I am glad the Minister has clarified that nobody in the Government is soft on crime.  I am sure Senator Sherlock will answer for his own party but the Labour Party has always responded to proposals made by successive Ministers for Justice in relation to crime and will respond to whatever proposals are put forward in relation to bail.</P>
    <P>I was confused by Senator O'Kennedy's points in relation to parental responsibility and individualism.  This stress on the individual is more right wing than left wing.  Left wing parties are much stronger on social solidarity. The growth of materialism, which I see as right wing, is part of the whole problem of violence because there is more materialism, more goodies are shown on television and so on.  People want them and that is part of the situation as well. I know there is no answer to that.  I had intended, before I ever heard Senator O'Kennedy, to express my concern about the need for parents to be involved.</P>
    <P>There is a need to separate the different types of crime being committed.  The <Col N="117" /> hardened criminals who are operating at present should be locked away for a very long time.  They should be dealt with differently from young offenders. We will be doing a great service to the future if we can put responses in place for young offenders; I very much welcome Senator O'Toole's contribution in that regard.  I had underlined an announcement that the Minister made on 5 December 1995 in relation to bringing forward legislation on juvenile justice.  The Minister will not have an opportunity to respond to the debate but I would like to know what progress is being made with this because it proposes that parents be involved in dealing with young offenders and emphasises the need to deal with young offenders in such a way as to prevent them from reoffending.  This legislation should give young offenders and their parents the kind of support that will ensure they do not develop into the kind of hardened criminals who are operating at present.</P>
    <P>The kind of measures Senator O'Toole was talking about in relation to education tie into that strategy.  There is a need for the provision of a psychological service in school and there is a need to invest money in education.  It is important that the juvenile offender is dealt with in a preventative way; we must take action in that regard.  Perhaps the Minister can tell me after the debate what progress is being made in regard to the juvenile justice legislation, which I understand is being drafted at present. We need to separate young offenders from hardened offenders who need to be locked up.  We need to focus on what happens in prisons when people go to prison and what is done to lessen their chances of re-offending when they come out.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures the Minister has announced in relation to freeing up Garda time, which is important.  The Criminal Justice Bill will change court procedures so that gardaí will not have to spend so much time in court.  Electronic fingerprinting and other measures which she has indicated mean <Col N="118" /> that something which took 500 manhours to do before can now be done in ten minutes.  We need to look at what gardaí will be able to do with their time, at how their time is used.  We can talk about the number of gardaí but it is also important that we ensure that what the gardaí are doing with their time is valuable in combating crime.</P>
    <P>I support Senator O'Toole in what he said that crimes against the person have to be of paramount importance.  They should have priority over any kind of crimes against property.  The perpetrators of crimes against the person must be treated as severely as we can possibly treat them so that we value human life more than we value property.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Sullivan that a total Garda time budget should be devised to see what the allocation of Garda time resources is.  The bail laws have to be amended, unusual though it is to cast Mr. de Valera in the guise of a liberal junkie whose Constitution was far too solicitous of individual liberties. I welcome what the Minister said about sexual crimes.  She is right and I applaud her for not taking the easy way out by saying this is simply an increase in reporting; the increase in this type of crime reflects a fundamental change in the nature of our society and I applaud her for recognising that.  On the other hand I thought she passed over a little too easily the quite sharp rise in murders in 1995.  As I understand it the rise has been something of the order of 50 per cent on a year to year basis and if <Col N="119" /> that were sustained it would be a dreadful increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us say that if the worst case scenario were sustained it would be a dreadful shift in trajectory.  I hope this will not be the case.  There is cause for concern there, but we are not a violent society.  We have not historically been a violent society, much though it may have suited some to present us in that guise for the sake of denigrating us.  We may very well become a violent society, however.  This is where I have a problem with the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>After diagnosing that wrongdoing is part of the human condition and that the extent of it is governed by the nature of the society in which we live &mdash; I agree very much with her in that regard &mdash; she goes on to make comparable statements, such as that we all bear responsibility for the kind of society we have to build up and that reversing this or even stopping it requires a reawakening, in co-ordination, of caring instincts.  The rest of her speech then concentrates on what can be done to curb crime on a justice basis.  I know it is not her responsibility to take the totality of view but her introduction would lead one to suggest that there ought to be a mechanism for taking the totality of view and it should not be left simply to the Department of Justice to cope with the fallout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see much evidence that any of us have any idea how we restore society, if &ldquo;restore&rdquo; is the word.  I agree that there was never an idyll in the past but there has been a change in the tone of our society.  There is a growing coarsening of behaviour patterns and I see that continuing inexorably in the light of the influences on us, many of which are imported, many of which we choose to <Col N="120" /> domesticate, some we may try to reject and fail to do so; but it depends very much on our own value system.  That is why even though I approve of the specific measures the Minister is undertaking and which have been suggested by Senator O'Toole and by others here, I do not repose an immense degree of confidence in their capacity to resolve the core of the problem, which comes from our mindset and our value system. Unless we have some idea of how to foster a value system which rejects this type of behaviour we will be running hard to stand still.</P>
    <P>I quoted from a newspaper in the last debate and I will quote again, because it suggests the dichotomy in our minds that we are up against.  After deploring the hideous murders in Kildare for a couple of pages, the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 27 January, in its review of the television programmes for the week, described the first episode of a new programme, &ldquo;Murder One&rdquo;, as having &ldquo;mingled sex and violence with expertise&rdquo;. That was not presented in order to denounce it.  I am not singling that comment out, it is absolutely standard for the type of comment that is made on media presentations in this country to which our young people are exposed for an even longer period than they are to school education if one looks at the number hours they spend in the classroom and the television room over the year.</P>
    <P>If we continue to divide these two areas and look at one as if it is somehow unconnected with real life, we will foster an atmosphere which is conducive to a small, but crucial group, behaving in a manner which is damaging to us.  We are not simply confronting the behaviour of a group of individuals, but the mind-set of society as a whole and we cannot shirk that.  I do not know what the Government can do about it, but it must at least face it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Government can do either, but I will make some suggestions.  I support the Minister because I believe she is taking <Col N="121" /> the right steps to support the Garda.  I approve of good management practice and the new structure of the Garda, which seems to be in the right direction. If we are to support the Garda, we can do so in three ways.  The first is structure, to which the Minister referred.  The second is the bail laws.  Four months is enough to consider the report of the Law Reform Commission which lasted 18 months; five months would test us but six months would be far too long and we would regard it as procrastination. We need a better bail law system.</P>
      <P>The third way we can help the Garda is with modern equipment.  I was delighted to read about electronic fingerprinting.  We should bring in electronic tagging when we introduce new bail laws.  This would ensure that people on bail would not need to be incarcerated, but could remain at home.  Electronic tagging, which could be done voluntarily, works in other parts of the world and we can make it work.</P>
      <P>I would like to list steps which the Minister could take in the justice area which would help the Garda to enforce the law in relation to serious criminals who offend time after time.  I do not understand why we have a right to silence, which does not apply in the case of drink driving.  We do not have the right to refuse to take urine or blood tests.  If we refuse to take them, the judge may assume from that a certain degree of guilt.  This should also apply where a criminal refuses to answer for his whereabouts when a crime was committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda are unable to hold someone for questioning &mdash; even if they are sure that a few hours of questioning would enable them to determine guilt &mdash; for longer than six hours unless under the Offences Against the State Act. That Act is only enforceable if a firearm is used.  If machete or a knife has been used in a murder, the suspected person must be released within six hours; but if a pellet gun has been used, the Garda may hold them for 48 hours which <Col N="122" /> would give them the opportunity for more questioning.</P>
    <P>Last week I was in the United States, where an execution took place.  The execution was by firing squad and because of that it received a certain amount of publicity.  I do not believe in capital or corporal punishment.  Our crime rate is lower than that in the United States, which has much tougher laws.  I support what the Minister is doing rather than birching and other efforts which have been getting publicity in the past week.</P>

      <P>By and large, we have had a reasonably balanced debate and some useful suggestions have been brought forward.  I would like to knock on the head the idea that things have become radically worse since the Minister took office.  There is no doubt that recent events, including vicious assaults and murders, have sent a wave of revulsion through the country.  As Senator Lee said, a certain malaise has appeared over a period of time.  We must extend our sympathies to the families who have been affected.  Action is required and I am glad the Minister has taken a broad approach and has implemented a series of measures, which will be followed by more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of bail has been mentioned. I, and I am sure others, would <Col N="123" /> have supported the Supreme Court decision on bail 30 years ago.  However, tremendous changes have taken place since.  It is interesting to note that the increase in crimes committed by people on bail began in the early 1990s.  In 1990 some 2,494 crimes were committed by people on bail, while in 1991 the figure was 2,690; in 1992 it was 2,791, in 1993 it was 3,191 and in 1994 it was 4,416.  It did not happen in the past 12 months and that should be remembered.</P>
    <P>Various measures must be implemented.  Prisons must be examined and I welcome the provision of extra places.  Obviously, the question of who is in prison must be addressed.  Some people are in prison for non payment of debts, yet there are better ways to address this issue.  If a debt needs to be paid, perhaps it could be deducted from a person's wages or welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Some Members mentioned the manner in which the media have treated this issue.  We must also address the question of violence on our screens and how it affects young people and influences crimes against women.  Last week on television a Dublin District Justice, with a strong record, was interviewed.  People outside the court were also interviewed and it was as if it was a virtue to be up in court.  They were almost applauding the fact that they were out on bail after committing crimes.  The media have a role to play, although in recent weeks one would think that crimes have only begun to be committed in this country. There are almost pull out supplements in newspapers on crime.</P>
    <P>We must also look at victim support and I welcome what the Minister said about Muintir na Tíre.  There is no doubt victims are forgotten at times.  I pay tribute to the members of the Garda Síochána and the Army.  I hope the progress which has been made, particularly in relation to recent horrific crime, will be maintained.  Society must respond and assist the Garda.  I support the Minister and the amendment to this motion.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that Fianna Fáil, the main Opposition party, did not congratulate the Minister on introducing a comprehensive package. This is what they have been talking about since the change of Government. All they did in Government was talk about it and they have continued talking about it in Opposition.  The Minister has, in the last week, brought forward a comprehensive plan which deals with every aspect of the problem from prison spaces and reorganising the Garda Síochána to appointing judges who, we hope, will stay for a while.  In reply the Minister has received a sad barrage from elected representatives who criticise her for taking action in the interests of the people.  Does that make sense?  It makes no sense to me.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal briefly with Castlerea prison as I am from that part of the country.  The Minister came to Castlerea last year and told the people that she was reviewing the overall situation in the context of the peace process.  It was anticipated that extra places might become available in existing prisons and a decision would be made about Castlerea.  The Minister has kept her word on that within the time limit she set then.  She has now announced almost 300 new prison places.  It is not something to celebrate but it is a sign of where our society is going.  It certainly does not warrant the Opposition party coming into the Chamber to decry the Minister.  They are running with certain elements of the popular media which are fired up by certain pals of a political party.  However, other people in the media are more responsible and they have come forward in the last few weeks to say that it is up to all politicians to have the guts to stand up and support a Minister for Justice who is keeping society together.</P>

      <P>I have a particular responsibility this evening as I am from Kildare where one of the murders took place.  It is appropriate that the House should send its condolences to the Quinn family on the appalling tragedy. It has been the practice of the House in respect of Northern Ireland to extend condolences where atrocities have taken place.  What took place in Kildare was an atrocity; the quality of the suffering of the family concerned is no different from the quality of the suffering of the families of those who died in Northern Ireland.  From that point of view it is appropriate for the House to express its sympathy to the family.  I was at the funeral last Saturday morning.  It was a traumatic experience which left one numb and shocked.  The whole community was shocked.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate the Garda on how they responded and the civil defence and Defence Forces which assisted the gardaí.  Happily there has been an arrest although we will not prejudge the outcome of the judicial process.  However, we should thank the Garda on that account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that lurid language has been used about these matters.  It is most unfortunate that, perhaps, it takes incidents of this magnitude to produce the type of response we have seen over the <Col N="126" /> past few days both at political and media levels.  We should reflect on that. When things are normal we should be working just as hard as when things are abnormal to address these evils within our society.</P>
    <P>I hope to adopt the moderate tone which the Minister sought from us in her address.  I welcome her actions in respect of prison places.  It is a step forward. However, the Minister would agree that it is only part of the picture and no more than that.  Solving the problem will require a deeper and more meaningful response.  I welcome the fact that there will be more judges but I am not sure that the queues will get shorter.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a particular incident which involved a serious assault.  The family concerned travelled over 100 miles to the court proceedings but the case was adjourned.  The person who had been assaulted carried out his duty to society by identifying the criminal and by being prepared to give evidence. However, when he arrived in court the matter was adjourned and the offender was let out on bail.  These were ordinary country people who have, for generations, respected the law and had confidence in the law.  My worry is not about the people who have no respect for the law but about the undermining of confidence in the law on the part of people who have for generations respected it and upheld the values which we believe to be important in a civilised society.</P>
    <P>The most harebrained initiative was the alarm tax relief which the Minister for Finance introduced in the budget.  In the first place, the number of people in this category who would have taxable incomes is minuscule.  Second, because of where these people live, the only creatures who would hear the alarms are sheep.  I do not understand the logic behind the proposal; it strikes me as the logic of a civil servant living in a built up area in Dublin.  With regard to making recommendations, my recommendations would be similar to those of Senator Quinn.  Fingerprinting has been suggested.  It is quite conceivable that the entire population could be fingerprinted <Col N="127" />&mdash; people who are law abiding would have no difficulty about that &mdash; so that there could be a register of fingerprints.  The part-time reserve has been spoken about before and might need to be looked at again.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats can claim a certain consistency on this issue.  We had a motion before the House in 1994 and a Fine Gael Senator &mdash; who I will not name because I wish to underline a point to which the Minister has also referred &mdash; said: &ldquo;Fine Gael supports most of what is contained in the motion. Most of its points are part and parcel of our policy.  We favour reform of the bail laws.  We called on the Government to hold a referendum on them on 9 June to coincide with the European and urban elections.  Such a referendum would be worthwhile.  I believe most people would support reform of these laws.&rdquo; My point is the same as the Minister's &mdash; we change places and the dance continues. However, I am not seeking to denigrate the efforts being made.</P>
    <P>There is another proposal regarding the six hours which the gardaí can use when questioning suspects.  It should be a good deal longer and that suggestion has been made to me by the gardaí.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I welcome the package she announced yesterday.  It is a long awaited measure in the fight against escalating crime.  The provision of new prison spaces will be welcomed by all law abiding citizens.  Developing a detention centre for paramilitary prisoners in Castlerea and the freeing up of prison places in Portlaoise are also welcome. When is it planned to have these places available?  The planned regionalisation of the Garda Síochána should improve its operational effectiveness. That reorganisation and the appointment of extra judges are welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is widespread concern at the level of violent crime in our society at present.  The reality experienced by some of our citizens is quite <Col N="128" /> frightening and we must address that fear.  It is not acceptable that women feel they can no longer walk freely in the streets of our towns and cities without being attacked or, in some terrible cases, raped and murdered.  It is not acceptable that the most vulnerable group in our society, the elderly, are living in fear in their homes.  It is an outrage that 1,000 convicted criminals, including perpetrators of very violent crimes, are allowed to walk free having served only a portion of their sentences.</P>
    <P>We all accept that morale in the Garda Síochána is quite low at present. The Force is trying to cope with an unprecedented level of violent crime and, at the same time, they see many of their efforts come to naught when criminals who have been convicted are allowed to walk free under this crazy system of temporary release.  I ask the Minister to bring forward proposals to end this continuing, chaotic and unregulated system of temporary release.</P>

      <P>I am glad to be able to say at the outset that the Fianna Fáil motion has been overtaken by the Minister's announcement of a major anti-crime package which we welcome wholeheartedly.  The crime wave did not break out suddenly a year ago.  If that were the case, the remedies would be much easier.  Long-term unemployment, demographic and social changes, serious town planning mistakes in the 1960s, trends in popular culture and a variety of other factors have combined to create a climate conducive to crime.  I wish that the crime problem could simply be solved by increasing prison places, and the Minister mentioned yesterday that the number of prison places will be increased to 278.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on her action and statement that in so far as the Garda Síochána is concerned, she has <Col N="129" /> taken some very important steps to enhance its effectiveness.  That is the language that I like to hear the Minister speak.  In the city and county of Cork, the dogs in the street know that for the last decade the gardaí have not been doing their duty in many instances.  We have seen people walk free from the courts because they belonged to a certain class which gave them influence.  Others could see this quite clearly.  There must be a clear message that crime in any shape or form will not be tolerated and perpetrators must be brought to justice. Justice must not alone be done but must be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the measures the Minister mentioned will help to alleviate the current situation and reassure the public, but they address the symptoms rather than the cause of crime.  We need, and I believe this Government can deliver, a long-term co-ordinated response to the underlying social disintegration which is contributing to the spiralling crime rate.  The recent attacks on people in their homes and on the elderly in rural areas have been particularly horrifying.  Nobody will forget the battered and bruised features of old people throughout the country who have been abused and tortured by sadistic thugs.</P>
    <P>Rural Ireland must have manned rural Garda stations.  It is not good enough to police an area from a centre, such as the main town, without having police on the ground.  In the towns of north Cork there are policemen paid by this State who are working for employers.  I do not know whether that is well known but I am stating it here publicly.  I have said it publicly locally and will never be afraid to say it publicly. It is not good enough.  We want to see the police on the street doing the duty which this State is paying them to do.  There have been many instances which have made people very cynical about the way justice is administered in this country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the task force on security for the elderly announced by the leader of Democratic Left, the Minister for <Col N="130" /> Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  The needs of older people must be addressed in a coherent and integrated fashion and I look forward to the task force's conclusions in that regard.</P>
    <P>Any response to the current crime wave must also address the underlying problems such as poverty, social exclusion and low educational attainments. I am quite satisfied that this Government is addressing the issues in an integrated and coherent manner and that we will get the desired results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Sherlock for affording me the opportunity to speak in this debate.  It must be most frustrating for Fianna Fáil to table a motion and find that, within days, it is obsolete.  I take the opportunity to compliment the Minister for Justice on producing an extraordinarily detailed package to deal with crime in this country. It is absolutely spurious for anyone to suggest that she or the Government are responding in a knee jerk fashion to the crime situation which has developed in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>The package is detailed and wide-ranging. It deals specifically with prison places and I am delighted that in 1996 she will be providing 223 additional places.  I commend the Minister for reopening the women's prison in Mountjoy, Dublin and getting it back on the agenda.  Her proposals relating to Garda administration, particularly the appointment of Assistant Commissioners in five districts across the country, are most welcome.  They will lead to far more effective Garda management, accountability, reaction and decision making in relation to specific problems which arise in areas.  The Government approval for the appointment of new judges will also help the fight against crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a previous occasion we have discussed the drugs situation.  The Minister has put on record some of the work she has done and proposes to do in this area.  I am delighted that she was able to announce details of a comprehensive <Col N="131" /> programme to counteract drug trafficking, which is extremely welcome.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago she met with Muintir na Tíre to discuss the community alert scheme and granted £50,000 towards that scheme, which is also welcome.  My colleague, Senator Hayes, who will not get an opportunity to speak tonight, was anxious to put on record the effect of community policing in the urban areas. It has operated successfully because people are there on the ground identifying those generating problems.  It has been most successful and I suggest that the Minister's Department give this area more attention in the future.</P>
    <P>It must be put on record that since the community alert scheme was established there has been a 17 per cent decrease in attacks on the elderly, a 25 per cent decrease in burglaries and a 21 per cent decrease in other crimes.  That is something which must be highlighted and articulated across the country to remove the fear that some people have tried to generate in the minds and hearts of older people in particular. There has been a substantial decrease in the level of crime and the fear that has gripped this country over the past few weeks, generated particularly by certain elements of the media, must be condemned. The Government, and the Minister in particularly, has done extraordinarily good work in an extraordinary short space of time.</P>
    <P>It is particularly interesting to note that Fianna Fáil did not include the bail issue in their motion but nevertheless some of their members are crying about it on local radio.  This is despite the fact of having spoken and voted against it in the Dáil just two years ago.</P>

      <P>I want to take up two or three points.  I agree with Senator O'Toole and Senator Dardis about the <Col N="132" /> £800 grant which I think is ridiculous. This task force on security for the elderly is completely out of touch.  If the Minister wants to do something for these people, she should give them £300 for the Telecom Éireann medi-alert.  I know this proposal did not come from the Minister but rather from the Trotsky branch of the Government.  I was surprised to hear a Member say that the Garda turn a blind eye to certain people.  I cannot believe that and I have nothing but the highest respect for the gardaí in this country.</P>

      <P>I withdraw the remark. There were some points in the Minister's speech which I want to mention. The Minister said that our homicide rate is relatively stable and well below European levels.  This is good, but a little complacent, especially if one tells it to the family of somebody who was murdered recently.  One murder is one murder too much.  I do not blame the Minister. I am glad to see her responding finally to calls from the Opposition parties and to calls from the public and I laud her for what she has done today.</P>
      <P>There are reports of a doubling in the rate of rape crimes and an increase in sex crimes, yet a member of the Government is legalising pornography, which demeans women.  The Minister is aware that most of those involved in sex crimes have large collections of pornography.</P>

I agree with her, and we should support her in this.  However, we need help from the Departments of Health, Education, Social Welfare and Justice acting together.  The Minister has made a good point on this aspect, and we must all co-operate in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some understanding of the position in which the Minister finds herself because I was in a Government at a time when there was a series of attacks on elderly people in the west of Ireland.  Unfortunately, at the time we did not get very much co-operation from the Opposition.  I recall many occasions, as I am sure can many Senators, when we almost hounded out of the other House by the Opposition, led by Deputy Jim Mitchell, a former Minister for Justice.  There is a very serious problem to be addressed and we all have an obligation, regardless of what side of the House we are on, to offer suggestions to the Minister as to how best to deal with this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the series of attacks and robberies on isolated houses in the west of Ireland, <Col N="134" /> especially in my own area.  Three people living near to me were broken into and robbed in the past year or so.  Their main complaint was that after the event occurred they received very little help or advice.  Many were left in a devastated situation, with their life savings being taken.  Senator Taylor-Quinn knows the people concerned.  My own neighbour was broken into and robbed and was devastated for months on end afterwards.</P>
    <P>None of these cases was resolved.  In one instance it was found that a bunch of renegades were on the rampage from Cork city.  They had stolen a car, embarked on a series of robberies, but were let out on bail.  They went to court, however, and one took the rap for the others who walked clear.  People are very concerned about the issue of bail. Although the Minister advises it is under consideration, it is time to have it dealt with.</P>
    <P>One other alarming point that has come to my attention is that in recent days shotguns have been purchased by people in the west who are now terrified. This is something that must be examined as it is undesirable that people are buying them.  If the Minister has any information on this development I would appreciate some details. The demand for shotguns is escalating at an alarming rate.  Some of them would be held illegally.</P>
    <P>There has also been an alarming increase in the number of young people involved in drugs, especially in the west. We have all known for years that many of the problems associated with breakins, robberies and attacks in this and other cities were drug related.  It is a scandal to see that this pattern will be repeated in the small towns of the west of Ireland.  Even in some of our second level schools in west County Clare recently, young students in first year were exchanging drugs, something we never saw before.  It will have alarming consequences for the young people concerned and their parents.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that people be assisted in the areas where they have been <Col N="135" /> attacked, robbed and relieved of all of their possessions.  This includes helping them afterwards, inserting security equipment or helping to provide whatever may be needed.  The questions of drugs, especially in second level schools and other institutions, including drugs coming from Dublin every weekend to west County Clare, must also be addressed.</P>
    <P>We are in a critical situation.  I would be the last to attempt to score any political points on this issue.  We are in a serious downward spiral at present and all of us have an obligation to assist the Minister in ensuring that matters are resolved.</P>

      <P>I will not rise to the bait offered me by the Minister at the beginning of her contribution as this subject is far too serious for that.  The central point the Minister appeared to make was that this is a problem that has newly arrived.  She appears to be comparing herself to her predecessors.  However, she has said, on the record, that the buck stops with her. She cannot avoid the fact that during 1995 she did not introduce one piece of criminal justice legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Coveney, to the House. This gives me an opportunity to speak on this important issue.</P>
      <P>I have been involved in cross-Border work for 19 years and I am aware of the different fundings which are available and of the statements made by the President of the United States and the delegations from America who are trying to help the North and the southern Border counties.  I know that the International Fund for Ireland is divided on a 25:75 basis and that the Delors package is divided on a 80:20 basis.</P>
      <P>The southern Border counties are in danger of losing out because the national development plan, which was drawn up before the ceasefire in the North, includes little funding for them on the grounds that they receive INTERREG funding.  The INTERREG programme has been widened to include harbours, but it is of little value to the Border counties.  The Government is using INTERREG funding as a substitute for other funding and that is unacceptable to members of local authorities in Donegal and the other Border counties.</P>
      <P>I was at a meeting in Donegal on 27 October last when the Taoiseach said there would be no additional funding because it was important that Exchequer funds meet the Maastricht criteria.  Since then the Minister for Finance made a different statement in Monaghan.  He realised that the Taoiseach's statement of the 27 October in Letterkenny had been seen by the Commissioner for Regional Development and had not gone down too well because the funding from Europe and elsewhere has been allocated purely on the basis of additionality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sought this matter on the Adjournment in order to clarify this question because the people of the Border counties of every political persuasion are <Col N="140" /> aware of the current situation and the chickens will come home to roost pretty quickly.  For example, County Donegal was allocated £2 million for roads in 1995, but it lost £2 million because the normal allocation for roads was reduced by that amount.  The Government cannot continue to do this in the hope that it will not have serious consequences for the Border counties.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the stage where setting up a business in any of the southern Border counties is a totally unattractive proposition.  It hurts me to say this because I may help to spread the bad news.  Throughout the 25 years of hostilities in the North, the British Government paid compensation on the spot for all the deprivation which had taken place.  Belfast is now the focus of the International Fund for Ireland, the Delors package and the peace and reconciliation fund and related announcements are made in Belfast.</P>
    <P>Even at the Washington Conference, which was attended by huge numbers of northern local authority members, Baroness Denton, representing the British Government, said that she appreciated the work and contribution of the American people, the US Government and President and called on the gathering to give a round of applause.  About 90 per cent of the people present were from the North and they stood and applauded in appreciation for the funding which was coming to the North.  We had a Minister there too but he did not stand and say that we in the southern Border counties also appreciate what the American people and the President have done for the southern Border counties.  This is consistent with the lack of awareness of the needs and deprivation in the southern Border counties over the last 25 years.</P>
    <P>Look at the record of American companies and of those setting up businesses. The six Border counties account for about 11 per cent of start-ups.  At present, it is much more attractive to set up in Northern Ireland.  If a derelict site is classified as a bombed site there, one can get a start-up grant of £50,000. <Col N="141" /> There are no such benefits or schemes here and we have nothing on the ground that works.  I am involved in a county enterprise board which must submit to the Department of Finance even a small grant of £1,500 along with a tax-clearance certificate.  How long would it take to get £1,500 on the dole?  A few weeks, and one would not need a tax-clearance certificate, etc.</P>
    <P>The situation is serious.  I do not understand why the Government does not recognise that there is no point expecting funding from the Delors package, the fund for peace and reconciliation or anywhere else if matching funding is not put in place.  The Minister for Finance said in Monaghan there would be additionality.  Can the Minister present say that there will be additionality and that there will not be substitution, because that is what this is all about?</P>
    <P>I met the Commissioner for Regional Development, Ms Wulf-Mathies, on three occasions and she said that my problem was not with her but with the Minister for Finance and the Government. She said that the Government would have to re-examine the national development plan and reallocate funds for the southern Border counties.  She was quite open about it.  She even said that there was a lot of &ldquo;ring-fencing&rdquo; going on.  This is a new word which she had learned from Irish politicians.  Will the Minister recognise that there is a serious problem?</P>
    <P>According to a letter from the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, it was agreed at a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 21 October 1987:</P>
    <P>Both Governments have decided to press ahead with this [cross-Border] study because they recognise that the problems of the area are enormous and cannot be effectively tackled by either Government acting in isolation.</P>
    <P>In another letter in response to my request for funding on behalf of the cross-Border group on 20 August 1985, <Col N="142" /> the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry, stated:</P>
    <P>This lack of financial additionality is a major drawback from the Government's point of view in so far as an integrated operation is concerned. It could in practice lead to a situation where the existing receipts from Structural Funds would be over concentrated on certain areas at the expense of broader national development priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry because I have a lot to say and would like to continue.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jacques Santer, to tell him that at a meeting in Letterkenny, County Donegal, the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, to our great shock &ldquo;advised the Group that there would be no additionalities from EU funding.  This means that hundreds of applications under the INTERREG II Provision will be of no benefit to the border counties &mdash; the same applies to the Cohesion Fund&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have a problem.  I am just one of a number of public representatives who have met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Northern ministers and, as I said, the Commissioner for Regional Development on three occasions.  There is a lack of intent here and I ask the Government, the Minister for Finance or someone within the structure of administration here to demonstrate clearly that it is intended to make matching funds available on the ground.  Sadly, I do not believe there is such an intent at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority of which I am a member and the other Border counties have spent a lot of money employing consultants to put detailed plans together and to submit them to Government. We await its response.  Will funding <Col N="143" /> be made available for the Border counties?  I must put it as bluntly as that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Senator on the way he has put his case.  In addition to expenditure under the Community Support Framework operational programmes and from the Community initiatives, the Border region, comprising the six counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo, is benefiting specifically from the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties and the Ireland &mdash; Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme 1994-99.</P>
      <P>Under the peace programme a total of ECU300 million &mdash; approximately £240 million &mdash; of EU funds is being provided over the period 1995-97.  At least 20 per cent of these funds amounting to approximately £48 million is being made available for the six Border counties.  Under INTERREG II a total of £125 million of EU funds has been allocated to the Border counties and Northern Ireland for cross-Border projects in infrastructure, environmental protection, natural resources, human resources and economic development. Of this amount £72 million, significantly over half of the EU funding approved, has been made available for the six Border counties and, as in the case of the peace programme, where matching funding is required it will be provided by central Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure under the peace programme and INTERREG II will be additional to spending in the Border counties under the 1994-99 CSF operational programmes for Ireland and under other Community initiatives.  In order to verify this additionality the Department of Finance has requested Departments to compile details of forecast expenditure under each operational programme and community initiatives for each of the eight regions.  These forecasts, which are now being finalised, will provide the baseline reference data <Col N="144" /> for establishing additionality of expenditure under the INTERREG II and the peace programme over the period of these programmes.  I can assure the Senator that procedures are being put in place to ensure that additionality of funding under INTERREG II and the peace programme will be verifiable and transparent.</P>
    <P>In the context of the peace programme the Department of Finance has asked Departments responsible for CSF operational programmes to examine the possibilities for refocusing these programmes in order to accommodate the new demands and challenges which have arisen following the cessation of violence.  While a major recasting of operational programmes should not prove necessary, Departments are expected to examine possibilities such as advancing the timing of projects located within the Border region and increased opportunities for cross-Border co-operation.</P>
    <P>The programme is very much a bottom-up programme and every effort is being made to ensure that local groups have the maximum input into the delivery of the programme.  The bulk of the programme will be delivered by intermediary bodies funded by way of global grant.  The programme was agreed with the Commission last summer and global grant agreement with the various intermediary bodies is now finalised.  Applications already received are at present undergoing assessment and funds are expected to flow shortly.</P>
    <P>Approval of applications under the INTERREG II programme has already commenced.  I would remind the Senator that an INTERREG office was established in Monaghan last October and an INTERREG development officer has been appointed with the specific remit of assisting with the promotion of this programme on the ground both in the Border counties and in Northern Ireland.  He will also inform interested groups and individuals on other sources of EU funding for their particular projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to stand for election in Roscommon; I have no electoral interests of any description in Roscommon.  I feel that somebody has to help shout for County Roscommon &mdash; the people believe they are getting a hard deal from the Government.  In welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, I put my hand out to him as a fellow trade unionist and tell him I am about job creation, in an environmentally friendly way with proper access and development for the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>There is no marina in the Roscommon area of the River Shannon.  In 1995 65,000 tourists passed through the area &mdash; these are the Department's figures &mdash; and there were 500 new boats on the Shannon in the last year.  This led to an increasing demand for support services. The project I am supporting and asking the Minister to approve would have spin-off effects in boat building and chandler activities, restaurants and bars.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to respond in the context of the general &ldquo;saving the west&rdquo; approach.  This project involves local people looking at their area to see how it can be exploited in a way that is environmentally friendly and ties in with Government policy.  This project is supported by Ireland West Tourism, the Aughrim-Kilmore Association, the Roscommon County Enterprise Board and many other groups.  It also has the full support of the local people who see in this project a way of resuscitating their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="146" /> Apparently the local roadway is causing some concern to the Office of Public Works.  It is concerned the road would damage the canal and the bank.  We do not wish to propose a project that would damage the environment, the canal or the area.  However, these are technical difficulties to which it must be possible to find technical solutions.  If the road to the site near the marina is in the wrong place for accepted and understood environmental, technical and engineering reasons, the proposer of the project is prepared to build a new road in a different location which will not create that problem.  If the Minister finds it impossible to take that additional information on board in his answer, I ask that the proposer and supporters of the project be given an opportunity to make their case to the Minister and the Office of Public Works.  I have the highest respect and regard for the judgment of those in the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>This project could be of great value to an area where there is no industry.  It is indicative of a community looking after itself; it is developing from what is in the community.  The site is centrally located in relation to expansion into the Erne system.  It gives an opening to a midland rural county in the west to create up to ten jobs almost immediately and more could follow.  I ask the Minister to give the matter the fullest consideration, that the response of the person making the proposal be listened to and that we take the project on board with the technical advice of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Toole for sharing his time with me.  I support the case he has made.  The location of this development is at Moy-glass, Kilmore, County Roscommon, and it consists of the provision of a marina which will cater for approximately 70 boats or cruisers.  The development is supported by Ireland West Tourism, the Roscommon County Enterprise Board and by local community development organisations.  I would have thought that the Office of Public Works would be <Col N="147" /> very supportive of the proposed development in this location and would try to facilitate in every way possible the developer, who does not wish to do anything detrimental to the area.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that if this development is allowed to proceed it will result in job creation and an economic boost to a very deprived area of the west.  If the small towns and villages along the Shannon are to benefit from the increased cruiser and boat traffic on the Shannon, then local entrepreneurs will have to be encouraged and assisted to provide the services for which there is a demand.  I urge the Minister to ask the Office of Public Works to enter into positive discussions with the developer with a view to sorting out the difficulties and problems which have arisen so that this development can proceed.</P>
      <P>If it is not possible, as Senator O'Toole said, to use the existing Office of Public Works roadway, the developer is prepared to provide a new roadway which will give access to the development. However, that roadway would have to be constructed over waste ground owned by the Office of Public Works.  These problems are not beyond the capability of engineers and technicians to solve and this matter can be resolved in a positive and constructive manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome my colleague and friend, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, and thank Senator O'Toole for the opportunity to speak on this issue.  An individual raised this project with me as I passed through a lock one sunny Sunday afternoon.  I had an initial discussion with him and it seemed a very good idea.  He gave me a list of reasons it should go ahead and I concurred with most of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lacking the expertise to decide if it was an operation which could go ahead immediately, I said I would refer back to the Office of Public Works and check out the technical feasibility of the project. I subsequently had a discussion with the Office of Public Works and <Col N="148" /> received a very positive reaction, although it voiced very serious concerns to me.  I am not in a position to evaluate the opinions of the Office of Public Works in relation to those very technical matters but I have to accept that it is, above all else, the guardian of the system.  Therefore, it must take very serious note of its responsibility to protect and preserve the system on behalf of the State.  I was assured by the Office of Public Works &mdash; which I had no reason to doubt &mdash; that if it was technically feasible and within the bounds of the safety of the system as a whole, it would welcome such a development.  My understanding was that it would communicate with the proposed developer, engage in various studies and, eventually, rule it in or out, based on the technical merits of the case.</P>
    <P>I had not heard about it since then. When I discovered that Senator O'Toole was raising the matter in the House this evening I asked him about it and he very generously gave me two minutes of his allotted time.  I do not know whether it is technically feasible, although I am sure that the Minister will tell us.  I would welcome the development and the person involved seems to have very enthusiastic and good ideas. However, I am mindful of the need to protect the system, as Senator O'Toole and Senator Mullooly said.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works' record on the Shannon is second to none.  It has done wonderful work across the whole Shannon waterway, including the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  I was in Banagher during the summer.  It has a most cosmopolitan atmosphere with Germans, French, Dutch and so on thronging the streets.  It has a wonderful marina which, according to the plaque, was opened by Senator Mullooly's colleague, the then Minister, Deputy Cowen.  There are very nice lights on the pier but it does not have electricity for boats.  It is crazy that it does not have a facility for boats which can use both shore and battery power to plug into so that people can watch videos, use microwaves and so on.  That is a great lack in <Col N="149" /> terms of development.  There is such a facility in some parts of the Shannon Erne waterway on the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  In addition to new marinas, such facilities are necessary to ensure that the existing marinas can offer the best that is available on the Continent and in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I had two sleepless nights in Terryglass and Banagher as there is no control over the marinas.  On one occasion, people decided to set up a ghetto blaster at 2 a.m. and have a party.  I felt like slinging them into the water but I was not allowed to do that.  However, everybody on the boats that night felt the same way because so little regard was shown to children, old people and visitors. I subsequently wrote to the Deputy representing that constituency to complain about the lack of action on that occasion by the Garda as anybody within 20 miles of Banagher would have heard those ghetto blasters.</P>

A great deal can be done to provide facilities for boaters.  We are at the dawn of a new age in terms of tourism, which is the Minister of State's responsibility.  I welcome any development which would allow people to use the Shannon-Erne waterway and contribute to cross-Border activity.  A marina fits well into that pattern and if it can be done within the strictures imposed by the Office of Public Works I would welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Trade (Mr. T. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence this evening of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins. I am glad Senator O'Toole declared that he has no intention of standing in Roscommon because the content of the motion is secondary to the fact that he tabled it.  Many people will sleep easier tonight following his declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> I assure Senator O'Toole, Senator Mullooly and Senator Magner of the commitment of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to the development of Shannon navigation and the creation of jobs where feasible. Proposals have been put to the waterways service of the Department to develop a boat repair and maintenance service, as well as a mooring facilities business at Albert Lock on the Jamestown Canal.  This canal bypasses rocky shoals in the Shannon between Drumsna and Jamestown, thus allowing boats from the middle and lower Shannon to proceed northwards towards Lough Key in County Roscommon or Lough Allen in County Leitrim or, alternatively, to avail of the Shannon-Erne waterway to get into the Erne system. The Jamestown Canal in a vital artery at the centre of Ireland's inland waterways.</P>
    <P>The developer of this proposed business is a lock-keeper in the employment of the State.  He occupies a lock-house and adjoining garden under a care-taker's agreement.  I understand that he owns, or has the use of, privately owned property adjacent to the State's property. I understand also that he permits some boats to be moored on this adjacent property, but the proposals put to the waterways service involve a major expansion and development of the present arrangements.</P>
    <P>As part of these proposals the developer has asked to purchase, or have a long lease on, State-owned land.  In relation to the former, it has long been the custom and practice to dispose of State property by public tender or auction, thus safeguarding the interest of the taxpayer. Notwithstanding this issue, the proposer has made clear his wish to use the waterways service road running alongside the Jamestown Canal.  This roadway was constructed at the same time as the canal, more than 200 years ago.  It was built on top of the embankment, consisting of excavated material from the canal.  The main component of this material is peat and it is up to six metres in depth.  It has a low structural stability.  Present information <Col N="151" /> indicates that at present the road is traversed only by pedestrians, cyclists, animals and the occasional car or light vehicle.  Over the decades, a major portion of this road has been prone to subsidence leading to regular maintenance on a continuous basis by the waterways service. This must be done if major flooding is to be avoided.</P>
    <P>The business proposals, which involve, a full repair service, among other things, would necessitate the regular use of heavy lifting gear, as would the construction of long-term mooring facilities.  The implications of this for the structural stability of the road are obvious.  If the roadway were to collapse, there would be a major breach in the canal leading to inundation of large tracts of land and the severing of the middle and lower Shannon to navigation northwards and vice versa, as described earlier.</P>
    <P>It is for these potentially catastrophic factors that the waterways service engineers have been unable to agree to this development.  The creation of up to four full-time jobs, according to the proposer's estimate &mdash; a difference exists in this regard, as Senator Mullooly mentioned the creation of ten jobs &mdash; must be put against the possible dangers to the overall employment created from boating tourism.</P>
    <P>To augment and consolidate the opinions of its engineers, the waterways service commissioned a study from an independent consultant who is an acknowledged expert in this field.  His report confirmed the views of the waterways service engineers.  He highlighted the very poor structural condition of this roadway, its liability to collapse, the major difficulties involved in attempting to reconstruct the road, widen it to allow for larger vehicles or even repair it.  Such was the nature of this expert's report that the waterways service is considering possible restrictions on the existing usage of this road.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I repeat the Department's willingness to further job creation.  It is, of course, open to the developer to seek another route from the minor public road to his own property. <Col N="152" /> The waterways service is not opposed in principle to the establishment of a marina.  Indeed it is very aware of the need for facilities to cater for the increasing traffic on the Shannon and welcomes the provision of good quality facilities by private developers to augment those which it is providing itself.  I assure the House that developers who approach the service with viable schemes of a suitable standard will be given every possible co-operation and assistance.  Furthermore, the Minister will be glad to arrange a meeting between officials of the Department and the proposer of this development.</P>
    <P>I assure Senator O'Toole that any proposal for an alternative access route will be fully examined and this may help to overcome the present problem.  If the proposer can suggest an alternative route, the officials of the Department will be more than glad to hear what he has to say in that regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to ghettoblasters, I can only inform Senator Magner that I come from a seaside county and I believe he has become somewhat soft due to living inland.  People on the south coast have to contend with the Atlantic and there are no plug-in facilities there.  Nonetheless, I welcome the Senator's suggestion. My own area of responsibility is domestic tourism and I believe it would be a welcome development.  I have made representations to the ESB, through my own Department, to see if this service could be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and the Department for a very positive response.  My sole purpose had been to request that the Minister set up a meeting to discuss the problem and consider alternatives.  The proposer is the third generation of his family and has a commitment to the area and to protecting the environment.  I thank the Minister for such a positive response and either I, or Mr. Burke, the developer, will contact the Department to discuss the matter and the technical resolution to the problems.</P>
