      <P>I have notice from Senator Byrne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to review the operation of the European Community's (Fees for Health Inspection and Control of Fresh Meat) Regulations, 1995, in view of the impact and cost of the regulations on local authorities and abattoir operators under the Abattoirs Act, 1988.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to continue his intensive efforts to protect the lives of the homeless Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide a new classroom, toilet block and ancillary accommodation at Kilmurry national school, Ennis, County Clare; and if she is aware of the very real necessity of having the finance for this project included in the capital building programme.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Sherlock of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to rectify the anomaly under EU regulations which precludes farmers growing peas for green harvesting from area aid, resulting in the loss of 50 jobs at Universal Dehydrates Limited, Midleton, County Cork.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Kelly of of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to outline the reason so few <Col N="270" /> agricultural projects are being funded under the Leader II Programme.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Reynolds of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide funding in 1996 and 1997 for the first phase development of a residential hospice service for the North-West Hospice.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Fahey of the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for the Environment if he will meet a deputation from the Knocknacarragh Combined Residents Association, Galway, with a view to providing £1 million to Galway Corporation for the Western Distributor Road.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senator Byrne's and Senator Cotter's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Before announcing the Order of Business I wish to express sympathy on behalf of the House to the widow and family of the late Barry Porter, MP.  It is unusual for this House to express sympathy on the death of a Member of the British House of Commons but Barry Porter was a founder member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and many Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas served with him since that body's inception.  He was a great friend of this country and a vigorous, full-blooded and supportive member of the body.  Those who came to know him during that time valued his commitment and friendship.</P>
      <P>Today's business is items 1 and 2 and item 20 on the supplemental list.  Item 1 will be taken until 5 p.m., uimhir 2 idir 5 p.m. agus 6 p.m. le ocht nóiméad go gach cainteoir, and item 20 from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Leader's intention that item 1, the Family Law (Divorce) Bill, 1996, will be dealt with between now and 5 o'clock?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that as much progress as possible will be made, culminating in its conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are on Report and Final Stages I am sure our spokespersons will do everything to ensure the Bill is expedited as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that President Clinton has received a renewed mandate from the American people.  I look forward to his continued commitment to the peace process here.  I also look forward to the fact that his distinguished <Col N="271" /> Ambassador, Mrs. Jean Kennedy Smith, will continue her good work in the interests of peace on this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the need for continued discussion on the White Paper on Education, which is listed on the Order Paper &ldquo;to be resumed&rdquo;.  We should discuss certain sections of it which the Minister could then deal with as well as taking questions at the end of the debate. That system worked satisfactorily on previous occasions.  The White Paper on Education requires further consideration prior to the Minister introducing some of her education legislation, apart from the Universities Bill.</P>
      <P>I appeal again, as have all sides of the House, for a debate on currency developments in Europe, particularly with regard to European Monetary Union, imports and exports and the implications of Britain joining the European Monetary Union or not.  This has become more pertinent with the change in the value of the punt over the last week.  We should have such a discussion in this House.  As the punt has now dropped below parity with sterling, people are talking about its impact on inflation.  That is new information for many people and it needs to be examined.  We need to be fully informed on it by having a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader in proposing a vote of sympathy to the family of the late Mr. Barry Porter.  The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body has made a valuable contribution to mutual understanding between the parliaments but more importantly it has made a genuine contribution to the whole peace process and for that, Mr. Porter and his colleagues are to be commended as are our own Members on that body.</P>
      <P>I wish to extend our congratulations to President Clinton on his re-election as President of the United States.  I acknowledge the work he has done and the personal interest he has taken in the peace process.  I am sure the United States will continue to make a valuable contribution to the peace process.</P>
      <P>The membership of the food security board was announced today.  Will the Leader indicate when we can expect legislation establishing that board to come before the House?  While it has been established on an interim basis, it needs legislative support to have a genuine effect as well as teeth to act in the interests of both the food industry and the consumer.  We hope it will have such an effect but I wonder when we will have that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week we debated the Control of Horses Bill including a provision whereby people who are convicted of contravening certain sections of it cannot own or have any interest in a horse for the rest of their lives.  Those who are drafting the food board legislation should examine that <Col N="272" /> section of the Control of Horses Bill with a view to having something similar included.</P>
    <P>The issue of Rwandan refugees in Zaire is to be raised on the Adjournment today but it is a matter that could be debated more widely in the House.  As President of the Council of Foreign Ministers, the Tánaiste should ensure the European Union does everything it possibly can to alleviate the situation and to intervene on a humanitarian basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter will be discussed on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the expression of sympathy to the family of the late Barry Porter and I concur with Senator Dardis on the importance of the work of the British-Irish InterParliamentary Body.  I also congratulate Mr. Bill Clinton on his re-election as President of the United States.  The active involvement of his Administration in the Northern Ireland peace process, as embodied by Senator George Mitchell and the US Ambassador, Mrs. Jean Kennedy Smith, has been most important.  The President has indicated that he will continue this active involvement in the next term and all Senators will welcome that.</P>
      <P>Among the Bills due to be published this session are two which relate to youth.  The Youth Services Bill will be published by the Department of Education and the Children Juvenile Justice Bill will be published by the Department of Justice.  When are they likely to be introduced in the Seanad?  We should have a debate on the issue of young people who drop out of school early and who do not go on to third level education.  They lose out, fall into the unemployment trap and often end up in trouble with the law.  The problem of teenage pregnancy is also prevalent in that sector of the community. They do not appear to be the responsibility of any Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>A question for the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the local employment service can take up that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my party leader in congratulating President Clinton on his re-election. The House should send a message to the American Ambassador to Ireland expressing our gratitude for the help and assistance the US Administration has given to the peace initiative. I hope such a message would have the unanimous support of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will shortly discuss the colleges Bill and education in general.  Will the Leader of the House bring to the attention of the Minister for Education, before that Bill is finalised, an anomaly that exists whereby a number of colleges in Northern Ireland do not qualify for ESF grants?  The payment of such grants is at the discretion of our Department of Education. <Col N="273" /> Public representatives in the Border counties continually make representations to the Department to have colleges in Northern Ireland recognised for such grants but they do not receive any response from the Department.  It is most embarrassing when a college that has been selected by students from the Border counties does not even get a reply from the Department. No Member of the House would support that. Will the Leader bring this matter to the attention of the Minister as it appears to have escaped her attention?  We must make it clear whether we recognise such colleges for inclusion in our grant programme.  The current position is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the vote of sympathy to the relatives of the late Barry Porter of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  I also congratulate President Clinton on his re-election. He is an enthusiastic supporter of the peace initiative and I hope his re-election will give it a new impetus.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I raised the issue of delays in the Department of Justice in dealing with applications for naturalisation by persons who are resident for five years and employed in this country.  There are undue delays in finalising such applications and I wish to bring the problem to the attention of the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>As councils are meeting to discuss their estimates, will the Minister for the Environment make a statement as to whether service charges will be abolished?  Service charges are important to many of our councils but at present we do not know now if they should be included in our calculations.  All we want is a clear cut answer, yes or no.  Then we can proceed with the preparation of our estimates in a sensible and professional manner.</P>
      <P>Can we have a debate on school discipline? This is a big problem in England; schools here are operating in a vacuum.  There could be a problem with schools closing if the Minister for Education does not do something positive.  If we had a debate here, she would get the views of the Members from various parts of the country as to how parents and pupils feel about the present system and what measures they believe should be implemented.  This would be helpful to her.  There would be no aggravation about this because it is something we all agree should be debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to wonder if the legislation referred to by Senator McGowan as the &ldquo;College Bill&rdquo; was the Universities Bill.  If this is the case, it suggests that a colleague of mine from Trinity College was correct when he said the plans of the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, were to reduce the college of the sacred and undivided Trinity to the regional technical college in Dame Street.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris on the Order of Business.  A question to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Justice into the House to explain the operation of the Refugee Bill and to give a review of it in the light of a number of recent instances which concern those of us who took part in the debate, particularly the case of Madani Haouanoh.  He was excluded from this country in curious circumstances about which there appears to be conflicting evidence from journalists on the one hand and the Minister on the other.  There appears to be an attempt by departmental officials to smear this man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been leaked to the newspapers that the marriage was performed by Fr. Pat Buckley, and is probably legitimate but it seems odd that the Department would release this kind of information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader get an explanation from the Minister of the move to deny refugee status to 150 Cuban refugees &mdash; using the phrase: &ldquo;because they had not shown a well founded fear of persecution&rdquo;?  A number of Members discussed the issue of a well founded fear of persecution at considerable length when the Refugee Bill was going through the House and we were given certain assurances.  However, in the light of these two cases, it appears that these assurances were not as watertight as the Minister assumed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saddened to hear of the death of Barry Porter, a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, who represented the Unionist position, because, at the time, there was no Unionist prepared to take their seat. Barry Porter did so and made an enormous contribution.  I join in the vote of sympathy.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Dardis that it is important that the problems in Rwanda and Zaire be discussed on the Adjournment; these problems are being discussed this afternoon at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  However, I ask the Leader to allocate three hours to debate this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I have accepted the importance of it.  Our President has requested that the media and everyone involved continue to highlight the problems in Zaire.  We should allocate a minimum of three hours to discuss that problem.</P>
      <P>Today the Minister for Health announced the personnel for the new food security board.  I look forward to the introduction of this important legislation in the near future.  All sides of the House should show co-operation and goodwill when discussing this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Comments have been made which are of no benefit to this country because ambassadors, who represent the countries to which we export meat, relay this information back to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Foreign Affairs the horror and concern felt in the southeast, particularly in Kilkenny, at the death of a German national.  The attitude of the officials in the German Embassy was horrific.  They used their country's Data Protection Act to refuse to give any details about this man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board had to bury the German national.  I hope the attitude of the officials in the German Embassy is not mirrored in any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Leader's decision last week to discuss the currency issue on 4 December.  Perhaps he could allocate time to discuss the White Paper on science and technology which was published last week.  I urge everyone to read it before we discuss it because it is a valuable document as regards investment in jobs.</P>
      <P>I support the calls by Senator Enright and Senator Dardis to introduce legislation to establish the food security board as soon as possible.  That is a priority because it will secure confidence not only in our food but also in our exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with colleagues in conveying sympathy to the wife and family of the late Barry Porter.  He was an honest and open advocate of what he saw as the conservative and Unionist tradition and he always had our affection and respect.  I hope that points the way for all of us.</P>
      <P>Arising from what Senator Enright said, we must, in the interests of consumers here and abroad, have full and open disclosure on all food related issues.  In that context, I raise a serious question. When the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry agreed to the inclusion in the Russian deal of Wexford and the exclusion of other counties with a lower level of BSE, was he not aware that there were already reported cases of BSE in his native county in the Department, which have since been confirmed, which demonstrated that it had a much higher level&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As Senator O'Kennedy was allowed to show his concern about animals, I should have a right to show my concern about human beings.  A young man of 21 was strip searched on three occasions in nine days.  The situation has deteriorated dramatically and nothing has been done.  There will be serious unrest in English prisons over the abuse of Irish people.  I ask all politicians to bring pressure to bear on their colleagues on the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and also on their leaders so that the British Government is similarly pressurised to do something about the problem.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) &lsquo;persons qualified to help&rsquo; in paragraph (a) are deemed to be persons who have completed a recognised counselling course,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises from concerns expressed on Committee Stage about the provision that solicitors must give an applicant the names and addresses of persons qualified to help to effect a reconciliation between spouses who have become estranged.  We were concerned about how &ldquo;a person qualified to help&rdquo; will be defined and what constituted &ldquo;qualified&rdquo;.  This is an important consideration because the court will have to be satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation between the spouses.  How can a court be satisfied if qualified reconciliators have not been involved in the reconciliation process? How could the court be satisfied when all that might take place is a procedural charade where the solicitor supplies the applicant with names and addresses of persons qualified only according to his criteria?</P>
      <P>The objective of the amendment is to find a definition or criterion which will introduce consistency and assist solicitors in interpreting this clause.  It will assist the court to be confident that the procedures related to the objective of there being no reasonable prospect of reconciliation have been reasonably attempted and that it is not simply an empty procedure.  It is impossible to say in conscience that the court can be satisfied if the person deemed qualified to help does not have a recognised qualification and experience in counselling and does not satisfy what might be regarded as minimum requirements in that respect.  This amendment is an attempt to find a definition, thereby not leaving anything to chance.  One could even envisage circumstances where a court could come up with different conclusions about the qualifications of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed legislation opens a minefield of potential contradictions.  If we are serious about there being no reasonable prospect of reconciliation there has to be a better way of defining &ldquo;a person qualified to help&rdquo;.  There is also a gross shortage of conciliation services and there are long waiting periods for the existing services.  It is perfectly plausible that people who have no qualification will strive to set themselves up as professional conciliators.  If more people come into this area, as they are bound to given <Col N="280" /> that it is a growing market, there has to be a control on entry, such as a professional requirement.  I do not know how one can effectively achieve that without constructive thought.  This is not necessarily the best way of going about it but on Committee Stage I was concerned that the issue was marginalised.  We are not fulfilling our responsibility to the electorate about a reasonable prospect of a reconciliation unless it is clearly thought through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue was discussed at great length on Committee Stage and Senator Lee and I were disappointed with the Minister's response.  I draw the Minister's attention to what is intended in section 6 of the Bill &mdash;&ldquo;Safeguards to ensure applicant's awareness of alternatives to divorce proceedings and to assist attempts at reconciliation&rdquo;.  Leaving aside the commitment we gave when the referendum Bill was put before the people to proceed with the divorce legislation in a particular way, if we were to fulfil the obligation set out in the heading to section 6 we would need to do exactly what Senator Lee and I propose in amendments Nos. 1 and 3.</P>
      <P>Obviously, we want to ensure the applicant's awareness and that will be done by way of the solicitor informing the couple that there is an alternative to divorce but, if we also want to assist attempts at reconciliation, we must do a little more than just leave it to the discretion of solicitors to get lists of groups or individuals.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned on Committee Stage the number of bodies already receiving grant aid from the Department and he stated during the course of the debate that none of them were on a statutory footing.  Leaving that aside, there is still scope for the Minister to identify reputable groups and bodies and communicate them to solicitors' practices so they can have at least some knowledge of them when they inform a couple about them.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I said that if we were to live up to the personal commitments the Minister, Members and I gave when canvassing support for the referendum, then we must live up to the spirit and word of the Bill.  Having heard the lengthy debate on Committee Stage, I ask the Minister to respond in a more positive way now that we have reached the end of the road.  I ask him to consider the amendment favourably and respond accordingly.</P>

      <P>People are concerned, not just in this field but in many other areas, that counsellors are setting themselves up without anybody having much knowledge of their qualifications or whether they are involved with a reputable counselling organisation.  The spirit of this amendment is my main concern.  We should try to ensure that solicitors, who I hope will make every effort to assist reconciliation within the marriage, refer people to counsellors who have some form of training in this field and who, if <Col N="281" /> possible, now that various organisations are being set up, are members of a recognised body.</P>
      <P>This is an area in which there is an enormous amount of money to be made.  Counselling is the buzzword at present and everybody seems to need counselling after any episode in their lives. It is important we recognise that.  I hope those who set themselves up to undertake counselling will require some form of recognised qualification in the future because if the counselling given is defective, it is far worse than if the person received no counselling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6(2)(a) of the Bill requires a solicitor to discuss with the applicant for a divorce the possibility of a reconciliation and to give to him or her the names and addresses of persons qualified to help to effect a reconciliation between spouses who have become estranged. There is a similar provision in the 1989 Act which deals with separation proceedings.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes that persons qualified to help to effect a reconciliation as provided for in subsection (2)(a) be deemed to be persons who have completed a recognised counselling course.  As framed, the amendment would mean that a person who helps to effect a reconciliation may be qualified, regardless of whether they completed such a course.  If the real intention of the amendment was that persons qualified to help to effect a reconciliation must have completed a recognised counselling course, it would have to be framed to state precisely that; it does not do so.  I can only address the amendment as framed and it cannot be accepted on that basis.  It would not be acceptable that a person qualified to help effect a reconciliation be deemed to be a person who has completed a recognised counselling course when the person in question never attended such a course.</P>
      <P>Counselling services are undergoing development at present.  In recent years, much has been achieved by reputable counselling organisations such as Accord, Marriage and Relationship Counselling Services, the Irish Association for Counselling and Therapy, etc., to regulate the profession, set standards for their members and engage in dialogue between themselves with a view to standardising protective procedures and training and providing for accreditation of persons by the Irish Association for Counselling and Therapy.  To date, however, the various counselling organisations have not reached the stage where there is a commonly recognised counselling course.  As the service develops, that stage will eventually be reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of a recognised counselling course does not mean that such courses do not exist. Many reputable organisations are providing excellent training for their members who, in turn, are providing counselling services of the highest quality.  My Department provides annual funding, this year's provision is in excess of £900,000 for <Col N="282" /> over 70 counselling organisations nationwide who are providing excellent services.  The Government is committed to the continued funding of these organisations to ensure their ongoing development.</P>

However, I will express myself in very restrained terms regarding the line taken by the Minister in response to a proposal, the intent of which is to attempt to reduce the degree of unhappiness that attends marital breakdown.  I believe the Minister's reply is irresponsible but its positive reference to the organisations assisted by his Department strengthens the case made by Senator McGennis in amendment No. 3.  I hope the Minister will find that amendment correct in terms of its use of language.  I am very disappointed with the composition, construction and ethos of the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) that the provisions of paragraph (a) shall not apply in cases where at the date of the passing into law of this Bill one or both spouses is already cohabiting with another partner,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify what might have been taken as a misunderstanding about the motive behind the attempt to clarify the meaning of &ldquo;qualified to help&rdquo;.  Some people believe that, if it were applied rigourously, implementation of the Act would be slowed down until a sufficient number of properly qualified people were available.  This could only occur if the Government was willing to increase the supply as a matter of priority which it is clearly not prepared to do.  There is a substantial number of existing marriages which have broken down irretrievably.  There are also marriages in which partners have been cohabiting for some time with a second partner.  No purpose is served by suggesting that a reconciliation process ought to be embarked upon in such cases.  It is difficult to know where the balance is in the scales of human suffering but there is no point in trying to reopen relationships which have been superseded by <Col N="283" /> functioning, new ones.  Far from intending to delay matters, the purpose is to address marriages which have not broken down irretrievably and not to subject those who are well beyond that stage to the same procedure.  It was an attempt to humanise the procedures contained in section 2 (a) and no other purpose should be imputed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to release solicitors from the obligation under section 6 of the Bill to discuss with their client, prior to the institution of proceedings for divorce, the possibility of a reconciliation between the spouses where either the client or the spouse of the client is cohabiting with another partner.  The amendment makes the assumption that where either of the spouses are cohabiting with another person there should be no need for the solicitor to discuss a reconciliation.  I do not agree with that assumption because there may be some cases in which a spouse, athough cohabiting with another person, is prepared to discuss with his or her spouse the possibility of a reconciliation.  Moreover, the Constitution requires that, before granting a decree of divorce, the court must be satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation between the spouses.</P>
      <P>If the spouses have not engaged in any attempts at reconciliation, notwithstanding the furnishing to them of names of counsellors qualified to help effect a reconciliation, this may constitute to the court some evidence that there is no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation.  It will, of course, be open to the court to address the matter further.  The provision in the Bill is satisfactory and it should not be changed as proposed in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I can see the force of the Minister's argument.  There is a certain incongruity in the way he is arguing this and perhaps he may say the same about me.  I do not subscribe to the view that it is not possible to achieve a better Bill than the one before the House.  The Bill does not take full cognisance of the variety of human situations where marriages have broken down and the different circumstances pertaining in cases where people have left their first marriage.  Within reason, cognisance should have been taken of those in order to minimise the degree of hurt involved.  I accept that there are arguments against my amendment but there are stronger arguments against what is contained in the Bill.  However, I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 9, after line 47, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) The Minister may make regulations to allow for the establishment of a Register of Professional Organisations whose members are qualified to assist the parties involved in effecting a reconciliation, such register to show the names of members of those organisations and procedures to be put in place for the organisations involved to regularly update the membership lists.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I dealt with this point during the discussion on Senator Lee's amendment.  We mentioned the use of language on Committee Stage &mdash; the term &ldquo;McGennis-speak&rdquo; was used &mdash; and perhaps we should stick to simple language.  I know exactly what Senator Lee intended in his amendment but it appears that, on a legalistic interpretation, it would not stand up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that it was not written in &ldquo;McGennis-speak&rdquo; it would not stand.  I hope my simple and easily understood amendment is acceptable to the Minister.  I passionately made the case for this amendment on Committee Stage and referred to a specific case of which I was aware.  Members of other professions have mentioned that people set themselves up as counsellors, therapists or family mediators.  It is a growth industry.  I do not suggest that the names of groups be enshrined in legislation but following the passage of this Bill, the Minister should, by regulation, notify groups which in his opinion provide a good service to those who need counselling, advice and support.  The Minister has great experience dealing with the groups we named today and on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>My amendment is even simpler than that of Senator Lee.  I do not want charlatans to be able to recommend themselves as qualified counsellors and to have in their hands the future of a couple in dispute.  Such couples should only be advised by people trained for the purpose.  I believe the Minister can take this amendment on board.  Unless we include this specific provision or do something positive in this area, we will not live up to the spirit of the legislation or the spirit of our arguments to win the slim majority in favour of divorce.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment.  In addition to the persuasive points made by Senator McGennis, I stress that this is an enabling provision which would allow the Minister, by regulation, to draw up a list of qualified people. It is not mandatory and it does not tie his hands or those of his successors in title.  For that reason and given that we are all anxious to maintain and <Col N="285" /> support the institution of marriage where possible and where there are problems to do everything to effect reconciliation through the intervention of highly qualified professional counsellors, this amendment must commend itself to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I also hope the Minister can accept this amendment.  From what he said in reply to amendment No. 1, he recognises that the professional organisations of counsellors see the need to organise on a professional basis to protect the many well-trained counsellors of good repute. These organisations, some of whom the Minister has mentioned, are ideally placed to undertake counselling in these sad circumstances.  Solicitors will direct applicants to those bodies.  It should not be a matter of looking through the <i>Golden Pages</i> to see who has the biggest advertisement, but that might be the case if we do not make efforts to ensure that only people with training who belong to a reputable organisation will become involved in counselling.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment.  I forgot to mention earlier that Senator O'Toole asked to be associated with the spirit of my amendment and of this one, for the reasons mentioned by Senator McGennis and Senator Henry.  This is the absolute minimum which the Government ought to be prepared to accept, if there is a genuine commitment to the conciliation process.  It would be a sad reflection on everything which has happened if the Minister were not prepared to accept it in the restrained and clear phraseology in which it is expressed by Senator McGennis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate what this amendment and that of Senator Lee propose to do.  The matter is of concern to all.  In my experience as a practising solicitor of giving advice under the Judicial Separation Act and about available services, it is often difficult to know what qualifications are possessed by those to whom one refers clients.  People in the legal profession, having practised in family law, tend to know who they are dealing with in that area so it works out relatively well.  There is a shortage of qualified people in various parts of the country and that is another problem which this legislation cannot tackle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment gives the Minister the power to make regulations but it is ultimately a matter for the counselling organisations to administer themselves.  It should not be for us as legislators or for the Minister to do their work for them by keeping a register of membership.  The Law Society, the Bar Council, the Irish Medical Council, auctioneers, accountants and various other professions regulate and set standards for themselves and that must ultimately happen in the counselling service also.  We should not make amendments for the sake of it or include phrases in legislation in order to salve our consciences.  In the long run, it is for the counselling services to <Col N="286" /> organise themselves, although I appreciate what the proposer of the amendment is trying to do.</P>

I am impressed by the fact that is an enabling provision.  We all have experience of good and bad in every organisation and I have heard about good and bad counsellors.  This provision does not guarantee anything but, given that it empowers the Minister, I hope he can accept it and use it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, which was also put down on Committee Stage, would enable the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to make regulations establishing a register of professional organisations in the field of counselling and mediation.  I indicated on Committee Stage that I was unable to agree it was a function of my Department to establish a national register of organisations or persons deemed to be qualified to practise as family counsellors or mediators.  For the moment, organisations involved in counselling and mediation are in the best position to set the standards and qualifications for persons engaged in the provision of such services.</P>
      <P>I will inform Senators of the present position on the counselling and mediation services which are available.  The Mediators Institute of Ireland have already set standards necessary for accreditation and training of mediators.  Similarly, in recent years, much work has been done by organisations involved in counselling to regulate the profession, including the establishment by the Irish Association for Counselling and Therapy, which is the accrediting body for counsellors, of a national register of individual counsellors.</P>
      <P>Recently, officials of my Department met representatives of counselling organisations and there was general acceptance that accreditation by that association was one important way to establish standards among counselling agencies. My Department has, of course, responsibilities which relate to the funding of certain marriage counselling organisations as well as the funding and administration of the family mediation service.  Substantial funding totalling £900,000, which represents an increase of 50 per cent over previous years, is available this year to help with counselling.  This is being used to assist those organisations in their work to develop that professionalism and to encourage them to expand and develop counselling and related services.  For the first time, assistance is available this year to organisations providing counselling services to children whose parents have separated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Altogether some 70 counselling organisations nationwide are receiving assistance from my Department.  That is the strength of the Government's commitment to counselling.  It has been generally acknowledged by counselling agencies that the increased funding over the past couple of years has helped to transform the <Col N="287" /> assistance provided by the counselling organisations and that the number of counselling hours provided has increased by almost 58 per cent over the years 1993 to 1995.</P>
    <P>In 1996, I provided £300,000 for the family mediation service which is more than double the amount allocated in 1993.  The funds available this year have strengthened and developed the service.  The development plan for the family mediation service involved the opening of a new centre in Limerick and there will in future be an input from other organisations and private individuals.  As at present, the mediation service will engage only persons who have certain prescribed qualifications.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I undertook to make available to the legal aid board a list which includes the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the organisations involved in mediation and counselling which receive funding from my Department.  This has now been done. In addition, my Department has written to the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and furnished them with the same details for circulation to their members.  My Department also intends to publish this information in the next few weeks as part of an information guide to family related services funded or supported by the Department of Equality and Law Reform. This will be given a wide circulation.  This approach meets the spirit, at least to some extent, of what the Senator's amendment seeks to achieve for the moment.  At a later stage, however, I accept that the question of regulations may arise.  Accordingly, in view of the limited function which is envisaged for the Minister in the amendment, namely that he may make regulations to allow for the establishment of a register, I am prepared to accept this amendment.</P>

There is nothing that I feel particularly guilty or innocent about and I would do the same thing if the campaign recommenced tomorrow.

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 27, lines 29 and 30, to delete &ldquo;the spouses concerned anticipated that the member would be educated or trained&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;he or she could reasonably have been expected to have been educated or trained&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We discussed this amendment briefly on Committee Stage when I thought the Minister was not unreasonable, at least by the standards of other proposals, in undertaking to consider it in the context of the Children Bill.  However, the more I think about it the more potentially important this issue is.  If we ask what are the prospects of children in divorce cases, a great deal of their future will hinge on the education they receive.  Education will be central to their possibilities later in life.  They will have to cope with a certain degree of emotional disruption and I would argue that education is even more important in their case than it is in the case of others.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) (e) states: &ldquo;the manner in which the member was being and in which the spouses concerned anticipated that the member would be educated or trained,&rdquo;.  The Bill is based on the assumption that spouses will disagree.  The legislation seeks to provide a procedure for, and to channel within a certain framework, the scale and consequences of disagreement.  When we come to the future education of children, the assumption underlying this seems to be that the spouses concerned agreed that they were as one in anticipating how the child ought to be educated.  In practice it is more likely that there will be disagreement because of financial implications or on objective intellectual grounds. At that stage people's disposition is to disagree on nearly everything.  There might even be disagreement because the children are being used as bargaining chips where hostility has arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Simply relying on the anticipation of the spouses is too vague.  What is the court to do in cases where there are differences between the spouses?  Even if they agree the court might take the view, and should be authorised to so do, that the future education of the child should be to some extent independent of the anticipations of parents whose commitment to the child in the first instance was not strong enough to sustain the marriage.  That is not to say they do not love the <Col N="290" /> child, but the welfare of the child was not necessarily their first concern.  The court might have to anticipate, in the case of a five year old or younger child for example, what will be the trajectory of educational opportunity and so forth for many years in the future.  That is why the amendment seeks to substitute the phrase &ldquo;he or she could reasonably have been expected to have been educated or trained&rdquo;.  It allows the court to take into consideration a range of issues which the phraseology of the Bill does not.</P>
    <P>I seriously question whether the spouses concerned are in the best position at that time to decide the matter, even if they agree about what is anticipated.  If they disagree, what can the court do?  This is no-fault legislation so the court is not in a position to allocate responsibility for the breakdown of the marriage.  How does it decide whose view should take precedence when parents disagree on anticipations regarding education or training?  This is perhaps the single most important decision that can be taken about the future of the child and a wider range of considerations should be taken into account than parental anticipations at that moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. There is precedent in the development of family law for this amendment.  Long ago, the rights of one or other of the parents were considered the primary rights in terms of the custody and welfare of the children.  At first it was seen as the primary right of the father.  Happily that changed following the passage of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, under which the rights of both parents were considered of equal value. Subsequently the rights of both parents were considered to be secondary to the rights and welfare of the children.  It is essential that precedent be endorsed in legislation.  Senator Lee's proposal is in harmony with the development of family law, particularly with regard to the primary rights of the children.</P>
      <P>The children are dependent members of the family and will not themselves have been responsible for the breakdown of the marriage.  If they were consulted and could have their views adopted there would not be a breakdown.  They are the primary victims of marriage breakdown where adults who enter freely into a contract &mdash; if one is to call it no more than that &mdash; have neither the capacity nor, in some cases, the responsibility to adhere to it.  For that reason the amendment should be incorporated into the Bill. The court should not be tied to a provision which simply states: &ldquo;the manner in which the member was being and in which the spouses concerned anticipated that the member would be educated or trained&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lee has put the case correctly.  In the sad sequence of events it is likely that there will not be agreement between the spouses concerned.  There might be a definite division <Col N="291" /> between them as to how the member should be educated or trained.  Often it might have been one of the causes of the lack of responsibility or commitment on the part of the parents who are choosing to divorce.  Senator Lee's proposal is not only desirable but in line with developments in our courts which ensure that the primary interest to be considered is that of the children and their future, including the educational standards to which they can aspire.  In some cases the parents might not have much concern for education for one reason or another and in many cases it would be the least of their concerns at that point.  It is important that this amendment, which provides for the &ldquo;reasonable expectations&rdquo; of children having regard to the circumstances, is accepted and that the court be allowed to take that into account.  The court could determine what would be a reasonable expectation of education and training for the unfortunate victim of marriage breakdown.</P>

      <P>As I indicated when the same amendment was discussed on Committee Stage, the provision in the Bill is similar to provisions in the legislation of 1989 and 1995 in relation to separation proceedings where children are concerned.  In separation proceedings at present the parents are asked to assess and anticipate what are the education and training needs of their children now and in the future.  The parents have that responsibility irrespective of whether they are separated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lee's amendment refers to section 19(4).  Subsection (4) is a subsection of the main operative section dealing with maintenance and other support orders.  The proposed amendment should be examined in that context. Subsection (4) states: &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1)&rdquo;.  Subsection (1) provides:</P>
      <P>In deciding whether to make an order under section 11, 12, 13, 14 (1) (a), 15, 16, 17 or 21 and in determining the provisions of such an order, the court shall ensure that such provision as the court considers proper having regard to the circumstances is made for the spouses and any dependent member of the family concerned.</P>
      <P>The overriding obligation in subsection (1) requires the court to ensure that such provision as the court considers proper, having regard to the circumstances, is made. Subsection (4) is without prejudice to the generality of that and provides certain guidelines.  It seems to me, and perhaps Senator O'Kennedy is more skilled, that the situation Senator Lee envisages would be well covered by the overriding provisions in subsection (1), which is the main operative guideline under which the court operates.  The court has responsibility to have regard to the circumstances and additional guidance is given to the court in subsection (4).</P>
      <P>I indicated I would look at this amendment again in the context of the Children Bill which is being prepared in my Department and I understood Senator Lee was reasonably happy with that undertaking.  I have some reservations about the proposed amendment.  I have yet to satisfy myself that the amendment can and that it should be made.  It is a matter which I will be glad to consider further in the context of the Children Bill which is being prepared at the moment.</P>

      <P>I understand law even less than I understand the English language, so I will not argue with the Minister on that basis.  If subsection (1) provides cover, I do not see why my amendment should not be covered by the phraseology there.  I prefer the phraseology and the intention in my amendment.  The Minister is right when he said that I indicated on Committee Stage a degree of assent to his willingness to consider it.  The reason I have changed my mind is that the more I thought about it, the more important the implications seemed to be.  There are big numbers involved.  We could be talking about thousands of children given the flood of <Col N="293" /> applications anticipated.  It is arguably the single most important decision the courts will take with reference to the welfare of the children.  It makes a significant difference that this amendment is a guideline to the court of the desires of this House concerning the way education should be incorporated into the future of children.  It can still qualify as that under subsection (1).  While I acknowledge the Minister has phrased his <Col N="294" /> response in a more accommodating manner than earlier, the amendment is sufficiently important to be incorporated here as an integral part of the divorce regime and not simply left to the legislation concerning children.</P>

      <P>I must apologise to Senator O'Kennedy and the House.  I inadvertently misled him on amendment No. 16.  The amendment is to section 117 of the Succession Act, 1965, by the substitution of six months for 12 months.  I was mistaken in that and I regret it.  The position was as I read it out initially.  The text of the amendment clearly indicates that the 12 month period in the 1965 Act is being reduced to six months to accord and equate with the position in this Bill.</P>

I regret that this provision restricts the time limit related to the provisions of that enlightened legislation.  It was the first Bill with which I was involved in the Seanad in 1965.  It is recognised as being among the most enlightened legislation.  I regret that the time within which people can apply for their legal rights under the 1965 Act are to be restricted from 12 months to six months.  I appreciate the Minister's statement.</P>

      <P>We have now completed all stages of the Family Law (Divorce) Bill, 1996 in the Seanad and it will be returned to Dáil Éireann for consideration of the amendments made in this House.  This is an historic day.</P>
      <P>The process upon which the Government embarked in January 1993 which culminated in the Family Law (Divorce) Bill was at times difficult.  I thank Senators who were supportive in that task.  Irish society has cherished the family and no one really salutes the introduction of divorce.  Nevertheless, the mature decision of the people in the divorce referendum was an acknowledgement of the need to address the painful problem of marriage breakdown.</P>
      <P>When the Government put to the people its proposal for an amendment to the Constitution to allow for divorce it also set out clearly in a draft Bill the nature of the provisions which would be put in place should there be a positive outcome to the referendum.  The Family Law (Divorce) Bill keeps faith with that commitment and is loyal to the decision of the people.  I thank Senators for their assistance with the Bill.  In particular, I thank Senator O'Kennedy for his generosity in regard to the amendment relating to the Succession Act, 1965.</P>
      <P>I express my deep appreciation to Senators for their fine contributions all of which have been beneficial.  I also thank the staff of my Department who have worked long and hard on the Bill.</P>

      <P>This is an historic day.  I thank the Minister for his personal commitment to this legislation.  I regret that, for whatever reason, he was not open to many of the important amendments proposed in the Dáil and Seanad.  I thank him for accepting my amendment on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Many others deserve our gratitude and history will record their contributions to the social development of our country.  Ms Mags O'Brien of the Divorce Action Group deserves special mention.  The relief which this legislation will bring to many people is due in no small part to her group and its hard work and dedication.  It is appropriate to recognise that the enactment of this legislation is not just the achievement of those who campaigned in recent times but is the result of 30 years of debate and discussion.  I congratulate all who took part in the campaign over that time.  I actively supported and campaigned for divorce.  I see it as a necessary relief for many couples trapped in the tragic circumstances of a failed marriage.  It is a basic right for them to be able to put that behind them and move on to a future loving relationship.</P>
      <P>Mr. Des Hanafin and others campaigned against divorce.  I respect their views and I understand their concerns.  With certain obvious exceptions I congratulate them on their campaign.  Over the years their input has allowed us to refine our views on divorce until they properly reflected what the people wanted.</P>
      <P>In the referendum the people gave us a mandate for this change and I was conscious throughout this debate that it was important to act within that mandate.  In this debate the Minister has committed himself to changes in other legislation and I remind him of those commitments.  Of particular importance is the issue of the rights of access to children for members of the non-custodial parent's family where that parent does not exercise a right of access.  Typically that parent would live abroad and access would be given to the child's grandparents.  This is important for the children involved.  The Minister has committed himself to including this measure in a proposed Children Bill and I urge him to bring that forward as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important day in Irish history.  The legislation addresses a social problem in society. However, despite its importance it will not radically change society.  When it is enacted the vast majority will see no change in their lives but the lives of those affected by marriage breakdown will change for the better.  We must monitor the legislation once it is enacted.  We must ensure it works in the manner which we contemplated.  We must also ensure resources are put in place to support all the measures in this Bill and, in particular, we must guarantee the provision of an efficient and accessible family court system to ensure access to divorce is available to those who need it, regardless of means.  I thank all <Col N="301" /> concerned and I hope we have served the people well on this issue.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the manner in which he has discharged what was an onerous responsibility in the present political circumstances.  He has done so with a degree of restraint, dignity and decorum which has been an important contributory factor to the relative civility with which the matter has been discharged.  As I said, the Minister has the enviable ability to present the most unreasonable viewpoints in the most reasonable manner.  That is extremely important in terms of the society in which we live.</P>
      <P>There was an unfortunate misunderstanding about a vote this afternoon.  I regret that and I ask the Minister to accept that it was a genuine misunderstanding.  I congratulate him on the manner in which he has discharged his responsibilities.  It is a credit to him and to the legislative process, whatever one may think of the consequences of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has presented this Bill and debated the issues.  It was an example of courtesy and reason.  While I hold a different viewpoint on the issues, it is important in giving effect to the decision of the people in the referendum that we address the issues in a rational and responsible way.  I thank the Minister for his bona fides in relation to the presentation of all relevant facts as he was aware of them.</P>
      <P>Many will come to regret this historic day.  The terms of the Bill have within them a momentum for what was not intended by the Minister but which will follow.  The Government and the Minister have presented the Bill as enshrining a right to remarry.  It is more correct to say that it is enshrining a right to remarry and to divorce. The pattern in other countries clearly demonstrates that this legislation will not just give rise to divorce and remarriage on one occasion it will be found that the instance of divorce will be proportionately much higher in second unions than in first unions and, similarly, with third unions.  Is there a reason to think that Ireland will be different?  This legislation has been passed in the knowledge of the experience of other countries and I regret that particularly in the interests of children about whom the Minister is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As often as not, breakdown occurs because of a lack of unselfish concern on the part of spouses breaking up.  This has always been a feature of family and married life in Ireland.  Children will be the victims and I have met such children in other jurisdictions.  They get married and unfortunately because there is a lack of stability <Col N="302" /> in their relationships they get a divorce.  I regret greatly that the stability of marriage which is a feature of this society will be undermined.  I know that this is not deliberate.</P>
    <P>I regret that section 5 which refers to collusion between the two parties is included.  I acknowledge that this is not intentional, the courts can only interpret the Bill as passed.  There is no way that a court will be able to say that people in the same house were not living apart for at least four years.  Neither could a lawyer or court say that they know from their knowledge of the individuals' private and personal relationships that they have not been living apart.  That provision, which may have been introduced with good intention, will give rise to collusion on the part of those who want to get a quickie divorce. Who can question or much less contradict them? It is unreasonable to expect that people will not abuse this broad provision because they will be entitled to rely on what is written into the Bill.</P>
    <P>I regret that people who are in a position of irretrievable breakdown will now be free from that burden.  I accept it but it will have other consequences.  No longer will marriage be a permanent binding contract between two people. It will not and cannot be such by definition because now it will be &ldquo;until divorce do us part.&rdquo; It will have a great effect on society and on marriages which have run into difficulties. Whoever can tell me about a marriage which has not had difficulties has found an extraordinary human experience.  People work to effect a reconciliation and put aside their immediate personal interest in the interest of the harmony of both and the children.  Unfortunately, with the passage of this legislation the effort required to do so will not be encouraged to the same extent.</P>
    <P>It is an historic day.  I hope that my fears will not be realised.  Long after we have left the Oireachtas perhaps somebody reading these debates will say I was wrong.  I hope they will but I greatly fear they will not be able to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the fact that all stages of a divorce Bill had been passed is not necessarily a cause for great joy.  Divorce is always difficult and traumatic, frequently messy and leaves great hurt but on many occasions it is the only solution.  I am glad this enlightened legislation exists though it is not the last word. There will be a need for changes in legislation as the years go by as there is a growing body of family law practitioners working at a high professional and humane level.  The legislation which will be on the Statute Book shortly is as good as can be achieved at this time.  The Minister and his officials are to be greatly commended.  I do not share the Cassandra-like gloom of my friend and colleague, Senator O'Kennedy, but only time will tell which of us is right.  There is a counter argument to every point he made and for the most part they are stronger than his points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a society we have come a long way since 1924 when these Houses made divorce illegal and <Col N="303" /> 1937 when the prohibition on divorce was included as a fundamental part of our law.  It has been a long, bruising and divisive debate but it has been handled well.  The scars have healed and when the new divorce regime is in place people will not notice huge changes.  The tenor of society will not be greatly upset and an opportunity will be given to a great number of people to either remarry or regulate lives and their children's lives in a way that is more ordered and certain than is the case at present.</P>
    <P>It has been a long and arduous path for the Minister.  As Senator O'Kennedy said, he has handled the debate with great civility, courtesy and seriousness.  He listened to people and when he did not agree with them he always gave reasons.  Whether we agreed with them or not the response was always based on solid argument rather than on prejudice or caprice.  I also commend Senator McGennis.  Here contributions during the debate have been consistently principled, spirited and gusty.  I listened to all of the debate and the contributions were consistently high without any personalities or bickering and a great sincerity was brought to it. I single out Senator McGennis for her contribution and her courage during the debate.</P>
    <P>Only time will tell whether Senator O'Kennedy and his view prevail.  Let us hope it is that view.</P>

Tá a fhios againn ar fad an chumhacht atá ag an teilifís i saol an lae inniu mar mheán craolacháin.

Cuireann sé sin gliondar ar ár gcroíthe uilig.</P>
    <P>Tréaslaím leis an bPríomh-Fheidhmeannach, Cathal Goan, agus leis an bhfoireann ar fad a rinne sár-obair leis an tseirbhís a chur ar fáil dúinn.  &ldquo;Tús maith leath na hoibre,&rdquo; a deir an seanfhocal agus chuir foireann Theilifís na Gaeilge tús slachtmhar, foirfe, taitneamhach, tarraingteach lena gcuid oibre oíche Dhéardaoin seo caite agus táim cinnte go leanfar den ardchaighdeán sin.</P>

    <P>Gné tábhachtach eile a bhaineann leis an tseirbhís seo ná an pobal féachana nua a mheallfar chuici nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar a dtoil acu.

    <P>Molaim mar sin an rún seo agus tá súil agam gur i bhfeabhas agus i láidreacht a rachaidh an stáisiún nua.  Ba mhaith liom mar fhocal scoir cúpla rud a rá i dteanga na Sasanach, mar achoimre &mdash; to quote in paraphrase, the words of the great English poet, John Keats, who coined a description which could now be aptly applied to the incoming Teilifís na Gaeilge &mdash;&ldquo;It's a beauty, it's a gift, and I know it's going to give a lot of joy to a lot of people for a long long time to come.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The launch of Teilifís na Gaeilge as a means of restoration and assistance and meaningful promotion of the Irish language, is a moment unchallenged, unparalleled in the history of this State.  It is a moment that we will all cherish and remember and nothing but good can come out of this launch.  The Irish language will be richly rewarded as a result of Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>

      <P>Cuidím leis an rún.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Seanadóir Ó Mainnín, a thug am dúinn chun fáilte a chur roimh Theilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeachas a dhéanamh le Teilifís na Gaeilge: tá siad ar an aer anois agus tosnú maith déanta acu agus tosnú maith, leath na hoibre.  Tá súil agam go leanfaidh siad ar aghaidh leis an sárobair seo.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le gach duine agus gach coiste a raibh baint acu le Teilifís na Gaeilge, a chuir os comhair an phobail é agus a chuir brú ar rialtais, ar Airí Gaeltachta agus ar pholaiteoirí go ginearálta chun go mbeadh Teilifís na Gaeilge ar fáil ní amháin do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ach don tír ar fad agus do na glúinte atá le teacht.</P>
      <P>Is linn féin an t-oileán álainn seo, Éire; is anseo a chónaimid agus is anseo atá ár slí bheatha.  Sa bhunreacht, is í an Ghaeilge an chéad teanga oifigiúil agus tá dualgas orainn an teanga a choimeád beo; ní amháin í a choimeád beo ach í a chur chun cinn.  Freisin, tá dualgas orainn mar pholaiteoirí, an córas oideachais trí Ghaeilge a leathnú chun go mbeimid cinnte go mbeidh eolas agus taithí ar ár dteanga ag gach páiste nuair a fhágann siad an scoil náisiúnta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá feabhas mór tagtha ar an scéal le fiche bliain anuas ó bunaíodh Gaeltarra Éireann nó Údarás na Gaeltachta mar a thugtar air anois.  Chuir siad sin beatha ar ais sa Ghaeilge agus i muintir na <Col N="306" /> Gaeltachta trí thionscail a bhunú in iarthar na hÉireann agus slí bheatha a thabhairt ar ais do dhaoine a bhí ag dul thar lear chun postanna a fháil, go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Gan amhras, beimid ag lorg níos mó cabhrach ó Údarás na Gaeltachta ach tá a lán déanta.  Mo bhuíochas ó chroí don Údarás, don Phríomhfheidhmeannach Ruán Ó Bric agus do na baill go léir ar an mbord.</P>
    <P>Sna blianta romhainn, caithfimid féachaint le hairgead breise a chur isteach i dturasóireacht agus in iascaireacht: sin iad na rudaí atá fágtha againn anois i nGaeltachtaí na hÉireann.  Tá Raidió na Gaeltachta tar éis a lán a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge agus tá siad ag tabhairt seirbhís mhaith do mhuintir na hÉireann: seirbhís anphroifisiúnta ar fad atá chomh maith le haon stáisiún raidió sa tír agus níos fearr nuair a thagann sé chuig nuacht agus cláracha áitiúla. Cuireann sé ár gcultúr, ár gceol agus ár scéalaíocht chun cinn agus sin í an saghas seirbhíse atá uainn.</P>
    <P>Níl difríocht ar bith idir nuacht Theilifís Éireann agus nuacht Sky nó CNN: na príomhscéalta ón domhan acu ar dtús, ansin nuacht na hÉireann agus sa deireadh thiar thall, blúire de nuacht áitiúil.  Is é seo ár teilifís náisiúnta agus ba chóir nuacht náisiúnta a chraoladh ar dtús ar feadh ceathrú uaire a chloig, ansin nuachtáitiúil agus ar deireadh nuacht domhanda.  Sin an fáth go bhfuil na stáisiúin áitiúla chomh coiteann sin leis an bpobal: tá siad ag tabhairt seirbhís atá ag teastáil ón bpobal agus sin é go díreach an rud atáim chun a rá le Teilifís na Gaeilge: tabhair don phobal an tseirbhís atá ag teastáil uathu: nuacht agus scéalta áitiúla agus nuacht náisiúnta, ceol agus cultúr na tíre seo, drámaí agus scéalta a bhaineann leis an tír seo.</P>
    <P>Tá fuílleach de scéalta agus leabhair timpeall na háite.  Is cuimhin liom nuair a bhíomar ag dul ar scoil go raibh <i>Jimín Mháire Thadhg</i> againn a scríobh an Seabhac.  Na chéad fhocail a bhí ag Jimín Mháire Thadhg ná &ldquo;An máistir a dúirt liom é seo a scríobh le cur go dtí An Lóchrann.  Cuntas a thabhairt mar gheall orm féin, sin é a dúirt sé a bhí uaidh.&rdquo;  Fear ó mo dhúiche féin ab ea an Seabhac.  Agus nach bhfuil a leabhar chomh maith le <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.</i>  Scéal grinn is ea é mar gheall ar bhuachaill óg agus a chara ag fás suas in iarthar na hÉireann. Tá scéalta eile ann ar nós <i>An tOileánach</i> le Tomás Ó Criomhthain, <i>Peig</i> le Peig Sayers, <i>Fiche Bliain ag Fás</i> le Muiris Ó Súilleabháin agus daoine nua mar Maidhc Dainín Ó Sé agus <i>An Teach nár Thit</i> agus <i>Chicago Driver.</i>  Scríobh fear as Dún na nGall leabhar an-deas, <i>Rotha Móra an tSaoil</i>&mdash; Micí Mac Gabhann.  A scéal féin a bhí ann, fear a chuaigh go Sasana agus as sin go Meiriceá, ar aghaidh go dtí an Klondyke ag lorg óir agus ar deireadh d'fhill sé ar Dhún na nGall áit a raibh cónaí air go dtí deireadh a shaol.  Níl aon ghá le dul amach as an tír le scéalta a fháil le scannáin a dhéanamh astu.</P>
    <P>Teilifís na Gaeilge atá againn agus ní stáisiún teilifíse do mhuintir na Gaeltachta amháin.  Is do mhuintir na hÉireann uilig an stáisiún seo agus tá <Col N="307" /> súil agam go mbainfidh muintir na hÉireann úsáid as chun taithí a fháil ar an teanga agus ar an gcultúr.</P>
    <P>Tá a lán aisteoirí timpeall na tíre a bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu mar ghnáth-theanga.  Tabhair seans dóibh scannáin Ghaeilge a dhéanamh agus tabhair slí bheatha dóibh.  Téimis amach as an tír go Meiriceá freisin, cosúil leis an clár a bhí ann an oíche dheireannach.  Téimis go tíortha eile chun a fháil amach conas atá na daoine Éireannacha a chuaigh thar lear ag déanamh agus tabhair na scéalta abhaile.  B'fhéidir ag déanamh scannáin mar seo go mbeimid ábalta cuid de na daoine a chuaigh thar lear a mhealladh abhaile ionas go mbeidh slí bheatha acu i ndúiche a muintire. Guím rath Dé ar Theilifís na Gaeilge agus ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta, an Teachta Mícheál D. Ó hUiginn agus leis an rialtas agus na rialtais a bhí ann roimhe seo siar go dtí Cathal Ó hEochaidh nuair a bhí sé ina Thaoiseach agus Aire Gaeltachta agus tá a lán daoine eile a bhfuil buíochas ag dul dóibh.  Táim cinnte go dtiocfaidh maitheas as an seirbhís seo do mhuintir na hÉireann.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire agus thar ceann an Daonlathais Chlé fíorfháilte a chur roimh Theilifís na Gaeilge. Táimid ag fanacht lei an lá seo le cúpla bliain agus ar deireadh tá rath ar ár gcuid feachtasaíochta ar a son.</P>
      <P>Bhí an Daonlathas Clé i gcónaí i bhfábhar Theilifís na Gaeilge ar cheithre chúis.  Tá sé ceart agus cóir go mbeadh seirbhís teilifíse ann do lucht labhartha na Gaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí agus ar fud na tíre; tá gá lena leithéid chun ár gcultúr a chaomhnú agus a neartú &mdash; tá an Ghaeilge mar chuid thábhachtach den chultúr sin agus is féidir an saibhreas ceoil atá sa chultúr Gaelach a fhorbairt agus a chur ar ardán domhanda, mar a rinneadh le Riverdance; is fiú go mór £10 milliún sa bhliain agus is féidir linn an costas a iompar faoi láthair; tá fostaíocht á chruthú ag an seirbhís &mdash; nach iontach go bhfuil breis agus 300 post curtha ar fáil dá barr?</P>
      <P>Ní ceart dearmad a dhéanamh go bhfuil imeachtaí an Oireachtais le taispeáint ar Theilifís na Gaeilge agus níl aon amhras orm ná go méadóidh ar an tsuim atá ag muintir na hÉireann i gcúrsaí polaitíochta agus is maith an rud é sin i ndaonlathas.</P>
      <P>Tá moladh agam don tseirbhís nua.  Ba chóir dóibh clár rialta a chraoladh do lucht foghlamtha na Gaeilge agus dóibh siúd a bhfuil meirg ar a gcuid Gaeilge nó atá as cleachtadh.</P>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an tseirbhís nua, déanaim comhghairdeachas le gach duine atá ina bhun agus tá buíochas tuilte acu siúd a chaith seal fada ag feachtasaíocht ar son an stáisiúin Ghaeilge.  Tá áthas orm gur acu a bhí an lá.</P>

      <P>Rinneadh trácht ar Jimín Mháire Thadhg ansin agus is cuimhin liom i gcónaí an bhrionglóid a bhí ag Jimí agus na ceisteanna a chuireadh sé ar an mháistir scoile.  An ceann is fearr a chualas ná dá dtógfadh sé trí lá do thriúr fear cré a líonadh isteach i bpoll de mhéid áirithe, cén lá den tseachtain a fuair Cromaill bás?  Rudaí nach raibh aon cheangal eatarthu.</P>
      <P>Tréaslaím leis an Aire as an méid atá déanta aige.  Seo é an séú huair domsa an rud seo a phlé sa Teach seo agus go dtí seo bhíomar i gcónaí ag iarraidh argóintí i bhfábhar Theilifís na Gaeilge a chur ar aghaidh.  Is iomaí uair le dhá bhliain anuas nuair a bhí an tAire faoi ionsaí ag freasúracht láidir lasmuigh de na Tithe seo gur sheas sé an fód leis an aisling seo.  Aidhm í seo a bhí againn le blianta anuas agus tá an lá tagtha go bhfuil sé beo agus is maith gur éirigh leis.  Beidh an-sásamh do mhuintir na tíre uilig agus is breá liom an méid de atá feicthe agam go dtí seo agus ní raibh an seans agam a lán de a fheiscint: ní fhacasé an chéad oíche agus bhíos ag féachaint air i rith na deireadh seachtaine agus bhíos an-tógtha leis an úsáid a baineadh as teicneolaíocht nua.  Oíche Dé Domhnaigh, bhíos tar éis cúpla alt a chur le chéile ar script a bhí á thabhairt agam ar an dteicneolaíocht nua, gur gá go mbeadh sé ar fáil i scoileanna na tíre.  Chuireas an teilifís ar siúl ag Teilifís na Gaeilge agus níorbh ann ach gnáth panel-game de shaghas ach bhí daoine óga ag dialáil isteach óna dtithe féin, ag imirt an chluiche óna dtithe féin agus ag glaoch isteach beo ar an dteilifís agus ag iarraidh pé rud a bhí ar an scáileán a chur ó thaobh go taobh: bhí leanaí na tíre páirteach i dTeilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Ag féachaint ar an daoine a bhí ag cur na cláir i láthair, bhí siad fuinniúil, úr, spéisiúil, profaisiúnta agus mo léan, bhí siad óg agus sin rud nua dúinn.  Bhagair sé orm i slí éigin go raibh siad chomh hóg sin agus chomh beo sin leis an méid a bhí ar siúl acu.</P>
      <P>Is maith anois go ndéanfadh muid rud níos leithne as.  Ba chóir go mbeadh stiúideo i gCiarraí agus seans ag daoine sna Gaeltachtaí go léir páirt a ghlacadh sna cláir atá ar siúl.  Agus ní amháin sna Gaeltachtaí ach faoin dtír ar fad go háirithe in áiteanna ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt.</P>
      <P>Ó thaobh an oideachais de, tá sé seanráite agam chomh tábhachtach is atá teilifís Gaoluinne do chúrsaí scolaíochta na tíre seo.  Le fiche nó tríocha bliain anuas, tá siad ag dul abhaile fiú sna Gaeltachtaí agus gan a dteanga féin ar fáil acu ar na airways ach amháin ar Theilifís na Gaeilge le tamaillín anuas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níil seirbhís raidió ann don aos óg: is ar an teilifís a fhéachann siad agus is í an teilifís a bheith ar fáil dóibh.  Tá sé ann dóibh anois agus tá siad bródúil as.  Bhíos sa Ghaeltacht coicís roim oíche na hoscailteachta agus bhí daoine ag feitheamh leis agus b'ábhar cainte é sna pubs.  Tá ownership ag pobal Gaoluinne na tíre air seo; táid <Col N="309" /> páirteach sa dul chun cinn seo agus is maith an rud é sin.</P>
    <P>Is maith an rud go dtuigeann siad siúd atá ag cur na cláir seo i láthair go bhfuil cultúr nua-aimseartha sa tír seo agus b'in an íomhá is úire a tháinig chughamsa óna cláir a chonaiceas.  Chonac anseo cultúr úr na tíre, cultúr an lae inniu agus bhí sé láidir, neamhspleách agus Gaoluinn.  Ní féidir le héinne a rá mar gheall ar Theilifis na Gaeilge gur Teilifís na Seanleads í: Teilifís don Aos Og í.  Bhíos ag féachaint ar dhráma oíche Dé Domhnaigh agus bhí roc-cheol, deoch, gnéas agus gach rud eile ann.  Cinnte, éireoidh leis an dul chun cinn seo.  Tá sé ann don aos óg agus do gach duine eile, is rud nua-aimseartha agus Gaelach é agus ní sé ag tabhairt hostages to fortune in aon áit.  Is dul chun cinn den scoth agus caithfimid gach tacaíocht a thabhairt dí.  Ba mhaith an rud é dá mbeadh nuacht ón Oireachtas laethúil nó seachtainiúil ann chun brú a chur orainn féin an teanga a úsáid.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Aire as seo &mdash; is mó argóint a bhíonn againn ach tá sé seo déanta aige, beidh sé ann i gcónaí dó agus táimid uilig buíoch de as an méid atá déanta aige.  Táim cinnte go mbeidh i bhfad níos mó den dul chun cinn atá feicthe againn tar éis seachtaine ann.  It will be a great success agus go n-éirí leis.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh Theilifís na Gaeilge agus déanaim comhgháirdeas leis an Aire as ucht as an méid obair atá déanta aige agus leis an iar-Aire, Cathal Ó hEochaidh: sílim gur chuir siad beirt Teilifís na Gaeilge ar fáil dúinn.  Nuair a bheas an stair scríofa, feicfidh na daoine sa tír seo gurb iad an bheirt pholaiteoir sin a chuir Teilifís na Gaelige chun cinn.</P>
      <P>Déarfainn go mbeidh Teilifís na Gaelige antábhachach don Ghaelige agus do na Gaeltachtaí. Go háirithe, beidh tionchar an-láidir ag an Teilifís ar an nGaeilge labhartha.  Freisin, tabharfaidh Teilifís na Gaelige tacaíocht do dhaoine atá ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a spreagadh tríd an tír.  Ar ndóigh, caithfimid cuimhniú arís ar an dream tríd an tíra bhí leis na blianta anuas ag troid chun Teilifís as Gaelige a chur ar fáil sa tír seo. Déanaimid comgháirdeas leis na daoine sin as ucht Teilifís na Gaelige a bheith againn anois.</P>
      <P>Deirtear in áiteacha nach bhfuil i Teilifís na Gaeilge ach airgead á chur amú.  Ní aontaím le sin ar chor ar bith.  An méid airgid a chaithfear ar Theilifís na Gaeilge, beidh sé chomh tábhachtach le haon airgead eile a bheidh caite sa tír seo.  Tá sé in am dúinn airgead ceart a chur isteach i spreagadh na Gaeilge agus, ar ndóigh, i athbheochan na Gaeilge agus is í an teilifís ceann de na caoínna gur fearr é seo a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Ó thosaigh sé an tseachtain seo caite, cuireann sé iontas orm go bhfuil an caighdeán chomh maith sin do sheirbhís nua.  Is deas an sprid atá ag an bhfoireann atá ag obair air: tá siad óg, tá fuinneamh agus spiorad acu; tá dearcadh úr acu agus tá súil agam &mdash; agus táim cinnte de &mdash; go n-éireoidh go han-mhaith leo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> Caithfimid freisin ár mbuíochas a thabhairt de RTÉ as ucht an tacaíocht a thug RTÉ don tseirbhís nua.  Ní deacair a rá go mbeidh na daoine óga seo i gcomórtas leis na daoine &mdash; b'fhéidir níos aosta &mdash; i RTÉ.  Beidh seansanna ag na daoine óga ar Theilifís na Gaeilge agus b'fhéidir i RTÉ in éineacht le Teilifís na Gaelige.</P>
    <P>Taispeáineann sé rud eile duinn, sé sin go bhfuil seansanna nua le fáil ag na comhluchtaí neamhspleácha atá ag déanamh scannáin sa tír seo.  Beidh an-seans agus an-deis acu níos mó scannáin agus cláracha a dhéanamh agus mar sin de.  Tá sé sin an-tábhachtach mar ní raibh an seans ag na comhluchtaí seo go dtí seo.  Bíonn baint agam le ceann de na comhluchtaí sin atá ag déanamh cláir do Theilifís na Gaelige agus bhí sé go h-iontach domsa a fheiceál an méid oibre a bhí le déanamh acu agus le fáil acu as na cláracha a bhí á dhéanamh acu.</P>
    <P>Chuala mé i mBaile Átha Cliath nó leigh mé sa pháipéir nach mbeidh ann sar i bhfad ach teilifís áitiúil, nach mbeidh sé ag plé ach leis na Gaeltachtaí nó leis an deisceart nó an iarthar.  Ní aontaim le sin.  Beidh Teilifís na Gaeilge chomh tábhachtach i mBaile Átha Cliath agus beidh baint ag Teilifís na Gaelige ansin sa chaoi chéanna in a mbeidh baint aici i gach áit eile sa tír.  Tá súil agam nach mbeidh sí ina teilifís áitiúil ach go mbeidh sí ag breathnú tríd an tír go léir. An méid atá feicthe againn chomh fada le seo, is seirbhís náisiúnta í a bheas go han-mhaith.</P>
    <P>Beidh sí go han-tábhachtach do na Gaeltachtaí. Tá mise ag plé le Gaeltacht Chonamara le bliain go leith anuas i bhfad níos mó ná bhí mé cheana ó athraíodh an chomhairle Dáilcheantair.  Tá fuinneamh agus spiorad iontach le fáil sa Gaeltachtaí anois.  Tá sé i bhfad níos fearr ná mar a bhí sé deich mbliana nó cúig bliana déag ó shin. Beidh Teilifís na Gaelige an-tábhachtach leis an sort fuinnimh agus spioraid seo atá sa Ghaeltacht a chur chun cinn agus do dhaoine atá ina gconaí sa Ghaeltacht, mar tá deacrachtaí acu agus beidh seans acu na deacrachtaí sin a léiriú ar an teilifís. Tá súil agam go mbeidh daoine i mBaile Átha Cliath in ann a fheiceáil chomh deacair agus atá sé do dhaoine atá ina gcónaí in áiteanna cosúil le Conamara, deisceart Chiarraí nó ar na hoileáin thart ar an gcósta.</P>
    <P>Ós rud é go bhfuil an tAire anseo anocht, caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil deacrachtaí sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh seans againn go léir na deacrachtaí seo a phlé agus níl aon dabht agam ach go mbeidh sé againn.  Tá sé go dona nach bhfuil daoine in ann uisce a ól in a lán áiteanna i gConamara ag an am seo, agus go háirithe ar na hOileain Árainn.  Tá imbalance idir an méid airgid atá á chaitheamh i mBaile Átha Cliath ag teacht ón Eoraip agus an méid atá á chaitheamh in áiteanna iargúlta ar fud na tíre.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an teilifís in ann an imbalance seo a thaispeáint.  Níl aon dabht ann ach go bhfuil an tseirbhís seo go han-mhaith don Ghaeltacht, don Ghaeilge agus don tír go léir.  Tá sé thar a bheith in am don tseirbhís seo.  Déanaim comhgáirdeas leis an bhfoireann go léir &mdash; Cathal <Col N="311" /> Goan, Pádraig Ó Ciardha agus gach duine eile atá ag obair ann.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go han-mhaith leo agus níl aon dabht agam ach go mbeidh an t-ádh leo.</P>

      <P>Ní labharfaidh mise ach ar feadh cúpla nóiméad.  Ní hé nach bhfuil bá agam le Teilifís na Gaelige ar ndoigh: tá sin ráite agus scríofa agam minic go leor cheana, ach tá beagnach gach rud ráite cheanna féin a ba mhian liomsa a rá agus é ráite níos fearr ag daoine eile.</P>
      <P>Creidim gur éachtach ar fad an obair atá déanta acu siúd go léir a raibh lámh acu i dtabhairt an bheartais seo chun críche.  Luadh ainm Cathal Ó hEochaidh agus ainm an Aire atá anseo anocht &mdash; fearaim fáilte roimhe.  Tá árdmholadh tuillte ag an Aire, an Teachta Ó hUiginn, as an ngaisce atá déanta aige.  Mura ndearna sé rud ar bith eile i rith a Aireacht &mdash; agus tá ráflaí ann go bhfuil rud nó dhó déanta agus beartaithe aige a dhéanamh &mdash; cuimhneofar air amach anseo as ucht Teilifís na Gaelige a thabhairt i gcrích.  Tá gach moladh atá faighte aige tuillte go maith aige.</P>
      <P>Anois, tá cáineadh faighte aige chomh maith. Faoi mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Tuathail &mdash; agus aontaím go hiomlán leis &mdash; is seirbhís nua do dhaoine nua-aoiseacha a ba chóir a bheith anseo, do dhaoine a bhfuil neamhspláchas intleachtúil ag baint leo.  Ach déanadh ionsaithe fíochmhaire ar Theilifís na Gaelige, ionsaithe a léirigh cé chomh doimhin agus atá an compléasc íslithe imithe i bhfeidhm ar dhaoine áirithe sa tír seo, fiú ar dhaoine go mba chóir fios níos fearr a bheith acu. Fiú, trí ghlúin tar éis imeacht na Sasanach as an Stát seo, tá a rian sin le feiscint anseo go fóill.</P>
      <P>Is ócáid stairiúil í agus má éiríonn lei, gníomh stairiúil amach a bheas ann.  Má theipeann uirthi agus ní féidir linn ligint di teip, mar craic uafásach a bheadh ann don saol Fódhlach agus don saol Gaelach: bheadh sé sin stairiúil chomh maith go mí-ámharach.  Ar ndóigh, braithfidh sé sin ar go leor rudaí taobh amuigh de Theilifís na Gaeilge féin ach tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geal leis agus guím gach rath ar an stáisiún agus ar gach duine atá ag obair inti agus ar gach rud atá beartaithe acu amach anseo.</P>

Cuireann sé seo an Ghaeilge ar chomhchéim leis an mBéarla i gcúrsaí craolacháin sa tír seo mar is ceart.</P>
      <P>Cén fáth go bhfuil RTÉ 1 agus 2 ar VHF agus Teilifís na Gaeilge ar UHF?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a big bone of contention in the country. It will cost me £80 to get Teilifís na Gaeilge in Sligo.  It has been said that one can get an aerial for £12, and of course you can, but you have to <Col N="312" /> be within a couple of miles of the mast.  We can get RTÉ using a simple aerial in most parts of County Sligo but we cannot receive Teilifís na Gaeilge.  This is also true for Dublin and many other parts of the country unless you are on the cable system.  Many people, a bhfuil suim mhór acu sa Ghaeilge, are annoyed by this.  Why could RTÉ not put all three stations out on the one wavelength?  This has done, and will do, a lot of damage to Teilifís na Gaeilge.  I appeal to the Minister to have this corrected because it will be the downfall of Teilifís na Gaeilge.  People will not pay up to £80 for a special aerial to receive it.  That is sad.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom buíochas a ghabháil le Seanad Éireann as an deis seo a sholáthar le fáilte a chur roimh thús craolacháin Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Thug me aitheantas i gconaí don tacaíocht a tháinig ó gach taobh den Teach seo do choincheap Theilifís na Gaeilge agus don chabhair a thug an tacaíocht sin domsa mar Aire a raibh an fhreagracht tugtha dó gealltanas an Rialtais &mdash; an chéad chinneadh i mí Feabhra 1993 agus an dara cinneadh i mí Eanáir 1995 &mdash; go mbunótaí an stáisiún mar chainéal náisiúnta ar leith a thabhairt chun críche.</P>
      <P>Níl ach sé lá imithe ón gcéad chraolacháin.  Tá na céimeanna tosaigh feicthe againn, tá súil agam, in aistear a bheidh fada agus torthúil.  Ní féidir liomsa, mar Aire atá freagrach as polasaí craolacháin, bheith bainteach le cúrsaí cláir ó lá go lá ach ní dóigh liom go mbeinn ag dul thar na teorainneacha reachtúla dá ndéanfainn tagairt do ché chomh féin-mhuiníneach a bhí nacéimeanna tosaigh sin agus don úireacht, ilghnéitheacht agus beocht a bhí le brath ó na cláir a léiríodh i dtaca an ama sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá Teilifís na Gaeilge mar cheann scríbe ar mhór-iarrachtaí a bhí á ndéanamh ag a lán daoine thar tréimhse blianta.  Ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt do Mheitheal Theilifís na Gaeltachta a dhírigh aird an phobail ar an riachtanais a bhí ann.  Ceist cearta a bhí ann go mbeadh stáisiún teilifíse ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do chomhluadar na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre.  Ó 1993 bhí bunú an stáisiúin mar chaineál náisiúnta ar leith mar chuspóir de pholasaí an Rialtais agus, ar mhórán cúiseanna, bhraith mé i gcónaí go <Col N="313" /> raibh cur i gcrích an pholasaí sin ar cheann de na cúramaí ba mhó a bhí le comhlíonadh agam.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom lánaitheantas a thabhairt do na daoine a chuaigh romham agus a raibh an coincheap seo acu is a thug tacaíocht don choincheap sin.</P>
    <P>Ní amháin go bhfuil Teilifís na Gaeilge mar chuid bhunúsach de pholasaí cultúrtha, craolacháin agus teanga: téann sé níos doimhne ná sin.  Tá bunú stáisiúin náisiúnta teilifíse, lena cheanncheathrú i mBaile na hAbhann, mar shampla den chaoi inar féidir na teicneolaíochtaí is nua-aimseartha a chur chun fónaimh dár saoránaigh uile agus é sin a dhéanamh ar imeall na hEorpa chun postanna buana a chur ar fáil do dhaoine óga.  Ní hé go bhfuil an teicneolaíocht á brú orainn ach go bhfuilimid ag baint úsáid aisti chun ár saoil a iomlánú agus chun fostaíocht a chruthú.</P>
    <P>Tacaíonn sé le coincheap an chraolacháin seirbhíse poiblí ag am nuair atá an coincheap sin faoi mhór-bhrú.  An tseachtain seo chugainn beidh mé ag tabhairt léacht in onóir Raymond Williams agus cuimhním i gcónaí ar an méid a scríobh sé, go mbeadh seans againn i ré na teicneolaíochta dul i gcumarsáid lena chéile ar shlí nach raibh ar fáil go dtí sin.  Scríobh sé é sin sna seachtóidí i <i>Culture and Society</i> agus fiú ansin bhí an bagairt ann go mbeadh na hollchomhlachtaí i gceannas ar an rud ar fad agus nach mbeadh fáil ag éinne eile ar an nuatheicneolaíocht chéanna.</P>
    <P>Mar atá ráite agam go minic, baineann Teilifís na Gaeilge ag an leibhéal is bunúsaí le cearta daoine a úsáideann an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth-theanga laethúil: teacht a bheith acu sa teanga sin ar an meán cumarsáide is cumhachtaí a bhfuil forbairt déanta air go dtí seo.  Baineann Teilifís na Gaeilge le cearta, saoránacht agus daonlathas.</P>
    <P>An fáth go bhfuil an oiread sin suime san Eoraip i mbunú Theilifís na Gaeilge ná go bhfuilimid ag crosbhóthar craolacháin.  An bhfuil na seirbhísí nua agus an teicneolaíocht nua ag imeacht i dtreo na tráchtála agus na n-ollchomhlachtaí nó an mbeidh sé ar fáil chun na bunfhiúntais a bhí mar bhunús le cúrsaí craolacháin sa tír seo, sa Bhreatain agus i dtíortha eile ar a tugadh an teideal polyservice broadcasting?  An mbeidh sé ar fáil dóibhsean agus cén treo i ndeireadh na dála a roghnóimid?</P>
    <P>Tá an cinneadh chun dul ar aghaidh le bunú an stáisiúin nua mar chaineál náisiúnta ar leith ina chomhartha muiníne i gcumas agus i dtalainn ár gcraoltóirí agus ár ndéantóirí clár.  Aontaím leis na Seanadóirí faoin tionchar a bheidh ag na milliúin atá caite ar an bpróiséas coimisiúnaithe do chomhlachtaí ar fud na tíre a bhfuil daoine óga ag obair iontu a chuirfidh cláir ar fáil don tseirbhís nua.  Is comhartha muiníne í freisin i mbeocht agus in ábharthacht ár dteanga féin agus muid ag druidim i dtreo na milaoise nua.  Dá mbeimis inár seasamh anseo i mí na Samhna, 1996 ag plé todhchaí na Gaeilge agus dá dtógfaí cinneadh an t-airgead a bhaint as Teilifís na Gaeilge agus gan dul ar aghaidh lei, cén sórt <Col N="314" /> atmasféir a bheadh ann agus an cinneadh sin tógtha gan seans a thabhairt di agus é soiléir nach mbeadh an seans sin ann go deo.</P>
    <P>Thóg muid an cinneadh chun í a chur ar fáil agus cuireann sé gliondar croí orm féin.  Is iontach an fháilte fhial atá curtha roimh an tseirbhís ag gach taobh den Teach seo.</P>
    <P>Tá amhail mar a bheadh pléascadh ar siúl ar bhonn domhanda sna meáin leictreonacha agus sna seirbhísí a dtéann leo, agus sa chomhthéacs sin, tugann bunú Theilifís na Gaeilge aitheantas don ghá atá le seirbhís theilifíse inár dteanga féin atá préamhaithe go daingean inár bpobal féin agus atá Gaelach ar bhealach sainiúil.  Is féidir úsáid a bhaint as an oidhreacht agus as an gcaomhnú atá ag seasamh taobh thiar de agus ag an am gcéanna, bheith in ann freastal ar an samhlaíocht a bheidh ar fáil don todhchaí. Coincheap ama fíor-thábhachtach atá i gceist.</P>
    <P>Is comhartha soiléir í Teilifís na Gaeilge nach bhfuilimid sásta glacadh gan ceist le brú ó mhórchomhluchtaí tras-náisiúnta, atá bunaithe ar chúrsaí brabúis amháin, chun go bhfeidhmeodh saoránaigh mar thomhaltóirí fulangacha gan spéis ar bith acu i leas a chéile.  Is ráiteas é Teilifís na Gaeilge nár chóir na teicneolaíochtaí nua-aimseartha a úsáid ach don aon chúis amháin, sé sin, chun níos mó seirbhísí den chineál céanna a sholáthar d'fhonn an lucht féachana is mó is féidir a mhealladh ag an bpraghas is ísle don lucht fógraíochta.  Is léir ó Theilifís na Gaeilge go bhfeictear dúinn gur rud ábharthach, beo agus luachmhar é an craolachán gur féidir le saoránaigh a úsáid i múnlú a dtodhchaí agus a gcultúr féin.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir an iomarca creidiúna a thabhairt do na daoine uile a raibh baint acu le saolú Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Tá buíochas ag dul do RTÉ as a gcuid iarrachtaí chun an bunstruchtúr teicniúil a chur ar fáil laistigh den scála ama cuí.  Molaim go mór na hinnealltóirí a bhí ag obair ar an gcuid sin de.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt do thacaíocht ghinearálta RTÉ agus do ról Comhairle Theilifís na Gaeilge: tá an t-ádh linn go bhfuil an fhoireann fé cheannaireacht Chathal Goan.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil duine den fhoireann sin i láthair inniu, Pádraig Ó Ciardha. Ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt freisin do iarrachtaí na n-oifigeach i mo Roinn féin a d'oibrigh go díograiseach chun an ceann scríbe seo a bhaint amach.</P>
    <P>Ní mór comhghairdeachas a dhéanamh le foireann an stáisiúin a thug múnla d'fhís Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Ní mór comhghairdeachas a dhéanamh leo freisin as díogras agus dea-thoil i leith an stáisiúin a chothú, ní amháin i measc cainteoirí Gaeilge ach tríd an tír i gcoiteann agus go deimhin, níos faide chun siúl.  Thug cinneadh an Rialtais go mbunófaí an stáisiún agus an tacaíocht a fuair an cinneadh sin ó pháirtithe an Oireachtais, aitheantas don dea-thoil agus don chion sin &mdash; in ainneoin go raibh roinnt beag cáineadh ciniciúil ann.  Tá foireann Theilifís na Gaeilge tar éis croílár a thabhairt don dea-thoil sin agus modh chun é a chur in iúl, agus dá réir <Col N="315" /> sin, tá léirithe acu gurb é an cinneadh ceart a bhí ann.  Ó thaobh an Rialtais de, tá socraithe go ndéanfar airgeadú ar an stáisiún ar bhonn leanúnach.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an struchtúr don todhchaí, pléifear é sin nuair a thugaim reachtaíocht maidir le cúrsaí craolacháin os comhair an Oireachtais i 1997.</P>
    <P>Tá obair nach beag le déanamh ag foireann óg Theilifís na Gaeilge agus ag na déantóirí clár, a bhfuil coimisiúin tugtha dóibh, chun dul ar aghaidh agus tógáil ar an tosach iontach atá bainte amach acu.  Beidh líon mór seirbhísí san iomaíocht leo chun an lucht féachana a mhealladh.</P>
    <P>Tá mé dóchasach, áfach, go nglacfar le Teilifís na Gaeilge laistigh d'achar gearr mar chuid bhunúsach den phobal a dhéanann an chraoltóireacht in Éirinn freastal air.  Tá sainordú ag an stáisiún plé lena lucht féachana mar dhaoine meabhracha seachas mar ghrúpaí tomhaltóirí a ndéanfaí airgead orthu.  Is féidir leis an stáisiún caighdeán nua a leagan síos do chláir den scoth agus cruthúnas a chur ar fáil, creidim, go mb'fhearr leis an lucht féachana go rachfaí i ngleic leo agus go dtabharfaí dúshlán dóibh ar bhealach ciallmhar, seachas tuilleadh a chur ar fáil dóibh den síor-phrislíneacht a nglactar lei mar chruthaitheacht ar go leor de na seirbhísí eile atá ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Beidh seans ag muintir na Gaeltachta na deacrachtaí atá acu a nochtadh, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Fahey.  Ó thaobh na n-aeróga, má táthar ag súil le RTÉ 1 agus 2 a fháil, tá an t-aistriú ó VHF go UHF ag tarlú, is cuma faoi Theilifís na Gaeilge agus má chaitear an t-airgead beifear in ann Teilifís na Gaeilge a fháil freisin.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tacú go hiomlán leis an rún atá ós ár gcomhair inniu agus mo bhuíochas phearsanta agus buíochas an Rialtais a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí faoin rún ata os ár gcomhair inniu: fáilte a chur roimh an gcomhalta nua den chlann craolacháin in Éirinn.  Tá lán-dóchas agam go mbeidh páirt iomlán le himirt ag an stáisiún nua i saol cultúrtha agus sóisialta oileáin uilig na hÉireann agus go mbeidh sé ina ábhar bróid dúinn go léir.  Fearaim fíor-chaoin fáilte roimh Theilifís na Gaeilge agus guím chuile rath ar na daoine a bheidh ag obair ann agus ar na daoine a bheidh ag féachaint uirthi.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government's lack of commitment towards the <Col N="316" /> economic development of the Border counties; stresses the absolute necessity to draw the maximum amount of EU funding available to this area; and calls on the Government to utilise all available peace initiative funds towards industrial infrastructural development in the Border areas.</P>
    <P>I need more than the allocated time to establish the justification for the motion.  The Minister of State should discuss this matter with the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach at the first opportunity.  This matter will not go away. There was a two day debate on it in the Dáil and it is important for the Government to recognise that the six southern Border counties have been poorly treated in the last 25 years. There has been no serious attempt by the Government to do anything other than have a two page article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> which is not factual and is pure propaganda.  I could tell the editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i> that it is a total misrepresentation of the facts.</P>
    <P>How many American trade missions have been to the six southern Border counties?  The answer is none, while there is one nearly every week in the north of Ireland.  It is difficult for me to read in newspapers circulated in Donegal and printed in the north of Ireland that the North-West Partnership has made a breakthrough.  This partnership does not include the southern Border counties.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 28 October 1996 stated there is to be a cut in EU aid to Ireland because we have joined the &ldquo;rich man's club&rdquo;.  The six southern Border counties, and the west of Ireland, are far from prepared to join this club.  The Government does not seem to recognise that there is a problem.  This is borne out by the fact that it has not appointed anyone from that area as a Minister of State.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Carey, is able, but he does not have a clue about what is happening on the ground in that region.</P>
    <P>It is surprising that Deputies Nealon and Harte and other prominent Deputies who were Ministers of State in previous Governments were not suitable for such an appointment.  This is consistent with the Government turning a blind eye to the problems of the southern Border counties.  I am sure Senator Reynolds understands what is happening in Leitrim.  In the debate in the other House, Deputy Nealon admitted there was organised confusion.  There are 74 committees.  If someone came to me tomorrow with a small project, I would tell them to go to the credit union.</P>
    <P>It is a shambles.  I am a member of the county enterprise board, the Strabane-Lifford commission, ERNACT and the North-West cross-Border group, and it is a waste of time attending them.  I ask the Minister to look at the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> of 28 July which lists areas where new jobs have been created.  There is not a single job listed for anywhere in the six <Col N="317" /> southern Border counties.  Every second day there is some development across the Border. Two weeks ago we nearly lost £78 million in EU funding.  Joe McCartan, the Fine Gael MEP from Leitrim, decided not to vote on the issue as he did not think it was a problem.</P>

      <P>Two weeks ago in Lifford Commissioner Wulf-Mathies said we should put pressure on the Minister for Finance to review funding for the Border regions.  The Government <Col N="318" /> must wake up to the fact that we are in danger of losing the £78 million.  Deputies and Senators from the southern Border counties agree this Government is neglecting the region.  It is difficult for them to defend the indefensible.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Doyle, is far removed from the problems in the southern Border counties.  IDA Ireland, the county enterprise boards and various other agencies are responsible for providing jobs, but their hands are tied because there is no additional funding for these counties yet everyday we read in the newspapers about money being made available to the Northern counties.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that £10 million has been provided for a footbridge across the River Foyle. If the six southern Border counties got £10 million, I would not have tabled this motion. Industrialists are encouraged to set up across the Border.</P>
      <P>There is no money for tourism related projects in the South yet the northern counties have received 60 per cent funding for projects such as the development of piers and lakes.  I ask the Minister to tell me how much Bord Fáilte is getting, where it spends it and why funding is not available to private individuals to develop farmhouse accommodation, etc. in the six southern Border counties.  We have received no money from the Fund for Peace and Reconciliation or from Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>I do not have time to go into detail on the neglect of the six southern Border counties.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Carey, did not ask an American delegation to visit the six southern Border counties because he does not know the problems there.  It is a tragedy that a suitable Minister of State has not been appointed to the six southern Border counties.  The electorate knows the Government has totally neglected these counties and my colleagues will not fool the people if they attempt to defend the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If someone wanted to start a small industry in this region, I would send them to the credit union or to the bank.  I would not impose such a jungle <Col N="319" /> of organisations on them.  I can only briefly outline in the time available to me the neglect of the Border regions.  I hope the Minister will explain to the Minister for Finance the seriousness of the matter because if she does not, she will pay a high price at the next election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  There is no doubt the six southern Border counties are badly neglected.  Northern Ireland receives 80 per cent funding, while we get 20 per cent.  The Government must try to remedy that.  We in the Border counties suffered more economically than the northern counties, which suffered physically. They received money from the British Exchequer and from insurance companies.  However, the Border counties have no tourism or business prospects.</P>
      <P>The Leader programme is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry; the North-West Partnership is administered by the Department of the Taoiseach, the county enterprise boards are the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise and Employment; INTERREG is administered by the Department of Tourism and Trade and every Department has its finger in the Fund for Peace and Reconciliation.  There is organised confusion. Sligo is coming to grips with it by trying to set up a one-stop-shop.</P>
      <P>I am annoyed we will not get any money.  The only elected voluntary organisations are the local authorities, yet they have been ignored.  Our case was not properly made in Europe at the outset. County councils have the infrastructure, the expertise and the necessary equipment to help set up projects.  Few projects would have got off the ground were it not for the county councils.  We should be more involved so that there is full accountability.  Many voluntary organisations have been set up overnight in Dublin.  What has Dublin to do with the Border counties?  Why were these committees not established in that area?</P>
      <P>I am not casting aspersions but we were disappointed at Deputy Carey's appointment as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach.  It is sad the Government did not think it worthwhile to appoint a person from the Border counties.</P>

It is time the plethora of organisations handling all the funds <Col N="321" /> were abolished.  As Deputy Nealon said in the Dáil, it is a case of pass the buck.  People are passed from one agency to another and they do not know who to go to in the end.  Consultants are required to prepare cases and we know what that costs.  The people with an idea spend the few pounds they saved to invest in their project on paperwork.  I appeal to the Minister to put an end to that.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann commends the Government's commitment towards the economic development of the Border counties and is confident that the maximum amount of EU funding available to the Border region will be drawn down in timely fashion over the lifetime of the EU programmes relevant to the area.  Seanad Éireann acknowledges that a full consultative process was undertaken in Northern Ireland and the Border counties by the European Commission Task Force. Seanad Éireann further notes that local opinion in regard to the implementation of the measures was overwhelmingly to the effect that implementation of the measures be devolved to local implementing mechanisms and away from central Government Departments.  Seanad Éireann also recognises that the weight to be given to the various strands of the Peace Programme, including the question of aid towards infrastructural development in the Border region, was based on this local consultative process.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan and those of us who live in the Border area hold the ideal of funding close to our heart.  This motion was discussed on 16 May 1996 and the wording was exactly the same.  It reminds me of the words of the late James Dillon &mdash; with a lie well told and told often enough he was damned if the truth would ever catch up with it.  If the motion is repeatedly tabled, people may believe we are in serious financial difficulties in the six Border counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGowan has given no real indication of how he would improve matters.  The only example he has given is that there is 70 per cent funding in Northern Ireland and 30 per cent funding in the Border counties.  I agree with that. There should be a level playing pitch.  However, it reminds me of one of my great experiences as a fledgling politician in Leitrim County Council when the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed in 1985.  As I thought it was a wonderful piece of diplomacy and democracy on behalf of any Government to get such an agreement, I <Col N="322" /> introduced a motion in Leitrim County Council to get its support.  The Fianna Fáil members voted against the motion.  We know that Mr. Haughey, who is not late&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While I believe one has to look forward rather than backwards on Northern Ireland, one must consider that type of politicking.  If the logical conclusion is drawn, my colleagues on Leitrim County Council in 1985 who voted against the motion on the Anglo-Irish Agreement, voted against the setting up of the International Fund for Ireland which was established on foot of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>

      <P>In 1994, there was no US-based manufacturing industry in County Leitrim.  It was the only county in the country which had none. Since my party came into Government, three American-based US industrialists have set up in Leitrim and will employ over 750 people.  They must have come in at some stage and Fianna Fáil did not bring them in.  That is the only example I can give and it is not a bad one.</P>
      <P>The International Fund for Ireland has been discussed.  Since 1987, over £290 million has been spent in the Border counties and Northern Ireland.  That was in the IFI annual report 1995. That is a phenomenal amount of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not taking credit for anything.  All I am saying is that the motion tabled by the Opposition is not well-thought out. It is scaremongering.  I have no difficulty with the fact that there are problems with the number of organisations established to allocate the money but I have a major difficulty with the wording of <Col N="323" /> the motion tabled by the Opposition.  It condemns the Government for a lack of incentives and creativity.  I have given the Senator an example of the creation of 750 jobs with American firms with the help of the funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>

      <P>The Government helped. Unlike many Fianna Fáil politicians I would not claim that, without me, the jobs would not be there.  We played a part and that role will be looked upon favourably at the next election.</P>
      <P>With regard to the International Fund for Ireland, £35 million was spent on the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  It has made a great difference to the area in which I live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, £3 million was given to the Shannon-Erne link marketing company to market the area for three years.  I can see the difference it has made because I live in the area. I take my hat off to the Governments who provided funding to the IFI.  I always give credit to the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, for putting the project in place.  When he was in County Leitrim I treated him a lot better than members of his party.  When he was doing a good job they got rid of him.  Logic sometimes goes by the board with Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as relevant as all the Senator's statements.  If I make one irrelevant statement, that is not too bad.</P>
      <P>I will not name the person who raised the issue of the peace and reconciliation fund and said that, but for his diligence, there would have been a cut of £80 million in the amount allocated to the Border counties but the facts are that there was never a proposal to take £80 million from the £300 million provided in the Delors package. That was simply a scaremongering tactic to get publicity.  A number of community organisations which had applied for funds for worthwhile projects were convinced that the funding would not be put in place because of this individual's crying and whinging.</P>
      <P>The next time Senator McGowan puts down a motion on the Border counties he should think more about it; he should not be critical just for the sake of it.  A large amount has been spent in the region.  My colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, is reviewing the establishment of the existing agencies and organisations, most of which were established when Fianna Fáil was in power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from and represent a Border county.  Last week I and a number of my colleagues visited republican prisoners in Britain. We have taken up the cause of republican prisoners in Britain because we consider the prisoners central to the peace process.  In general, the republican movement has not reciprocated. The resumption of the paramilitary campaign in Northern Ireland is most damaging to cross-Border co-operation and development.  I welcome the recent reports of negotiations between Gerry Adams and John Hume with a view to reinstating the republican ceasefire.  I urge the republican movement to take into account the economic well being of people living in Border areas.</P>
      <P>This motion condemns the Government's so-called lack of support for Border development.  I find the motion surprising.  While we would all welcome the utilisation of the money available under the peace and reconciliation fund, it is unfortunate that Fianna Fáil is such a late convert to the idea.  When this issue was debated in the Dáil the Fianna Fáil Leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, made much of how he was responsible for putting the peace and reconciliation fund in place.  At a cursory glance he is correct but does he not recall the prolonged negotiations that went into the formulation of the workings of the fund? Does Fianna Fáil not recall that, when it agreed to the peace and reconciliation fund, it also agreed to its subheads which include urban and rural regeneration, cross-Border development, social inclusion and technical assistance?</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil should also recall that the decision to devolve the disbursement of money under the fund to a local level was taken by the task force established by the EU Commission.  The decision to devolve this responsibility is consistent with one of the key aims of the fund, namely, the need to combat social exclusion and to promote cross-Border co-operation.  The intermediate funding authorities established by this process were only made aware of their statutory responsibilities in December 1995.  Now they are functioning they will have no difficulty disbursing the funds.  These intermediary groups are responsible for the disbursement of 70 per cent of the total funds available to the Border counties through the EU. Fianna Fáil should not pretend that it was not involved in the consultation process.  It was involved through its participation in local authorities and regional authorities and through its participation in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The submission of the Border Regional Authority to the consultation process emphasised the need to use the initiative to promote reconciliation on both sides of the Border and excluded large infrastructural development. There is a suspicion in some Border areas that the use to which the peace and reconciliation funds are being put differs on both sides of the <Col N="325" /> Border.  There is some truth in this suspicion but other issues are involved.</P>
    <P>The division between the allocation of funds in the ratio 80:20 between North and South was arrived at after Fianna Fáil indicated to the EU Commission that it was unhappy with the 75:25 breakdown originally proposed.  If this is indicative of the success of Fianna Fáil lobbying I am sure the people of the Border counties would do as well without it.</P>
    <P>I do not begrudge our friends on the other side of the Border the lion's share of the fund.  They are already disadvantaged in terms of available EU funding by virtue of their membership of the UK.  We, on this side of the Border decided to spend our share of the peace and reconciliation fund on combating social exclusion.  That choice was no doubt informed by the availability of EU funds for other purposes.</P>
    <P>I would like to address the allegations made by Fianna Fáil about the Labour Party's commitment to funding the Border region.  Let me assure them they need not worry unduly. Rather than venting their ire on the socialist group in the European Parliament, Fianna Fáil would do better to thank it.  The proposal to establish the fund was taken by John Hume, a member of the socialist group, and endorsed by Jacques Delors, the then President of the Commission and a French socialist.  When one compares that record to that of Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party and its European allies fare well. When the Delors package was last voted on in March 1996 not one Fianna Fáil MEP was present to support it.  So much for Fianna Fáil's commitment to the Border counties.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has always believed that the funding was never in danger.  As is commonly known, there are organisational difficulties involved in drawing down moneys from new funds.  Fianna Fáil owes an apology to my party colleague, Bernie Malone, MEP, who was lambasted by Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher who has dual membership of the Dáil and European Parliament, on one of his frequent visits to Ireland when the original decision was taken by the Parliament's budgetary committee.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I have to shout in order to be heard.  In all other European countries local government spends its resources on local development; in Ireland money spent is measured in pennies and halfpennys.  Over the past few years community groups have been established in Border counties for the purpose of bringing about local development.  Local councils have responsibility for a defined area but they cannot deliver as there are no resources.  All they can do is scream and shout at Government to give them more money.  It is a disgrace and if we have any respect for our children we will change that and turn around the 1977 decision.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan should be making positive noises about that.  It is much more fundamental and important to the future development of Ireland.  This Government is at least looking at that.  I work on a regular basis with local community groups in Counties Monaghan and Cavan.  It is a shame that we, as local councillors, can only give them verbal support.  They get money and do some brilliant work, but they should be able to fund that work themselves.  All the other local authorities across Europe have been doing it for the past 20 years.  Can anyone imagine the total damage that resulted from the 1977 decision?  It is huge.</P>

Employment with high added value that tends to employ graduates is completely absent in County Monaghan and the county enterprise board should be able to make a proposal to the Minister.  Monaghan should be able to go after that type of industry to create a balance.  When the North American Partnership was announced a year and a half ago not a single industry in Monaghan or Cavan was involved as they were not suitable.  Some of us were anxious to be positive in the Chamber because there are problems in the Border counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government recognises that the Border region, by virtue of its geographical location, is deserving of special attention.  The region is the subject of specific and intense emphasis on the part of this Government in the general area of economic development.  This emphasis is both qualitative and quantitative and I do not think that the continual griping and doing down of the region by Opposition Deputies and Senators with redneck rhetoric and manufactured indignation as we heard here this evening is at all helpful.</P>
      <P>Before I outline the level of Government commitment to this region, I want to say that I think all of it will be at nought if the IRA ceasefire is not restored.  I concur with Senator Maloney's sentiments in this regard.  Opposition Senators did not see fit to refer to the economic impact &mdash; even if we are only discussing the economic impact quite apart from the social impact &mdash; of a restoration of the IRA ceasefire in the motion.  The economic impact of a restoration of the IRA ceasefire would be worth much more than all the Government, the British Government, the US Government, the International Fund for Ireland, the EU and all the agencies put together could possibly achieve in the Border regions.  The restoration of the IRA ceasefire stands out as the single most important issue for the Border regions of the South and, of course, North of this island.  That is where the real problem lies and it is where we should all expend our energies instead of on futile irrational exchanges across this House which will do little to solve the outstanding problems in the Border region.</P>
      <P>The region is one of the principal beneficiaries of the Operational Programmes under the Community Support Framework 1994 to 1999.  In addition, the region benefits exclusively from substantial additional funding provided under the International Fund for Ireland, the Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme and the special EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> The INTERREG and peace programmes between them provide for additional EU funding for the region of £120 million&mdash;maybe Opposition Senators would add up these figures. When the full amount of public investment provided under the programmes is taken into consideration the full extent of additional funding available to the Border region under these two programmes exceeds £160 million.  This investment is additional to what is available to the Border region under the Community Support Framework and other Community initiatives and, of course, the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>As well as providing for this substantial level of investment, the Government is committed to the concept of full additionality.  In the Dáil on 25 April 1995, the Minister for Finance gave a commitment that, once all the operational programmes under the Community Support Framework and the various Community initiatives had been approved by the European Commission, the relevant Departments would be asked to compile details of forecast expenditure under these programmes in each of the eight regions.  This exercise has been completed and the forecasts from the baseline data by reference to which additionality of the expenditure under the peace initiative and INTERREG can be demonstrated over the period of the programmes.</P>
    <P>In the specific instance of the Border counties, the Department of Finance is compiling details of projected expenditure in the area under the CSF and other Community initiative programmes. This information is updated on a periodic basis taking account of outturn, together with expenditure outturns under the peace and INTERREG programmes in order to demonstrate the additionality of expenditure over the period.  The EU Operational Committee of the Border Regional Authority is supplied with the baseline data and the periodic reports in order that it can assure itself of the additionality of the expenditure under the programmes.</P>
    <P>The baseline figures in respect of all operational programmes supporting investment in the Border region were presented to the Border Regional Authority's EU Operational Committee at a special meeting last July attended by Esben Poulsen, head of the Irish desk in the Regional Policies Directorate of the European Commission.  These will be updated at future meetings of this Border committee and will also be monitored by the Community Support Framework Monitoring Committee.</P>
    <P>Before I go into detail about the considerable additional infrastructural investment which has been provided for the Border Region under INTERREG and, indeed, the peace programme, I want to refer specifically to the Opposition request that the Government utilise all available peace initiative funds towards infrastructural development in the Border areas.  The Senators who put down the Opposition motion seem to have a basic misunderstanding of what the <Col N="331" /> Special EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation is about.</P>
    <P>In drawing together proposals for the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation the relevant authorities in both member states took into account the overwhelming need to maintain the momentum for peace, the prevailing economic and social conditions in the eligible areas, the priorities set for the initiative by the Commission, the results of the prior appraisal and the outcome of the consultation arrangements. All of these have combined to provide the rationale for the programme.</P>
    <P>The widespread consultation process engaged in the eligible areas by the European Commission Task Force found that the particular emphasis of the programme should be on peace, reconciliation and social inclusion.  These findings were borne out in the course of an extensive consultation exercise in both eligible areas by the Department of Finance and the Department of Finance and Personnel, Belfast.  In the Border region the consultation process included a conference organised by the Department of Finance in Ballyconnell, County Cavan, on 20 April 1995.  This was attended by over 200 delegates, including participation from across the Border in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In addition to the two Government sponsored conferences, a further conference was organised on behalf of the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy in conjunction with the European Commission.  The impetus for the conference came from a joint initiative of Northern Ireland's three MEPs, who had been closely associated with the work of the task force from the outset.  The conferences, which brought together a very broad range of interests from both Northern Ireland and the Border counties, was an important opportunity for the European institutions to express, at the highest level, their ongoing support for the developing peace process.</P>
    <P>Without exception, all recognised the particular emphasis the programme would need to place on measures to support peace and reconciliation.  There was no support whatever for the view that the programme should allocate significant sums to infrastructure.  The overwhelming consensus of those consulted endorsed the view that the prospect of lasting peace requires particular efforts to overcome the effects of the disruption of normal economic and social relations.  By addressing these challenges, the programme aims to help secure a lasting peace.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the programme full regárd was had to ensuring the optimum degree of complementarity and integration with the Community Support Framework Operational Programmes and relevant Community initiatives, particularly the Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG Programmes, in addition to the range of activities carried out under the IFI.  In <Col N="332" /> the Border region particularly there was a clearly perceived need to build on the support available under the Community Support Framework and the INTERREG programme to fully redress the negative perceptions that the region has had to face &mdash; I would hope that the movers of the motion would understand the importance of not increasing negative perceptions as we all try to help the region.</P>
    <P>There are specific tourism measures under the urban and rural regeneration subprogramme which set out to give the necessary boost to ongoing efforts in this area.  While there will be some scope for the statutory tourism agencies in this, the major emphasis is on bottom-up development arising from community based actions.</P>
    <P>If the present peace process proves successful, then the restoration of economic and other normality in Northern Ireland should result in considerably lessening the specific and unique problems faced by the Border region <i>vis-a-vis</i> the rest of Ireland.  We cannot emphasis that enough and I must say that none of the Fianna Fáil Senators who contributed mentioned the importance of the peace process to economic progress in the Border regions.  The mind boggles.</P>
    <P>As to how the programme should be implemented, the European Commission Task Force, following its widespread consultations in Northern Ireland and the Border counties, strongly recommended that as much as possible of the implementation of the programme be developed to local delivery mechanisms.  Given the objectives of peace and reconciliation and the paramount importance of the need to combat social exclusion, it was considered that implementing mechanisms independent of Government and closer to the grassroots offered the best means of achieving these goals. The Commission, in adopting the report of the task force, required the respective Administrations to draw up proposals putting these recommendations into effect.</P>
    <P>To ensure the independence of the intermediary funding bodies, the Commission required that they be funded through the medium of global grant agreements signed directly between them and the Commission.  The devolved delivery mechanisms for the Border counties were put in place following a series of extensive consultations between Departments and the Commission.</P>
    <P>The bodies set up have full discretion, within the parameters set by the programme, in relation to the implementation of the measures for which they are responsible.  The exercise of this discretion sometimes gives rise to differences in interpretation between intermediary funding bodies, North and South, dealing with similar actions and measures.  The joint monitoring committee for the programme monitors the activities of all of the implementing mechanisms <Col N="333" /> and is in a position to require co-ordination of actions where this is appropriate and necessary.</P>
    <P>Area Development Management Limited, already charged with responsibility for the local development programme, and the Combat Poverty Agency were the bodies charged with delivering a wide range of measures across the programme.  ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency report to the Departments of the Taoiseach and Social Welfare respectively.  Co-operation North, in conjunction with IBEC and CBI (Northern Ireland), implements the cross-Border business and culture measure.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has responsibility for overseeing this measure.</P>
    <P>The statutory responsibilities of the intermediary funding bodies became effective on 8 December 1995 when, with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies on behalf of the Commission, they signed the global grant agreements which governed how they were to implement the relevant measures of the programme for which they were responsible.  The bodies then had to set up offices, employ staff etc., and this process was substantially completed by end of February 1996. Since that date, the bodies have been actively involved in implementing the actions provided for under the measures.</P>
    <P>Another innovative delivery mechanism involved county council-led task forces, operating in each of the six Border counties.  They are responsible for delivering a wide range of actions in the urban and rural regeneration areas.  The task forces have a considerable degree of discretion in deciding how the allocation is to be spent, but the programme requires that representative and relevant local interests be consulted as appropriate.  The Department of the Environment has responsibility for overseeing the activities of the task forces.  The total EU funding disbursed through these devolved mechanisms totals £33.7 million, or over 70 per cent of the amount allocated to the Border counties.  The Commission accepted that a small number of measures could not be appropriately devolved to intermediary funding bodies.  The Department of the Environment is responsible for EU investment totalling £5.2 million under the cross-Border infrastructure measure and a further £5 million in EU funding has been provided for cross-Border co-operative actions involving public bodies.  I hope Senators are totting up these figures.</P>
    <P>The loan subsidy provisions are being administered by the European Investment Bank through the medium of the commercial banking system in the Border area.  The Department of Finance is responsible for overseeing this measure and almost all of available funding has already been committed.  It also implements the technical assistance measure, totalling nearly £1 million in EU funding.  Its function is to support the administration of the programme.  Nearly all of the technical assistance budget goes to meet the running expenses of the intermediary funding <Col N="334" /> bodies.  The total commitment figure to date is almost £28 million, or over 58 per cent of the EU allocation to the Border counties.  This figure is highly satisfactory given the difficult circumstances pertaining, and it represents a high current pace of commitment as most of it has been committed within the last six months.  I expect that rate of progress to continue and improve now that all of the delivery mechanisms are fully operational.</P>
    <P>While the bulk of commitments to date can be accounted for by the activities of State agencies, the intermediary funding bodies have recently recorded impressive progress.  In the coming months I expect them to account for an increasing share of commitments.  It should be borne in mind that, in many respects, they had to engage on a steep learning curve and the areas of the programme for which they hold responsibility are among the most sensitive and difficult.</P>
    <P>There has been a long standing commitment on the part of the Government that Structural Fund aid under the programme would be additional to Structural Fund spending in the Border counties under the Community Support Framework for 1994 to 1999 and other Community initiatives, and that the national matching finance would also be additional.  The Government has provided funding to match fully the EU funding available under the peace programme.  The programme specifically enshrines the principle of additionality, and I quote paragraph 3.29 which states</P>
    <P>The expenditure under the programme will be fully additional to expenditure which is due to take place in the eligible areas under the SPD for Northern Ireland, the CSF for Ireland and the Community initiative programmes.</P>
    <P>I would like to clarify the position on the matching funding element for the benefit of the House.  In Northern Ireland and the Border counties funding to match the EU contribution comes from a variety of sources.  However, as I already indicated, where necessary the matching funds will come from the two central Governments.  It may also be provided from a variety of sources including local authorities, the private sector and community and voluntary groups as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Due to the nature of the programme, many projects fall to be submitted from disadvantaged groups or individuals who may have extreme difficulty in making a direct contribution to the financing of their proposals and this is taken into account in deciding the level of funding from the programme.  Account may also be taken of resources in kind; for example, premises and human resources.  It is important that beneficiary groups be given every opportunity to develop some sense of ownership of a project even if a financial commitment from them is not appropriate.  The International Fund for Ireland will also co-finance some of the projects under this programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> Before I leave the subject of the peace programme, I want to return to the question of support for industrial infrastructural development.  While the general consensus was that financial provision for investment in infrastructure was inappropriate to the peace programme, there, nevertheless, is provision for such investment under sub-programme 3, measure 2, where nearly £7 million has been made available for road improvements in the Border counties.  The programme also contains other measures which are intended to contribute more directly to economic development, particularly sub-programme 5.  Measures 1 and 2 of that sub-programme offer some scope for additional assistance in the area of provision of industrial sites.  These measures are administered by the commercial banks and ADM Ltd. respectively.  An essential condition is that relevant Departments and, in particular, the county enterprise boards are involved.</P>
    <P>Senators living in Border areas may be aware of the criticism from all sectors in Northern Ireland to the funding of an advance factory in Strabane under this sub-programme.  The question of additionality was raised in that connection and I would not like to hear similar criticism levelled should this measure be availed of in like fashion in the Border counties.  While there is some funding available for infrastructural development under the peace programme, the Seanad might note that considerable investment in infrastructural services in the Border region was made under the Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG programme.  The European Commission approved an EU aid allocation to the INTERREG II programme for the six years, 1994 to 1999, of 157 million ECU, £125.6 million, of which 89.5 million ECU, £72 million, was earmarked for the Border counties.  With Exchequer co-financing and funding from State agencies and the private sector the total package for the Border counties under INTERREG amounts to nearly £115 million.</P>
    <P>The Government placed particular emphasis on ensuring the additionality of funding under INTERREG I.  The independent evaluation carried out on the INTERREG I programme on behalf of the Commission bore this out.  The emphasis on ensuring additionality has been continued under INTERREG II.  Senators are aware that the programme provides for funding for a wide range of measures in support of economic development in Northern Ireland and the six Border counties of Ireland &mdash; Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo.</P>
    <P>At the time of the drawing up of the INTERREG programme, the Government took the view that a coherent economic development strategy for the Border region is dependent on adequate infrastructural foundations.  The Government agreed that the bulk of the funding on the southern side be allocated to the infrastructural and environmental protection sub-programmes. <Col N="336" /> Roads, sanitary services, electricity networks and telecommunications are vital underpinnings to the tourism, agricultural, food processing, industrial and service sectors.  The Commission accepted the argument that a significant part of INTERREG funding should be invested in infrastructure and over £32 million out of the £72 million was reserved for such areas. When the matching funding elements provided by the State and State agencies is added, the total available for infrastructure in the Border counties comes to over £51 million.</P>
    <P>Under the infrastructure sub-programme, a special emphasis is being placed on investment in non-national roads additional to the main Operational Programme on Transport.  This includes the improvement of roads which are of importance to economic and rural community development in the Border area, including cross-Border roads that were closed due to the security situation.  Other road improvements includes projects which are complementary to the trans-European road network.</P>
    <P>The energy provision relates principally to funding for electricity interconnection projects between the northern and southern electricity systems, including the restoration of the main interconnector on the Louth/Armagh border. These projects are of significance to the development of the electricity market and to the containment of costs.  Funding for telecommunications is supporting the creation and development of a digital communications system which will benefit communities on both sides of the Border.  Exporters are increasingly dependent on telecommunications for marketing, purchasing and the electronic transfers of cash transactions.  Industrialists are reluctant to locate in areas where modern telecommunication facilities are not available.</P>
    <P>The International Fund for Ireland operates through a range of sectoral programmes &mdash; tourism, business enterprise, community initiatives, rural development, urban development, etc.  One of the fund's projects which has particularly benefited the Border region has been the £30 million restoration of the Shannon/Erne waterway.  This project, which has also received substantial funding under INTERREG and the Operational Programme for Tourism, is the largest single project approved by the fund so far.</P>
    <P>The fund's Border towns and villages &mdash; BTV &mdash;scheme focuses on those towns and villages closest to the Border and most affected by the troubles of the past two decades.  To date, 17 such schemes have been assisted involving total fund support of over £7 million.  They include such villages as Carlingford, County Louth, Inniskeen and Clones in County Monaghan, Ballinamore, Manorhamilton and Kiltyclogher in County Leitrim, Blacklion and Swanlinbar in County Cavan and Ballyshannon, Castlefinn, Newtowncunningham and Raphoe in County Donegal.  Under the fund's business enterprise <Col N="337" /> programme community groups in a wide number of towns and villages in the Border counties have received considerable assistance towards the provision of workspace.</P>
    <P>The North American Business Partnership, in conjunction with Forbairt, has promoted strategic partnerships between high-tech companies in the Border counties and North America.  Under phase 1 some 200 jobs have been created.  The significant additional EU investment to the Border counties and the additional funding leveraged through the medium of those programmes specific to the Border region are having a significant and noticeable impact on its general economic development.  I would like to draw the Seanad's attention to particular instances where Government intervention increased the economic benefit to the region over that originally proposed by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The special EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation was originally conceived to support the peace process in Northern Ireland following the IRA ceasefire.  It was not initially the intention of the Commission that it should also apply to the Border counties.  The Government argued strongly that the Border region should also be included in the aid framework emerging and following much discussion the Commission agreed to include the five counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth and Monaghan.  The Government continued to push for the inclusion of the entire Border region and the further inclusion of County Sligo was eventually conceded by the Commission.</P>
    <P>It is the case that during the consultation period indicative funding proportions of a 75:25 breakdown north and south were being considered by the Commission.  However, I note that Deputy Carey, Minister of State with responsibility for funding arrangements in the Border region, remarked in the course of a similar motion taken in the Lower House recently, that Fianna Fáil Border Deputies and Senators had sent a letter criticising the proportion being proposed for the Border region by the Commission to President Santer and Regional Commissioner Wulf-Mathies.</P>
    <P>Shortly after this, the Commission informed both member states that the funding would be proportioned on an 80:20 basis; a reduction of some £12 million to the Border region which went instead to Northern Ireland.  Take a bow Fianna Fáil.  I will leave the Seanad to draw its own conclusions.  What I have said is a fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike others I am not in the business of manufacturing facts for the record.  I would further point out to Senators opposite that the original Commission proposals for the funding of INTERREG II would have resulted in only 25 million ECU, that is £20 million, in EU aid being made available for the Border counties. <Col N="338" /> The Commission's case was that £20 million was all that could be justified for the region on a number of indices, including population levels. My Department, through the aegis of the EU Management Committee for Community Initiatives, succeeded in getting this allocation increased more than threefold to a level significantly higher than that allocated to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I return to the critical point: there is no point discussing economic difficulties north or south of the Border if we do not realise that the single greatest contribution to economic growth and the social well being of people on both sides of the Border will come from the restoration of the IRA ceasefire.  All our energies must be directed towards building whatever bridges we can to ensure that happens as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances the Seanad might agree that the Border region, which on a <i>per capita</i> basis receives significantly more funding than other regions, is being treated very favourably by this Government.  I ask the Seanad to support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this subject which is particularly important to Senators and Deputies from Border counties.  The Border region has suffered greatly in the past decade.  The horrific violence in Northern Ireland has cast a terrible shadow over the region. However, despite this, the people have shown great initiative in developing new projects which have yielded considerable benefits and provided employment and financial wealth to the area.</P>
      <P>The arrival of peace in August 1994 presented a new opportunity and engendered high hopes for the area.  The various investment funds &mdash; Leader, INTERREG and the fund for peace and reconciliation &mdash; were seen as a tremendous opportunity for developing the area and in particular the food processing sector.  Tourism and many other sectors have grown.  However, this Government has shown little interest in the area.  There is no commitment to economic development in the Border counties.</P>
      <P>If the Minister lived in a Border county &mdash; Monaghan, Cavan, Louth, Donegal, Sligo or Leitrim&mdash;she would better understand our problems.  The Minister mentioned an 80:20 breakdown of funding but the counties south of the Border are completely disadvantaged by this ratio.  I am not saying the Government can do much about that; it is an EU directive.  However, some pressure should be exerted on the powers that be to reverse this ratio because it is seen as overly favourable towards the northern counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ceasefire was a wonderful experience but the breakdown has been a tremendous blow to the situation in Northern Ireland.  I hope we revert to peace very quickly.  I call on the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to do everything in their power to restore peace.  This is a most important issue and it should be top of <Col N="339" /> the agenda for the Border counties and for Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of developing the road from Sligo to Dundalk.  This would be a great benefit to the Border counties because the area from Sligo to the port at Greenore needs to be opened.  I cannot see where the Minister of State's breakdown of figures relates to problems on the ground.  Even the organisations nominated by the Minister do not have the required funding to do the work they would like to do.  A road between Sligo and Greenore would be of real benefit to the people of the Border counties.</P>

      <P>I hope Senators do not expect me to draw all the strands together because I am hardly equipped with the background to do so.  I rose to speak because of the somewhat acerbic note which has crept into the debate.  It always pains me when I hear a reference to Northern Ireland because it seems to draw from the Opposition a tone which is most regrettable. Funds within the UK programme have nothing to do with Fianna Fáil, whether they are devoted to the Border areas of Northern Ireland or not.  I hope this is not begrudgery about those funds being used or because they are at a certain level.</P>
      <P>One eye-opener I have received since I became a Member of this House is the way so many issues are treated like a bone thrown in the middle of the floor for everyone to dive at to see who will get it first.  Some issues, such as this one, should engage the attention of nearly everyone in the Oireachtas because they are so deserving.  One would think the Opposition would help the Government to present the case and meet the people of the Border areas as one group, not as two groups each doing its best to topple the other. I have had a small amount to do with the efforts by the community in Monaghan to generate tourism, artistic and festival activities, etc. and I am lost in admiration for them.  I did not hear an acerbic note in the Four Seasons Hotel or anywhere else when I met these people to help publicise what they were doing.</P>
      <P>On an earlier occasion when discussing Northern Ireland such terms as &ldquo;separated brethern&rdquo; and &ldquo;sundered counties&rdquo; were used and I had reason to remind Senators opposite that the issue of consent has been taken on board by all constitutional parties on this island.  The only group in politics which has not done so is Sinn Féin.  Yet it appears that the consent is still conditional in some people's minds.  This should be eliminated in any discussion, especially on such a broad based matter as this.  Comparing Northern Ireland to the Border counties is like comparing apples to oranges &mdash; there is no meeting point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> Some Senators may have travelled more than I but it has been my experience that all border areas in Europe have problems, for no other reason than that they are at the end of the production line.  The only border where there are no problems is that between the USA and Canada.  However, all border areas in Europe have economic problems, particularly when exacerbated by troubles such as those in the North.  No one knows better than the people of Monaghan what those troubles are, because they suffered at the hands of the villains who exploded bombs in Monaghan and Clones without warning. Any benefits which go to Northern Ireland are sore and hard earned.  I want Monaghan, Clones, Donegal and the other areas to get a fair crack of the whip and the background details given by the Minister indicate they are getting it.  They are also blessed with community activists who earn my admiration and the admiration of many more people in the North.</P>

      <P>It will be a disappointment to many organisations in the six southern Border counties.  The theory is nothing less than a gloss over because that funding is not available in these counties.  A representative of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation met six or seven community groups in County Donegal and said that he did not have one pound note to spend on bricks and mortar in the southern Border counties.</P>
      <P>The theory is written up by the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs but it is not delivered in practice.  Even after the Minister of State's speech there will be nothing to deliver on the ground.</P>
      <P>Senator Cotter said that local authorities do not have funds and perhaps he is right as far as Monaghan is concerned.  My local authority is forced to collect a development fund of £500,000 from Donegal ratepayers to support small projects where the Government has failed. INTERREG funding to support development is being used for sewerage schemes at Muff and Ballybofey in County Donegal.  It was announced in 1995 and twice this year but nothing has been delivered.

    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue.  I raised it previously in May 1995 when the scheme was not operating fully throughout the country and the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, responded.</P>
      <P>I pointed out to the Minister of State that the scheme was costing the family butcher a great deal of money.  Butchers in South Tipperary had carried out many expensive renovations to their premises and had purchased new equipment.  As a result they were at a disadvantage because butchers in adjoining counties were not operating the scheme.  Their expenses were low so they could sell meat more cheaply.  The Minister of State graciously met a deputation from South Tipperary County Council last year in connection with this matter.  The issue is now more serious. It is important that the scheme be implemented in full in every county in the interest of reassuring the public that our meat is of the highest standard and that inspections are carried out regularly in a proper manner.</P>
      <P>The veterinary surgeons of Ireland held a conference recently.  They pointed out that this Act was only being operated by a few counties, with some partly operating it.  South Tipperary is the only county in the south which is operating the Act fully, at enormous expense.  The veterinary profession expressed alarm that this situation should be allowed continue for so long. The bottom line is the cost of implementing it. Successive Governments, and my own party, were involved in introducing this Bill.  They also introduced many regulations but local authorities must carry the can.  Given the shortage of funds in local authorities, it is impossible to continue in this vein.  It is important that where food, and particularly meat, is concerned, there should be no penny pinching.</P>
      <P>Last year in South Tipperary there was a shortfall of £129,000 in the implementation of this scheme.  We have a permanent and full time county veterinary officer, two full-time temporary vets and one part-time veterinary surgeon who are doing an excellent job.  The members of South Tipperary County Council expressed concern that while they were implementing the law other counties were not.  I heard recently that the Minister may be giving some funding to local authorities.  I hope it is sufficient to fund the scheme because much has happened since last May when I raised this issue.  It is urgent that the Act should operate nationally without any hiccups.  Credit is due to the family butchers in the counties, including South Tipperary, operating the scheme, who have done so at enormous expense.  The local authorities have carried the can in the last number of years.  I hope the Minister has good news and will allocate sufficient funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A deputation met the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, and I understand that matters are in disarray.  County managers are not challenged on why they are not implementing the <Col N="345" /> scheme.  I hope we will no longer have a lopsided implementation of the scheme.  It is not only unfair to the counties but to those who purchase meat.  Given the irregularities that have taken place, every county must implement the Act.  We hope the Minister will make funding available to enable the Act to be implemented.  It is alright to say the county manager is obliged to implement it but surely the Minister and his officials should see to it that this is done and that there is no more shilly-shallying.  We must restore the confidence of consumers which has been undermined in recent months, particularly by certain sections of the media.  That is the reason I raised this matter. I wait with great hope for the Minister's good news.  I hope the funding given will be sufficient to cover the cost to local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity afforded by Senator Byrne to discuss the Abbatoir Act, 1988, and the situation arising from it.  I pay tribute to South Riding Tipperary County Council which has taken its obligations under this Act seriously and has put a permanent veterinary presence in place, which we are anxious to ensure is implemented on a uniform basis across the country.</P>
      <P>The European Communities (Fees for Health Inspection and Control of Fresh Meat) Regulations, 1995, implements a number of European Union decisions and directives relating to standard rules for the collection of charges to cover the cost of providing meat hygiene supervision services.  The principal measure is Directive EC 85/73 EEC, as amended.  This sets down rules for the implementation of charges for the supervision of slaughter, cutting and boning, cold storage and product plant operation of beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat and poultry plants.</P>
      <P>Section 44 of the Abattoir Act, 1988, prescribes the fees payable to local authorities by abattoir licence holders in respect of animals slaughtered at domestic abattoirs.  The Act provides that the Minister may, by regulations, vary these fees. Since this enactment, the EU Directive was adopted extending the rules previously applicable to the production of meat at export plants to all meat produced in the Community including small domestic abattoirs.  The EU set the standard fees in ECUs applicable in respect of all animals slaughtered.  As EU law supersedes national law, regulations had to be introduced under the European Communities Act, 1972, to implement the Directive which amend charges previously applicable to premises licensed under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930, the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935, and the Abattoirs Act, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive also includes a provision which allows member states to impose charges to recover the full cost of providing the veterinary inspection service to individual plants.  A provision was, therefore, included in the national <Col N="346" /> legislation for charging the real inspection cost rather than the standard fee to a licence holder.</P>
    <P>Under section 35 of the Abattoirs Act the onus is on local authorities to carry out veterinary inspections of animals and meat in accordance with the Abattoirs Act, 1988, the Veterinary Examination Regulations, 1992, and the Abattoirs (Health Mark) Regulations, 1992, which implement EU legislation on the inspection of animals and meat.</P>
    <P>The exemption of plants or abattoirs which are currently under local authority supervision would require an amendment not simply of national legislation but of EU Regulations.  To secure such a change would require the support of the 15 member states concerned as well as that of the Commission of the European Union; a formidable undertaking.  Even if such agreement could be obtained, I would be concerned that the change would lead to a competitive disadvantage for Irish meat export plants which might find their competitors in other member states operating at lower costs because of the different structure of the meat industry in certain countries where meat plants are the responsibility of local authorities.</P>
    <P>There can be no relaxation on the inspections required under EU legislation.  It is, therefore, at the discretion of the county managers whether or not to impose charges on licence holders which reflect the real cost of providing veterinary inspection service at individual abattoirs.  That is the legal situation resulting from EU law.</P>
    <P>The Abattoirs Act, 1988, provided for the setting of fees on a national basis.  The purpose of this provision was to ensure that butchers' overhead costs would not be distorted by the application of different fee levels by individual local authorities.  The butchers' representative associations sought, and very strongly supported, this provision.  Their position on a standard national fee remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been experiencing severe problems in funding the cost of the local authority veterinary service in so far as it relates to meat inspection.  One option would be for them to seek to recover the full cost but this would create very serious difficulties for smaller abattoirs and may indeed force closure of many such premises.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to having a uniform level of inspection of all meat intended for human consumption.  In recognition of the difficulties which are being experienced, it is my intention to put in place, as a matter of urgency, interim arrangements which will involve an element of financial support from central funds. The exact mechanism for providing this assistance is in the process of being finalised.</P>
    <P>The Government is concerned about the lack of uniformity in the implementation of the Abbatoir Act, 1988.  It is unacceptable to my colleagues and me that we do not have the level of veterinary supervision we should have for all meat slaughtered and consumed in this country. <Col N="347" /> This has been in the domain of the Minister for the Environment in conjunction with local authorities.  We will now look urgently at the question of providing a national veterinary service.  This will involve dialogue with the local authorities and industrial relations dialogue with veterinary officers of local authorities.  We will also have to examine how departmental veterinary staff and the temporary veterinary inspectors can be pooled together so there will be uniform coverage.  The Government has agreed to give extra resources but this may involve some increase in the national charge.</P>
    <P>There is no quick fix solution to this problem. Tomorrow I will consult with officials from the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment and my own Department to try to put a blueprint in place as soon as possible.  While I cannot give specific figures&mdash;I know local authorities are preparing their estimates at this time &mdash; the Government is determined there will be uniform coverage.  The export standard for meat processing for the domestic market should be as rigorous as that imposed for the export market.  It is my intention to put that in place so that the service in Tipperary will be the same as that in the other 32 local authority areas.</P>

      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for coming to the House this evening.  It shows the interest he has in the topic we are discussing.  I urge him to continue his strong efforts to protect the lives of the Rwandan refugees who are wandering around eastern Zaire.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste knows I have a special interest in this area because I spent my summer holidays working with an NGO there in 1994.  I now recognise the areas shown on television.  It was an incredible experience and I learned how volatile the situation was in that central African area.  I was not surprised when this problem arose.  Zaire is hanging together by a thread and anyone who saw the activities of the army in eastern Zaire must come to the same conclusion.  The army spent its days manning road blocks to collect tolls. The local population live in abject poverty; they do not have the trappings of this world.  If these people wanted to pass a road block, they had to pay a toll or they would not be allowed through. I presume the army did this because it did not receive much pay.</P>
      <P>One can imagine the situation in Goma when one million Rwandan refugees arrived there. There was no water, except from Lake Kivu and that was polluted.  Everyone remembers the terrible scenes of refugees lying dying after they drank this water.  It took the various agencies approximately one week to get this situation under control.  They supplied clean water and then they tried to feed the starving.</P>

      <Col N="348" /> The first camp I visited was Muganga Camp which was just a piece of rock.  It was the most horrific experience I ever had.  There were 700,000 refugees there with no beds, clothing or protection from the elements.  When we were driving to the camp I saw little bundles lying on the side of the road.  When I asked someone what they were I was told they were bodies rolled up in the canvas in which they used to sleep.  All the deaths were caused by bad water.  This was inevitable considering that 400,000 refugees were still living in two or three camps up to last week. Services were beginning to be provided for them when I was there.  In the space of a few weeks we had put together little villages and central services in the Kigali camp.  We built them with plastic, bamboo shoots and a few nails.  Those camps were used to feed the people who were dying of starvation and who could not collect food for themselves.  Some of them stayed in the camps overnight.</P>
    <P>This situation improved over the past couple of years with little houses being built for families on various sites.  What happened was inevitable.  I remember people gathering in the camps every morning to find out what had happened the night before because someone would have spread a rumour.  These people were afraid of their own militia because if they decided to go back the militia would kill them.  We often found bodies in the mornings because word would have spread that a certain family was going to move back to Rwanda and the militia killed them because they did not want them to return.</P>
    <P>A similar situation developed approximately 25 years ago when the Tutsi tribe was involved.  It settled in eastern Zaire and it started the disturbances with the support of its brethren from Rwanda.  The Ugandans also offered some support.  There was a threat they would be sent back to Rwanda.  As a result, there is now open warfare in eastern Zaire.  The Zairian army was routed easily and the rebels have taken control of that part of eastern Zaire.  The Hutus, who inhabited the camps, became frightened and left. They are now wandering around eastern Zaire and drinking bad water because they could not take the water refining equipment with them.  The NGOs and the other agencies had to pull out for their own safety.  We are now facing another human catastrophe.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the work done by the Tánaiste and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burton.  The Tánaiste has consulted with his EU colleagues, the United Nations Special Envoy to the region and some of the African leaders.  I ask him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement.  The Rwandans object to the presence of the French in the region. Surely this could have been foreseen?  I am inclined to blame the United Nations for not responding to this situation.  Anyone from the region could have told them in the last two years that it was a volatile situation and that again there would be problems.  Could a strategy be <Col N="349" /> implemented so that we could move quickly if a disaster was threatening?  One week without water or drinking bad water means dead bodies. I know the Tánaiste is very interested in that part of the world and has been working hard on its behalf.  I recognise that and urge him to continue the good work.</P>

      <P>It is timely for us to have an opportunity for an exchange in the Seanad on the difficult situation facing the population in the Great Lakes region, Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi.  I wish to outline to the House what Senator Cotter has acknowledged is happening, primarily through my efforts and those of the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>Ireland, as President of the European Union, working in conjunction with our partners, is continuing its efforts to avert further human tragedy in eastern Zaire and to avert a potentially catastrophic humanitarian disaster in the Great Lakes region of Africa.  This has been outlined by the Senator who has personal experience of the region.  In our ongoing efforts we are working in close co-operation with the EU Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, the special representative of the Secretary General of United Nations, the Organisation of African Unity, regional leaders and other members of the international community.  We are also actively dealing with Irish NGOs and United Nations agencies in relation to this difficult situation.  A comprehensive account of the action already taken by the EU has been provided in my reply to Dáil questions on 31 October and in the Adjournment statement made by the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, on 23 October.</P>
      <P>Information from the region remains very limited and that is one of the great difficulties we have.  Although a limited ceasefire is in effect, all international humanitarian staff have now been forced to evacuate from eastern Zaire having been subjected to death threats, acts of violence and seizure of their equipment.  The conflict and instability make the delivery of humanitarian assistance extremely problematic if not impossible.  Both the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs are continuing to seek guarantees of security and access to vulnerable populations from the Zairian authorities.  The fighting in South Kivu forced over 350,000 people, Hutu refugees and local Zairians, to flee to the south and west.  In North Kivu it is estimated that up to 500,000 people are currently in the Muganga refugee camp referred to by the Senator.  The World Food Programme last distributed rations in the camp on 30 October.  It is forecast that current supplies of food and water in the camp will last no longer than one week. The UN High Commission for Refugees believes that the camp may be home to around 700,000 people within days.  The mountainous terrain and the recent rains make an outbreak of cholera very likely.</P>

      <Col N="350" /> Foreign Ministers of the EU discussed the situation in eastern Zaire at our General Affairs Council held in Luxembourg last week.  We called on all parties to exercise restraint and to have regard to the safety of civilians.  As a first step towards preventing any further escalation in violence and unrest, we called for the implementation of an immediate ceasefire and reiterated the Union's firm conviction that the complex problems at issue can only be resolved through dialogue.  We called on all parties concerned, and in particular the authorities in both Zaire and Rwanda, to begin such a process as soon as possible.  We also requested the European Commission to report urgently on the situation and to make proposals for action by the Union to assist actively in the process of getting supplies to those in need.</P>
    <P>The European Union mandated its own special envoy to return to the Great Lakes region where he has, over the past week, been engaged in intensive consultations with the Governments of Rwanda and Burundi, the United Nations, the Organisation of African Unity and other concerned parties.  Mr. Ajello also attended, on behalf of the European Union, the Summit of Regional Leaders on the Crisis in Eastern Zaire which was held in Nairobi yesterday.  I also spoke to Mr. Ajello on Monday of this week in relation to his efforts.</P>
    <P>The outcome of yesterday's summit should be viewed as a further positive step towards the realisation of a framework within which the crisis in eastern Zaire can be resolved in a peaceful and humanitarian manner.  The regional summit has given strong support to the calls made by the EU and other members of the international community for the implementation of a full and immediate ceasefire to facilitate the intensification of diplomatic efforts to achieve lasting peace.  The summit also strongly supported the establishment, in conjunction with the respective Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unit, of safe corridors and areas of sanctuary inside Zaire with an appropriate protection force to facilitate humanitarian assistance and the repatriation of refugees.</P>
    <P>The crisis in eastern Zaire is under active consideration by the United Nations Security Council and the council will be addressing the calls made by African leaders at the Nairobi Summit for urgent concerted international action. The outcome of the consideration by the Security Council should provide the broad framework for co-ordinated international action including the efforts of the European Union.</P>
    <P>In its approach to the crisis in eastern Zaire, the European Union will stringently seek to create the earliest possible opportunity for peaceful dialogue between the parties concerned while, at the same time, addressing the volatile and distressing humanitarian situation.  This reflects the Union's recognition that the humanitarian and political aspects of the crisis <Col N="351" /> need to addressed together in a comprehensive way.  We will thus seek to ensure that the necessary conditions exist for essential humanitarian tasks to be carried out as quickly as possible and for the process of dialogue to proceed.  As part of this approach, Minister of State, Deputy Burton, will chair a special meeting of EU Development Ministers to be held in Brussels tomorrow to discuss the humanitarian situation of refugees and displaced people in eastern Zaire and to assess prospects for humanitarian action to bring about an easing of the crisis.  The meeting will also be attended by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs. Sadako Ogata, Under-Secretary Acacia of the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs and representatives of UNICEF, the World Food Programme and the International Committee of the Red Cross.  The humanitarian agencies and EU member states will provide an overview of the situation and address the most effective means by which a humanitarian disaster can be averted.  In addition, the meeting will deal with the importance of effective co-ordination of responses to the humanitarian situation from the EU member states and international aid agencies.</P>
    <P>Since 1994, Ireland has contributed over £9.5 million in aid to the Great Lakes region, including more than £2.5 million to date in 1996. This contribution has been allocated to Rwandan refugees for use within Rwanda itself and to Burundi and Burundan refugees.  Our agencies have followed a clear policy of providing humanitarian aid to refugees in the region while also promoting their return through supporting the rebuilding of civil society in Rwanda.  As the Senator will be aware, the Government has recently approved the allocation of £1 million from the national lottery to provide assistance to the Great Lakes region.  This allocation will supplement funding available to the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund which will be allocated to specific projects as soon as possible. The international community has contributed $2.589 million to the Great Lakes region since October 1993.  The two largest donors have been the European Union and the United States.</P>
    <P>Humanitarian agencies are preparing to return to the region once the security situation improves. <Col N="352" /> These agencies are currently reallocating resources to Rwanda where they hope the refugees will return or that they will be able to establish humanitarian corridors.  The Government will remain in close consultation with Irish NGOs as the situation develops.  The Government is committed to the voluntary and safe return of refugees to Rwanda as a key means of achieving a long-term solution to the problems of the region.</P>
    <P>In the context of a need for a comprehensive approach to the complex and interconnected problems at issue in the Great Lakes region, the Government and our European partners remain committed to the holding of a regional conference on peace, security and stability in the region under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity.  We believe such a conference has a central role to play in the establishment of a lasting regional settlement.</P>
    <P>In conclusion.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  It is right that it is discussed in the Seanad and I can assure him that we will continue to grapple &mdash; I use the term reservedly but cautiously, but that is what we are doing &mdash; with the problem.  We are trying to co-ordinate the efforts of the various organisations within the European Union, in co-ordination with the United Nations and the Americans.  I expect to spend hours for the remainder of this day in consultation with my European Union colleagues, the United States and the United Nations to see if we can get hard information on what is happening on the ground and see if we can get the NGOs and the volunteers back working on the ground.  However, we cannot do that unless we can guarantee their security.  That will be a problem, but the most pressing problem for us at the moment is probably humanitarian aid, that is, to get food to the people on the ground.  As the Senator has described from his experience, the situation in the camp is most volatile.  We will continue our efforts in co-ordination with the world organisations to see if we can avert a human catastrophe for which there is a potential.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 November, 1996.</P>
