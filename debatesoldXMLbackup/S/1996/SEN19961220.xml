      <P>I have notice from Senator Hayes that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to give an update on the resolution passed at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which called on the Irish Government to call upon the European Union and the United Nations to obtain guarantees for the safe return of Belen Toras and Raul Ramos to Columbia.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide the necessary funding to the Irish Wheelchair Association for its proposed national respite and holiday centre at Donamon, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to approve a grant for the provision of facilities for victims of violence in Ennis in accordance with the plans of Clare Haven House Project.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Hayes's and Senator Finneran's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Daly may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>
      <P>I wish all Members a happy and peaceful Christmas.  I thank the staff in the Seanad Office, the staff of the House, ushers, stenographers, etc., and the members of the press for dutifully turning up on all sitting days and assisting us in every way possible.  I wish each Member a happy and peaceful Christmas.</P>

      <P>I thank all those who made the <Col N="1330" /> work of the House possible this year.  It has been a traumatic and difficult year for us with the loss of our beloved Cathaoirleach, the late Senator Liam Naughten.  All of us would like the Naughten family to know they are in our thoughts as we finish our year's work today.  I also thank the Clerk, Clerk Assistant and their staff for their total professionalism and courtesy during the year.  I thank the press and television people who have given us regular coverage in an honest way. It is not their fault if we do not get the coverage to which we think we are entitled because they give an honest and fair service.  I also thank the ushers, stenographers and all others who make the work of the House possible.  I wish all of them and all colleagues a happy Christmas.</P>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Items 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Item 1, as is traditional, will have one speaker from each group who will have no more than 15 minutes.  All Stages will be taken on the understanding that the Bill will be left on the Order Paper for it to be fully debated in the New Year. Item 3 will follow straight after Item 2 to be then followed by Item 4.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I express good wishes to all for the year's work, to you, a Chathaoirligh, to the staff which you and the Leader have mentioned and to all who have helped make the House run as smoothly as it has this year.</P>
      <P>I take it the matters announced on the Order of Business will run one after the other.  There were so many announcements on yesterday's Order of Business it was hard to keep up with what was going on.  I welcome the initiation yesterday of the Credit Union Bill, 1996.  I take it the Programme for Change will be discussed in the new year.  It is a major document which will have a significant influence on all local authority activities and I hope the Leader makes time in the new year to discuss it.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Independent Senators, I thank the staff of the House, the ushers and all who have been so helpful to us during the year.  As the Leader said, it has been a traumatic session for us.  We look forward to the new year which we hope will be luckier for us.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health about BUPA?  It is a splendid medical scheme but the general public is entitled to know if its cash back schemes will be allowed under the community rating scheme.  The public is also entitled to know if BUPA intends to register with the insurance ombudsman.  The VHI is registered but BUPA is not registered with the British ombudsman. Will the Minister find out if it intends to register in Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I would like to wish you, a Chathaoirligh, and all the Members of the House a happy and peaceful Christmas.  I also join in the thanks to the staff in the Clerk's office, the staff of the <Col N="1331" /> House and the press for their coverage.  We have had a good session but we note the sad passing of Senator Naughten and we extend our good wishes to his family, and those of the late Senators Fallon and Wilson, over Christmas.</P>
      <P>I join Senator Henry in seeking clarification from the Minister for Health on the status of people who have joined BUPA.  Will the Minister reassure them that their status will be protected and that they will be eligible for cover in the new year?</P>
      <P>I would also like to raise the claim made by local authority veterinary officers that pressure was put on them not to proceed with prosecutions against butchers in the Dublin area who were in breach of hygiene regulations.  There was an outbreak of E-coli and some young mentally handicapped people were affected.  There has been a tendency to understate the difficulties in the meat industry in the mistaken belief that this is in the national interest.  Will the Minister for Health ensure that action is taken where breaches occur? Our food industry is very important and if we do not pursue these matters it will damage us in the long term.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, the staff of the House and the press and wish them a happy Christmas.  The Naughten family will be in our thoughts this Christmas.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for the Environment concerning changes in local government.  Most of the coverage has been on the removal of charges but it is a much broader package than that.  Reform of local government has been of particular concern to Members of the House and I am glad that there is now a broad package on the table.  Much preparatory work has been done and I look forward to debating the issue in the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish you, a Chathaoirligh, and the staff of the House a happy Christmas.  May we have some indication from the Minister for the Environment of what the new local government arrangements will mean?  If one is talking about the abolition of local charges and their substitution by road tax, this raises a series of questions as to how this will be achieved.  Will new legislation be required and when will it be introduced?</P>
      <P>These reforms limit the ability of local authorities to raise finances.  Without seeing what the Minister has in mind, it seems we are playing musical chairs with the finances of local authorities, substituting one form of revenue for another.  At the end of the day there will be no change.</P>
      <P>The same applies to the abolition of property tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is substituting stamp duty at a much higher rate on properties worth £150,000.  It does not deal with the fundamental issue of local authority finances.  Rather than helping the matter, these changes will make things worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator O'Sullivan in commending the Minister for the Environment and the Government on the new proposals for the funding of local authorities.  Many Senators are also councillors and most of us have been elected by councillors.  Will the Leader convey our congratulations to the Minister and the Government?</P>
      <P>We should also recognise the work done over the years by bodies such as the General Council of County Councils and the Local Authority Members Association.  Many of their suggestions have been taken on board and the cash starved councils, who have struggled for the last 20 years since the vote buying exercise of 1977, can now look forward to a better future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader commend the Minister, the Taoiseach, the Cabinet and the Government for doing something meaningful at last for local authorities?  They are bringing good news at a great time of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the changes in local authority financing.  If I were a member of the Labour Party I would not be smug about the fact that two stupid taxes, both introduced at that party's insistence, are being removed and that we are now playing musical chairs.</P>
      <P>It is important that we have a full debate on what is happening in local authorities.  We have had 17 separate reports on local government in this county since 1961.  No politician in any party can be smug about the disastrous state of local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we have a debate on local government rather than these meaningless public relations statements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Ministers for Social Welfare and Agriculture, Forestry and Food address the concerns of public representatives in the Wicklow area about the treatment of Coillte workers?  This weekend a number of these workers will be suspended because they are refusing to drive their cars five miles into the forest.  They are also refusing to unilaterally accept the breaking of work <Col N="1333" /> practices which have existed for over 30 years. This will affect Coillte workers all over the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Coillte is trying to force workers off the payroll in order to massage the books. There is a need for an urgent debate on the way the company is operating.  Will the Leader pass on the concerns of many public representatives in Wicklow to the two Ministers and ask that something be done?  It is appalling that, in Christmas week, people do not know if they will be paid or what their circumstances will be immediately after Christmas.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House convey to RTÉ our dissatisfaction with the amount of time it allocates to the Oireachtas broadcasting unit to carry Seanad debates?  The Leader has rightly acknowledged the level of coverage of the House by the print media and from the RTÉ broadcast unit. However, it can only use the number of seconds coverage made available to it.  There are two Houses in the Oireachtas and there is something fundamentally wrong with the current allocation of time.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a discussion on health insurance to take place early in the next session? There is concern that the arrival of BUPA in the market will have a detrimental effect.</P>
      <P>I join in the good wishes to the staff of the House and the Cathaoirleach.  Our colleagues who have passed on will be in our minds at this time of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Cathaoirleach in his good wishes and thanks to the staff of the House for their service over the last year.  I congratulate the Government on the abolition of the residential property tax.  When Fianna Fáil was in Government with the Progressive Democrats it extended the tax and brought many of my constituents into the net.  I am glad it has been abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>What about stamp duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Oireachtas passed legislation on health insurance protecting the principle of community rating and providing for competition. It is wrong that any group should circumvent the wishes of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Unusually, I find myself in agreement with Senators on both sides of the House.  I agree with Senator Roche's comments on the RTÉ coverage of the Seanad.  I watched it last night and the impression was that the Oireachtas was closed because the Dáil session is finished.  I got the impression from the broadcast that the Seanad would not be covered, although perhaps I misinterpreted what was said.  They discussed <Col N="1334" /> the publication of a general election report which is a report of the election to the Dáil.  It is not a report of the election to the Oireachtas.  There is an unfortunate tendency to minimise the importance of this House.</P>
      <P>We will deal today with the remaining stages of the Oireachtas (Miscellaneous Provisions) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Bill, 1996, from which the Seanad is excluded.  I am told there may be legislation subsequently dealing with funding for political parties.  I heard the Minister for Finance say on the radio this morning that it was intended to provide a level playing pitch for individuals and parties. If there is no provision for the Seanad and, in particular, for Independent Senators there must be a question as to the constitutionality of the legislation.  I notice the Leader is shaking his head and I will look forward to his response.  I hope provision will be made not just for successful candidates but for all those who take a risk in the election, having regard to the number of votes they receive.</P>
      <P>I agree with the points made by Senator Doyle and Senator Henry about BUPA coming into the Irish market and I share the concerns about fairness and the exclusion of vulnerable groups by some degree of financial chicanery.</P>
      <P>Will the discussion on the Appropriation Bill, 1996 continue after the Christmas break?  I presume it is not intended to finish it today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend seasons greetings to you, a Chathaoirligh, the other Members, the staff of the House, the press and to all those who contributed to the successful operation of the House during the year.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a discussion on the currency?  During the year the punt has strengthened considerably against a number of continental currencies&mdash;by more than 12 per cent against the deutschmark and 16 per cent against the French franc, for example.  In the normal course of events this should be reflected in a reduction in retail prices.  However, this has not happened. It is a matter to which we should devote some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry recently sent a letter instructing local authorities to implement the Abattoirs Act, 1988&mdash;that is, those local authorities who were not implementing it out of their own funds.  He has indicated that he will give some funding towards its implementation but it will be up to the local authorities to provide for it from their own resources.  There is a knock on effect for food safety considerations if there is no proper system for the inspection of abattoirs which slaughter fewer than 1,000 head.  That is in effect what is happening in 12 counties.  If the Minister wishes to protect the health of consumers he should fully fund the implementation of the abattoirs legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1335" /> I recently asked the Leader to seek an assurance from the Minister for Health that community rating would be observed by BUPA.  This has been a bad week for health insurance.  It was indicated there is a gap of about 7 per cent in the VHI cover for some private hospitals which the subscribers will have to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Senator a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House seek an immediate statement on the matter from the Minister for Health?  The Attorney General is questioning whether BUPA has adhered to the guidelines.  The Minister should make a statement on the matter.  Elderly people will find themselves worse off on account of this new competition.</P>
      <P>The Leader should seek clarification from the Minister for Health and an assurance that amending legislation will be brought forward to ensure fairness and community rating.  We accept competition is needed but community rating must apply to ensure the vulnerable sections of the community are not penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in wishing the Members and all others connected with the House a happy Christmas and a peaceful new year.  I congratulate the Minister for the Environment for introducing a new system for financing local authorities.  This has been talked about for more than ten years, yet the Minister is the first to have the courage to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for the representations he made on our behalf about the Universities Bill, 1996.  I acknowledge there are dozens of proposed amendments to it to transform what was a dog's dinner of a Bill into something else. Whether it is satisfactory is another matter which we will have to consider in this House at a later date.  Having thanked the Leader for what he did on our behalf, when will the Bill come before the House and how much time does he intend to give it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Every political party in the House should bring whatever pressure they can to bear on church leaders to see that something is done about the demonstrations at Harryville Church in Ballymena.  Yesterday the president of the Independent Orange Order issued a statement supporting the demonstrations at that church.  It is the worst form of religious bigotry we have seen for a long time.  For the last 14 weeks there have been demonstrations there every Saturday night.  We are now moving into the Christmas season and they are organising themselves to picket people who are trying to go to their place of worship.  They will even hone in on midnight Mass.  We should ask church leaders North and South to see what can be done to bring pressure to bear on these groups.  The Independent <Col N="1336" /> Orange Order is a religious grouping, not a ladies carol singing group.  It is an absolute disgrace that it is playing politics with this matter.  It might help the Christmas season if we can bring pressure to bear on that group and others to cease their activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate in the new year on local government.  It is interesting to note that my former colleague in County Meath, the present spokesperson for the Environment, does not know whether he wants the charges abolished, although he did when he was seeking votes in 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>

      <P>As has been mentioned, we would like to see the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry fund the implementation of the Abattoirs Act around the country.  A number of counties have implemented it.  It is irresponsible, however, for councillors and Senators not to implement the Act but call instead on the Department to do so.  There is a duty to implement it for the sake of people's health.  Will the Leader ensure that whatever power he has is brought to bear on his colleagues and councillors around the country to implement the Act in the interests of health and food safety?  Councillors should implement it as the rest of rest of us did five years ago.  The then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry did not provide us with funds but we did it in the interests of people's health and safety.</P>

      <P>I wish Christmas greetings and a happy new year to the Cathaoirleach, Members of the House, the staff of the Seanad Office and all those involved in running this House.  Will the Leader convey to those in charge of <i>Oireachtas Report</i> the fact that the Seanad is sitting today and will be sitting in 1997 also?  We want everything that happens in both Houses of the Oireachtas, not just what occurs in one House, to be reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader convey our concerns to the Minister for Health regarding BUPA?  It has been brought to my notice that while the general plan is for everybody, there are selective plans called protection A, B, C, D and a gold one.  All age bands are included in this but I do not think that <Col N="1337" /> was the intention in having free competition.  The matter is with the Attorney General at present but the Minister for Health will have to act quickly on this to provide a proper service for everyone.</P>
    <P>I would like the Leader to convey to the Minister for the Environment our appreciation for his work on local government.  Much has been said about reform in council chambers throughout the country over the years but we have now seen something tangible.</P>
    <P>To those involved in coalitions, I would say that if there is agreement regarding taxes it is the responsibility of all parties to the agreement to support it.  If people are not prepared to take that on they should not be involved in coalitions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the Opposition for drawing attention to the publication of the Credit Union Bill which has come out on schedule.  It is a worthwhile Bill and I hope it will quickly find its way onto the Statute Book.  There will be a major debate on all aspects of local government in the next session.  I had hoped to have it during this session but certain decisions had to be reached in Cabinet first.  These decisions have now been taken.  As Senator Roche said, there are quite a number of publications, some of them recent, which could form the basis for a debate.  The debate in the next session will be open ended as many Members of the House will want to contribute.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry and others raised the question of BUPA.  It is my understanding that the whole question of community rating is central to this sector.  This was clearly spelt out by the Minister. I do not think there is any way around that.  The matter is being treated as one of urgency.  As is appropriate, the Minister has taken legal advice from the Attorney General on the matter.  We will shortly have clarification which protects the whole principle of community rating.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis raised the question of the implementation of the Abattoirs Act.  I do not have any details on that but I will pass on the Senator's concerns to the relevant Ministers.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan and others referred to the question of local government charges which will be the subject of a debate in the next session.</P>
      <P>In an omnibus contribution, Senator Roche raised a number of issues many of which were covered by other speakers.  I will refer on the question of Coillte as I am not familiar with the details involved.</P>

    <P>Senator Roche and others also raised the question of <i>Oireachtas Report.</i>  I am astonished that <i>Oireachtas Report</i> will not be broadcast today, if that is the case.  It is my clear understanding that RTÉ has an obligation to broadcast <i>Oireachtas Report</i> if either or both Houses of the Oireachtas are sitting.  I will be in immediate contact with RTÉ after the Order of Business to establish the position.  In my view, it would certainly be unprecedented for RTÉ unilaterally to break what I <Col N="1338" /> understand to be a clear agreement with the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Norris is under a misconception about the matter he raised.  The Seanad is not excluded from the Oireachtas (Miscellaneous Provisions) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Bill, 1996, which will be taken later today.  The point at issue is that there will be further legislation dealing with the spending of money at election time rather than the funding of political parties on a day to day basis. There will be a need for separate legislation for the Seanad on that matter and that will follow in due course.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard raised an important point which should be accommodated in an ongoing series of debates on economic and monetary union during the next session.  Senator Finneran raised points with which I have already dealt.</P>
    <P>All my Christmases are coming together because Senator Ross thanked me for my input in changing the Universities Bill.  I have found the Minister for Education to be extremely responsive to constructive suggestions made from all sides of the House on the Universities Bill.  She has consulted with and listened to Members.  The Bill which emerges will be good legislation.  As to the timetable, I expect the Dáil to complete it not later than the end of February.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" /> I welcome this opportunity, in the unavoidable absence of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to address Seanad Éireann today on the 1996 Appropriation Bill.  The annual Appropriation Bill gives statutory effect to the departmental Estimates for the Supply Services, non-capital and capital, including all Supplementary Estimates which were approved by the Dáil since the last Appropriation Act.  The Bill appropriates to the various services listed in the Schedule the sum of £11,043 million.  This total amount comprises the original Estimates of £10,794 million, as voted by Dáil Éireann last July, and Supplementary Estimates totalling £249 million.  In line with the normal practice, the Bill also approves the use of departmental receipts amounting to £1,019 million as appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    <P>Most of the focus of public debate on Government expenditure is on the level of spending on gross non-capital supply services.  This relates to the day-to-day spending of Departments.  The 1996 Estimate for gross non-capital spending as published in the revised Estimates Volume was £12,087 million which was subsequently increased by £50 million following the presentation of a revised Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to provide £50 million in respect of EU disallowances.  The Supplementary Estimates provided for in the Appropriation Bill add a further £131 million on top of this £50 million.  These additions bring total 1996 gross current spending to £12,268 million.  This is the figure for gross current expenditure referred to by the Minister for Finance in his statement on the publication of the 1997 Estimates last week. It represents an increase of 6.7 per cent in nominal terms or 4.8 per cent in real terms over 1995. It is likely that the actual 1996 outturn will be lower than £12,268 million since savings may emerge between now and the end of the year.</P>
    <P>In his statement on the Estimates, the Minister dealt comprehensively with the reasons expenditure overruns have occurred this year which have necessitated the Supplementary Estimates included in the Appropriation Bill.  The Minister explained in considerable detail the reasons spending has increased in 1996 in order to show that the criticisms which have been made recently that public expenditure is out of control are unjustified and misleading.  The single biggest increases in current spending have been for the EU agricultural disallowances or beef fines and for additional spending due to the BSE crisis. These two items alone added £113 million to gross current spending this year.  This additional expenditure was absolutely unavoidable and arose from circumstances which were entirely outside the Government's control.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Government also decided to increase spending this year in a number of other areas where there was a clear and pressing need to do so.  For example, it was necessary to allocate additional resources to the Government's anti-crime package.  Also additional funds were provided <Col N="1340" /> to meet pressures in the health area in relation to the cost of the community drugs schemes and to reduce waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat in this House the assurance given by the Minister for Finance in the Dáil yesterday that the additional expenditure which has emerged this year does not in any way signal a weakening of this Government's resolve to control public expenditure.  Spending is being closely monitored and controlled.  The Government has taken steps to improve the expenditure management systems in Departments through a tightening up of the normal expenditure reporting arrangements.  Further measures to improve the expenditure management process are being introduced as part of the strategic management initiative, to which I will refer in more detail later.</P>
    <P>In his statement in the Dáil yesterday, the Minister for Finance gave a detailed outline of the position in relation to expenditure in 1997.  I do not propose to go over the same ground today. However, one very important point which the Minister made is worth repeating and it is this: the fundamental measure of the health of the public finances is the level of the general Government deficit.  The House can rest assured that, on this measure, the public finances are firmly under control.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism that the Government has exceeded the demanding targets which it set for itself to limit the growth in current public expenditure to an average increase of 2 per cent above inflation over the years 1996 and 1997. However, it is misleading and blinkered to look at the position on expenditure in isolation from the overall budgetary position.  Government budgetary policy is very much on course to meet the requirements for participation in economic and monetary union.  The Government's expenditure plans for 1997, as detailed in the Estimates published last week, are an integral part of the overall budgetary framework and are entirely consistent with the achievement of the Government's overall budgetary goals.</P>
    <P>The budgetary framework which the Government has decided for 1997 and in a medium-term context will allow for a level of Government borrowing or general Government deficit which is well within the guidelines set out in the Maastricht Treaty and in the EU stability and growth pact, final details of which were agreed at last weekend's EU Summit in Dublin Castle.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the efforts and considerable skill of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, in successfully negotiating the stability and growth pact which will give a decisive further impetus to economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>This Government's record on controlling public expenditure stands up well to scrutiny when one looks at the position under the previous Government.  The real increase in current public spending in the years 1992-94, inclusive, was an average of about 6 per cent per annum.  This is significantly higher than the average of about 4 <Col N="1341" /> per cent per annum in the period 1995-97 under this Government.  It is clear, therefore, that this Government, in line with the broad thrust of its stated policy, has achieved a considerable measure of success in slowing down the rate of growth in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to maintaining firm control of the public finances and public expenditure in particular over the medium-term has been put in clearer focus by the move to a three year multi-annual budgetary cycle.</P>
    <P>The new approach to framing the budget will mean that it will now be possible for the Government to examine policy changes on spending or taxation in the light of their impact on a clear and agreed benchmark and in the overall budget context.  The overriding aim is to give the Government more effective control over the evolution of the major budgetary aggregates and the allocation of resources between spending programmes. The Minister for Finance is determined that progress will continue to be made with this approach to framing the Estimates and budget.</P>
    <P>The strategic management initiative now under way in all Departments will widen and deepen this process.  Under the new public expenditure and financial management system outlined in <i>Delivering Better Government</i>, which was launched by the Taoiseach on 2 May of this year, there will be a major devolution of responsibility to Departments for the expenditure programmes under their aegis.  There will also be a strong emphasis on reviewing expenditure programmes to ensure the best possible value for money.</P>
    <P>As the medium-term planning system is introduced and broad indicative allocations are settled by the Government for different programmes, Departments will be encouraged to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of those programmes. There will be a major incentive for Departments to make certain that they have in place management systems designed to produce the maximum value for money.  On a broader level, the strategic management initiative continues to make progress in the Civil Service.  A number of Departments and offices have already published a strategy statement&mdash;I received the Tánaiste's today &mdash;and several more will become available before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The general availability of statements of strategy for each Department and office marks a major step forward for the SMI.  These strategy statements, by setting out the objectives and priorities for each Department, allow the business of individual Departments to be more rigorously scrutinised.  Their availability also helps to bring greater clarity to the complex business of public administration and in this regard constitute a very valuable contribution to a better understanding of work in this area.  Crucially, the SMI is also about delivering better services to the public, realising efficiencies and making the best use of our resources.  I have no doubt that as SMI takes deeper root within Departments, and as the disciplines which it engenders become the norm at <Col N="1342" /> all levels of management, its impact will become increasingly apparent and will facilitate the delivery of cost effective and efficient public services.</P>
    <P>The publication earlier this year of the programme of change, <i>Delivering Better Government,</i> has given renewed impetus to the SMI process. This programme is directed at achieving real and lasting improvements in efficiency and effectiveness in the civil and public service.  Its aim is to ensure that only the best management practices are employed, practices which emphasise the highest standards of performance and the pursuit of excellence in service delivery and which recognise the primacy of the customer.</P>
    <P>A key objective of <i>Delivering Better Government</i> is the introduction of an enhanced framework for devolving responsibility and accountability. This will require amendments to the Ministers and Secretaries Act, and legislation will shortly be brought before the Oireachtas to give effect to this.  The proposed framework will provide a legal mechanism for enabling responsibilities and accountability within the civil service to be clearly identified and assigned while preserving the ultimate responsibility of Ministers to Dáil Éireann, as required by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Delivering Better Government</i> will also introduce improvements in other areas such as the better management of human resources, enhanced financial management systems and procedures to which I have already referred, as well as the better use of information technology and improved co-ordination between Departments in the management of key national issues such as child care and the environment.  Overall, I am confident these initiatives will result in a more efficient and effective civil and public service which provides good value for money, and I know the Government can depend on continuing support from all sides of this House in progressing this important initiative.</P>
    <P>Section 3 extends the termination date of the temporary £1,000 vehicle registration tax scrap repayment scheme introduced in the Finance Act, 1995.  Under the scheme the Revenue Commissioners will repay £1,000 VRT to a person who, between 1 July 1995 and 31 December 1996, scraps a car which is ten years old or more and, at the same time, buys and registers a new car. The scheme will now run up to 31 December, 1997 on the same terms and conditions as currently apply.  Senators will be interested to know that since July 1995, more than 23,000 cars have been scrapped under the scheme.  More than 18,000 of these were in the ten to 16 years old age bracket but a number of vehicles 30 years old and over have also been scrapped.</P>
    <P>The scheme has been a great success and has been very positively received by the public and by the motor trade.  It has helped to remove many old and dangerous cars from the roads.  The replacement of these older models by new cars purchased under the scheme has also benefited the environment through the consequent reduction in air pollution due to the latest levels <Col N="1343" /> of technology in the newer cars.  In addition, vehicles which might eventually have been dumped or abandoned are scrapped, crushed and disposed of in a proper and environmentally friendly manner.  It has not, however, increased the total car stock so it cannot be blamed for extra traffic congestion in our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>The scheme has also provided a boost for sales of new cars and has brought the purchase of a new car within the grasp of some car owners who might not otherwise have been able to purchase one.  The scheme has helped increase car registrations in 1996 to record levels with in excess of 114,000 new car registrations expected by the end of the year.  Other factors have also played a major role.  These include the low interest rate environment, the increase in consumers' disposable income, the stable economic climate and the fact that further economic growth can be relied upon and one can invest in a new car with some degree of confidence in the future.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the motor trade had asked for the scheme to be renewed for a further year.  While the scheme clearly assists those selling cars, this was not the determining factor in the decision to extend the scheme.  The quality and the age profile of our national car stock needed to be addressed.  Furthermore, the continuation of the scheme for another year will dovetail with the Government's announcement in October that it will introduce compulsory car testing from 1998.  Owners of cars of ten or more years will have a final chance to dispose of them under the extended scrap repayment scheme especially if they fear their car is unlikely to pass the proposed tests without expenditure on repairs or improvements.</P>
    <P>There has been some coverage in the media of dealers who have sold cars worth more than £1,000 traded in under the scrappage scheme instead of scrapping them as is required.  In those instances, the dealers have not informed the customers of their old vehicles' intended fate.  I hear from the trade this may have happened in no more than 20 cases at the most.  While I do not condone such action, Senators will appreciate this must be seen in the context of nearly 23,000 payments to date.  In cases where cars were sold on, the required certification of destruction was not issued and the £1,000 payment of VRT was not made to the dealer.</P>
    <P>While there does not appear to have been any revenue loss, customers may feel they have lost out by selling a car for less than it is worth.  This practice is totally against the spirit and the intention of the car scrappage scheme and the Minister for Finance has made this view clear to the trade. I am pleased the Society of the Irish Motor Industry has directed its members that if a garage wishes to sell on a car surrendered under the scheme, it should only do so with the consent of the customer and that all cars offered and accepted under the scheme should be scrapped. This assurance is welcome and the Minister for <Col N="1344" /> Finance has asked the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to monitor the situation.  This scheme was one of the more enlightened initiatives in the public arena in the recent past.  It had its doubters both in official circles and in the trade but it has been successful.  I have no doubt the scheme will generate the same enthusiasm in its final year as it has in the past eighteen months.</P>
    <P>The Appropriation Bill is normally one of the last items of legislative business to be dealt with in any year.  As such it presents a good opportunity to review the performance of the economy during the year.  The economy continues to perform exceptionally well.  Economic growth in 1996 as measured by the increase in GNP is expected to be around 6 per cent.  This rate of economic growth is well in excess of the average of our EU or OECD partners.  The economy is expected to continue to grow strongly in the coming years but perhaps not quite at the very high levels of recent years.</P>
    <P>Consumer confidence remains very buoyant. This is clearly evident in all the major towns and cities.  Consumers are spending more because interest rates are at historically low levels, more jobs have been created and people have seen an increase in their real disposable incomes.  Retail sales in the first eight months of 1996 were nearly 7 per cent higher in volume terms than in the same period in 1995.  Investment by industry and business generally has also recorded a further substantial increase this year, underlining the high level of confidence in the economy.  This confidence derives largely from a belief that the Government's management of the economy and of the public finances will continue to steer us on a path of low budget deficits and high economic growth.  The Government is determined that this course is followed.</P>
    <P>Ireland's inflation rate for 1996, as measured by the average increase in the consumer price index will be 1.6 per cent, a very satisfactory performance. Export growth this year has slowed down somewhat, reflecting the sharp fall in some of our European markets in the first six months of the year and also the effect of the BSE crisis on agricultural exports.  Export growth of 10 per cent in volume terms, however, represents a very satisfactory performance.</P>
    <P>On the employment front, in 1996 alone, it is estimated that 50,000 new jobs were created which is a remarkable achievement.  The increase has been strongest in the fast growing services sector.  Industry also recorded appreciable job gains, particularly in high technology areas of manufacturing.  I acknowledge that unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, remains an intractable problem.  However, the Government has taken important steps to tackle this problem through the allocation of substantial additional resources, both this year and in 1997, for FÁS training and employment schemes, including the community employment scheme.</P>
    <P>As we approach the end of the year, I take this opportunity to mention the successful conclusion <Col N="1345" /> of what has generally been acknowledged to have been an outstanding Irish Presidency of the European Union.  I believe all those involved&mdash;the Taoiseach, the Government and public officials alike&mdash;can be justifiably proud of their achievement. It has reflected very well on the Irish public service and I personally to extend my thanks to all those who worked so hard to make it a success. From attendance at Council meetings in Brussels and chairing conciliation meetings, I am aware of the work carried out by our public servants, at home and abroad, over and above the call of duty.  In no small way their tremendous commitment to the governance of Ireland and its role in Europe helped to make our Presidency a success. As Minister of State with responsibility in this area, I thank them for their great commitment to the success of Ireland's Presidency.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  I wish the Cathaoirleach and Members a very happy and peaceful Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The spirit of goodwill that flows through my veins at this time of year may prevent me from harping on the old adage that self praise is no praise.  The Government inherited the benefits of an economic boom when it entered office in 1994 and, thankfully, it has done little to prevent that boom continuing.  It is not unfair to remind the parties in Government that, when in Opposition from 1987 to 1992&mdash;in some cases to 1994&mdash;they attacked every measure put in place to resolve the economic problems prevalent at that time and construct the foundations of the current economic revival.  They spurned the idea of good and prudent economic management at that time and it is clear they have now begun to turn a blind eye to the necessity for such management.</P>
      <P>In 1992, when recovery was well under way, one of the junior partners in the present Coalition entered Government and can claim some credit for what occurred between 1992 and 1994, but it must equally share blame for any mistakes made during that period.  However, I fear the left wing of the Labour Party, and the even further left wing of Democratic Left, are propelling this country down the same disastrous economic road it entered in the 1970s and 1980s for which politicians of all hues must still bear their fair share of blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I worked in the Department of Finance in 1973 and I recall we first began to spend ourselves into difficulties at that time.  If the records of the period are consulted, it is obvious that the deficits incurred were quite small.  It is also apparent that the first steps taken toward the expenditure madness which prevailed in the following 15 years were also small.  The reality is that expenditure accelerated in the 1970s when it appeared safe and prudent to do so in terms of priming the economy.  However, we could not get off the expenditure spiral once we entered it.  Expenditure continued to accelerate between 1983 and <Col N="1346" /> 1987 and it was only after 1987, when economic reality began to dawn on politicians on all sides, that steps were taken to bring the madness to an end.</P>
    <P>Given current positive economic indicators, reducing public expenditure and, more precisely, the existing deficit&mdash;the current debt burden&mdash; should be a priority for the Government.  Servicing foreign and domestic debts remains one of the heaviest burdens borne by PAYE taxpayers. Everyone recognises this reality and is aware of the statistics.  Servicing these debts continues to consume the majority of the revenue gained by the State through personal taxation, particularly that obtained from taxes paid by PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>Honest taxpayers cannot defer their debts, hide their incomes by using clever accounting practices or rely on rich and powerful friends to pay their domestic bills.  Therefore, we owe it to them to ensure that there is universal and honest compliance with the nation's tax system.  Powerful people in business and politics cannot be allowed to adopt an <i>á la carte</i> attitude to the tax laws of the State.  However, matters of taxation are not the primary issues dealt with in the Appropriation Bill.  We also owe it to honest taxpayers to adopt a prudent and careful stewardship of their money.  After all, every penny in the State's coffers belongs to the taxpayers.  The third thing we owe to taxpayers is to take every measure possible to minimise the tax burden.  Today's debate is focused on the latter two responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The rise in public spending next year means that the Government is expanding its demands on taxpayers by four times the rate of inflation and the cost of that spending will be six times higher than in the current year.  If exceptional issues are factored out and we compare like with like, the actual increase in the spending bill will be 7.4 per cent.  That is taxpayers' money.  It is not possible to consider each expenditure head but the point must be made that inflation stands at approximately 1.6 per cent and Government expenditure should not rise above that level; Government expenditure should be capped.  It can be argued that there are endless good causes which can put demands on the taxpayer.  However, no Government has the right to recklessly expand the bills that taxpayers are obliged to pay.</P>
    <P>A Finance Minister once stated that there is an essential truth about being a Finance Minister. The individual in question stood to physically lose his head.  At the time of the revolution in France it was pointed out that that which Government spends it must first take from its citizens.  We seem to have lost sight of this.  Next year the Government will spend approximately £13 billion, which represents £13,000 for each taxpayer or £4,000 for every man, woman and child. I do not doubt that the Government and the Minister could state that most of the items covered under the expenditure heads are good and prudent.  However, the reality is that we are spending at a rate we cannot afford.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> This Government's attitude, which is reflected in the presentation of the Appropriation Bill, is smug, dangerously complacent and breathtakingly reckless and it sacrifices prudent financial management on the altar of political expediency and short-term political gain.  The Bill is storing up problems for future taxpayers.  I know senior advisers in the Department of Finance have indicated their alarm at the excessive increase in expenditure and the failure of this Government to reach any financial targets it has set.  Because of the artificiality of the Bill, it is not possible to go through each heading of public expenditure or for me to address the issues raised in the appropriation accounts.  I would like to touch on four specific issues, two of which relate to taxation&mdash; the changes in the RPT and in local government service charges.  The third issue concerns the numbers in the Civil Service and the fourth relates to a trivial detail, bonus payments to civil servants.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision by Government to abolish the residential property tax which was cooked up at a barbecue attended by a Fine Gael Taoiseach and a current Labour junior Minister.  Like so many things concocted at barbecues, it has proven to be a singularly indigestible taxation. More trouble has been caused by the RPT than the tax has been worth.  Abolition will cost the Exchequer approximately £15 million which the Minister will get back from a 50 per cent hike in stamp duty.  These changes will be widely welcomed, notably along the east coast and particularly in Dublin city south of the River Liffey and in north Wicklow in places such as Bray, Greystones and Delgany.  The RPT has been one of the most stupid things the Labour Party ever inflicted on us and it became a tax on modest dwellings owned by ordinary taxpayers.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a danger in the decision taken on stamp duty charges.  Ultimately, the 50 per cent hike in stamp duty will have the same regressive and discriminatory effect on a small and identifiable area.  In effect, the change in stamp duty will rob some property owners of the fruits of their savings which they have invested in their homes.  That burden will inevitably fall on taxpayers and homeowners who dispose of their homes in south Dublin and north Wicklow.  The universal applause which today greets the decision to get rid of the stupid residential property tax will ultimately raise further questions.</P>
    <P>I refer to the decision on local charges.  Again, this imposition was first introduced by the Labour Party.  Two things have happened since service charges were introduced.  First, the amount of the tax has grown spectacularly in virtually every tax year and, second, public resistance to the tax has consolidated, particularly since the Dublin West by-election, a fact we must accept.  The decision to pay for this change by transferring the yield from motor tax to local authorities will be problematic and raises several issues.</P>
    <P>I agree that motor tax should go to local authorities <Col N="1348" /> expenditure.  It is a good idea and I applaud the Minister for introducing it.  However, I suggest that it would be more appropriate that the money be transferred to local authorities to spend on roads, particular county roads.  The deficiencies in county and by-roads are highlighted by the amount of Structural Funds going into the national road network.  Motor taxation should go to local authorities for roads and not be used as a stop gap to rectify the crisis in local government finance which has arisen because of universal political cowardice to do anything about it.  This change will rob Peter to pay Paul.</P>
    <P>This could also have the effect of being a cap on the amount of expenditure local authorities can sustain.  Although we are in the happy position that, roughly speaking, the amount of money being transferred from motor tax will compensate for the abolition of water and sewerage charges, it is unlikely such an equation will always exist.  If local authority members want to expand services, they will be tied rather haphazardly to the level of income which the motor tax transfer, which will not really be controlled by local authorities although there will be some flexibility, will provide.</P>
    <P>It would be unfair to criticise this decision in detail because we do not know as yet how the change will be effected.  Perhaps the Minister of State and her colleagues will turn their minds to a number of specific issues over the Christmas period.  As she knows, there is the major issue of equalisation and there will be a problem, particularly if we try to introduce a variable rate of taxation on the relative local authorities borders.  A number of issues need to be addressed in this regard.</P>
    <P>The strategic management initiative is a good and an ongoing measure and is having positive beneficial effects on the Civil Service.  I am concerned about the inexorable upward increase in the number of civil servants.  The Minister for Finance said yesterday in the other House that there will be an increase of 600 per year.  It is worth reminding ourselves that between 1922 and 1947 there was virtually no increase in Civil Service numbers.  Between 1947 and 1957 Civil Service numbers increased by approximately 100 to 120 per year.  Through the 1960s and into the 1970s the increase in the number of civil servants reached 1,000 per year.  It was out of control by the end of the 1970s when, as part of the policy of pump priming, there was effectively an open door to recruitment in the public service.  There is nothing wrong with recruiting more public servants to provide beneficial services to the people. However, we must remember that when we increase the number by one, we are taking on a burden for 40 years.  That is a reality of which we sometimes lose sight.</P>
    <P>I understand that between 1994 and 1995 Civil Service and public service numbers have risen by approximately 3,700.  The Minister will appreciate it has been difficult for me to research the specifics and this figure is only a reported statistic.  If <Col N="1349" /> it is true, it means that all the benefits from the redundancy package introduced in the Civil Service some years ago have been wiped out.  We have a problem here because we should look for something which is more efficient.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly referred to the tremendous work done by civil servants during Ireland's Presidency of the EU.  I had the honour to be a civil servant when Ireland joined the EU.  The Minister rightly said that our civil servants have provided an extraordinary service to this nation throughout our EU membership.  That contribution is spread throughout the Civil Service and the wider public service.  Today's print media has criticised bonus payments of between £2,000 and £2,600 to certain people in the diplomatic corps and in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I do not agree with that principle because disruption is part of the diplomatic service.  If bonuses are to be paid, it is unfair that they are focused on one Department.  Civil servants in the Minister's Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, other Departments and State agencies have given a huge amount of their time. If there is to be a benefit payment &mdash; I question the idea of a cash payment &mdash; it is unfair and inequitable to focus on one Department.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State and her staff well over Christmas and in the preparation of the budget.  It will be an interesting and exciting time for us.  While this is not meant to be a carping criticism, there is a danger of smugness and complacency in the economic management of this State.  Things are going well and please God that will continue for many years.  As the Minister of State rightly said, we have intractable problems, such as unemployment, to address and we still have a huge debt which has been worked up by successive Administrations over the years though I will not blame any party.  When times are good it is prudent management to cut the debt and ensure there is not a continuing burden on taxpayers.</P>

      <P>Each year the Appropriation Bill brings our work to a close.  It restructures our finances to bring them into line at the end of the year and I do not intend to delay its passage through the House.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and the Government on the performance of the economy in the last two years.  The finances are firmly under control and Government budgetary policy is on course to meet the requirements for participation in economic and monetary union.  We can be proud of the way our economy has boomed in recent years.  Interest rates are the lowest this country has ever experienced. This is a boost for householders and the construction and other industries.  When industry can borrow at low repayment rates it affects every aspect of its operations, particularly the cost of unit production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inflation is 1.6 per cent this year.  Never have we had such low inflation.  We can also be proud <Col N="1350" /> of the country's progress in job creation. Approximately 100,000 jobs were created in the past two years.  The number of unemployed has decreased in recent months and fallen to the lowest level for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government on its introduction of the multi-annual budgeting strategy.  It is a great development.  It is good for the Government, regardless of its composition, and Departments to have a strategy to bring projects on stream over a number of years.  It facilitates planning and means that when commitments are given by Government they will be honoured.  This is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on extending the car scappage scheme which has been most successful. Approximately 23,000 cars were scrapped and 114,000 new cars were registered this year. The scheme has been welcomed by the motor industry and all members were enthusiastic that it be extended.  The scheme will benefit everybody, especially road users, because our roads will be safer.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned two areas in which spending has increased &mdash; the much publicised BSE problem and the anti-crime package. The Minister for Justice has performed particularly well in the last 12 months.  She has a difficult portfolio.  I congratulate her on the manner in which she tackled the many problems that arose.  She has introduced many valuable legislative measures.  I also congratulate the Fianna Fáil Party for introducing Bills which complement those introduced by the Minister.  This has led to an increase in spending but in this case it can be justified.  It means our country will be a safer place.  The people are happy to have secured the changes they sought.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for the Environment of changes in funding for local authorities.  I agree with the calls by other Senators for a full debate on this issue.  I have sought a debate on the problem of waste disposal. It is one of the biggest difficulties facing local authorities and we must deal with it.  It is a major issue for the east coast; it is probably a bigger problem there than in the rest of the country. There should be an early debate on the issue and it should be part of a wider debate on the funding of local authorities.  The removal of the residential property tax is welcome.  The increase in property prices in recent years had brought a number of householders into the net and I am pleased with the Government's decision in that regard.</P>
    <P>I wish to be associated with the tributes by Senator Roche and the Minister of State for our public service.  After my dealings with them in the past I can only speak highly of them.  They are to be commended on their work and efficiency.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> I wish to discuss the Irish Presidency of the EU and how it was conducted.  I was in Brussels last month and everybody I met was most impressed by the work of the Irish people &mdash; Civil Service, Ministers, Tánaiste and Taoiseach.  Their handling of the Presidency was considered excellent by our fellow Europeans.  It made one proud to be Irish to see how, as a small nation, we could carry out our work so well.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill before the House, every year has its high and low points and budgetary adjustments must be made.  This year we were obliged to pay beef fines of approximately £50 million.  There was also excess spending to deal with the BSE problem.  Extra money had to be expended on an anti-crime package that was long overdue.  People flout the law, break into the homes of old people and inflict injury on young and old with no regard for human life.  A cruel culture has developed among people involved in crime.</P>
    <P>We also had to spend extra money on the community drugs scheme and on decreasing waiting lists.  Spending has been closely monitored and controlled and we are on line for economic and monetary union in 1999.  Our affairs have been handled well and we are within the guidelines of the Maastricht Treaty and the new suitablity and growth pact agreed by the EU Summit last weekend.</P>
    <P>I welcome the strategic management initiative to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  Greater co-ordination is needed between Departments and local authorities.  Coming from a coastal constituency, we often try to get the Department of the Marine or the county council to carry out a function and sometimes it falls between both and long delays can develop.  I would like to see closer co-operation between the Department of the Marine and the local authority in aquaculture, pier building, control of fishing, pollution and other such matters.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the extension of the car scrappage scheme which has been very successful in putting many new cars on the road.  Old and dangerous cars and those polluting the atmosphere have been scrapped.  The extension has also been welcomed by the motor trade.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, for introducing the new local government package.  It is long overdue and combining it with the increase in the number of new cars will mean more money for local authorities. If this continues, there will be no need to increase car tax as was suggested.  I am happy with the schemes introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister for the Environment abolishing RPT and water and sewerage charges.  In Coalition Governments, a policy may often not suit one party but it will have to be agreed.  In the 1992 Government the Labour Party agreed with issues that were not part of their policy.  When a policy is formulated by a coalition, compromises must be made.  We <Col N="1352" /> have to take responsibility for the whole package afterwards.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche must have taken his anti-Labour Party pill this morning.</P>

      <P>It is a bitter pill when the Minister for Finance is successful in running the financial affairs of the country, which some people thought he could not do.  The scrappage scheme was introduced by the Minister who, although a member of the Labour Party, is still part of a Coalition Government.  Therefore, it is still part of Government policy.</P>
      <P>It is good to see inflation as low as 1.6 per cent. However, despite this there should still be increases in the budget for old age pensioners and single parents who are struggling to live.  The increase is often gobbled up quickly by increases in essential items that are sometimes higher than the inflation rate of 1.6 per cent.</P>
      <P>I wish everyone in the House a happy Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. A. Doyle) Avril Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and their support of my complimentary remarks on the public sector, particularly as we conclude our Presidency of the EU.  The public service contributed enormously and beyond the call of duty to the success of this Presidency.</P>
      <P>I will not take up the various political points made by Senator Roche.  I could write his script and he could write mine; we have been around too long to play this game at the penultimate hour of this session.  I will respond to his comments on numbers in the public service.  We expect an approximate increase of 250 civil servants in the public service in the coming year. There are between 210,000 and 230,000 public servants, depending on the method of assessing numbers in the Government Vote as distinct from local authorities and health boards.  In a total of 210,00 public servants we are expecting an increase of about 600, which is a small percentage. Increases are extremely tightly controlled and approval must go to Government for any proposed additional numbers in the Civil Service. I accept that the scheme of 1987-89 had an important effect in reducing numbers.  However, it was crude in terms of axing some services.</P>
      <P>As regards the voluntary early retirement scheme, we could not control those who wanted to go.  Sometimes it was the best and brightest who were cherry picked by the private sector and who availed of this scheme leaving gaps in certain specialities and services.  Those we encouraged to leave, who were suffering from burnout, intractable problems or were no longer suitable for the job, were the least likely to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of numbers, the scheme was effective but not in delivering a quality service to the customer. This is what the public service is about, <Col N="1353" /> and I include politicians as public servants.  If the service is no longer required, the same may apply to those delivering it.  If the service is not efficiently delivered those delivering it may not be the right people to do so.  We must view the public and Civil Service in terms of the service they are required to provide.  A major part of the strategic management initiative is to refocus on the customer and to ask what are we providing? How are we providing it?  Should we be providing it?  Could it be best provided elsewhere?  We could then decide the number of public and civil servants needed to most efficiently and effectively provide a quality service with best value for money.</P>
    <P>This issue should be looked at from the other side.  We can indulge in the numbers game, score political points and I can accuse the last Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat-Labour Governments of reducing the number of civil servants.  The scheme in 1987-89 worked quantitatively but not qualitatively.  While there is not an absolute embargo now, any increases must be approved by Government.  This means we can get the essential services, experience and new skill we need.  At the same time, we check whether the resources to provide the service are there already and then carefully allow for the employment of those with specific skills or extra numbers if that is what is required.</P>
    <P>I would like to think we have moved past the crude numbers game in the public service, even though we must control the overall level of staffing. Ireland has a narrow productive base and can only afford to pay for so many to deliver Governmental services needed for our quality of life.  We must have a sophisticated way of sorting out what staff we need and where we need them.  There is a major case for more and easier redeployment. There are areas working themselves out of existence with technology and mechanisms.  We do not need as many administrative staff as we did but rather staff with new skills and specialities.</P>
    <P>There was a huge rate in numbers in the 1950s and 1960s but since then an enormous number of public servants has been involved in the Northern Ireland peace process.  They are committed to that work until the problems there are resolved. A huge number of public servants has been committed to Ireland's membership of the EEC, EC and EU.  They are needed because we continue to depend extremely heavily on the best and brightest in the public service in terms of their work in the international arena.  Ireland is now a proud main player in world trade because of the contribution of successive Governments.</P>
    <P>I will debate this aspect with anybody and play politics if necessary.  If I was in Opposition, there are plenty of statistics I could use to play the political game.  However, in analysing the public service and the quality of work of public servants, I hope people will consider it in terms of quality rather than quantity.  The number must be strictly controlled but not to the point of using it as a crude weapon which allows the best and brightest <Col N="1354" /> to be cherry picked by the private sector.  The strategic management initiative is a bigger, more sophisticated game plan, but it also keeps a close eye on value for money and taxpayers who must ultimately pay the bill.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the economy and public expenditure and that we are strictly within the Maastricht guidelines.  The real measure of a Government's performance is the level of borrowing and general deficit and the average increase is well within the Maastricht Treaty guidelines and the EU stability and growth pact, the details of which were fixed last week by the Minister for Finance during the EU summit in Dublin.  I have no concerns about this matter.  If one averages it over the last few years, the level is 2 per cent lower than the figure achieved by the previous Government in four years.  It was running at 6 per cent but the average over the last three years is 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is not good enough.  We should be kept on our toes and it is good that the private sector and the Opposition say it is unsatisfactory.  It should be pitched at the rate of inflation, but that is in an ideal world.  The areas which caused increases in the borrowing limit in 1996 included the problem of the EU disallowances &mdash; the beef fines &mdash; and BSE.  That difficulty was not of the Government's making.  If we want to be political, although I am not sure it is the right time of the year or the place, the fines are a hangover from the last two Governments.  We can whack each other politically but if we are intellectually honest it was not caused during this Government's regime.  It is an historic fine which must be paid now.</P>
    <P>The BSE crisis goes back to 1989-90 and the feeding of meat and bone meal to cattle and perhaps efforts to thwart the rules introduced by the then Government.  There has been a catching up in terms of results on the ground but the taxpayers must pay a high cost to shore up the agricultural sector which is an essential industry whether one lives in an urban or rural area.  It is an enormous contributor to GNP and a large number of people depends on agriculture for income and a way of life.  There must be a base line and the compensatory payments are for the depopulation of BSE herds.</P>
    <P>Another area is hospital waiting lists.  It is difficult to legislate for the number of hip operations which can be done in a year.  Legislation cannot prevent people suffering arthritis in their hips or other problems.  In so far as the Government can control this area, it will do so.  However, good Government and democracy is ultimately about responding to the needs of the people in a careful and considered manner.  It is not just about balancing the books but meeting social needs.  I will not apologise for the Government breaching the guidelines set for expenditure on health in relation to the drugs subsidy scheme and the hospital waiting lists for elective surgery because this was necessary.</P>
    <P>The Government and I believe passionately that there should not be a two stream health system. Those with GMS cards should not have to <Col N="1355" /> wait longer to be relieved of their pain through hip, heart and other surgery than those in the private sector.  I believe in private sector health insurance which relieves the taxpayer and the Government in many cases when people are in a position to look after their needs.  However, this should only apply to the support structures and not essential medicine.</P>
    <P>It is fine if one wants a private room in a particular hospital and other independent factors in relation to decision making about one's medicine and surgery.  However, the quality of health and medical care should not be determined by whether one is a private or public sector patient. Access should be available.  If one wants to pay for extra frills, let private sector hospital insurance pay for them.  I am in favour of that because it removes the extra expense from the taxpayer.  However, there should not be two streams and I fully support the Government's and the Minister for Health's insistence that extra resources were required to reduce surgery waiting lists.  This was another extra expenditure for which provision was not made at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>There are a number of areas where the Government has breached the targets set down at the start of the year.  However, as a member of the Government and a democrat who cares about public expenditure and controlling public finances, I will ultimately listen to the essential needs of the people before the black line is drawn.  Having the books in order is critical, but I will not pay the price if it involves the health of the people.  We must pay for exigencies such as EU disallowances and the costs involved in the hepatitis C issue.  There are costs in areas outside the Government's control which must be met to respond to the needs of the people involved.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for the spirit of his contribution.  I can also play politics with this matter but it is not the time or place.  The Senator is aware that there is wonderful confidence in this Government's ability to run the economy given the buoyancy in consumer spending, low interest rates and the low inflation rate of 1.6 per cent.  The people have confidence in the Government's handling of the economy but we could do without the banana skins.  However, the electorate is sufficiently sophisticated to distinguish the Government's control and handling of the economy from other political factors.  These are a distraction but no more than that.  People want to have confidence in the Government to run the economy, increase disposable income and, above all, to know the ship of State is in solid hands. I assure the House that is the case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (4), line 20, to delete &ldquo;1st day of January,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;20 December,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I will not press this amendment to a vote but I want to ensure my purpose in tabling the amendment is understood.  It is to avoid retrospection, and ensure this legislation operates not from 1 January last but from today.  There are two reasons it is important to do this.  The first is one of principle and the second relates to the practical question of equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a real problem with any legislation allowing for retrospection.  It is a fundamental tenet of democracy that citizens know the law. That is the basis of freedom.  If we in the Oireachtas allow any law to be passed and to be made retrospective then we are in danger of not treating citizens as they should be treated in a democracy.  When a law is to be made retrospective, we must stop and see if we can allow this.  I refer to the principle rather than the actual arrangements in this case.  If we allow the State to legislate retrospectively we strike at the fundamental base of our democracy.  With regard to this principle, I and every other Member has a duty to draw attention to any law which is to be made retrospective.  I intend never to allow retrospective law to be made without drawing attention to the chipping away of democracy that entails.  Democracy is based on legislation on which the citizens know where they stand and we should abhor retrospective legislation.  There have been exceptions and there may be more but if we allow those exceptions to pass almost on a nod and without criticism, we damage the foundation <Col N="1357" /> on which our democracy is built.  On principle, we should not legislate retrospectively.</P>
    <P>The second aspect relates to equity between the citizens and those who create legislation.  The implementation of changes in law which will benefit citizens is always delayed.  I refer to legislation from the Ministers for Social Welfare and Finance.  Whenever something to our benefit is introduced, we are told it cannot be had immediately and that it takes time to implement.  When the Minister for Finance introduces changes, they do not come in on that day but later.  We are in danger of creating a very large gap between the &ldquo;plain people of Ireland&rdquo; in how we treat ourselves when legislation refers to us.  This is the wrong time to give such a signal.  It is important that the House recognise the dangers of retrospection. We must not apply that retrospection when it is to our benefit and not do so when it applies to citizens.</P>
    <P>Until the Minister's speech last night, I was concerned at a number of aspects of this Bill.  His speech was impressive for its explanation and passion.  The Minister explained why so much of this Bill should go through.  It changed my attitude a great deal.  Today my purpose is to draw attention to the retrospection particularly because it applies to political parties and Members of the House, those who make the laws. By passing this on the nod, we are in danger of saying to our citizens who elected us, that there is one rule for them and one for us.  That is the purpose of my amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a strong case for this Bill last night.  I would have liked this discussion to take place in a cooler atmosphere.  When retrospective legislation is rushed through at the last minute in the last session in the House, we are in danger of losing the argument, of not being highly regarded by our citizens and putting the legislation passed by the House beyond the trust of the citizens.  That is why I have asked that this date be reconsidered and we treat ourselves the same way we treat them.  Senator Fitzgerald made a strong case that needed to be heard but we are in danger of losing that argument if we do not make it in a measured way.  I urge that this amendment be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the amendment which I understand Senator Quinn does not intend to press.  I want to outline how the change in regard to overnight allowances came about, and my views probably reflect those of every Member.  I have bundles of letters rejecting my claims for overnight allowances going back as far as 1 March 1995.  I do not know when this regulation was first introduced but I believe it was approximately two years ago.  I understand there was a change of personnel in the Department dealing with these allowances and an examination of the legislation revealed that something was not being done properly up to that time.  The person who made this discovery immediately set about rectifying the position, wrongly.  For as long as I have been <Col N="1358" /> a Member it was the norm that Members in attendance for the last sitting of the House were entitled to the overnight allowance, and no questions were asked about the time the sitting adjourned.</P>
      <P>Two years ago I was amazed to receive a letter informing me that because the Seanad adjourned before 4 p.m.  I was not entitled to the overnight allowance.  The letter set out, in a ridiculous manner, the reasons.  I was allowed one hour to &ldquo;clear my office&rdquo;&mdash; the words used in the letter &mdash; an hour to get out of Dublin and then travel at an average speed of 35 miles per hour to reach my home in Kerry before 12 o'clock.  I do not want to be nasty about this but am I not entitled to break my journey to go to the toilet or have a cup of tea?  I was expected to travel home on a winter's day at an average speed of 35 miles per hour; in the summer they expect people to travel at 40 miles per hour.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to return to the original arrangement and pay us our rightful overnight allowances backdated to that time, although Senator Quinn said they should not be backdated even one year.  I would be glad to accept them backdated one year even though every Member is entitled to have them backdated two years.</P>
      <P>The sitting of the Seanad to which the letter referred adjourned at 1.53 p.m. on the day in question.  Everybody knows this House sits until 1 o'clock, with a sos until 2 o'clock, but that day we decided to sit through the sos to dispose of a particular Bill.  That might also have been to assist the Minister who might have been unable to return to the House at 2 o'clock.</P>
      <P>I would be happy if Senator Quinn withdrew his amendment in view of what I said.  The backdated allowances are rightfully owed to us, even though they are only being backdated one year. The change should never have been implemented in the first place.  I made my views on this matter known to the Minister prior to the summer recess and he was man enough to tell me he would look into the matter and correspond with us.  Although the Minister is on the opposite side of the House he is a man of his word and I admire him for what he has done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of splitting the Independent benches I cannot support my colleague in this matter.  I agree with the comments made by Senator Fitzgerald.  The range of expenses and allowances for Members of both Houses are pathetic.  I compliment the Minister on the assertive way he has dealt with this Bill in the media in recent days.  If somebody had asked me for my advice I would have said the Bill should not be introduced now because it is not the right time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not new legislation.  It is not necessary for these expenses and allowances to be covered by legislation.  They should be automatically indexed and increased, and noted by both Houses.  I do not have any sympathy for Senator Fitzgerald's argument because I offered to deal with this problem in the past year.  The way to address it is <Col N="1359" /> not by going back to the Minister.  It simply requires a decision of this House directing the official to pay the money which is properly due. There would be a constitutional crisis if somebody refused to pay Members of this House what they are entitled to under the Constitution, expenses as required.  The Constitution does not go further than that.  It is clear and that is what should be done.</P>
    <P>On occasions when my expenses were challenged I challenged the query and I was always proved correct.  On behalf of Members I made a presentation to the Buckley committee during which I appealed for the abolition of this extraordinary system of paying expenses.</P>
    <P>I listened to a Government representative being interviewed on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; yesterday. He was shafted by the interviewer because he was trying to defend the indefensible.  He should have said that the system for paying expenses is wrong.  If it is to be compared with the system in private business or other operations, we should compare like with like.</P>
    <P>The best way to operate this system is to require Members to submit their expenses at the end of the month with details of trips made, overnights etc.  The people who administered the system over the years adopted a trouble free, less administrative approach by simply giving Members their entitlement for the month.  They thought everybody was happy with that approach but we are not because expenses will now be queried and it is difficult to explain that these expenses are to compensate them for the whole month.</P>
    <P>We should have a system similar to that which applies for people who work for, say, the INTO &mdash; I am sure Senator Quinn's staff avail of a similar system &mdash; where there is an element of trust in regard to vouching expenses.  A person cannot pretend they were at a meeting if there were 20 or 30 other people in attendance.</P>
    <P>Members of both Houses are afraid to discuss this issue but I am not because I can see that the current system is wrong.  People are losing out and are being sucked into a sort of twilight zone in regard to claims for expenses.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of retrospection.  I would be a liar if I said I had not spent three months arguing with the Minister's officials about it; I want to say that to him before he says it to me.</P>

      <P>Nonetheless, we are talking about a principle.  Whereas Senator Quinn's arguments, taken out of the current context, make sense, they also feed the scepticism of those who say we are doing this for ourselves.  That is the message that will emerge, but that is not the case. People are either entitled to these expenses and allowances or they are not, and I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald that they should be backdated <Col N="1360" /> further than one year.  It makes sense, however, to keep it within the budget year.  I hope the Buckley report will deal with that issue.</P>
      <P>The Government and Opposition Whips do a great deal of work for this House and are entitled to an allowance.  In order to ensure the smooth working of the House, certain people spend half the weekend telephoning each other, working out amendments on a Sunday night, trying to arrange when Members will speak, and so on, for which there is no recognition.  The Department of Finance has always argued that is covered by the allowance given to parties but I reject that.  The House must organise its own operation and there is a very strong and valid case for providing an allowance to those who take on this extra work and responsibility.  I can defend that argument anywhere.  In any workplace when people are requested to take on an extra organisational role or job it is reflected in their salary.</P>
      <P>The Independent Members lose out very seriously because we are not affiliated to a party group.  However, we, too, need to do a huge amount of research and work with the minimal of resources.  There must be a way under this Bill for Independent Members of the Seanad, in particular, who cannot form themselves into a group for the purposes of this Bill &mdash; although they can for other matters and Independent Deputies have made arrangements over the years to include people outside the Dáil for the purposes of forming a group &mdash; to be given resources and back up.  They cannot claim funds from any parties or support networks.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the public stand the Minister has taken on the issue, as Senator Fitzgerald said.  It is important for the sake of parliamentary democracy that we insist people are properly rewarded and compensated.  Those who say it is too much should come up with a better system.  Many people cannot afford to get involved in full-time politics because of the low level of reward and compensation.  I support this minimal step and I cannot support my colleague's amendment.  I wish the Minister well with the legislation.</P>

      <P>I hope Senator Quinn will withdraw his amendment.  A number of aspects to which I wished to refer have already been very thoroughly dealt with by Senator O'Toole; I will not repeat what he put so very clearly before the House.</P>
      <P>When I explain my situation perhaps Senator Quinn might view his amendment in a different light.  Of those of us present in the Chamber, Senator Calnan, Senator Fitzgerald and I have the greatest distances to travel to our homes.  My home is 150 miles away.  I had no difficulties with the overnight allowance until about two years ago.  My experience at that time reflects a situation to which no Member should be subjected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the summer of 1994 I had a serious illness and I had bypass surgery that October.  I returned to my duties as a Senator in January 1995, subject to medical advice.  I was not in a fit medical condition <Col N="1361" /> to drive 150 miles home on a winter's night after a Thursday session of this House.  However, when I submitted my application for overnight expenses it was disallowed by somebody who had no medical experience or regard for my medical or physical ability to make that journey.  Members should not accept or tolerate such a situation.  I discussed this with Senator O'Kennedy who had been through a similar experience.  It is demeaning to the status and standing of Members, such as Senator O'Kennedy and I, for someone with no medical experience to decide on our ability to do something which we had been advised against doing by the best medical advice.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to repeat anything Senator O'Toole said.  However, if Senator Quinn had found himself in my position or if he lived 150 miles from the House, I doubt he would have tabled this amendment.  I suggest, for that reason, that he withdraw his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">

      <P>It is a refund of something which has already been paid.  It is very important to get that point across to the public.  There is no increase in the telephone allowance.  I have already used up my allocation for this year.</P>
      <P>When the Seanad adjourns at 3 p.m. I am told that I have an hour in which to finish the work which has gathered on my desk.  That makes no sense.  I then have an hour to get through Dublin, but one day it took me an hour to get through Kildare.  These matters are not taken into account.  As I said last night, the route I have been told I should take when going home is like starting a rally drive, with stage one to Portlaoise, stage two to Cashel and so on.  Having arrived here at 8 a.m., begun work at 9 a.m. and worked all day in the Seanad or my office, it is not a very nice prospect to have to drive over 200 miles to my home.</P>

      <P>I understand Senator Quinn's arguments and his concern about retrospective legislation. I am, of course, one of those who will not gain from this legislation.  There is one area where it is important that the legislation should be retrospective. That is in respect of section 4 which deals with payments indemnification in respect of certain persons in employment.  I was appalled to hear that if we do not pass legislation Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn &mdash; in addition to having a telephone bill of £6,500, which is bad enough &mdash;<Col N="1362" /> would be liable for the accident which occurred to her secretary through no fault of hers.  Because of that section alone I cannot support my colleague, even though I very much appreciate what he said.</P>
      <P>It would be worth while bringing in vouched expenses, as they do in the European Parliament. I feel sure there would be no problem in people producing them as they do for trips abroad. People always end up having spent more than they were allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cathaoirligh, I hope I am in order in addressing a few remarks to you.  I am a former pupil, if not apprentice, of this House, and this is the first time I have had the opportunity to be here since your recent election.  Your illustrious family name is a legacy of which you must be and are entitled to be very proud.  I am honoured to be here in your presence, and I congratulate you on being elected.</P>
      <P>To return to the principle of the argument enunciated by Senator Quinn, the Senator is correct in saying retrospective legislation is fundamentally wrong when it retrospectively creates a criminal offence and results in a person being prosecuted or billed in respect of an act which was neither a criminal offence nor would have incurred liability at the time it was committed.  It would be unconstitutional to prosecute a person on that basis, and a claim in the courts would ultimately be vindicated.  That is not what we are doing here.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to restate that citizens have rights which are enshrined in our Constitution and which are interpreted by the Supreme Court.  We are not, therefore, totally free agents.  We are not a sovereing parliament in the sense that the Houses of Parliament at Westminster believe they are a sovereign parliament that can unilaterally do what we cannot, that is, change the Constitution on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>There are, however, many precedents for retrospective legislation in this House.  For example, the Fianna Fáil Senators will recall the Jack Lynch landslide election of June 1977 &mdash; I recall it clearly, having been recently elected.  The former Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, said with prescience that perhaps a majority of 22 was too much.  History took its own course on that point.  I am glad to acknowledge the presence in the House of Senator O'Kennedy who was a very illustrious member of the Government that was formed in 1977.  He will recall a series of announcements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in early July endorsing the Fianna Fáil Manifesto, which had clearly got a popular mandate, one of the proposals of which was the £1,000 first house purchase grant which was paid out from that date.  The law giving retrospective legality to the vote on that money did not come into effect when we came back into session <Col N="1363" /> in the late autumn in that year.  The late George Colley, former holder of the office I now have the honour to hold, made an announcement in respect of it.  This was perfectly democratic. The money was voted because the Government of the day, with the support of the Oireachtas, agreed to it.  I cannot recall any Finance Bill that does not have an element of retrospection, for example, in respect of a liability arising which was never intended by the legislators or the Revenue Commissioners who, like referees on a football pitch, or judges in a court, have to administer and interpret the law as they see it.  Life is an organic constantly-changing experience, and we cannot with prescience design for every foreseeable circumstance. Even when we try to, we do not envisage some of the things that happen.  Therefore, there has been retrospection in tax laws of one kind or another.  I can think of two or three examples, but I will not bore the House with the details.</P>
      <P>With the modesty to which we have become accustomed, Senator O'Toole referred to the timid claims made by him on behalf of his organisation, most of which make outrageous claims for retrospection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a precedent for retrospection, but not in the area under discussion where, a bit like the king in &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo;, an act is retrospectively deemed a criminal offence and people are charged and punished.  As to the change in the guidelines and whether there was a new level of vindictiveness among civil servants in this House that they interpreted overnights in a harsher way than was previously the case, this was visited upon the Administration by a constitutional officer of this Republic, the Comptroller and Auditor General, who took the view that the way we had administered overnights was not in accordance with the standards which he is constitutionally charged under the Constitution to administer.  Lest there be a perception that permanently paid staff of the Administration took it upon themselves to reinterpret rules that had previously been interpreted differently and that it was an arbitrary and vindictive decision, it was not.  It was consequent on the ruling of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn's quest for a stay is not just confined to the question of payments and allowances and moneys due to Senators and Deputies.  It would be unfair to portray him as making that case only when it has been so successfully rebutted. In fairness, the Senator also argued that the payment for the leaders of political parties should not be paid out either.  I was honoured and somewhat flattered to hear Senator Tom Fitzgerald describe me as a man of my word.  On that basis I was delivering something I said I would deliver, <Col N="1364" /> something I could deliver without necessarily resorting to legislation.  Likewise, I gave an undertaking as Minister for Finance that there would be payment for political parties through the original Electoral Bill in the course of 1996. We ran into the legal and legislative difficulties which I described in some detail yesterday evening and which I will not repeat now.  Leaving aside the question of other expenses, there is an expectation that expenses will be incurred by political parties in employing people.  It is the commitment I gave in respect of that that I want to honour.  That is why I cannot accept the proposed amendment which would prevent me from doing that.</P>
    <P>While I am on my feet, I will deal with the point made by Senator O'Toole and others regarding vouched expenses.  At the end of the debate in the other House I made a point on the way we manage our affairs.  Officials in my Department have begun to prepare a note on it. Most if not all democratic assemblies, of which this is one, organise and manage their affairs in that they have a separate budget which they vote upon themselves.  At present, however, the Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas is processed and dealt with in the same way as Votes for other Departments and offices of State.  Those making the case for the Vote are not the political heads, such as the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach or members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, but officials, who make the case to other officials from the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy held various offices and was an illustrious Minister for Agriculture and Food.  He is aware that, ultimately, cases as to why extra money should be allowed are made politically, above normal considerations, at bilateral meetings between the Minister of a Department and the Minister of Finance of the day.  Inevitable compromises emerge from the process.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to consider the proposition, if it is well made and carefully presented, that the Houses of the Oireachtas be treated in the same way as other democratic assemblies in the EU. This would be subject to the provisos, first, that terms and conditions of employment for permanent staff would be in line with Civil Service norms and, second, that pay and remuneration in terms of salary for Members of the Houses would be in accordance with either the Gleeson or the Buckley recommendations.  This would preclude the power to unilaterally vote massive salary increases.</P>
    <P>On the question of resources and the way in which expenses are managed, we should align ourselves to good business practice.  There should be monthly submissions of expenses within agreed norms.  Senator O'Toole knows when a submission for expenses from a member of his executive or staff within the trade union organisation of which he is general secretary is offside. There are formal and informal procedures for dealing with such instances and there is nothing <Col N="1365" /> to prevent us from taking the same approach. How we proceed is a matter for ourselves.</P>
    <P>Returning to my comments on the Comptroller and Auditor General, there is a point at which unvouched expenses and allowances inevitably cross into the territory of additional income.  The law must then apply, whether it be benefit in kind, allowance income or whatever, and this can only be established through a mechanism which allows for vouched expenses.  That is the advice I have received, and it is right and proper against the background of the past couple of days that we are seen to be as compliant, disciplined and policed in our taxation matters and affairs as other citizens.</P>
    <P>Following that, doing the business of the State, for which we are elected, is something about which we should be proud and not defensive. People elected to do a job should be paid for the associated costs, whether it be travelling expenses from Kilrush or Dingle.  Salaries are determined by a different mechanism.  For these reasons I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  I hope I have addressed some of the concerns that have been articulated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. F. Quinn Mr. F. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in moving this amendment was to ensure the legislation did not go through the House without debate.  The Minister has addressed my concern regarding retrospection. However, I will continue to express such concern whenever there is retrospective legislation, even if matters of criminal liability and taxation are not involved.  When dealing with our citizens we seldom make measures retrospective, but we find it easier to do so when dealing with ourselves.</P>
      <P>I regret that so much of the debate addressed matters pertaining to this House because the Minister has explained that the bulk of the legislation is concerned with party political funding, etc.  Senator Howard made a strong case in asking me to withdraw the amendment.  I am fortunate in that my income from the House is not my sole income and my expenses are, therefore, not of huge importance to me.  In addition, my home is near the House and I do not have the travel problems outlined by many Senators.</P>
      <P>The amendment has elicited a response from the Minister which has been acknowledged by all sides of the House.  I will, therefore, withdraw it on the basis that it achieved what it set out to do. I appreciate the attention Members have given it, and especially the attention given to it by the Minister in his explanation of the quandary and difficulties he faced during the past year.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his forthright presentation of the rationale behind the Bill.  I also thank my colleagues, notably Senator Quinn, for allowing the House the opportunity to discuss the basis of these increased allowances.</P>
      <P>I have been privileged to be in national service here for 32 years.  However, I must question the timing of the legislation.  We need to enhance the status of public representation, which is very important, not only for those of us who are privileged to serve for the time being, but for those whom we hope will replace us.  We must ensure that nothing can be said or done that would diminish that status.</P>
      <P>Any Minister introducing legislation will leave himself open to question on timing.  The impression was conveyed that this item was being rushed through but that is not the case.  I am much better paid in the legal profession than I am as a Member of the Seanad but I want to speak on behalf of all my colleagues in the honourable political profession.  I regret the impression conveyed that this is an occasion for politicians to stock up on their treasures or that they do not care about and are not sensitive to the public whom they are obliged and privileged to serve.

      <P>I wish to respond to the gracious compliment paid by Senator O'Kennedy.  We have crossed swords on occasion but, as fellow democrats, we rise to support an ideal which we cherish strongly.  I say to my colleagues of the Fourth Estate there is not a tyranny in the world that provides for a free press.  There is not a dictatorship that allows a free press to report with impunity the activities, including the human frailties or the peccadilloes or the flights of ego, to which everybody, dare I say some columnists, succumbs.  A democracy is the bedrock for the foundation of liberty.  A free press is essential to liberty.  Eternal vigilance can only be maintained by a well informed press.  I regret &mdash; I say this without any sense of wrath of <Col N="1367" /> which I was accused today on the front page of a newspaper &mdash; that some of the big issues with which we have grappled in this and the other House do not attract the same degree of attention as some of the human failings and frailties which we all possess, myself included.</P>
      <P>Previous generations did not have the honour to participate in such Houses and were obliged to obstruct the business of another House across the Irish Sea to ensure that the voice of the people whom they represented was heard.  I want the people who after so many hundred years of aspiring to an independent republic to have the resources to do the job for which they were elected.  If at the end of my term of office the citizens decide we are not fit to hold the trust they bestowed on us they can withdraw it.  I would be the first, without any sense of regret, to acknowledge not only their right to withdraw that trust but also the honour they bestowed on me.  I thank Senators for their co-operation.</P>

I have come to know Senator Lanigan as one of the Members who is greatly concerned with international affairs and I have no doubt his observations will be useful and timely.</P>
      <P>Commitments from the Colombian Government to improve the critical human rights situation there sound hollow as widespread and systematic human rights violations continue.  The Government's political will to implement its human rights programme has been severely eroded by the political crisis which threatens its continuance in power.  The crisis, which stems from the allegation that President Samper's 1994 election campaign received financial support from drug trafficking organisations, continued throughout 1996 despite a Colombian congressional decision to exonerate him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> Not alone has there been no substantive improvement in the human rights position since the 52nd Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1996, the situation has become considerably worse in many respects.  During that period people disappeared and others were executed while many more were tortured by members of the security forces and their paramilitary allies.  Hundreds of civilians have been killed during counter insurgency operations, while members of legal opposition groups, trade unions, teachers, peasants, indigenous community leaders and human rights activists continue to disappear and to be targets for political killings.</P>
    <P>During the first two years of the Samper administration, the armed conflict spread and intensified.  Paramilitary groups and guerrilla organisations have achieved significant territorial gains through military offences, which have been unprecedented in recent years.  In a resolution on the position in Colombia adopted on 24 October the European Parliament stated it was &ldquo;shocked by the violence that has been escalating in Colombia since August 1996, the biggest offensive in 30 years, which threatens to develop into full-scale civil war&rdquo;.  At least 200 people died last August during several weeks of intensified military actions, as guerrilla forces attacked economic and military targets.  Armed opposition groups continue to violate international law.  Hundreds of people have been kidnapped and held hostage and there are increasing reports of deliberate and arbitrary killings.</P>
    <P>Despite repeated government promises to dismantle paramilitary forces, political killings by these groups have escalated dramatically.  The government's failure to take action to halt paramilitary abuses is clearly illustrated by the position at the Bellacruz ranch in northern Colombia where peasant farmers have been subjected to months of persecution by a paramilitary group operating in complicity with the armed forces. Last March more than 280 families were forcibly expelled from the Bellacruz ranch by a paramilitary group operating on behalf of the family who claimed ownership of the land.  Many peasant farmers were tortured and their homes burned.  The homeless families remain under threat of death if they attempt to return.  Despite formal government commitments guaranteeing the safety of the evicted families, no action has been taken by the authorities to arrest the paramilitaries or to remove them from the Bellacruz ranch.</P>
    <P>Last week Belen Torres and Raul Ramos, members of ANUC, a peasant farmers' organisation which represents more than 200 families on the Bellacruz ranch, visited Ireland to campaign for the protection of their members in Colombia. On Tuesday, 10 December, International Human Rights Day, Belen and Raul learned that four of their colleagues had been assassinated, bringing the number murdered to date to more than 30. On Wednesday, 11 December the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted a resolution which called on the Government to raise the matter of their security with the EU and the UN.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs met <Col N="1370" /> both representatives at Iveagh House and wrote to the Vice President of Colombia regarding the position at the Bellacruz ranch.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is seeking a response to the Tánaiste's letter of 11 December.  Belen and Raul remain in serious danger of assassination by death squads on their return to Colombia.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament resolution calls on the Colombian Government to stop the army carrying out arbitrary killings, torture and other human rights violations.  It also requests the United Nations and the Colombian Government to take all necessary steps to open the office of the High Commissioner in Bogota and to ensure that it can function.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter to inform the House of the developments which have taken place and to encourage the Government, which has acted in a speedy and determined way since the issue was first raised with the Department of Foreign Affairs, to continue its work to secure the safe return of Belen Torres and Raul Ramos to Colombia. Members of the Oireachtas and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs call on the Colombian Government to stop the systematic torture taking place in its country and to implement normal civil rights for its citizens.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Senator Hayes who has asked for an update on the resolution passed by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which called on the Government to ask the European Union and the United Nations to obtain guarantees for the safe return of Belen Torres and Raul Ramos to Colombia.  It will be difficult to obtain guarantees from a corrupt government led by President Samper who said he was not aware the drugs cartel had given $6 million to his election campaign.  This is an indication of the problems in Colombia in which for many years atrocious human rights abuses have been taking place.  It is somewhat naive to expect the Colombian Government to protect the two farm activists but we must ask them to do so.</P>
      <P>We must also ask how EU Governments allowed Carlos Arturo Marulanda Ramirez to serve as the Colombian Ambassador to Belgium, Luxembourg and the EU given his membership of a cartel which controls the killings at the Bellacruz ranch.  There is no doubt that he is the main shareholder in the group responsible for killing 280 peasants at the Bellacruz ranch.  He has not been seen since some time in November but he is still the accredited Ambassador to the EU.</P>
      <P>At the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs Belen Torres and Raul Ramos made a passionate plea for protection for the peasants in Colombia, for measures to be taken to deal with the drug cartels and to stop President Samper's Government from carrying out actions which should not be carried out by a government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is many years since the agrarian reform movement started in Ireland but we know people who still feel an affinity for the land from which they were evicted.  We should support the agrarian reform groups in Colombia in the same way <Col N="1371" /> as we supported the agrarian reform groups in Ireland and elsewhere in the world.  Colombia has a very bad history in political terms.  I call on the United States to stop supporting President Samper's Government.  The United States has a major role to play in eliminating human rights abuses in Colombia.  I ask the EU to withdraw the accreditation of the Colombia Ambassador to the EU.  This is one step we can take to show the Colombian Government that we do not approve of the human rights abuses in that country.  We want Belen Torres and Raul Ramos to become dependants of a democratic state.  We support their right to live and to fight for the agrarian reform movement in which they are involved.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Hayes for raising this matter and the Minister for coming to reply.  I sincerely hope that our points will receive some response from the Colombian Government and the EU in terms of the accreditation of the Colombian Ambassador to the EU.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all deeply concerned about the situation in Colombia, where human rights abuses are now endemic.  The Colombian security forces have been involved in counter-insurgency operations against guerrilla groups for more than 30 years and during that time human rights abuses, particularly by the security forces, have become commonplace. Kidnappings, disappearances, extrajudicial executions, torture and intimidation are regular features of Colombian life.  The security forces have made extensive use of paramilitary groups who have engaged in orchestrated campaigns of intimidation and murder.  Under Colombian law, members of the army and police are subject to military law and cannot be prosecuted in civil courts.  This has resulted in members of the security forces being to all intents and purposes virtually immune from prosecution.  Colombia also suffers gravely from violence perpetrated by armed drug traffickers and anarcho-terrorists.</P>
      <P>The Government of President Samper had sought to initiate peace talks with guerrilla groups and had indicated a willingness to introduce legislation to bring the country's laws into line with international human rights norms.  However, any hope of progress in those areas has been overtaken by the President's preoccupation with his battle for political survival.  It has been alleged that Samper was aware that about $6 million was contributed to his election campaign in 1994 by a member of the Cali drugs cartel.  Samper denies that he knew about the contribution and, not unexpectedly, he was exonerated by a congressional committee &mdash; his Liberal Party controls Congress.  The President continues to be preoccupied with the crisis.</P>

    <P>The Bellacruz ranch is the largest in the department of Cesar.  For more than 40 years the local peasants have been seeking ownership of the land which they have been farming.  A court ruling regarding ownership of part of the land is apparently awaited.  However, earlier this year up to 280 families were expelled from the ranch by <Col N="1372" /> paramilitaries who burned their houses and warned the peasants that they would be killed if they tried to return.  It is alleged that the paramilitaries were acting for a company called Marulanda Ramirez Investments SA.  The main shareholder of this company is reported to be Carlos Arturo Marulanda Ramirez, who served as the Colombian Ambassador to Belgium, Luxembourg and the European Union.</P>
    <P>Following their eviction from the ranch the peasants occupied the offices of the National Agrarian Reform Institute who are responsible for deciding the final title to the land.  The Government apparently signed two agreements with the peasants &mdash; in March and June &mdash; under which the safe return of the evicted families was guaranteed and the Government undertook to crackdown on the paramilitary groups operating in the area and to prosecute those responsible for human rights abuses.  However, when the families returned to the area five were murdered and one disappeared.  In late September two individuals who had negotiated with the authorities on the peasants' behalf were also killed.  Due to the failure of the authorities to control the activities of the paramilitaries it has not proved possible for the peasants to return to their homes.  Concern has also recently been expressed for the safety of members of NGOs who supported the peasants.</P>
    <P>Ambassador Marulanda is alleged to have criticised Colombian and international human rights' NGOs for their actions in this case and to have accused them of being linked to subversive groups.  The concerns of the Presidency regarding the ambassador have been brought to the attention of his authorities and a response is awaited. Mr. Marulanda left Brussels in early November, but formal notice of his departure has not yet been received.</P>
    <P>Two representatives of the National Association for Peasant Farm Workers &mdash; Unity and Reconstruction, Mr. Belen Torres and Mr. Raul Ramos, who played a key role in negotiations with the Colombian Government on behalf of those evicted, met officials from the political division of the Department of Foreign Affairs on 9 December 1996 and handed over a petition for the Tánaiste outlining the serious human rights situation in Colombia.</P>
    <P>On the following day the Tánaiste learned of the murders in Colombia of Adinael Toscano, who was one of the leaders of the peasants, and two members of his family.  The Tánaiste met with Mr. Torres and Mr. Ramos and wrote to Dr. Lemos Simmonds, Vice-President of Colombia and Ambassador to London.  The contents of this letter are as follows:</P>
    <P>I am writing to you to express my profound concern regarding reports which I have received in respect of the alleged activities of paramilitary groups operating on the Bellacruz Ranch and neighbouring areas.</P>
    <P>Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms form the cornerstone of Irish foreign policy as indeed they do for all democratic nations.  You will appreciate therefore my concern, that of other public representatives and <Col N="1373" /> human rights bodies when we learn of the situation of the peasant farmers in this region.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the Peasant Farmers Group held detailed discussions with my Department in Dublin on 9 December 1996.  I was horrified to learn on the following day of the murder in Colombia of one of the Peasant Leaders, Adinael Toscano and two of his family.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if you would be good enough to let me know the results of your Government's investigation into this and other acts of violence in the area.</P>
    <P>Concern for human rights is an important factor in European Union relations with Latin America generally.  EU ambassadors are tasked with monitoring the situation with regard to human rights abuses and with reporting on these matters so that the European Union can respond appropriately. In addition, the establishment of a mission to monitor human rights abuses and to offer technical assistance to the Government will shortly be finalised and will be set up in Bogota under the auspices of the United Nations.  The Tánaiste and the Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to monitor closely the situation in Colombia and will continue to press all Governments in the region, including that of Colombia, to respect human rights and to honour the commitments they have given under the various international instruments and conventions on human rights. The question of human rights in Colombia will be addressed in detail at the forthcoming session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for raising this matter and I will convey their detailed remarks to the Tánaiste.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming in to respond to my call for funding for the proposed national respite and holiday centre at Donamon, County Roscommon.  I appreciate that funding for the centre may not be the total responsibility of the Minister for Health, but it is not possible for three Ministers to come into the House to reply.  However, a Government response is required and I hope what I say will be conveyed to the Minister's colleagues with responsibility in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association is a national organisation dedicated to the achievement of full social, economic and educational integration of people with disability as equal, independent and active members in the general community.  The association aspires to be the leading organisation for people with physical disability, giving a voice to the demands of all members and taking action at local, national and international level to achieve those objectives.  In response to the demands for holiday facilities for persons with a disability, the association proposes setting up a national respite and holiday centre at Donamon in County Roscommon.  There are very few <Col N="1374" /> locations where it is possible for people with disabilities to go on holiday.  Only the more expensive hotels provide such facilities, but the cost is generally outside their reach.</P>
    <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association employs 158 full-time staff, 205 on a part-time basis and 360 on community employment schemes, a total of more than 700 people directly involved in providing facilities for the disabled on a national basis.  In some cases schools have been used on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to provide holiday facilities for such people. While we appreciate the good work done by the Irish Wheelchair Association and by voluntary groups and carers, the question of proper holiday facilities for people with disability has not been adequately addressed.  Consequently, the association proposes providing a custom made hospital respite centre, with the necessary facilities, equipment and support, and accommodation and meals provided at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>In 1995 they began discussions with the Divine Word Missionaries in Donamon, County Roscommon for the use of their 30,000 square feet pastoral centre.  In May 1996 a lease on the property was agreed, including a token rent of £3,000 per annum.  The Irish Wheelchair Association intends to develop the building into a modern, friendly and innovative respite, holiday and development centre available to all people with a physical disability, other organisations, the local community and tourists.  The building comprises a three storey block, with 64 bedrooms, seven large workrooms, showers, toilets, kitchens, dining and laundry facilities.  In addition, a conference facility for up to 300 people is available in a modern, almost unused chapel.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government and Department of Health to support the Irish Wheelchair Association in converting this property into one suitable for a holiday and respite centre for people with disability.  The association also intends to make this facility available to Irish and foreign disabled and able-bodied visitors alike.  That is an important component of this proposal, bearing in mind the connection between the Irish Wheelchair Association and international disabled groups and mobile international associations.</P>
    <P>The Donamon Centre in County Roscommon is located at the gateway to the west, an ideal base for people with disability touring the midlands, west and north-west regions.  The association further proposes that it will constitute a respite and holiday centre for people with disabilities, their families and carers in addition to providing employment opportunities for people with disabilities. They intend to run educational courses for people with disabilities and able-bodied alike, driving tuition, assessment of people with disabilities, art and recreation, including painting, sports, music, acting etc., a corporate training centre, angling and boating for the disabled, horticulture and capacity-building courses for people with disability with low level esteem.  It will be seen that this constitutes a very extensive and welcome proposal by the Irish Wheelchair Association.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1375" /> The reason I have tabled this motion is to draw the attention of the House to the costs involved. The Irish Wheelchair Association needs Government support to implement this plan.  I understand the costs will amount to approximately £350,000 capital, along with revenue costs of approximately £150,000 to cover the salaries of a staff of seven needed to run the centre, to be backed-up by participants in the community employment programme and others from the voluntary sector.  In my view that constitutes a very modest staffing complement but, in order to get the centre off the ground, they must be allocated adequate funds, particularly in respect of the capital costs involved.</P>
    <P>To date I understand that all the association has received is approximately £100,000 from the Department of Health and has raised the remainder in the form of a bank overdraft.  The association cannot continue on that basis.  It has applied to a number of other groups, including the European Regional Development Fund.  I am most disappointed that the latter has failed to respond to their appeal.  Under the Bord Fáilte heading, surely the administrators of that fund have a responsibility to back-up the provision of a holiday facility for the disabled in addition to those provided nationally for the able-bodied. Surely people with disability have an equal right to European Union money for a tourism facility.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be in a position to respond to this most worthwhile proposal by the Irish Wheelchair Association which would be enormously beneficial for everybody, but particularly those in the midlands, west and north &mdash; west.  I compliment the Irish Wheelchair Association and all support and back-up groups locally and nationally who have supported this project.</P>
    <P>Donamon Castle is one of the oldest inhabited buildings in Ireland, an erstwhile fortress, the earliest reference to which can be found in the Annals of the Four Masters in 1154.  Is it not all the more appropriate that that building, which is still inhabited, should provide an adequate opportunity for respite and holiday breaks for people with disability?  If ever a cause merited the attention of Government, the Minister and all of us in public life, surely it must be to constantly highlight the difficulties encountered by people with disability, particularly in gaining access to buildings and holiday opportunities.  This proposal affords the Government an opportunity to row in behind the Irish Wheelchair Association to provide this respite centre for people with disability.</P>
    <P>Hopefully the Minister will be in a position to respond on behalf of the Government and announce good news for Donamon, for the Irish Wheelchair Association, especially for those with a disability, so that some time in the coming year they will have available to them there a fully equipped holiday and respite centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank Senator Finneran for raising this matter.  I am glad to be able to assure the House of my commitment to this excellent project.</P>
      <P>During the year the Irish Wheelchair Association was offered the use of extensive accommodation by the Divine Word Missionaries on the Donamon Castle complex.  My initial commitment to the project was a capital grant of £105,000 which I paid through the Western Health Board, for necessary refurbishment work to enable the new centre to become operational. In addition, I made a lottery grant of £38,000 available for the purchase of a bus for this service.</P>
      <P>The Donamon Centre will provide a range of services for people with physical disabilities. These will include residential respite care, ranging from crisis intervention to planned regular breaks, day activity services for people in the locality with physical disabilities, personal development, activity and support programmes for people with disabilities and their carers, along with holiday breaks and recreational programmes.</P>
      <P>The services to be provided in the centre will be open to people with disabilities from all areas, but particularly the west.  While the centre will be managed by the Irish Wheelchair Association, various organisations providing services for people with disabilities will be involved.  It is also planned to involve other community-based organisations to provide as high a degree of integration as possible for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Respite care and day activity services are priorities in the development of services for people with physical disabilities.  I will sympathetically consider proposals for the continuing funding of the Donamon Centre.  I met the Irish Wheelchair Association recently when I expressed my support for the project.  I am optimistic that I will be able to provide additional support for the centre in 1997.  As a first step, I have asked officials of my Department to convene a meeting between the Irish Wheelchair Association, the health board and my Department to discuss additional funding requirements for 1997.</P>
      <P>From the very beginning I have welcomed this project and officials of my Department and the Western Health Board have been working with the Irish Wheelchair Association to progress it.  I readily agreed to approve a capital grant to enable the premises be converted for this purpose. This grant represented a commitment on my part which enabled the Irish Wheelchair Association to get the project off the ground by entering into a five-year lease for the premises.  I am glad to report that a number of people have already benefited from services in the centre.  In ensuing years I look forward to a progressive development in the Donamon Centre of much needed services for people with physical disabilities.</P>
