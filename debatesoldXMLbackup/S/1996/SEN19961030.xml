      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to ensure that elected councillors who are members of county enterprise boards receive out of pocket expenses for their attendance at meetings of the respective boards similar to other members of such boards.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Roche of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to immediately sanction the building by the County Wicklow vocational education committee of a second level school at Kilcoole, County Wicklow, and to recognise that this matter must be immediately resolved in order to save the site purchased for this school from being developed for alternative purposes.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they can be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Yesterday was a very successful day for the Seanad and one that we should encourage the Cathaoirleach and the Leader to take a stage further by ensuring that we invite someone else deemed worthwhile by the House during the nest session.  On behalf of the House I congratulate the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I asked about the credit union Bill. I am sure every member of the House is being <Col N="138" /> lobbied on this issue at the moment.  There are over 400 credit unions throughout the country. Considering the size of its membership and the type of people involved &mdash; including 1,500 employees and 10,000 volunteers &mdash; I ask the Leader when this Bill will be before the Dáil or the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate the Cathaoirleach and the Leader on the organisation of yesterday's invitation to Commissioner Kinnock.  It was a very informative and useful debate and will help inform us on our future debates on Europe.  It was the most illuminating discussion in either House on that area in a long period because the question of the enlargement of the market is passing many people by.  It is appropriate to move that discussion on to a debate on European Monetary Union and the single currency, as the Leader promised, so that people can understand those matters.</P>
      <P>A full discussion is needed on the whole communications area, especially broadcasting over the coming years.  There is Radio Ireland and TV3 and other related areas.  It is appropriate to raise that today with Teilifís na Gaeilge beginning tomorrow, which will create more broadcasting capacity which should be used for establishing educational broadcasting.  We are the only country in Europe not to have educational broadcasting.  Ireland should also establish a short-wave radio service for tourism and emigration reasons and to allow us to take our place among the nations of the world.  We should bring that back into the mainstream.  I ask the Leader to consider a full debate on broadcasting and Government policy and plans, by that I mean the steps beyond the Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We all found Commissioner Kinnock's address very illuminating.  It underlines the point that addresses of that nature can inform our subsequent debates and make them far more informed than they would otherwise have been. The Leader should consider introducing other Commissioners and distinguished people to address the Seanad.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges might consider publishing these addresses as a separate booklet rather than as part of the day's proceedings in the House.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to provide time to discuss the White Paper on science and technology which has been published by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment with responsibility for Commerce, Science and Technology, Deputy Rabbitte.  It is a very important area and we might not have some of the troubles in the beef sector at present if we had had a more scientific and analytical approach to these matters at the outset.  In that context and the context of the wider value of science and technology within education, it is important to debate that matter in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> I also welcome President Arafat to Ireland.  I hope the Presidency of the EU can be used by Ireland to advance the peace process in Palestine and Israel.  We hope we can contribute to lasting peace there and that we can emphasise that the terms of the Oslo Accord, agreed between the various parties to the dispute, should be implemented in full.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader provide time for a debate on the national food inspection service, proposals for which are before the Cabinet?  We wish to know the details of how that service will operate, the degree to which it will be independent of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and other aspects of its operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ascertain from the Minister for Education when she proposes to bring the new education boards on stream?  There is much discussion and concern about this and people in the educational process would welcome details.</P>
      <P>The Leader should also ascertain from the Minister for Education when the proposed new Bills on education arising from the deliberations of the accommodation committee are likely to come before the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader if he has information on setting up the new national food advisory service as this country imports and exports food.  Everyone in the ports knows the amount of traffic going in and out of the country. Are we to go it alone?  This is a European issue. There is a necessity to monitor our present difficulties but we should not set up the new national food advisory service without consulting the import and export sector.  It is a broader issue than inspecting food available here because every type of food is coming in by the container-load every day.  We class ourselves as a food exporting country but we import vast amounts of food. There should be the same inspection of all imported food as we envisage for our own food. The Leader should inform the House why the Government plans to go it alone on this issue. That is a very narrow approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Senators in commending the Leader for organising yesterday's session with Commissioner Kinnock and the Cathaoirleach for the very dignified and appropriate welcoming address to the Commissioner.  I was disappointed by his response to marine matters and the lack of subsidisation for Irish ferries and other marine elements such as cargo ships.  A debate on how marine transport affects Ireland's ability to export fairly in the near future might be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed that the newspapers persist in not reporting the proceedings of the House.  This was a unique opportunity: a question and answer session with <Col N="140" /> a Commissioner who has a portfolio that is vital to this country.  The coverage this morning was quite pathetic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no bad news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no news.  That is the problem.  Members asked pertinent questions on a range of issues and it is as if nobody asked a question.  Perhaps the Committee of Procedure and Privileges should meet the press interests to see if we can get decent reporting of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The report on the salmon industry issued by the Department of the Marine has created confusion in the salmon fishing industry. I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for the Marine to brief us on his intentions for that report's recommendations: whether he intends to introduce a system of tagging salmon, whether it is proposed to restrict salmon drift-netting and how it will be done, if legislation is required to give effect to the report's recommendations and what timeframe the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, has to introduce these measures.  There appears to be total confusion in the salmon industry at present. While that confusion reigns, the salmon industry is being decimated.  Salmon stocks are probably at their lowest ever level and the situation is critical.  We are getting no action from the Minister of State except to initiate more studies. The shelves of the Department of the Marine are lined with studies going back over 20 years but there is very little action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a discussion on afforestation, particularly with the felling programme and replanting going on throughout the country.  It is of extreme importance for State forests but we could broaden the discussion to include forestry and agriculture, forestry and tourism and employment in forestry.  In the past forestry provided valuable full-time employment in rural areas and it is of particular importance in places such as west Cork and the western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for organising yesterday's debate with Commissioner Kinnock. It was most enlightening.  Would it be possible to invite the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, to the House to speak about the proposed upgrading of the railway network which is in a deplorable state? As I told the House last week, the line between Tralee and Killarney has been downgraded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Daly's call for a debate on the proposed salmon management task force. There is total confusion about the matter between net fishermen and rod fishermen and no side is satisfied.  If the Minister implements new rules without legislation or debate it will be detrimental to the future of salmon fishing.  I ask <Col N="141" /> the Leader to invite the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, to debate his proposals in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support holding a debate on the proposed food safety authority.  It is time our views on the subject were made known.  It is important that whatever authority might be established should be both independent and have sufficient clout to protect consumers and deal with their many concerns.</P>
      <P>The House should also have a debate on the national lottery.  Today's prize fund of £6 million is scandalous.  Many charities and youth and sport organisations are crying out for money, yet £6 million might be won by just one person.  We must voice our concerns in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House convey my concern to the Minister for Education about the current confusion regarding higher education grants?  I refer particularly to students who have completed certificate or diploma courses and wish to proceed to degree courses. When they apply for the higher education grant they discover they cannot do so if they move to another college, although it appears they can if they remain in the same college.  There is a great deal of confusion and the Minister for Education should make a statement on the matter.  To get her to come to the House would be an impossibility but she should make a statement to inform the public about higher education grants particularly with regard to students who have completed certificate and diploma courses.</P>
      <P>I also support the suggestion that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications come before the House to discuss transport issues, particularly in the Dublin area.  There is confusion in Dublin about what transport model the city should pursue.  The issue gets more confusing by the day.  The Minister should come to the House for a full discussion on the matter. There cannot be enough discussion about it.  The public needs to know what road we should choose, if the Leader will pardon the pun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Since its inception the social welfare system has persistently treated women as adult dependants.  Consequently, the National Women's Council and the INOU are organising a national sign on day for women.  Signing on also means access to training places for women.  Could the Leader invite the Minister for Social Welfare to the Seanad in advance of the signing on day for a discussion on the rights of women <i>vis-a-vis</i> the social welfare system?  The Minister might also give the House an outline of the good work his Department is doing in the context of community development and aid to women's groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader organise a debate on the status of Ireland as an Objective 1 country in the EU in view of the current review and the catastrophic possibility that Ireland might lose that status?  The debate should be informed by an <Col N="142" /> analysis of the expenditure of Structural, Regional and Cohesion Funds over the last ten years.  The analysis should examine the disparity of expenditure within and between regions.  It would be useful to make a critical analysis of the priorities for expenditure.  Would we agree, for example, that building a light rail to Ballymun at a cost of £250 million is more important than attacking the serious poverty traps in Dublin city or knocking the Ballymun flats and rebuilding them?  Would we agree that building that light rail has a higher priority than providing water to people in the Aran Islands or Connemara who, for the last six months, have been buying bottled water at £1.80 per five litre bottle?</P>
      <P>It would be useful to have a discussion on our spending priorities thus far and on whether the proposals being put forward are the correct ones. I am worried that they are not.  There is a serious disparity in spending within and between regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the national lottery.  Six million pounds for one winner is an obscene amount.  It creates materialistic ethos which we could do without. When one considers that the English lottery prize fund is sometimes £25 million it appears that spending on the lottery in Ireland is very high. We should invite the Minister for Finance to tell us what impact the national lottery is having, the average spend and where the money is being spent.  It would be a good debate.</P>
      <P>I also reiterate my call last week for a debate on the bail referendum.  The Leader of the House suggested a date but I wish him to confirm it.  It is just 30 days to the referendum and I have been alarmed by the lack of public debate so far.  If the referendum is passed it will result in one of the most far-reaching changes to our judicial system since the institution of Bunreacht na hÉireann. The Minister for Justice is proposing the referendum and most Members of the House support it.  Would it be possible to invite an outside speaker to present the contrary view so the important points at issue could be discussed? The Minister has appointed a commission whose members include the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad to ensure a balanced debate, which is most important.  Can the Leader of the House give a commitment on the date for the proposed debate?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> I thank the Senators who referred to yesterday's discussion which was most worthwhile.  It was useful to have an old parliamentary hand such as Mr. Kinnock because he treated everybody's questions seriously.  His answers were characterised by their depth and the serious manner in which he replied.  My only regret is that a number of colleagues did not have an opportunity to ask questions.  We must look at that problem the next time a distinguished person addresses the House.  The experiment can now be deemed a success.  We can make it part of the normal business of the House and have a more regular series of such visitors and encounters.  I will discuss the matter with the Cathaoirleach and other groups at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I thank the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach and their staff for the dignity with which they handled yesterday's visit.</P>
    <P>Senator Wright raised the credit union Bill, which is a Government priority.  The delay is because a number of additional suggestions which will greatly enhance the Bill have been made for inclusion in it.  Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte has given it priority and we hope it will be published before Christmas.  It will be a priority next session.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised the debate on broadcasting.  It would be useful to have a debate on the full implications of broadcasting policy, especially in relation to the use of additional available channels.  Perhaps we could discuss how that might be structured later on today.  The Senator also mentioned the European Monetary Union debate on currency, which has been provisionally fixed for 4 December, so as to give Members time to prepare.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised the White Paper on science and technology.  I would be open to inviting Minister Rabbitte in to have a structured discussion on that.  I join with the Senator in welcoming President Arafat to Ireland.  Senator McGowan raised the question of the national food inspection service, which is at Cabinet today. While everybody welcomes it, perhaps we could raise the details when we have them rather than prejudging the proposals.  I propose an early discussion on the matter.  In relation to Senator McDonagh's query, the legislation on the new education boards is close to completion and we can expect it shortly.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner raised the debate on the marine, as Senator Fitzgerald has done for some days.  I will arrange it.  I agree with Senator Magner that the newspaper coverage of yesterday's serious and substantial debate was very poor.  That there was no witchhunt or nobody was attacking anyone, but rather discussing serious policy issues, may be part of the reason.  I regret it.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly raised the question of the salmon industry.  I will be happy to arrange either a briefing or a short discussion on that.  In relation <Col N="144" /> to Senator Calnan's request, I do not have any plans in the immediate future for a debate on afforestation.  Senator Gallagher and Senator Mulcahy raised the national lottery.  There is disquiet as well as excitement about the size of the prize today.  People accept the lottery as a way of life.  They accept it does a great deal of good and enjoy doing it.  We should not be too puritanical in talking about the lottery.  There is concern, perhaps unjustified, about the destination of lottery funds and how they are spent.  I have no difficulty in having a useful discussion on that matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde had a fair point on the confusion about higher education grants.  The Adjournment debate would be the right vehicle for that matter.  The Minister could provide all the necessary information.  There will be a debate on Luas.  I listened with great interest to Senator Fahey's contribution, after which I think we do not need a debate.  He covered almost every issue raised.  I will discuss the matter with him later and see if we can find a suitable way of raising those issues.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy raised bail reform.  It would not be useful to bring someone into the House to put the case.  We work hard to get into this House so we can discuss matters of current political interest.  It would not be appropriate to bring in someone to put his point of view during the current controversial debate.  That is the prerogative of Members of this House.  It is a useful thought but I do not agree with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 (1) says the concept of &ldquo;dispose of&rdquo; includes to sell or to give away or have destroyed, and cognate words shall be construed accordingly.  Is &ldquo;destroyed&rdquo; the correct technical term for killing an animal and if so, why?  Would it be better to have a phrase such as &ldquo;humanely kill&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be an obligation on the local authority to sell or give away the animal.  It is possible that as &ldquo;dispose of&rdquo; is defined in the Bill, <Col N="145" /> the local authority could take the easy way out on every occasion and destroy or kill the animal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Where I come from, when a horse goes down at the last fence, it is destroyed and there are many people destroyed with it.  In rural communities there is no problem with the definition of destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We examined all formulations and definitions closely on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  This was the ultimate definition.  On the welfare issue, I am sure that local authorities will try to dispose of any animals confiscated or impounded in as humane a manner as possible. They will try to sell them on in order to cover their expenses.  We have inserted new amendments which emphasise animal welfare, following our Second Stage discussion in this House and points raised by Senator Mulcahy.  I am confident local authorities will act responsibly and have regard to the welfare of animals in all cases.  This formula of words is the most appropriate for this definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree the word &ldquo;destroy&rdquo; is not good because it does not accurately describe what one is doing, that one is trying to humanely kill an animal, not destroy it. We should use as accurate a description as possible.  The Minister said the local authority will try to ensure the animal is humanely killed. However, there is no obligation on the local authority &mdash; correct me if I am wrong &mdash; to ensure the animal is humanely killed.  I accept there are provisions in the Bill relating to the treatment of horses by others, but where does it state that there is an obligation on the local authority to kill an animal humanely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will know there are EU regulations and directives on how one destroys an animal with which we have to comply. There are sufficient provisions to ensure animals are humanely killed.  I am satisfied with this definition.  This terminology has been used in other legislation and has been recommended by the parliamentary draftsman.  I accept his advice that this is the best definition we could include in the Bill to ensure its effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said but I want my reservations about this definition on the record.  I am not completely satisfied that the terms &ldquo;destruction&rdquo; and &ldquo;disposed of&rdquo; as drafted will place a legal obligation on local authorities when they are terminating the life of a horse.  It is all very well to say there are EU directives but there is an obligation on us to include EU directives in our legislation as far as possible so that people will understand them.  I will not press the matter, but we will agree to differ.</P>

      <P>I regard that as practice rather than anything else.  I cannot imagine a veterinary practitioner adopting anything other than a humane attitude because that is part of their code of practice and professional ethic.</P>
      <P>The words such as &ldquo;appurtenant&rdquo; and &ldquo;hinny&rdquo; cause me far more problems than the word &ldquo;destroy&rdquo;.  I want to bring to the Minister's attention the question of a public place, in particular where it refers to a field or other place to which the public have access, whether by right or permission.  The implication for land owners concerns me.  Provisions were included in the legislation on public liability whereby people would have access to land by licence, invitation or permission.  I assume a private landowner is covered under the definition of a public place. Would a farm to which I invite somebody to hunt be covered by the Bill?  The Minister is shaking is head; perhaps he will explain why I am wrong.</P>

      <P>If a farmer gives a person permission to come on his property, it is solely for that person.  If permission is granted to a hunt, it would be specified.  It would not make a farmer's property a public place simply because he gave an individual or an organisation permission to come on his property.  From my knowledge of that legislation, I do not see a threat to owners of private property under this definition of a public place.  I have no reservations about this but I understand the Senator's point. This definition applies to places where people can wander at large.  If a person wants to enter private property, they can only do so with the agreement of the landowner unless there is a right of way for the public which would make it a public place.  I do not see a threat to owners of private property because of the provisions in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 7, after &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;either singly or jointly with one or more adjoining local authorities&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not much difference between what I and the Minister propose.  On Second Stage I said it could be economically desirable &mdash; and desirable <Col N="147" /> from an operational viewpoint &mdash; for several, or for one, local authority to co-operate with another to appoint an authorised person.  It strikes me as a sensible way to do this.  I referred to the Abattoirs Act and the fact that in several counties people have not been appointed under that Act.  I suspect that in practice a person with another job in the local authority will be appointed on a part-time basis to do this.  It would be better for somebody to carry out this function on a full time basis which would suggest that it should be done on a regional basis.  Perhaps the regional authority could be the operational agency in terms of appointing the authorised person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with Senator Dardis's point which was well made in his Second Stage speech when he proposed a greater role and involvement for the regional authorities, particularly when one considers that this problem is not confined to one local authority.  It is a regional problem which affects four local authorities in Dublin.  There is merit in his amendment.  I made the point on Second Stage that the Bill should allow for greater co-ordination of the problem among the four local authorities in Dublin, which is the main problem area.  The Minister said a model by-law system would be given to local authorities as the by-laws to be introduced when the control areas are put in place.  I will be interested in the Minister's response.  The more co-ordination of roles in the legislation the better it will be in terms of its implementation.</P>

      <P>This amendment is implicit in section 20(10).  We included a special provision on Report Stage in the Dáil to enable local authorities to take on the responsibility of other local authorities, subject to agreement.  However, the appointment of officers must be the responsibility of local authorities.  They may become officers of other local authorities, following agreement with them.  This provision is included in section 20(10).  We had to table a number of amendments to allow responsibilities to be shared among local authorities.  Deputy Dardis's amendment is implicit in section 20(10).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree my amendment is implicit in section 20(10).  Section 20(10) allows the authorities to co-operate in terms of licensing. My amendment goes beyond that and calls for cooperation between authorised persons.  There is consistency in what I am arguing when I take the Minister's comments and the amendment on Report Stage into account.  Section 17(3) allows the Minister to intervene in situations where, having consulted with the adjoining local authority about the need to control horses, he may direct the adjoining local authority to declare by-laws.  The Minister can direct the adjoining local authority to declare by-laws if the problem <Col N="148" /> spills over from one local authority to the next. The Minister should have such an appropriate power.  Section 20(10) deals with how local authorities may enter into licensing arrangements.  However, I do not understand how the authorised person is subject to the same sort of control as envisaged in section 20(10) for licensing arrangements.</P>

However, section 3 states that &ldquo;A local authority may appoint&rdquo;.  There seems to be a contradiction between section 3 and section 9(b).

      <P>The parliamentary draftsman believes the Senator's amendment is covered in the Bill.  However, I will consider the Senator's points before Report Stage.  It was originally intended to take Committee and Report Stages together but I separated them to give me an opportunity to consider the views expressed by Senators.  The advice I have is that the amendment is implicit in the Bill.  I can foresee a number of local authorities in Dublin or in any part of the country coming to some arrangement as regards authorised persons to avoid duplication, to save unnecessary expenditure and to co-ordinate facilities around a central pound.  I already suggested that a number of regional pounds should be established.  I will consider the Senator's points before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I am encouraged by the Minister's reply and I accept his suggestion.  Perhaps he could ask the parliamentary draftsperson to look at section 3, which states that &ldquo;A local authority may appoint in writing&rdquo;.  Will that exclude several local authorities from coming together to appoint an authorised person?  This is a sensible suggestion with which I believe the Minister agrees.  We must determine if it needs to be done in a more tangible way than it seems to be expressed in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make my case briefly. I made an important point on Second Stage that those of us who are members of local authorities frequently encounter legislation which imposes a charge not on the State but on the local authority.  In Kildare, courthouses and the lighting on the motorway have to be paid for by the local authority.  This Bill entails another expense.  The Minister made the point in his Second Stage speech that the local authority can charge for the licences they issue.  I said that the amount of money raised by the local authorities would not cover the expenses they incurred.  It is an undesirable feature of some legislation that the local authority has to foot the bill.  That is not right if central Government makes the legislation.</P>
      <P>It would be desirable to have arrangements whereby young people who may be in breach of the provisions of the Bill can be given training and support.  These young people love horses which is something we must accept.  That love should be encouraged and channelled in the right direction.  I understand Dublin Corporation has set aside 11 acres for such a centre and that it will provide vocational training, employment, job training, horse care, leisure recreation and a potential for commercial income.  That is something I commend strongly to the Minister.  I hope it will succeed in that area and in others as well.  That was my intention in tabling the amendment.  I hope the spirit of it can be taken on board by the Minister to encourage this development and find funding for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a control rather than a developmental Bill.  I emphasise again that we will encourage such projects as the Senator refers to and also projects such as Fettercairn which is working very well.  We will provide every assistance possible to any organisation which establishes projects such as these to encourage good horse management and husbandry, especially among the youth.  I am confident that FÁS, the local authorities, the vocational education committees and the area partnership boards will combine to assist in the establishment <Col N="152" /> of these projects, which have been part of the discussion on this Bill since I introduced it.  There is widespread support for this type of project. Unfortunately, it was not possible to include it in this Bill because we are setting up a control rather than a developmental procedure.  I am sure that, if the need arises, local authorities and other agencies will respond.</P>
      <P>The Bill is comprehensive legislation whose provisions will control the problem of wandering horses.  There will have to be a response to that and no doubt local authorities and other agencies will respond by establishing and supporting projects such as the Senator mentioned.</P>
      <P>In the explanatory memorandum there is a clear commitment from the Government for financial support for the Bill and there will be provision in the Estimate for financial support for implementing the Bill.  In the Abattoirs Act, 1989, local authorities were given the power but not the resources to put it in place.  We have come up with the concept of control areas because the Bill will have to be targeted at areas most affected.  If you were imposing control areas through a national system you could not target financial resources at the most affected areas, which is the core philosophy behind the Bill.  There is nothing to prevent any local authority from establishing itself as a control area but I hope this Bill will target the most affected areas and that the financial commitment to be given by the Government will be targeted at the same areas.</P>
      <P>I hope the type of project that Senator Dardis mentioned will be developed where it is needed throughout the country.  It seems to be a sensible way of proceeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his support for the type of projects I described as well as for his commitment to financially assist local authorities.  As regards the racehorse sector, the apprentice school for young jockeys is a model of how young people can be educated and become involved in the horse industry.  The project we are proposing is far less sophisticated and has the potential to do just as much good.</P>

As an application for urban funding has been made on behalf of our own project at Fettercairn in Tallaght, no central State resources may be required to establish it.</P>
      <P>Section 15 states that the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may make grants towards the expenses of a local authority incurred under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How will this be implemented?  Will a block grant be given to local authorities?  Will a local authority or a group of local authorities working in tandem present their expenses at the end of year to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and expect that amount to be paid?  We need resources in this area.  I am glad the <Col N="153" /> Minister, through his powers of persuasion with the Minister for Finance, has assured there will be moneys in next year's Estimates for this legislation, but how will it work?  Some kind of reassurance needs to be given to local authorities if it is to be implemented.</P>

    <P>I could resort to speaking on the section once again.  Some concern has been expressed about the responsibility of, for example, a farmer who allows horses to be put on land.  I can envisage <Col N="155" /> certain situations where after harvest, people may be allowed to put horses out to stubble ground but it would be unreasonable to expect a farmer to be responsible for overseeing whether all horses entering the land were licensed, or that people would be dealing in them.  I moved the amendment in that context to put the onus back on the person who owns the horse.  That could be established by identifying the authorised person. That is the background to the amendment.</P>

      <P>The formulation in the Bill is considered best in order to protect innocent parties.  We previously looked at the question raised by Senator Dardis and feel that to protect the innocent party he refers to, this formulation is watertight.  In consultation with the parliamentary draftsman on Senator Dardis' proposal, it was felt that our proposal is fairer and would provide a better defence for an innocent party in the type of case to which the Senator referred.  For that reason I will stick with our own formulation.</P>

      <P>In page 15, line 25, to delete paragraph (i).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated the rationale behind this amendment on Second Stage.  I appreciate that a foal is defined <Col N="157" /> in the definitions section of the Bill.  However, many of those who keep horses, and to whom the Bill will apply, have colourful ways of describing the ages of their foals and when they were purchased.  In view of this I do not see why foals or recently purchased horses should be exempt from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A licensing system should apply to all horses to avoid cruelty to foals and to horses that have been recently purchased.  The Minister of State may argue that this is impracticable and that people must be given time to obtain a licence. However, if the transaction takes place within the control area the time to do it is immediately after the birth or purchase of the horse.  Without this, a licensing inspector could be told that a horse was purchased within the past week which may not have been the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We considered this aspect. However, a person may purchase a horse, say, in Ballinasloe, where it would be very difficult to immediately obtain a horse licence.  The horse would have to be brought to Dublin.  We must provide some leeway.  The person concerned has no licence to allow the horse to wander in a controlled area.  This provision is important, therefore, both in the interests of fairness and to allow people an opportunity to licence their horse within a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>Section 1 defines a foal as a horse not exceeding one year of age and which must be suckled by its dam or foster mother.  If a foal is found wandering alone it would be impounded and in such circumstances the dam or foster mother would be licensed and identified.  In view of this it would be somewhat draconian to impose a licensing system on foals.  However, I will consider re-emphasising the necessity of keeping a foal with its dam or foster mother.</P>
      <P>The Senator's amendment would tighten the Bill further.  We have endeavoured to be as balanced as possible.  In view of civil liberties and other such considerations we do not want to introduce draconian legislation.  There are provisions within the Bill to ensure that those owning a foal must be responsible for its management.  However, I will have a serious look at the Senator's amendment and will consult with him before Report Stage.  Being a lawyer he doubtless has a greater understanding than the lay person of what happens in court.</P>

      <P>They are in line with arrangements made by different local authorities. Amendment No. 23 provides that horses being transported through a control area <i>en route</i> to other areas, for example, a port for the purposes of travelling to England for sales or racing, do not have to be licensed or identified while in the control area.  The purpose of the provision is to ensure that people are not victimised or do not have to endure unnecessary hardships or delays.</P>
      <P>The reference to by-laws in respect of local authorities is to enable one local authority to take over the responsibility of another local authority area and to ensure that the by-laws would refer to that local authority.  I have also included a provision allowing for another local authority to be directed by me to take over or establish a control area. In such circumstances, provision is made for the Minister to make the necessary by-laws where that local authority would be reticent to do so.  It would cause a serious problem in that area as it would affect the other local authority with a control area.  It follows on from the provision made on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a difficulty with amendment No. 27.  We frequently talk about devolving powers to local authorities, of which I am in favour, but the amendment states that if the Minister does not like what a local authority did he will make sure it toes the line and does what he says.  It strikes me as contrary to the general thrust of the Bill which imposes obligations on local authorities, which I assume they are <Col N="159" /> prepared to take on board and exercise responsibly.  I do not like giving the control back to the Minister after the local authority has done all this.</P>
      <P>It might be used as an excuse by local authorities to not adopt by-laws as they could say it is not their responsibility under this subsection and that it is up to the Minister to make the decision.  The most recent similar example I can think of is the significant difficulty in my local authority area in deciding how taxis and hackney cabs should be licensed.  I do not like the provision as a matter of principle.</P>

      <P>It refers to the by-laws made in section 19 and not to others.  It is basically to facilitate the working of this Bill and is not intended to erode local democracy or local decision making.  However, there will be times when the Minister will have to be involved if local authorities are not doing their job in order to revoke any by-laws.  In cases where local authorities will not put by-laws in place the Minister will have to impose them.  The power will be used very rarely but it will keep local authorities in line.  We felt it was necessary to put this in place in order to ensure the effectiveness of the Bill and to facilitate its working.  I do not see it as draconian legislation but it is quite necessary.</P>
      <P>I was given responsibility for the implementation of the Abattoirs Act and I have spent the last two years encouraging local authorities to do so.  The Minister must have greater powers than those given under that Act. As the Senator knows, a proposal is going to Government which would take the administration of the Act away from local authorities because while some of them implemented it, and it cost them money, others did not.  This is a necessary provision in order to ensure the Bill is enforced. The reason for the provision is not to erode the powers of local authorities but to facilitate the effectiveness of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Basically, it follows from the provision we made, with which Senator Dardis agrees, that a local authority can take on responsibility for another local authority where that local authority will not co-operate with the Minister or the other authority.  It is a very important provision.  As I said earlier, this provision only refers to the by-laws in section 19. If the Senator reads those by-laws it may become clearer to him.  A range of by-laws will be made by local authorities in regard to the designation <Col N="160" /> of control areas and so on to which this provision will not refer.</P>

      <P>We have been talking for years about the delegation of powers to local authorities.  People ask time and again for more power for their communities and local authorities.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  He cannot say it is up to local authorities to designate control areas but that if they make certain by-laws he will not support them.  That does not add up.</P>
      <P>A local authority is entitled to do whatever it wants as long as it is within the law.  That is the important point.  If a local authority tried to bring in an unlawful by-law it could not be implemented and the Minister would have very good grounds for refusing to allocate it any finance under section 15.  However, either the Minister is giving powers to local authorities or he is not.  Will the Minister consider revoking this?</P>
      <P>If the amendment stated that where a local authority refused to make by-laws under this section the Minister would impose his own we might have sympathy for it.  However, a local authority might make lawful by-laws but the Minister could decide &ldquo;where he or she considers it necessary or expedient to do so, by order&rdquo; to &ldquo;revoke any bye-law made by a local authority under this section&rdquo; without giving any reason for so doing.  That is giving the Minister a huge power.  Local authorities wish to say &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; to Ministers, especially in regard to horses, and to be let do it themselves.</P>
      <P>It states earlier in the Bill that the Minister can step in if a local authority refuses to make a control order.  However, in this case the Minister is telling a local authority to step out.  The Minister will have an uphill battle to explain why the heavy hand of big Government should be on the little shoulder of local authorities.</P>

      <P>I really dislike the words &ldquo;or expedient&rdquo; in the amendment.  I can see the necessity of having to do it but it is even more undesirable to do it on the basis of expediency. The Minister of State gave the example of a local authority refusing to make by-laws.  I took that to mean that the Minister could create by-laws in his own right.  I do not take that reading from the amendment; I take it to mean he can revoke the by-laws established by a local authority.  The best way to do that is to first instruct the authority to redraft the by-laws in question.  The amendment gives far too much power to the Minister and is contrary to all we have said about devolution.  I am opposed to this amendment.</P>

      <P>I re-emphasise that the by-laws contained in section 19 are not as extensive as the by-laws contained in other sections, which give substantial powers to local authorities.  The by-laws in this section relate specially to it and should be considered in that context.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that I can direct a local authority to declare its area a control area.  This move followed reservations expressed by Deputy Kenneally and others on Committee Stage in the other House.  They pointed out that there could be &ldquo;border bandits&rdquo;, as the Senator called them, and the matter could get out of control with people bringing horses across control area boundaries.  I included the provision to direct local authorities following the strong case made in the other House.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 27 relates specifically to section 19.  By-laws under other sections, such as section 13, are completely free from ministerial intervention or involvement.  There are no similar provisions in respect of amendment No. 27 regarding the procedures for making by-laws.  The amendment relates specifically to by-laws made under section 19.  The advice of the parliamentary draftsman and the officials was that it was important to make this amendment to the section to facilitate the working of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am concerned when reference is made to the advice of the parliamentary draftsman.  Although the Minister has not done so yet, I become even more concerned when reference is made to the advice of the Attorney General.  That tends to be the ultimate refuge.</P>
      <P>Section 17(3) states that the Minister &ldquo;may direct&rdquo; the adjoining local authority.  I favour the point that the Minister may direct them to declare by-laws, but that is not the case under the amendment.  I accept the Minister's point that it relates to just one section but the amendment does not state that the Minister may give a direction.  It states that if we do not like it, we will tell them to go away.  It is much more restrictive than giving them a direction.  I am prepared to accept the phrase that where it is considered necessary, the Minister &ldquo;may direct&rdquo; the local authority.  However, the amendment does not state that, rather that by-laws will be revoked.  Is it possible for the Minister to create by-laws unilaterally, irrespective of those a local authority may decide to make?</P>

      <P>The amendment covers specific cases where horses are brought into an area.  If a local authority makes by-laws to cover a particular aspect, it may not revoke them and this could limit the effectiveness of the Bill.  The amendment relates specifically to temporary by-laws put in place by a local authority which are not revoked.  The purpose of the amendment is to facilitate the workings and effectiveness of the Bill.  This will become evident if the Senator examines the matter closely.  However, Senator <Col N="162" /> Dardis and Senator Mulcahy have expressed strong reservations about it and I assure them that their comments will be carefully considered. If they are not satisfied with my explanation, I will have the matter considered in depth between now and Report Stage to ensure a clearer definition is available.</P>

      <P>This is a very good amendment and came about following Second Stage contributions by a number of Senators.  It improves this Bill considerably from an animal welfare point of view.  This section allows a person authorised by the local authority or a member of the Garda to direct someone to seek veterinary attention for a horse that is obviously in extreme pain or distress, so they can request an individual who owns a horse or is in control of a horse to do that.  If they do not do so, they are guilty of an offence.  Other sections will follow up on that as well.  It is very important that somebody can point out to the owner of a horse which is obviously in distress, underfed, undernourished or in pain that they must get veterinary attention for it.  If they fail to do so, they are guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people mentioned this issue and it formed a large part of my contribution on Second Stage.  I am delighted with this amendment which reflects what I sought.  It will allow a member of the Garda or an authorised person, without going to a vet, to say to somebody that they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that a horse is being neglected and to demand veterinary attention for it.  It is very important because members of the Garda are under pressure much of the time and such matters must be dealt with on the spot.  I thank the Minister for bringing forward this amendment.  I and others who spoke that day mentioned the issue of animal cruelty.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to look on Report Stage at the word &ldquo;acute&rdquo; in the amendment which states: &ldquo;... the Garda Síochána who has reasonable cause to suspect that a horse in in such pain, distress or acute state of neglect...&rdquo;.  The words &ldquo;state of neglect&rdquo; should be sufficient.  The word &ldquo;acute&rdquo; would surely signify that the horse was literally knackered and on its last legs, but if a member of the Garda has reason to believe that the horse has been tied to a pole on a summer day and has not been given anything to drink for a day or two, that would be neglect.  It might be too late for the horse if it is in an acute state of neglect.  Perhaps another word could be used such as &ldquo;considerable&rdquo; or &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; or &ldquo;readily ascertainable&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Some horses that pass the winning post at the Curragh are in a state of neglect by the time they get there because they did not come first.  I agree with the need for the amendments which are very desirable and praiseworthy.  There are two aspects.  One has to do with section 33 and amendment No. 43 and the words &ldquo;or as soon as may be&rdquo;.  The nature of the condition of the animal would suggest that immediate <Col N="167" /> intervention was desirable.  I can understand that there might be legal reasons for not imposing an immediate responsibility on the Garda, but to use the words &ldquo;or as soon as may be&rdquo; would seem to give too much flexibility.</P>
      <P>In respect of section 40, amendment No. 59, whereby the intervention can proceed further and the animal may be destroyed, can the costs be recovered from the owner or the person in charge of the horse or horses in question?  Such a provision would be desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the concept of neglect, it can be interpreted in different ways; horse that is well groomed could be considered neglected.  The word &ldquo;acute&rdquo; was added to tighten the definition so that the subject of neglect would not be interpreted too broadly by the authorised officer.  It is attempting to retain a balance in the Bill but I will further consider it and if we can replace it with a better word on Report Stage, we will do so.  We can consider the matters raised today on Report Stage.  That is the importance of having Report Stage next week.  As we have demonstrated with this Bill, it is important when framing legislation to take everything into consideration.  One amendment may lead to another.  However, I will look at this.</P>
      <P>As regards costs, in this case the veterinary costs would have to be met by the owner of the horse.  Section 38 (2) (b) and section 39 (2) (a) also relate to costs and the reimbursement of costs by local authorities.  This Bill allows local authorities to recoup their expenses if they dispose of or sell on a horse and the balance can be returned to the owner.  The pound charges will be set down and the fines have been increased substantially.  This Bill includes various methods for local authorities to recoup their expenses.</P>
      <P>As regards the acute state of neglect, if we can get a better form of wording for Report Stage we will use it.  This is a very important provision in the Bill.  It strengthens it considerably because it also applied to areas outside control areas; it applies to horses anywhere in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am comforted by the Minister's words.  He is right, the Bill cannot go too far.  For example, if a horse was not given a drink for two hours that could be called neglect but we do not want a garda chasing that up.  There is a little neglect, middle neglect and acute neglect, the test should be somewhere between middle and acute. As the wording stands, a garda would not be able to intervene until the neglect had become acute. That is the problem.  A garda should be able to intervene before there is acute neglect.  This is not an easy one to crack; I agree with the Minister that a garda should not intervene if there is a little neglect.  This might seem like we are splitting hairs but when you are dealing with the welfare of an animal it could be a question of life and <Col N="168" /> death because once it reaches the acute neglect stage it could be too late.  I thank the Minister for agreeing to look at this again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister refer to a point made earlier regarding the wording in amendment No. 43 where a garda can take immediate action &ldquo;or as soon as may be&rdquo;.  I realise it may be too restrictive to impose a legal obligation on the gardaí to do something immediately, but the nature of the condition of the horse would suggest that immediate intervention is required.</P>

As regards costs, amendment No. 52 covers the costs incurred by local authorities; we will come to that later.  It is also referred to in other parts of the Bill.  There will be provision in the Bill for a large level of recoupment of costs by local authorities for impounding or disposing of animals.  As Senator Hayes said, we will have to provide more finance than is provided in this Bill to ensure its effectiveness.</P>

Senator Dardis made a strong case for microchipping.  It is working successfully in some places but we will have to make up our minds.  Horses in a pound can be identified in a different way from horses that have been initially identified by microchipping.  An identification will have to be put on them when they are impounded either by the Garda or the local authority.  It may not be as sophisticated as the original identification proposed but it will facilitate matters where horses are impounded repeatedly.</P>

      <P>When will the results of this study group be available?  On 26 May while speaking on Second Stage in the Dáil the Minister mentioned various forms of identification: freeze-branding, hoof and lip tattooing and microchip implantation.  He referred to this when addressing the Seanad on Second Stage.  I advocated the electronic animal identification system as one which would be desirable.  It can be used more easily on horses than on cattle or sheep because the value of the animal tends to be that much greater and the slight extra cost that might arise from using that procedure can be borne.</P>
      <P>When are we likely to have a decision on that? Could it be that one local authority would decide on electronic tagging, another on ear identification and another decide on the traditional type of thoroughbred passport identifying all marks on the horse?  Such a development would be undesirable as there is a potential with the travelling community for horses to move around the country.  It would be much better to have the local authority issue the licence and to have a standard type of identification system such as we have with motor cars.  In the event of the horse being moved from Limerick to Dublin, it would not need a second licence because the first licence would cover it nationally just as a motor car licence issued in a local authority area covers that car anywhere in the country.</P>

      <P>Proposals should be brought forward shortly because it is important to ensure the working of this Bill.  I totally agree with having a common system of identification throughout the country.  It would be very <Col N="171" /> confusing if this were not so.  Originally, our proposal to the Joint Committee was that identification be left to the local authorities but we changed that following consultation with them as it would not be practical.  There will be a national system of identification prescribed by the Minister and that is the best way forward.  We have narrowed the options down to two, microchipping and freeze-branding, as being the most desirable.  We will make a decision shortly and hopefully I will have a proposal next week. When I go back into the Dáil with these amendments I will then declare the national system of identification.  I agree with the Senator. It is desirable that we should have this system as soon as possible and I made a commitment to that last May.  In the end, we want the optimum system of identification and that is why we are not rushing this.  It is important that when the Bill is passed by the Houses we have a system immediately and that the matter does not drag on.</P>

      <P>Before we have an interesting discussion on the right to life of the horse, we need to be realistic.  There may be a need for this amendment but implicit in the Bill is that destroying a horse is seen as the last option. Earlier the Senator spoke about giving latitude to local authorities.  We should not tie their hands. My local authority area has a huge problem with horses, despite the figures released by the Department last week.  When this Bill is enacted it will be enforced through the local authorities. Many hundreds of horses will come into the possession of my local authority and something will have to be done with them quickly.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals recently stated that over 99 horses in the last year had to be destroyed by the society because of their condition; it is a real problem.  The local authority area in which I live and work has huge difficulties as a result of the treatment of horses by people who know nothing about caring for them, particularly in an urban environment.  Is this amendment necessary?  It is important that we do not tie the hands of local authorities who are working at the coalface in dealing with this problem.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with what Senator Mulcahy is trying to do and the humanitarian grounds for his amendment.  However, the amendment might be over restrictive.  In circumstances where a horse breaks a leg it is technically possible to rescue the horse.  It has been done where valuable stallions are involved. <Col N="173" /> However, it is an expensive operation and the outcome is questionable.  A vet would say that the preferred option would be to put the horse down. The vet must be given the latitude to make a professional judgment.  Senator Mulcahy is probably referring to a horse that is neglected and which could be, by feeding and so forth, restored to full health.  However, I envisage other circumstances whereby, if the amendment is included, the discretion which should be left to a veterinarian would be removed.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Dardis but his point is covered by amendment No. 59 which provides that a veterinary surgeon can decide, where a horse is in a bad state, that it can be put down.  My point is different.  If the local authority cannot sell or trade a horse it should be allowed to destroy it but that should be the last option.</P>

      <P>I understand the Senator's sentiments.  However, the inclusion of his amendment would be most restrictive on local authorities.  Local authorities will act prudently. From the point of view alone of recouping expenses they will try to sell an animal and if that cannot be done I am sure they will give it away.</P>
      <P>There are costs involved in the destruction of an animal and I am confident that killing the animal would be a last resort.  The animal would have to be in very bad condition.  This matter is covered in amendment No. 59 which provides that local authorities will seek the advice of a veterinary surgeon before terminating the life of a horse.  The Senator's concerns about the animal's welfare are adequately covered.  I will recommend to local authorities that they take the Senator's recommended course of action as it is the humane one.  However, if the amendment were accepted it could make life difficult for local authorities with a large number of horses some of which could be marginal cases and could not be disposed of otherwise.  For that reason, I must reject the amendment.</P>

      <P>If the words &ldquo;wilfully or recklessly&rdquo; are included, a high burden of proof is imposed on those seeking to prosecute under the section.  The correct standard should be neglect or carelessness.  It should state: &ldquo;The owner, keeper or person in charge or control of a horse who carelessly permits the horse to pose a danger...&rdquo;.  The amendment introduces the concept of negligence which is well-established. The negligence principle in law is that if one does something which affects one's neighbour in a detrimental way and one does so without caring about what happens to one's neighbour, one is liable to the neighbour in civil law.  The test for carelessness should be the proper test.</P>

      <P>The amendment to section 2 is <Col N="177" /> a technical one arising from the amendments to sections 4 and 46.  There are a number of references to the National Monuments Act, 1930 and the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994 in the Bill.  It is considered desirable to include these Acts in the definition section and to use a shortened version of the Title rather than repeat the full Title where it occurs.  The related amendments to section 67 substitute the shortened Title of the Acts for the full version in this section.</P>
      <P>Section 4(2) currently provides that the time limit within which a prosecution may be taken in respect of an offence is one year from the date of the offence.  Given the vulnerability to loss of the material or objects being cared for considerable time may elapse following the committing of an offence before it comes to the attention of the authorities in charge and the exact date of the offence may not be known.  Accordingly, it is considered desirable that the time limit for a prosecution should be amended to be 12 months from the date the offence came to the knowledge of the Minister.  This Bill already provides that licensing of alteration of archaeological objects will be a function of the board of the museum. The proposed amendment to section 4(2) will allow for the prosecution of offences under section 25 of the National Monuments Act to be on the same basis as other offences under the Bill, that is, within 12 months of the offence coming to the knowledge of the Minister.  The related amendment to section 50 and section 25 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, proposes that the prosecution of offences may be delegated by the Minister to a board.</P>

      <P>Museum and library boards have generalist functions and powers which would encompass the acquisition and the making and use of copyright, etc.  That issue was raised during Second Stage last week.

      <P>Senator Lee's amendments Nos. 4 and 8 propose that the power of the National Museum and National Library should be amended to include educational establishments as well as other bodies with whom they could enter into agreements.  I accept those amendments.  Senator Lee also proposes in amendment No. 6 that research in the library should be limited to relevant research.

I tabled this amendment because one often sees the National <Col N="180" /> Library crowded with people who do not need to use it as their first port of call.  They could use the library's own institutions.  Unless the library's resources are increased at a rate of vertical takeoff, the library should have some control over who uses the seats.

It is a difficult matter to judge.  The Senator's point is worthy of consideration by an appointed board.  I am reluctant to include the word &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; which implies a type of judgmental monitoring or an intrusion into a personal decision to carry out research.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the extension of existing powers to both the National Museum and the National Library.  The main reason for this legislation is to free the two boards from the bureaucratic jungle in which they have been involved since their establishment.  Everything these institutions do under their operating procedures must be referred to the Minister of the day.  They are not capable in many cases of developing and expanding their services.  Section 11 is extremely comprehensive and wide ranging in that regard and I compliment the Minister for framing it in such a manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In granting the boards this significant extension of powers the Minister should ensure that, as the power to control the day-to-day operation of these boards slips slowly from his grasp, they adopt a commercial approach.  This is an unwelcome word in academia.  However, the new boards of the library and of the museum have had and, despite this Bill, will continue to have a funding problem.  The Minister, with the best will in the world, cannot satisfy all the demands on his budget.  This section provides an opportunity for both boards to develop what might be loosely termed an entrepreneurial culture, aside from their responsible positions as protectors and acquisitors of the priceless heirlooms of the State. I ask the Minister to ensure a commercial <Col N="181" /> approach is adopted.  It is not enough for these powers to be written into law.  They should be seen to be proactive so that both institutions will have a great awareness of the potential that exists.</P>
    <P>I regularly receive colourful brochures from the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and from the British National Library which sell reproductions of many of their wares.  I am interested in the Minister's response to the view that there should be an entrepreneurial attitude or a more commercial approach.  It is not enough for the institutions to be keepers of the State's treasures.</P>

      <P>The element on conservation and restoration is important.  The National Gallery is a good example of where a conservation and restoration section has been developed over the years. Trinity and Marsh's Library have also developed considerable expertise in this area.  It is important for the continuing care of valuable artefacts that there should be people with the capacity to restore and conserve them.  In the restoration process, one comes into intimate contact with the fabric of these works and it lends to greater care.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased there is a provision to organise or arrange for the organisation of temporary exhibitions, within or outside the State, of museum heritage objects from its collection.  It is important that valuable collections should not be always based in Dublin. It is inevitable that a large concentration of these materials will be in the capital city but it is important they are made available both to citizens outside the capital and in other countries. We have had a number of spectacular exhibitions in America, for example, which are important for displaying the culture of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the production of replicas is important.  I agree there should be an entrepreneurial element.  These replicas will sell well.  People wish to acquire them because, in the international souvenir trade, so much has become bland and universal and the same rubbish can be found in city after city.  People want something distinctive, individual and unique.  The reproduction of material from these collections is <Col N="182" /> important.  It is highly marketable and there will be a welcome from the public for it.  There should and probably will be a degree of quality control. The last thing we want is inadequate, imperfect and shoddy replicas.  I have seen this in a number of places around the world and they do not do credit to the collection.  Perhaps it has to do with costs because it may be important to make them at a reasonable price so that the majority of people visiting galleries and museums can acquire them.  They cannot be priced outside the range of the ordinary person.  At the same time, I hope there will be quality control because shoddy replicas reflect badly on the originals.</P>
    <P>I speak with some feeling because I am involved, as the Minister knows, in the James Joyce Centre in North Great George's Street to which he has been extremely helpful and supportive.  We have had the pleasure of his company, erudition and wit on a number of occasions.  We are examining the possibility of reproducing items in the centre.  It does not just celebrate James Joyce but also the wonderful craftsmanship of Irish stuccodores and woodturners.  We hope to reproduce elements from the detailed plasterwork to sell to people who may wish to have those ornaments in their houses.  We are ensuring these are of a high calibre.  The average person likes to have these reproductions at home where they can touch them, stroke them, be in contact with the materials and occasionally break them without diminishing our national heritage as they would have had they broken the originals.</P>

      <P>I spoke at length on this section on Second Stage.  While I partly agree with Senator Mooney about the commercial aspect of the National Museum, I would hate if our National Museum were to be priced out of the range of the common person as has happened in London. Visiting the museums and galleries there is expensive.  The board should keep that in mind.</P>
      <P>Many schoolchildren come to Dublin on a day trip from April on.  The museum should have a tour specifically for them and show them items of interest relevant to their locality.  Children on a school trip have money to burn so it would be a viable activity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a huge debate in London about the entry cost to the Victoria and Albert Museum.  I would not like us to be in that position.  Our heritage and culture should be available to everyone.  The commercial aspect of it could be developed through brochures and reproductions as mentioned by Senator Norris.  I compliment <Col N="183" /> the Minister and, before I die, I hope to be complimented on my erudite wit.</P>

      <P>The accessibility of such institutions to young people, particularly school children, has been a part of life and should be developed.  The Minister should urge the boards of various cultural institutions to consider having access to most of the available artefacts and exhibitions.  It should be possible for a school in Roscommon or elsewhere to have computer access to a guided tour of the National Gallery or the National Museum.  That would be much cheaper and easier than sending pupils on a bus tour to Dublin.</P>
      <P>Irish people cannot afford to attend concerts and so on.  While commercialism is important and I fully support it in terms of harvesting tourism, it should not restrict access.  In supporting the section, that modification should be kept in mind.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to my colleagues for developing the points I made earlier.  If Senator O'Toole reads further down the list of amendments he will find that I have tabled one on entry and access to both Houses.  I am sorry to deflate the Senator but I am sure he will understand.</P>
      <P>Taking up Senator Norris's point to the Minister, we have moved on considerably from the time when clay objects stamped &ldquo;déanta i Timbuctoo&rdquo; were passed off as Irish souvenirs.  It is clear from literature I have received from cultural institutions in the United Kingdom that the boards will operate in an extremely competitive environment.  While it is accepted that standards will be maintained, I am glad Senator Norris made the point.  If replicating our national treasures in the National Museum and the National Library is to be successful I assume they will be of the highest standards as well as being accessible to the general public.  The price range must be acceptable and competitive otherwise it will be an elitist exercise of no benefit.  While I am glad Senators have expanded upon the point, I do not wish my earlier remarks on commercialisation to be misinterpreted.  It is precisely because of the commercial input into both boards that they will be aware of the competitive environment in which they are involved.  I presume the boards will adopt a commercial approach rather than assuming that their only functions are those mentioned in the two sections relating to them.</P>

      <P>In welcoming the section I take the important points made by Senator Kelly and Senator O'Toole.  None of us wants to create the impression that we are thinking of charging for entry.  Section 11(2)(q) gives the board power to <Col N="184" /> engage in such activities for the purpose of raising funds for the museum as it thinks appropriate.</P>
      <P>Had the thought crossed anybody's mind that fees might be charged, I am sure someone would have amended that to read &ldquo;other than the charging of entry fees&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Senators' contributions on this section and I will try to answer all the points that have been raised.  Both this section and the following one are core parts of the Bill that have not received sufficient outside attention.  I appreciate the comments made by Senator Mooney, Senator McDonagh, Senator Norris, Senator O'Toole, Senator Lee and others.</P>
      <P>The philosophy behind this Bill is to have legislation and institutional arrangements and, hopefully, adequate provision for the institutions to bring them into the next century.</P>
      <P>I have followed a principle of autonomy with responsibility.  Under the legislation the Minister is responsible but it is important that the boards enjoy autonomy.  I am not anxious to interfere with them having established their autonomy but I accept the point in the spirit in which it was made.  The principle of autonomy is important to me.  These institutions need freedom to be able to judge the circumstances in which they operate.  It is also necessary for the director and the board to enjoy that as an operable principle.</P>
      <P>For the assistance of Members I should say that the functions described in the section go back to some of the core principles in the Bodkin report, 1927.  The additional elements relate to the powers in section 11(2).  To answer the balance of the argument put forward by Senators, the functions respect heritage immutables in relation to responsibility.  The powers enable the institution to exercise those functions in a way that takes account of best contemporary balances. That is why they are listed.  Section 11(2)(q) relates to fundraising and sponsorship.  We can come back to that on Report Stage if Members so wish.</P>
      <P>I would draw the attention of Senator Kelly and others who are interested in education to the function which stresses the &ldquo;promotion of the museum as an integral part of the national culture&rdquo;.  Those words have not been idly inserted and it is possible to achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the argument about commercialism and conservation, the debate is whether the traditional model of a museum must give way &mdash; respecting as it does deposit, conservation and other factors &mdash; to live in the new age.  I do not accept that.  One can respect that and do all the <Col N="185" /> new things as well.  The reference to the &ldquo;promotion of the museum as an integral part of the national culture&rdquo; was included to strengthen its education purpose.</P>
    <P>The person whom I appointed to chair the interim board of the National Museum, Ms Barbara Nugent, and her board have addressed the issue of striking a balance.  The interim board has also addressed the issue of using new information technology in the best possible way to allow greatest access.  As we move towards the opening of Collins Barracks I have been trying to strengthen staffing in conservation and education. It is possible to fulfil the spirit and letter of the functions.  The advantage of having listed powers is that there is no spancel on the board to do, in its best judgment, any of the things Senators have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Minister of the day must make sure that the kind of expertise and ability referred to by Senators will be represented on the board.  It will be judged on how it manages the cultural institution during its period of responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long time since I heard the word &ldquo;spancel&rdquo; and it has been used in an appropriate manner here.  The word means to tie up somebody.  The Minister said there was no spancel on the board.</P>
      <P>I welcome these amendments.  On Second Stage I expressed concern about the issue of copyrights, patents, licences, etc.  I differ from other Senators on the issue of admission charges. Establishments such as this should make money. Museums in other countries which I have visited have admission charges.  How otherwise could they afford to provide guided tours?  In addition, from a safety point of view, people should not be allowed to ramble around them unsupervised. While Senator Mooney takes the opposite viewpoint he has advised me that charges are levied to cover the costs of exhibitions.</P>
      <P>There is an open market for the reproduction of artefacts in museums.  I have a small collection of artefacts from those I have visited.  They all contain a leaded stamp to the effect that they are authentic replicas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to get involved in detail because the boards are autonomous.  I have a long established practice of noninterference and an unfair reputation derived from occasional allegations of taking an interest. This is one of the difficulties of being proactive in legislation and other such matters.</P>
      <P>The boards will be able to, and should, consider these points.  The detail of the powers specifies that which should be taken into account.  We will encounter the issue of charges under section 14. In the meantime, it would be a matter for the boards of the institutions to decide on any suggestions on taking this approach.  However, such charges would only come into being with the consent of the Minister because it raises a deeper policy issue.</P>
      <P>I am fascinated by the argument on balancing personal curiosity and the guided tour and the structure of that which is presented to one as knowledge about a specific artefact, its setting or whatever.  I am always inclined to build around the concept of wonderment as much as scholarship, but these are balances with which the board will wrestle.</P>

      <P>In page 11, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following new paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) to facilitate, encourage, assist and promote the carrying out of genealogical research,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated on Second Stage, it was my objective to enhance the potential of the cultural resources of genealogy and heraldry, with a clear governance structure involving administrative accountability.  However, in the light of the various comments made I have examined alternative wordings to that in the Bill to achieve this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="187" /> The amendments proposed to section 13 replace the formal dissolution of the office with a wording which, for the avoidance of any doubt, declares that the Genealogical Office is a branch of the National Library.  This replaces subsection (1) of the original section.  As the office is not being dissolved the provisions of sections 2, 4 to 7, inclusive, and 9 in the original Bill dealing with transfers and revoking the 1942 Order are no longer needed.  Senators will recall my comments on Second Stage with regard to the status of the 1943 Order and my anxiety to try to manage a proposal which would handle this.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2), formerly subsection (3), is maintained and amended by providing for the full name of the Chief Herald to read &ldquo;Chief Herald of Ireland&rdquo;.  This addition aligns the appellation to that provided in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3), formerly subsection (8), is unchanged from the provision in the Bill as initiated.  This subsection provides that the National Library shall be entitled to the copyright on grants of coats of arms, a matter which was raised with me.</P>
    <P>The powers of the board of the library in section 12 are being added to so as to include the facilitating of genealogical research and the granting of arms.  I am satisfied that this wording, as amended in sections 12 and 13, recognises the <i>status quo</i> with regard to the Genealogical Office and makes clear that it will continue under the new board but will be responsible to it and clearly within the administrative framework of the library.</P>
    <P>I have considered Senator Mooney's package of amendments, including his amendment to my amendment No. 10 concerning the establishment of a genealogical office with a distinct legal independent status and parallel provisions to greatly strengthen the role of the Chief Herald, including a direct relationship with the board.  I understand and appreciate the intention behind the Senator's proposals but I am strongly of the view that my own approach is more appropriate.</P>
    <P>I am advised that if Senator Mooney's amendment to my amendment to section 13 is accepted there would be a clear contradiction between subsection (1), which recognised the Genealogical Office as a branch of the National Library, and his proposed subsection (2), which would establish it.  I consider it desirable that it be clear that the Genealogical Office is within the library's administrative structure, as it has been for decades, except, of course, it will have the benefit of clarity, and it is very important to have clarity as a foundation for administration.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney's amendments would seem to lead to two bodies under one board, that is, a Genealogical Office separate from the National Library with a lack of clarity about employment of staff, budgets, administrative management, etc. The current status of the Genealogical Office is recognised in my proposals.  The executive functions of drafting coats of arms will be given a <Col N="188" /> fresh mandate and will no longer be reliant on the Government decision about which questions have been raised &mdash; I am referring to the 1943 decision.  It is now clear and underwritten by the people through an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee's amendment appears to be in the same spirit as mine &mdash; to place the Genealogical Office clearly within the library framework rather than a separate office.  I hope Senator Mooney and Senator Lee, whom I thank for their careful and thoughtful amendments, might consider withdrawing them in light of my comments.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and his excellent staff, with whom I have been in regular contact over the last few weeks.  I welcome their clarification of several points which arose in the course of the debate, especially in relation to section 13.  However, the role of Government and Opposition in a working democracy are inevitably different.  The Government proposes legislation and it is the Opposition's responsibility to ensure those legislative proposals are debated and analysed so that we can arrive at a better Bill than that which began life in the office of the parliamentary draftsman.  That sums up where I stand in relation to much of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In common with my colleagues, I have received numerous representations from individuals and genealogical organisations since the Bill was first published; I am sure the Minister received similar representations.  Without wishing to sound self-important, but as my party's spokesperson on arts, culture and the Gaeltacht, I see it as my public duty to bring these proposals forward for debate so that the arguments for and against can be properly analysed on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I agree there have been massive distortion and misinterpretation, not only of the proposals in this Bill but also of the nature and historic function of the Office of the Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer.  That includes letters to <i>The Irish Times</i>, the Minister, me and everybody else.  Due to the murky background in <Col N="189" /> which this subject was conceived, gestated and born it is not surprising there have been massive misinterpretations.  I can understand how these historical distortions have been carried forward to the present day and used by various representative interests whose main concern is centred around the continuing independent status of the office and the international perception, rather than the legal status, of the procedures associated with his or her appointment.</P>
    <P>While much of what I am saying might seem to go against the general thrust of the amendments, there is merit in much of what has been submitted to me.  I assume Senator Lee, who tabled parallel amendments, has similar views.  There is a need to address this problem.</P>
    <P>I undertook detailed research on the role, status and function of the Chief Herald, formerly Ulster King of Arms, since the foundation of the State in 1922.  I felt my role in this debate deserved no less.  When the Minister and I first spoke about this aspect of the legislation 12 months ago I assumed Ulster referred to the geographical entity of Ulster.  In fact, it comes from the original title given by the English king in the 16th century who was known as Ullnester, which transmogrified 100 years later into Ulster. That was his name; he was known as Ulster in the same way the Cathaoirleach is known as Liam.  It had nothing to do with the province of Ulster.  It is important to say that because there has been a great deal of comment about cross-Border implications, the separated brethren and so on.</P>
    <P>I suppose I am entering into an academic debate here I am going to nail my colours to the mast.  I have come to the conclusion that successive Governments from 1922 until 1937 and the introduction of the de Valera Constitution would have abolished the office of Ulster King of Arms if agreement had been reached between what were then two Commonwealth Governments.  It is important to remember that, in spite of all that happened in 1916 and 1922. The main objection to abolition was that from 1922 until 1937 the Government of Saorstát Éireann was legally referred to as Her Majesty's Government in Ireland and the issuing of royal warrants for the granting of arms by Ulster was a royal prerogative.</P>
    <P>It is amazing how, especially in the context of the movie which is being released this weekend, the name and function of the late Michael Collins resonates down the decades.  He discussed the transfer of Ulster King of Arms office during the Treaty negotiations.  It was understood by both the British and Irish Governments at that time that the office, as distinct from the title, would be transferred.  However, I cannot locate a legal statute for this decision and the detail of what was discussed is based on contemporary accounts by those present at the Treaty discussions, in other words, there is nothing in writing.</P>
    <P>I wish to offer my personal observation of what I believe happened based on a reading of the various papers of that period.  The function of <Col N="190" /> Ulster King of Arms up to 1922 was primarily, although not exclusively, concerned with the orderly management of the Irish Court which was then based in the Viceregal Lodge in the Phoenix Park which is now Áras an Uachtaráin.  Ulster, as he was known, was also legally responsible for maintaining the genealogical records relating to Irish families, their pedigree and so on and for maintaining the register of members of the Order of St. Patrick.  Once Saorstát Éireann was established as a legal entity in 1922, the Office of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was dissolved and the Order of St. Patrick was suspended, pending a decision on its future by the Executive Council of Saorstát Éireann.  Incidentally, I am hoping the Minister and I will meet at a future stage in this House to talk about the Order of St. Patrick.</P>

      <P>The then Ulster King of Arms was Sir Neville Wilkinson who was appointed in 1907 but who spent most of his time in London at the Office of the Keeper of Royal Arms.  It is important to put on record that before, during and immediately after the Treaty negotiations, Sir Neville Wilkinson did not physically work out of the office of arms which was then located in the Bedford Tower in Dublin Castle.  However, by 1923 Sir Neville was observed visiting the office on a regular basis, much to the astonishment of the members of the Irish Government, especially the Department of Justice and the Attorney General's Office, which was then located in Castleyard.</P>
      <P>The presence of Sir Neville after such a long absence was queried.  When it became apparent that the office of which he was the main holder had not been legally transferred from British jurisdiction, efforts were belatedly made to have the office transferred in line with all other former British institutions of state.  However, under the Treaty agreement, all offices of state had to be transferred under Article 79 of the then Constitution by 31 March 1923.  When Sir Neville's wanderings around Dublin Castle came to light, it was, unfortunately, too late to effect the transfer.</P>
      <P>This unusual position obviously exercised the minds of the members of the Executive Council between 1923 and 1927 because by then the Irish Government &mdash; or, to give it its correct terminology at the time, Her Majesty's Government in Ireland &mdash; was pressing Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to agree to the transfer of the functions and office of the Ulster King of Arms to Dublin.

      <P>I thank Senator Norris for his point about His Majesty's Government. According to all accounts, the reply from His Majesty's Government to His Majesty's Government in Ireland did not go down too well in Dublin Castle.  Its position was that as the Ulster King of Arms existed by royal prerogative and letters of patent from the King, the British Government had no authority over his office although it paid his wages.  This is an important point; somebody in an office was paid by the British Government but when it came to a question of legal transfer that Government told this Government it had no power or authority over the gentleman or his office.</P>
      <P>The matter had not been resolved by 1930 and the trail went cold until 1936 when the abdication of King Edward VII&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> The abdication of King Edward VIII who, as the history books tell us, gave up the throne of England for the love of a woman, became involved in this matter.  My personal interpretation of history, based on the available data, of why the Executive Council of the Irish Free State decided in 1930 not to pursue the matter again is that the office of Ulster King of Arms was viewed as an historical anachronism that had no place in a republic.  Ireland was not officially a republic at that time but the mindset and culture at the time was republican in its outlook and functioning. Culturally, the country was a republic by then at the highest levels of office.</P>
    <P>The decision was taken, as in the case of the continuity or lack of continuity of the Order of St. Patrick ten years previously, that the then incumbent in the office, Sir Neville Wilkinson, should be allowed to continue his function as Ulster King of Arms, paid by the British Government, until such time as he passed on.  The Irish attitude was plain; when the Ulster King of Arms, Sir Neville Wilkinson, passed on to the great heraldic heaven, the Free State Government would have nothing more to do with it.  This is my interpretation of the history from 1922 to 1937.</P>
    <P>In the same way as it allowed the Order of St. Patrick to wither on the vine, no absolute decision was taken, although there are several references in the papers and documents of the period to the continuing status of the Order of St. Patrick.  It was left as a decision of the Executive Council at the time.  In addition, the previous Constitution stated that no orders of nobility could be given &mdash; this is also included in the current Constitution &mdash; so the Order of St. Patrick could not continue.  I understand at that time that the King of England initiated signatures and confirmed the various meritorious individuals who held the Order of St. Patrick.</P>
    <P>The matter was related to the king and royalty and the fledgling republic was trying to deal with this historical, royal anachronism which caused enormous angst over 16 years to the then Government.  I understand the Ulster King of Arms was to die with its incumbent, Sir Neville Wilkinson.  However, as often happens in history, fate intervened in 1940 when Sir Neville Wilkinson died and once again an Irish Government had to face up to what should been done about the office and the functions of the Ulster King of Arms.</P>
    <P>While a decision was pending, the then registrar, Mr. Sadlier, who was appointed in 1921 prior to the creation of the Irish Free State, was asked to continue in an acting capacity as Ulster King of Arms.  Years of neglect and confusion were about to come to an end with a <i>modus vivendi</i> agreed between the British and Irish Governments through the United Kingdom representative in Ireland at that time, Ambassador Mahaffey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided that the former functions of the Ulster King of Arms relating to the Six Counties would be administered by the King of Arms in London with Mr. Sadlier having responsibility for the Twenty-six Counties.  With this important change came the decision to create the Genealogical Office because genealogy was increasingly proving to be the greater part of the functions of the Ulster King of Arms.  This puts the Minister's point about the order in context.  It is the historical context and background to the creation of a genealogical officer in 1943.</P>
      <P>In 1943 the de Valera Government issued an order transferring the former office of arms under a new title of Genealogical Office to the Department of Education which in turn placed it under the administrative structure of the National Library.  I agree with the Minister about this matter.  It is incontrovertible that the Genealogical Office was placed under the administrative structure of the National Library in 1943.</P>
      <P>However, the Government of the day did not promulgate that order correctly.  This led to the legal questions surrounding that decision and has informed much of the debate about the legal status of the Chief Herald and the Genealogical Officer 53 years later.  The civil servants who drew up that order in 1943 operated under a mindset which formed their collective thinking on the role of the former Executive Council <i>vis-á-vis</i> the authority of the people in which it was vested. I am straying into constitutional matters and it open to those who are more expert in this area to correct me but, as a lay man, I suggest that under Saorstát na hÉireann's Constitution power was vested in the Executive Council, while under the de Valera Constitution of 1937 all power was vested in the people through the Oireachtas, their elected representatives and, in turn, the Government and the Minister functioning in his or her Department on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>I am open to correction but this is the legal chain of command which operates to this day.  It establishes the perception that if a board appointed by a Minister in turn makes an appointment, somehow its legal status is diminished.  However, if the board of the library appoints a Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer with the consent of the Minister of the day, it is not the case that the board is not acting ultimately with the consent of the people and given legal effect.  To suggest that any appointment by the board of the library with the consent of the Minister is not legal defies description.  It suggests that a board properly constituted and acting under the direction of the Minister, in carrying out its legal duties, is not acting on behalf of the Minister who, in turn, is responsible ultimately to the people through the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make this point because a number of letters were published in the national press.  The most recent of them was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> from the Right Reverned Lorenzo Casati, the <Col N="194" /> Bishop of Torcello, Orthodox Metropolia of Western Europe, Patriarchate of Kiev, writing from Palermo in Italy, where he obviously enjoys the sun.  He says that the proposed action would virtually eliminate the power of the Chief Herald to grant arms as coat armour granted by the National Library would have no legal standing either in the Irish Republic or in international law.  That is codswallop.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the historical continuity of the Office of Ulster King of Arms, constantly referred to here as an old institution which we should retain in its original form, was broken on the death of Sir Neville Wilkinson and that we should argue our present position from the establishment of the Office of the Chief Herald some six years later in 1946.  The status of newly appointed position of Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer was never a contentious issue until the appointment of the last encumbent of the office, who has since retired.  I have no wish to take advantage of privilege in making my contribution in this House, but if even half of what I have been told about this gentleman's tenure as Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer is true I do not blame the Minister for wishing to ensure in legislative terms that it will never be repeated.</P>
    <P>The amendments I propose to sections 12 and 13 are in the main an attempt to maintain the distinct nature of the office of Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer so as to eliminate any perceptions, especially at international level, that granting of arms by a Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer appointed by the board of the National Library with the consent of the Minister is in any way diminished.  It is in that context that I wish to have them debated.  When this legislation is passed it is vitally important that there will be no doubts about the legal status of the person appointed as Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer and that this person will not be diminished at home or abroad in relation to their functions.</P>

      <P>Before I call the next speaker, I wish to announce a correction to the amendment list.  Senator Mooney's name should appear to the second amendment to Government amendment No. 10 on the amendment list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for clarifying that point.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment to section 13 is very welcome.  The issue which caused the greatest problem for many of us was the use of the word &ldquo;abolish&rdquo; in the Bill.  The Minister did not do enough to reassure us on Second Stage.  The amendment states: &ldquo;for the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the Genealogical Office is a branch of the National Library&rdquo;.  In deference to Senator Mooney, we had an English teacher who, in teaching us the subjunctive always quoted those famous lines from <i>Macbeth:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" />&ldquo;If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>I wonder whether that &ldquo;is&rdquo; should be amended to a &ldquo;be&rdquo; so that it reads &ldquo;the Genealogical Office be a branch of the National Library&rdquo;.  The Minister might give some consideration to that.  I welcome the fact that abolition is not an issue and that the National Library will now continue in existence.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Genealogical Office will continue to exist as a unit in some form or other.  I thank the Minister and his advisers for their regular correspondence on this issue over the last few weeks and for their attempts to clarify it and to move forward.  How does the Minister see the relationship between the Genealogical Office and the board?  Are there now two units, a branch of the National Library and a board of the National Library?  The relationships between the units are important.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Genealogical Office is a branch of the National Library means that it is in some way subservient to it.  I want to be assured that although it is a branch, it could not at any stage be cut off from the stem, so to speak, and therefore we want to know exactly what powers the National Library will have over it.  For instance, it would be unacceptable if the powers of the National Library in dealing with the branch of the library were such that it could close it down.</P>
    <P>The other issue relates to Senator Mooney's reference to Statutory Instrument No. 267 of 1943, signed by Éamon de Valera.  That did not do some of the things that Senator Mooney said it did.  It transferred the administration of the business of the Genealogical Office to the Department of Education.  It did not establish it as a separate entity, but brought it into the Department of Education.  That is crucial in terms of understanding what we are doing here.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment, which intrigues me, replaces the original section of the Bill which contained a subsection revoking that order.  If it remains in existence &mdash; I cannot find anything in the Bill that revokes it &mdash; there is a difficulty if it is still allocated to the Department of Education. Does that not cause some confusion?  Perhaps the Minister would make that issue clear.</P>
    <P>In regard to commercial revenue, which we discussed earlier, I still have not found Senator Mooney's contribution where he says he wants access to museums to be free.  The Genealogical Office has a revenue creation potential and linking that to the National Library has an attraction.</P>
    <P>I received correspondence from the chairperson of the National Library of Ireland Association in which they express their concern that, because the library could not be seen as a revenue creating institution, it might be in some way diminished.  The Minister has made it clear that will not happen but I see certain attractions in linking the two which would give some revenue <Col N="196" /> creating opportunities to the broader unit including the National Library.  That is something the Friends of The National Library would appreciate.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the position regarding the continued existence of the Statutory Instrument No. 267, 1943, which transferred the administration and business of the Genealogical Office to the Department of Education?  What does this mean for the future in the scenario the Minister outlined?  Would he indicate the sets of relationships between the Genealogical Office and the Board of the National Library and the Genealogical Office and the Director of the National Library?  How does the Minister see those relationships and how can he ensure the continued and undiminished existence of the Genealogical Office?</P>

      <P>Those of us who expressed reservations and doubts about section 13 at Second Stage will have those fears assuaged by the Minister's proposals.  He has gone a long way towards allaying our fears about what might be happening in the genealogical area.  My concern was for the quality of service provided and less with the precise institutional structures, although I can understand why others are very concerned about them.  This is a big improvement but I too would like clarification.</P>
      <P>I have a number of queries regarding our respective amendments.  It appears that my amendment No. 11 places the genealogical service closer to the centre of the National Library's and the board's concern than section 12 (b) and (c).  I have no problem with that but it would be useful if every other alphabetical subclause were deemed to relate to genealogy as well as to everything else.  That is a procedural point but my amendment gives a higher profile to the genealogical dimension of the library's functions in addition to the Minister's.</P>
      <P>I do not want to begin a discussion about the relative values of the coats of arms concepts, but section 12 (c) states &ldquo;to facilitate, encourage, assist and promote the granting and confirming of coats of arms&rdquo;.  The phraseology is standard and I have no problem with facilitating and assisting the granting and confirming of coats of arms.  However, I do not see why in a republic, which I presume we still are, it ought to be a function of any institution to encourage and promote the granting of coats of arms.  I can imagine the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry trotting through the cattle marts of Tipperary, Cork and Monaghan inviting farmers to apply for their coats of arms at this moment but I do not see why we should be encouraging and promoting, as distinct from facilitating and assisting, that activity which is a subdivision of genealogical research and activity.  I would be interested to know if there is a philosophical and ideological impulse behind &ldquo;encourage and promote&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;facilitate and assist&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> I agree with Senator O'Toole; it may be necessary in order to get the most effective resolution of the problems that arose under section 13 and which the Minister is addressing in a constructive and fair minded way, to have further amendments on Report Stage but I am not sure we will agree on a form of wording today.</P>

      <P>I welcome amendment No. 10 which proposes to delete section 13 and I compliment the Minister on introducing it.  While we had specific discussions on Second Stage regarding section 13 and wide concern was expressed about the dissolution of the Genealogical Office, this amendment puts back into statute and legal form the recognition of that office.  This is to be commended and I thank the Minister for listening to Senators on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 deals with the functions of the library in relation to the Genealogical Office; this too is welcome as it lays down the role of the Genealogical Office.  We were concerned that it would be subsumed into the library but this amendment states that it will be a branch of the library with distinctive functions.  I compliment the Minister for responding to the calls made in this House.</P>

      <P>I greatly enjoyed Senator Mooney's contribution.  I found it illuminating.  It elucidated a number of complex points.  It is part of the function of this House to tease out some of this material so that it may become clearer and Senator Mooney did that in a scholarly way and I compliment him.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that some of the Minister's advisers were in contact with me over the last few days explaining the amendments and the Minister has clearly gone a long way to meeting some of the reservations Senators expressed.  The Independent section of the House wish to ensure that the question of the abolition of the Genealogical Office is cleared up.  It was obvious that it was not being abolished and the Minister was agreeable to do that and we on the Independent benches, with the assistance of Fianna Fáil, can feel that we have achieved this. It was our primary objective and I am grateful to the Minister for having so done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new section 13 (2) reads: &ldquo;The Board shall, from time to time as occasion requires, designate a member of staff to perform the duty of researching...&rdquo; I am concerned about the qualifications in this amendment.  &ldquo;From time to time as occasion requires&rdquo; suggests that there is an element of potential discontinuity that could be hauled out of the cupboard if we had to have such a person.  Is there any legal import to this phrase?  Is there any necessity for it?  It is not contained in Senator Mooney's amendment which is far clearer, nor is it in the amendment submitted to me by Mr. Gorry of the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations which, I believe, <Col N="198" /> is the basis for Senator Mooney's amendment.  I would like the Minister to comment on the phrase &ldquo;from time to time as occasion requires.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was enchanted by Senator Mooney's contribution.  It is part of the function of this House to engage in these illuminating excursions. As far as the Knights of St. Patrick are concerned I was encouraged to hear that he proposes to revive it.  It dissolved in rather curious circumstances; I do not think it ceased until 1970 or 1971.  The last knight was the Duke of Windsor.</P>

      <P>They were also rather mean.  As I recall you had to pay for your own regalia.  A connection of my grandfather's was to be made a knight in 1907 but when he got here it was discovered that the so called crown jewels of Ireland had been stolen.  Lord Castletown died in 1937 whereupon Neville Wilkinson demanded the return of the collar and star but they could not be found until two years later.  It was just as well because he did not have enough money to pay for them to be returned.  The Order did have a commemorative service about 20 years ago in St. Patrick's Cathedral attended by relatives of the late members who had a bunfight in the Deanery. The principal issue the Minister should address is &ldquo;from time to time as occasion requires&rdquo;.  It suggests there may not be the wholehearted commitment envisaged in some of the other amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">

      <P>Amendment No. 10, subsection (3) (a) states: &ldquo;All functions performed by the Genealogical Office from 1 April, 1943, to the establishment day are hereby recognised and confirmed&rdquo;.  That implies there may be a legal question over the Allocation of Administration (Genealogical Office) Order, 1943.  Would that then mean all the functions, such as the granting of coats of arms, performed by the Genealogical Office since that date are in legal question?  Is there a need to incorporate that part of amendment No. 10 into the Minister's amendment to copperfasten it?  I am not sure if one can make something legal retrospectively.  I thank the Minister for taking on board the concerns of many historians and genealogists. Perhaps the first line of the old section 13 caused the most angst.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Mooney but there is still an issue between us as to whether the Genealogical Office should stand separate as an institution with its own staff from the National Library or whether it stands as a recognised, mentioned section within the National Library responsible to the Library and its structures.  I see that difference very clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> I thank him particularly for drawing attention to the outrageous comments, including the letter he quoted last week, which suggested the functions of heraldry internationally were being damaged.  That was never at stake.  The functions of the office of the Chief Herald were being given specific reference in statute, not in a ministerial order.  It was therefore being strengthened.  The question of the functions of the Genealogical Office were no longer to be the function of a ministerial order but were being referred to in primary legislation.  There is a respectable difference between Senator Mooney and me in relation to the structure that might be brought in and I accept that but I appreciate his blowing away the outrageous comments made on abolition.  That is honest and appreciated.  There has been some damage done internationally when one gets letters from abroad that suggest that the Government or Minister of the day is interested in somehow undermining these functions.  That is not what is between us.  Both of us have a respect for these functions; our difference lies in how they are to be organised for the future.</P>
    <P>I have received advice from the Attorney General on my amendments which I put down for clarification in dealing with the issues presented by the Allocation of Administration (Genealogical Office) Order, 1943.  Listening to the Seanad debate on Second Stage, there was a possibility that it could lead to ambiguous construction or intention.  The amendments were put down for clarification.</P>
    <P>The advice of the Attorney General on the 1943 order is that it is a decision of Government and there is no reason to challenge it because of the transfer of functions to the Department of Education which were later transferred to the Department of the Taoiseach and, with other functions, these were transferred to me. Therefore I am the Minister responsible for this legislation and the institutions.  In relation to the Genealogical Office, it is a named section of the National Library within the National Library's administrative structure.  Therefore the board that runs the National Library, which will have many different functions, will be in charge, as will the director appointed by that board.</P>
    <P>Here is the choice and, to be fair to Senator Mooney, he is not arguing for ambiguity in the Library.  One chooses a model and once the choice is made, no Senator is arguing for confusion or ambiguity in administrative accountability.  That was a motivation in the correspondence to the newspapers because bad practice is facilitated by absence of clarity in who should report to whom, or who should be responsible to whom.  It is very different to argue for the autonomy of an office and functions within a structure and that one should not be responsible to, effectively, a chief executive who, in turn, is responsible to the board.  We are getting at the real issues and choices to be made. To answer Senator O'Toole, it is a recognised <Col N="200" /> section within the structure of the National Library, accountable to the board of the Library and to the Director of the National Library.</P>
    <P>On another important issue raised by Senator Norris, contrast that clarity with the absence of clarity which some would have asked for and which would have left matters confused and without ministerial responsibility.  The functions of heraldry, genealogy, etc., would be damaged.</P>
    <P>I was a practising academic, not a trained genealogist, but I was a researcher, sociologist and university teacher.  I take exception to those who say that heraldry suffers by being closely linked with genealogy or that either or both are damaged by a connection with library skills.  Yet that is at the basis of some of the correspondence: that somehow, these functions can gain through imprecision, absence of clarity, no accountability and that these can be affected by a relationship with the Director of the National Library.  I find the suggestion untenable.  I will restrain myself on historic practice as to what happens in such states of imprecision.  Is it desirable that that should continue in the future?</P>
    <P>On the international perception, I hope we are assisted by what has been said today.  Much of the concern has been generated by an erroneous debate with which Senator Mooney has dealt, including strong references to the functions of granting of arms in primary statute.  Here it is clear and strong in primary statute, irrespective of how it is organised and to suggest otherwise has been an act of gross irresponsibility.  One wonders, although one need not wonder too much, about the motivation of those who ran this campaign.  What can be stronger than that functions be supported by a law which expresses the will of the Oireachtas?</P>
    <P>The Office of the Attorney General advised me that this legislation does not interfere with the basic decision &mdash; Government decision of 1943 &mdash; to grant coats of arms and, as the system has been accepted internationally since then, it should not be affected.  Indeed, the clarity will enhance it. Senator Mooney discussed other matters in his fascinating contribution.  It is an interesting file and future historians will be delighted with it.  The initial Government decision was not to call the Chief Herald Príomh-Aralt na hÉireann but bolscaire.  Etymologists will argue about why Mr. de Valera thought a bolscaire was not acceptable and instead opted for an aralt.  It is a fascinating file which tells us a great deal.  We have benefited from it as it sets out the relationship between two peoples.  The correspondence between the Department of Education of the day and the Office of the Dominions is interesting.  There is a little resonance from that in some of the correspondence I have read but I will restrain myself.</P>
    <P>As I said the clarity will help.  Would it not be more damaging if there was ambiguity about the relationship between the Genealogical Office and the National Library which could lead to disputes in the future?  Senator O'Toole questioned the <Col N="201" /> use of &ldquo;be&rdquo; and &ldquo;is&rdquo;.  I used the word &ldquo;is&rdquo; to establish continuity lest there be any construction of &ldquo;be&rdquo; that the previous regime was not valid, it is in the sense that it is not anticipative of the future but a statement.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the excursions into the joys of language which the Seanad always makes possible.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole also questioned the use of the word &ldquo;branch&rdquo;.  This usage is in the Ministers and Secretaries Acts to deal with bodies with a distinct status.  A museum or a library, for example, are referred to as branches of administration when being assigned to Departments.  The word is used for clarity and consistency and to determine the flow of responsibilities under the legislation.  It will not be subsumed but will be a part of the library for the purpose of control by the board.  When the froth was swept away that was the real issue in most of the correspondence.  I accept people want to disagree with it.</P>
      <P>It is the view in the legislation that a connection between the National Library and genealogy is a good thing and should be made clear.  The Heritage Council is being asked to look at the development of genealogy and so forth and the Bill permits future arrangements. However, this legislation states who should listen to whom, who is answerable to whom and what are the relationships and structures.  The amendments to section 12 are proposed to ensure that genealogy and heritage are key parts of the board's functions.</P>
      <P>As the Genealogical Office is a branch of the National Library it will come under the orders that assign the library to the Minister.  Since the office is not being abolished there is no need to revoke the order as the transfers are taking place in the chain of transfers which I have outlined.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendments proposed by Senator Lee, the powers to which he refers will apply to all the library's functions including the Genealogical Office.  He referred to promoting and encouraging the granting of coats of arms.  I agree that facilitating and assisting should have assured the continuation of the function. However, I believed it was important, given the contributions that had been made and international perceptions, that the board was clearly seen to have a proactive role in this area and that it cannot be cut off as a branch, as Senator O'Toole suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the point thoughtfully made by Senator Lee in relation to functions and I will reflect on it before Report Stage.  However, if one is there to assist and the demand exists, is that not enough?  I have responded to those who claimed that this is something that should be promoted.  I am not hung up on it.  I believed I was addressing a point I was anxious to address <Col N="202" /> which is to end the outrageous suggestion that we had become a nation of philistines and there was a dark ideological plot afoot to destroy anything ancestral.  When historians look back on the correspondence they will find a comic character to some of the things that were written; some of it has less to do with the true intersection between heraldry and genealogy, as I as an independent scholar understand it, than with something that is much less than the scholarly understanding of heraldry.  Let that enigmatic statement resonate where it will.  With regard to practice, it is for future historians to look at the balance of practice and where did it always lie in the true connection between genealogy and heraldry.  That is the reason we had that word.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to the phrase &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo;.  This is simply to allow for changes of staff in the library through, for example, retirement or illness.  It is the usual usage.  It is not intended that the function would vary from day to day.  When I was selecting wording to denote that the person who is designated to perform the functions shall be a competent person, Senators raised the question of qualification.  There is one way of framing qualifications where a large number of staff could be excluded.  One might even raise a question about how many could be appointed.  There is also the question of competence; would one get that where one relies only on formal qualification?  My understanding is that a certain amount of craft and art of operation would have to be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Another point I noticed with regard to language was the provision whereby the person who carries out these functions shall use the appellation Chief Herald of Ireland.  The advantage is that rather than putting a cloak over a person, he or she should have an appellation. That was more than a touch of laying of hands and referred to exercising the function in a way that has credibility nationally and internationally in a scholarly way.  It was most beneficial to hear Senators' contributions on Second Stage and I have tried to respond to their good and illuminating points for which I am grateful.</P>
    <P>I will look into the question of &ldquo;as occasion requires&rdquo; with my legal advisers before Report Stage to see if it strengthens matters.  If it gives the impression of a less than full commitment, I will examine the wording.  The Senator can understand my difficulty.  I have a duty to protect the structures I establish.  If a cultural institution is established and the library board appoints a director, I have a duty to the public and the staff of the library, including the director.  It would be wrong to put the director of a national cultural institution in an ambiguous situation through lack of specificity.  We must ensure that, while there is flexibility, the function is crystal clear.</P>
    <P>On Senator Kelly's point as regards the Attorney General's office, the amendment recognises the existence of the Genealogical Office.  The basis for the award of coats of arms <Col N="203" /> for 1993 was a Government decision which the Attorney General's office advised me was a sufficient basis for the issue of coats of arms.  As the transfer of functions flows through the establishment of my Department and my responsibilities under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, I believe that the amendment stands up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for a comprehensive reply to the questions raised.  I have taken note of the question of &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; on behalf of Senator Norris.  The Minister's answer was convincing and I am sure Senator Norris will be happy with it.</P>
      <P>In tabling this amendment, the Minister is enshrining in legislation the continued existence of the Genealogical Office.  This is what we wanted to clarify.  Whatever problems may remain, that was the principal thrust of what we had to do.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to what the Minister said about management structure.  The Minister's vehement and convincing argument makes sense. There are other structures which make equal sense and this is not the only one required to ensure there is no ambiguity.  For instance, there could be a director in both institutions, each of which would be &ldquo;ar chomh leibhéal lena chéile&rdquo; and responsible to the board.  It is reassuring to learn that the word &ldquo;branch&rdquo; is in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  The Minister's advisers were quick to pick up on that important point.</P>
      <P>As regards the structure which the Minister outlined, I know that any proposed changes in management structure always cause unease for those in the institution involved.  I do not think this amendment will be universally accepted.  The Minister has said it is a clear structure, which it is.  He implies that the director of the National Library now becomes the boss of the Genealogical Office.  What needs to be added is that, as regards career structures, a future director of the National Library could come from the genealogical branch and progress upwards.  It is important that the director is responsible and there is clear accountability.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister's explanation of the difference between &ldquo;is&rdquo; and &ldquo;be&rdquo;.  It sounds logical but is incorrect.  The use of the word &ldquo;be&rdquo; does not imply the future.  If I said &ldquo;if that be the case&rdquo;, the Minister would know it was the present tense.  Usage has killed the subjunctive and &ldquo;is&rdquo; has become more acceptable in the present tense.  If the subjunctive was used where it should be one would often be accused of incorrect use of language.  &ldquo;Be&rdquo; is the correct grammatical use in this case.  I am prepared to accept the more common usage of &ldquo;is&rdquo; in this case.  I am surprised the Minister would stoop to such vulgar usage of language.  If this has to be written in the language of the <i>hoi polloi,</i> so be it. We are talking about accessibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> I ask the Minister to clarify another matter.  I met some of the people involved in this campaign.  They are people of the highest calibre who care about genealogical institutions and do not have hidden agendas.  As the Minister and Senator Mooney pointed out, some of them went over the top.  It is unfair to tar them all with the same brush.  I met decent people who were rightly concerned about the Genealogical Office and acted correctly and honourably in their dealings with me.  Their motivation, activity and methods of work were beyond reproach.  The Minister and I have often run campaigns.  We must take responsibility for those who go over the edge but that should not reflect on those running the campaign.</P>
    <P>We have now enshrined in legislation the continued existence of the Genealogical Office. The legislation also ensures the continuity of the Office of Chief Herald.  This can be achieved in a manner which will reflect well on our institutions. I support the Minister's position and would like to think further about the structures and the relationships.  I am grateful to the Minister for openly accepting the views of Senators on both sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's explanation and clarification of all the issues involved.  He has moved positively to reassure those of us who had concerns.</P>
      <P>In so far as I have a remaining concern, it would be for clarification of the implications of &ldquo;branch&rdquo;.  Does this mean the office cannot be closed down without major revision?  How does that ensure its continuing viability as a semi-independent entity within the National Library?</P>
      <P>The Minister did say, rather tantalisingly, that we could not be sure of the future, and that the Heritage Council was examining the matter.  Is there anything dangling there?  We wish to respond positively to the Minister's response to our concerns and thank him for the careful manner in which he and his officials have indicated they are moving.  However, we want to be clear that what will be decided here will last and that there could not be a change in the proposed structure without further Oireachtas consideration.  I do not know whether the Minister is in a position to give this type of commitment.  It would be helpful if he could say what he thinks about it.</P>
      <P>I would like to think that out of all this discussion, the main beneficiary will be the activity of genealogy in Ireland and that politicians, the public and scholars will have a heightened appreciation of the centrality of genealogy to our heritage.  I am prepared to withdraw my amendment in favour of the Minister's if that is desirable in the light of what the Minister said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply to the matters raised by Senator Lee.  The importance of &ldquo;branch&rdquo; as used in the Bill is that it would take amending <Col N="205" /> legislation to end it.  That is the connection with the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  If I used a different formulation of words which simply transferred without specifying it would be like any other activity.  However, it is strengthened by the reference.  Senator Lee referred to the future of genealogy.  I asked the Heritage Council to look at co-operation between the institutions and to see what each is able to provide.  This will make them more user friendly and will advance the practice and development of genealogy.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole made a good point.  Senator Mooney and I may have concentrated on one or two letters which are at the bizarre end of the spectrum.  I had a meeting with the staff of the cultural institutions at which I introduced and discussed the legislation in terms of how it would affect them.  My officials also met people who had an interest in particular functions which would be affected by the legislation.  That is as it should be. We would have to worry if people in the public service did not take an interest in their future. Who is more entitled to have an opinion on the best possible environment for advancing their practice than they?  They spoke for 90 per cent of those involved and it is not their fault if the more lurid contributions acquire more space.</P>
      <P>I have gone a long way in light of comments expressed on Second Stage.  Members will see that my amendments make the legislation clearer. They remove constructions, definitions and whatever and places the functions within a structure which has the benefit of clarity and accountability.  It establishes in primary legislation functions which did not have that benefit before.  It clearly mentions an appellation which had some confusion attached to it.  The only outstanding issue is whether one wants to separate the Genealogical Office from the library. I will not initiate a Second Stage debate on this, but that is the net effect of the amendment and what is outstanding between us.</P>
      <P>The Senator might consider withdrawing the amendment because I have gone a long way to give an establishment to the function.  If we set up a separate institution, break the link with library records, move it out of the context of librarianship and practice, we are left with the question of staff.  Staff will not be able to transfer to any other function.  They will not have a broad base of training and will not have the opportunities a large institution offers.  Senator O'Toole made the point that people should aspire to promotion to the top.  However, that is the other side of that argument.  I have gone as far as I can.</P>

      <P>There is a strong argument for keeping the Genealogical Office within the library.  I understand Senator Mooney's concerns but an isolated Genealogical Office would be in a difficult situation.  I do not believe anyone who contacted me on the subject supported the idea that it should be a separate stand alone institution.</P>

      <P>The Minister crystallised the difference between us.  It boils down to whether we create the Genealogical Office as a branch of the library or as a stand alone institution.  I appreciate the Minister has responded generously to the Second Stage debate.  He indicated he would reflect on that debate and this has crystallised into firm proposals which have strengthened section 13.  I would like to respond to the cue by Senator O'Toole which was picked up on by the Minister.  Given the media's possible perception of the controversy surrounding section 13 there could be a suggestion that those who have been consulting with and advising me on the specifics of genealogy, the workings of that office and on heraldry are not motivated by the highest ideals.  That would be grossly unfair and inaccurate.  I would like to compliment these people who work in this area.</P>
      <P>Whenever complex legislation is introduced I value the input of people who have a working expertise in the area which, in this instance, is genealogy and heraldry.  I appreciate their comments and am grateful to them for their input in framing amendments.  These people wish the position of Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer and the functions of the office to be in the best interests of genealogy.</P>
      <P>As Senator O'Toole said, when the Bill was first drafted the word &ldquo;abolish&rdquo; was mentioned. The international community assumed this would happen.  I would like to cite an example where a group of genealogists contacted me from Toronto, Canada.  They had seen information relating to the proposal in the original Bill on the Internet and had held meetings to discuss what they thought was an appalling development.  On questioning my informant in detail, I discovered they had no knowledge of the Second Stage debate which had been concluded.  The only information they received was on the Internet which indicated the Irish Government was going to abolish the Office of the Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer.  That may have led to much of the correspondence in the public arena.</P>

      <P>I never question the Chair's wisdom in these matters.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil believes there should be a separate State institution.  The Government had two choices and the Minister favoured one, which we do not enthusiastically embrace.  That is why these amendments were tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another school of thought suggests it is unacceptable that the historical position of Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer should be under the Director of the National Library.  I have scotched that argument because there must be one boss, as Senator O'Toole said.  If the Government's proposal is accepted, it will be impossible to operate.  Once the Director of the <Col N="207" /> National Library is given a mandate by the board, somebody in that structure, because of a perceived status, could feel they are separate or above accountability and cannot be touched.  I cannot sustain that argument in the context of the Minister's proposals.  The staff of the National Library have no objections to this management structure, which is also an important consideration.</P>
    <P>The seal of the Genealogical Office, which was created in 1943, is important in the legal context of the granting of arms.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that role of the Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer.  During my earlier contribution I said that successive Governments from 1922 to 1943 would have abolished this office if given the opportunity.  In 1941, during a discussion with the Irish Government about the future function of the Ulster King of Arms following the death of Sir Neville Wilkinson, the then UK Ambassador to Ireland insisted that the functions of the Ulster King of Arms should be transferred to London.  As far as the Irish Government was concerned, the retention of the records was the most crucial aspect of the debate. If the British Government wished to take away the title, the Irish Government had no objection. It continued:</P>
    <P>In all circumstances we are lucky to get the original documents.  They constitute the chief Irish element in the whole affair and it might just be as well to allow them to take away the title of Ulster which has now no holder in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, Ulster's title was annexed to that of Norrey, King of Arms, in London.  The new officer was styled Norrey and Ulster and was empowered to deal with any work which might come to him from Irish citizens preferring to deal with London rather than Dublin.  In February 1943 both Governments agreed that the transfer of the office would be formally effected on 1 April of that year.  Furthermore, the office would&mdash;</P>
    <P>continue to discharge under Irish administration the functions which it has hitherto carried out in relation to the grant of arms, tracing of genealogies, etc.  Certain of the duties personal to the Ulster King of Arms will be provided for in London.  The records and contents are to be taken over but such copies of documents as the British Government may from time to time require will be supplied to them.</P>
    <P>Mr. Thomas Sadlier, the Registrar appointed as acting Ulster King of Arms following the death of Sir Neville Wilkinson &mdash; that title was not given to him &mdash; was given until April to clear up unfinished business and to ensure that the arrears of payments to Ulster's office, which had mounted since 1922, were repaid to the Treasury in Britain.  He was also responsible for selecting <Col N="208" /> the documents to be considered.  Meanwhile, the Irish Government began to make arrangements for the future administration of the office, not of the title.  The issue of separation seems to arise from a misinterpretation of the historical realities surrounding the setting up of the Genealogical Office in 1943.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight the uniqueness of the office and its continuing importance to those working in the field of genealogy who avail of its services. It may be difficult to implement this proposal in the long term.  There is a view that those seeking information will find all the answers in the Genealogical Office.  However, they must also visit the National Archives and other such places. There is a lack of cohesion which this Bill will not address.  I appreciate the Minister's commitment to refer the functions of the Genealogical Office and the Chief Herald to the heritage committee. I hope a chief herald and genealogical Bill will be introduced in this House in the near future.</P>
    <P>Those are the reasons for the difference between the Minister and I.  Genealogists believe that the proper functioning of the office will be best served by a separate institution.  It is in that context that I tabled these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed this matter in great detail.  While listening to the discussion on Committee Stage, I read the opinion of Mr. John A. Costello, Príomh Aturnae to the Government, of 1 February 1929 and it is consistent with what Senator Mooney has said. He said he was clearly of the opinion that the office was to be taken over by the Irish Government.  I also looked at the functions of the Keeper of the Book of Pedigrees and in relation to the Order of St. Patrick, which I dealt with on another occasion.  It is useful we have put it in context.</P>
      <P>An issue has been raised outside the House about the Chief Herald acting on behalf of the Government.  Should the Oireachtas decide by statute, there is no difficulty in a body other than central Government carrying out executive functions of Government, if the granting of arms were regarded as such.  For example, the National Treasury Management Agency has a debt servicing function to benefit Irish people; this is an executive function carried out by a State agency on behalf of the Government.  However, I emphasise that everything should be clear and the legislation, whether one is in favour or against the principle of it, has the merit of clarity on all matters discussed.</P>
      <P>There is no difficulty keeping the seal.  The 1943 Government decision allowing the granting of arms provided for a seal for the office and the Attorney General's Office has advised me that this is not affected by the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What stands between us is the issue of a Genealogical Office separate from the library and this is why I cannot accept Senator Mooney's amendments.  He has made his case and there has been great discussion as to whom the <Col N="209" /> Genealogical Office will report.  Its staff is from the National Library and my understanding is that the head of the library is also head of the office.  That is one option.  The other option is to cut the link with the library and have a separate institution with resources and staff.  I do not expect Senator Mooney to withdraw his amendments on this basis, but I argue that this Bill regulating the cultural institutions, in so far as I have consulted with the Heritage Council on the future of genealogical functions, practice and research, has the capacity to allow the office to become autonomous in the future should it so wish.  At this stage, the model I suggest of a clearly defined and statutorily based office within the library is the best one.  I therefore cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>The 1943 order transferred the office to the Department of Education, who in turn entrusted it to the National Library.  The status of the Department of Education in relation to the Genealogical Office has been a source of some debate.  The Minister is correct when he says all the staff are from the National Library. There does not seem to have been any official transfer since 1943 from the Department of Education.  This has created confusion in the minds of those who believe that, as the Department of Education is still legally in charge of the Genealogical Office, there should be no difficulty setting up the office as an institution separate to the National Library.</P>

      <P>Between now and Report Stage, I will look at any possible confusion that might arise relating to the transfer of functions, because, if I might paraphrase Shakespeare, when it is done, it will be done and there will be no doubts after.  It would be nightmarish to envisage a situation where an autonomous institution was responsible for education and genealogy and the National Library was accountable to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  In practice, the Genealogical Office, its funding and staff are regarded as transferring with the library.  The order to which the Senator refers is interesting because it was silent on that point.  The good news for the Senator and the public is that the Bill, if enacted, will supersede the order.  Should there be the slightest sliver of ambiguity between now and Report Stage, I will examine it further.</P>

I have considered the point made by Senator Fitzgerald.  If one were to include the Irish language in a list such as that in section 12(2), it would separate it to some extent from other functions.  I see responsibility for the language to be contained in all the functions, for example:</P>
      <P>(a) to facilitate, encourage, assist and promote the carrying out of research in the Library,</P>
      <P>The act of research will include the Irish language.  One could continue:</P>
      <P>to arrange for the provision of a library and information service for members of the public,</P>
      <P>That provision includes an obligation to the Irish language.  If there were a separate listing, it would seem to me to lessen the burden of duty to the Irish language across all the functions.  Section 12(2)(e) is the most important one:</P>
      <P>(e) to foster and promote the Library as an integral part of the national culture,</P>
      <P>No construction could be put on that other than a clear commitment to the language.</P>

      <P>I must be careful not to breach the fundamental principle in my political practice of recognising the autonomy of institutions.  I am responsible for the legislation and for arguing the case to Government, while the board is responsible for best practice.  It is adequately covered elsewhere in the Bill that the board should provide a service to the public.  For example, Senator Lee has tabled an amendment to section 29 stating that the staff, for which the board is responsible, &ldquo;should normally be competent in the Irish language as well as English&rdquo;.  That is a step further because at it stands section 29 states that:</P>
      <P>The board shall ensure that an adequate service is available in both Irish and English to the public.</P>
      <P>We will look at Senator Lee's amendment to section 29 when we come to it.  It is understood that it would be an adequate service but we can deal with that in section 29.</P>
      <P>Those who, like myself, speak Irish regularly, and native speakers, must make their minds up on whether they are confident enough that the advancement of Irish and bi-lingualism can be handled in general provisions or whether it needs to be continually separated out at the end of the list.

Why can it not be &ldquo;to foster and promote the Irish language and all literature written in Irish&rdquo;?  It is a simple point but it would be a recognition that we are Irish and our first language is Irish.  I am not a master of the language; my Irish is purely conversational and I get bogged down when I try to speak Irish on Bills.  It might be superfluous in legislation like this which deals with culture and heritage, but the Bill should put an onus on those who run the National Library to promote and foster the Irish language.

      <P>Section 12(2)(e) states that the board shall have power &ldquo;to foster and promote the library as an integral part of the national culture&rdquo;.  It is quite serious to acknowledge through a separate reference that commitment to the Irish language is not a crucial component of the national culture.  I am not running down Senator Fitzgerald's point but I would ask him to bear that in mind.  I can examine this before Report Stage to see if it is necessary or <Col N="212" /> appropriate but I do not believe it is.  I am not interested in tokenism in relation to the Irish language, nor am I suggesting that is what Senator Fitzgerald has in mind.  In the past, references were made to Irish at the end of something because there was no commitment in the main provisions to its incorporation as normal practice.  These are the kind of considerations that one must bear in mind.</P>
      <P>We have passed the crossroads as far as the language is concerned.  Some of those in favour of bi-lingualism are tolerant as well as a small number who are intolerant, while another group is intolerant against the Irish language and feels it is not dying fast enough.  That group represents a kind of shoneenism or anti-náisiúnachas element.  Good luck to everybody but I am only responsible for legislation.  National culture is inclusive of the long history and rich contribution of the Irish language and what divides us is how best that can be included.  I believe the formulation is right and while I have no difficulty in looking at it again, in truth, I doubt if my argument will change.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (2) (a), line 43, after &ldquo;times&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and in so doing, the Board shall take specific cognisance of the needs of users nationally as well as locally,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that adequate attention is paid to the needs of the users of the museum or library who must travel substantial distances.  The opening and closing hours are very relevant to how much work they can get done or what use they can make of the premises.  Owing to lack of resources the National Library has had to change opening times over the years.  Its opening hours from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. have been amended so that it now sometimes opens at 2 p.m. and at other times closes at 5 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one is travelling long distances, the time one has in Dublin to get one's work done is of great importance.  Many research students, etc., who must travel long distances to Dublin find that the library's opening hours do not allow them to get as much work done as they would if they were living closer to the city.  Decisions on opening hours do not take adequate account of the <Col N="215" /> implications for such users.  National, not local, considerations should be kept in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with Senator Lee's point on usage.  He makes the correct case for taking into account the needs of those who must travel long distances and who require the facility of appropriate hours.  This is a matter for the board.  However, I am sympathetically disposed towards a later amendment on users' councils which may deal with such issues because it can most appropriately address different kinds of needs.  However, a statutory constraint on the board is not the best way to proceed, even in the interest of the users.  It would be preferable to handle it through the use of advisory committees.</P>
      <P>There is a paradoxical aspect to people's suggestions on these matters.  I have decided on autonomy.  People tell me they are in favour of this approach but they then proceed to tell me what I should tell those with autonomy to do.  I have a great deal of trust in the autonomous boards which will come into existence.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney suggests that admission charges should not be applied generally and I understand that his corrected amendment provides for this, except in the circumstances he suggests.  Again, it is better to leave a certain freedom to the boards.  Imposing a general admissions charge would require ministerial consent.  This is enough of a break in terms of the accountability that is required.</P>
      <P>People should not take one side or the other on this argument.  I am pronounced in my own thinking regarding the status of institutions and the formative citizenship of people, which is one thing but then there is a separate way in which one must approach the balancing of income from the State and other sources.  It is best to allow the boards freedom in this area.  However, where they would be driven to make a proposal they would have to obtain ministerial consent.  This is a better way to proceed, than stating <i>simpliciter</i> that they may not do something except that which is set out in the amendment.  I am, therefore, not accepting it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the Minister's indication that he is prepared to consider sympathetically the idea of users' councils or advisory committees, which are ways in which the issue may be approached more effectively, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.  However, it is an important issue.  It is far more important for users than many of the other matters which are important from our viewpoint or the producer's.  Regardless of how good is the museum or library, it is not much use to those who must use them if they cannot spend as much time in them as they wish.  Research students are at the coalface in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agonised over amendment No. 13.  The points made by the Minister are well made.  Either autonomy is given to boards under legislation or they are nobbled in some way. However, the question of admission charges is a separate and important issue.  The Minister and I can disagree on whether dealing with this matter by statute would preclude either board from introducing such charges.  The Minister advises that these charges would not be introduced in any event without his consent.  I accept this and have no doubt that it is an acceptable way forward.</P>
      <P>However, I am concerned about granting a power, irrespective as to whether it must be referred to a Minister, which could be implemented on the grounds of viability.  For example, it could be stated by either board that because they are not getting enough money from the Government they must impose admission charges.  The then Minister, being a politician, although I absolve the current Minister from this line of thinking, could view that as an easy way out which would save him from having to find another £15,000 or £25,000 for the National Library or the National Museum.  He could risk public opprobrium as he would not be in the line of fire, rather the board would be criticised for introducing such charges and they would be regarded as social pariahs.  That is my main reason for proceeding with this amendment.</P>
      <P>My second reason is that library books are subjected to a charge.  Any librarian will say that the introduction and continuance of the library charge has directly resulted in a reduced level of reading.  Surprisingly, this has not occurred among the element of the population who can ill afford the charge because they are, in the main, very aware of the value of books and attempt to ensure their children have access to them. Strangely, the well heeled classes who can afford the charge will not pay it.  I will not go into the argument of whether that is right because I am only discussing the cause and effect.  If an admission charge to two of our major cultural institutions would result in a reduction in the number of visitors, I would be very concerned. We would then have the worst of two worlds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In framing the amendment, I left open the possibility, to which the Minister alluded, of either board creating charges for activities within the buildings themselves.  As the Minister said, such activities would relate to exhibitions or other functions.  It is quite legitimate to do that because of the cost, time and effort involved in arranging exhibitions, seminars and other activities.  I am <Col N="217" /> not going to promote it but there is a case for a charge in such circumstances.  I am specifically against introducing entry charges to the National Library and the National Museum but I am not against the imposition of fees or charges for any service within those institutions.</P>
    <P>The entrance figure to the National Gallery, which has the highest throughput of visitors of any institution, is over 750,000 people.</P>

      <P>There is a great deal of merit in what Senator Mooney said.  It is not an issue of autonomy as such.  I do not think the Minister thinks so either or else he would not have the words &ldquo;subject to the consent of the Minister&rdquo; at the end of the paragraph.  Boards ought to have autonomy in the internal running of the institutions.  This is a matter of public policy which goes way beyond the competence of the board of any particular institution.  Therefore, there ought to be a direction from the Oireachtas on what is appropriate in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is right for us to debate it.  I have great sympathy with the principle enunciated by Senator Mooney.  It would be useful if the Minister said he was prepared to think further about it in the light of this discussion.  We all need to think more about this serious, constructive proposal towards which I am very sympathetic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to be an amenable as I can on this matter because it is a multi-faceted one.  Through nobody's fault, the amendment I heard today is different from the one which was circulated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome an opportunity between now and Report Stage to look at the principle involved.</P>
      <P>If an autonomous board is serving under a direction that it shall only do something in certain circumstances, one must ask if it is the best way to do that.  The legislation is specifying the activities in which a certain autonomy is exercised.  At the same time, I take the point made by Senator Mooney and others that a national cultural institution, as I said, has a crucial role in relation to citizens as distinct from tourists, and I must think about how this would be best handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I drafted the Bill the conclusion was that it involved a policy decision but the person who should answer for the policy was the Minister of the day.  If a national cultural institution decided it was going to use this as an opportunity to make a case for charges, that Minister would come under pressure, and rightly so.  Is that the best mechanism?  If, on the other hand, there was a conscious prohibition in the legislation and the <Col N="218" /> board decided to impose charges, the legislation would have to be amended by the Oireachtas.  Is such a heavy measure required?  Those choices and options must be balanced.</P>
    <P>I was happy enough with the idea that the board, having decided in regard to revenue generation that it would have a policy of admission charges, would have return to the Minister.  In the spirit of us all trying to achieve the best balance, I agree to look at it between now and Report Stage.  However, I have achieved as much of a balance as I can.  While I want to be able, as Senators have asked me, to allow these boards to enjoy autonomy and flexibility, I do not want to be intrusive to the point of specifying conditions after prohibition.  However, I will see if there is a way in which I can meet the points which were made.</P>

      <P>This should be a matter of national policy.  I do not believe a board should be given the right to introduce admission charges to those institutions.  It has nothing to do with autonomy or spancelling, nobbling or inhibiting the functions of the board.  I am merely making a simple, clear statement of fact that I believe, as Senator Lee said, the Oireachtas should send out a message that there should be free admission to these great national cultural institutions for anyone who wishes to visit them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that he will reflect on this issue before Report Stage.  This is worthwhile.  Perhaps he could consider inserting a restriction which would not include an entry charge to the institution under section 12 in relation to the functions or the conferring of additional functions on the boards.  The issue merits consideration.  They are new boards and certain expenses and overheads will be involved.  This will require the boards to examine possibilities of raising funds.  I understand they have other ways to do that and this power is conferred on them in relation to the reproduction of various items which can be sold within their establishments.  Perhaps the boards could focus more heavily on promoting and raising funds in that way.</P>

      <P>Apart from my earlier points about Senator Mooney's amendment, distinctions are not drawn in it.  These merit consideration between now and Report Stage.  For example, a tourist's relationship with one of the institutions is different from a citizen's relationship while a dependent school child's relationship is different from that of an income earner.  I am willing to consider the Senator's suggestion&mdash;that no charge should ever apply to anybody except in certain circumstances&mdash;between now and Report Stage to try to achieve a balance.  This must not be just between the autonomy of the board and the public as expressed through the will of Government but also in terms of how best the public can be served by such assurances.  If there is discomfort about the power lying with the Minister by way of approval, I will consider how the ministerial approval can be extended to cover the point made by the Senator about access.  I will examine the matter between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister.  He was not labouring the point but my perception was that he had not had time to reflect fully on the amendment because of the manner in which it was worded.  I also accept that its intention might be clearer.  However, we are discussing two specific cultural institutions and providing a framework which will allow the board to develop and grow, and hopefully generate significant sums of money, over and above sums the Government will give it, to ensure its continuing viability.  I adopted a commercial approach to the matter. The figure, which the Minister kindly corrected, of over one million people visiting the National Gallery in a country with a population of three and a half million is astonishing.  This figure is growing because our tourism market is burgeoning.  More people are visiting the country each year than are living in it.</P>
      <P>When people go on holiday they are not given to spending their days wandering around institutions such as national libraries.  I am an exception because I do so but the general mass of people who go on package holidays or go away for two weeks are not that way inclined.  People are usually budget conscious and there are many other attractions available.  The Minister mentioned the number of tourists visiting Ireland; there are an enormous number of counter-attractions for them.  The Minister alluded to the attitude of successive Governments when he mentioned a legislative quagmire or words to that effect.</P>

      <P>If Governments have not taken a lead in this regard, how can we expect citizens to be suddenly inculcated with a love of culture, libraries and museums?  The boards should be in a position to attract as many bodies as possible into the institutions without charge.  Once they <Col N="220" /> are in, they should try to get as much money as possible from them.  In the context of many of the points made in relation to section 11, we are hoping the various boards will develop money spinning ideas.  All libraries, museums and cultural institutions around the world do this.</P>
      <P>If people are charged even a nominal entry fee, it will be a psychological barrier.  We should ensure as many people as possible visit these institutions.  The amendment will ensure charges are not introduced.  Entry charges to these two cultural institutions are not the way forward.  I accept the Minister's point about examining the issue between now and Report Stage and I will withdraw my amendment on that basis.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the point raised by other Members for which Senator Mooney is probably searching in relation to a form of deposit and a certain archive.  I will deal with that point later.  Section 16 provides that the respective collections of the museum and library are in general to be held in repositories authorised in the First Schedule.  The primary purpose behind the repository concept is to discipline the loading of objects for their protection by providing that objects should not be removed from repositories except for stated reasons set out in statute.  There is no intention to differentiate between exhibition and storage areas, nor to make distinctions in the standard of accommodation.</P>
      <P>The First Schedule designates the core buildings of the National Museum and the National Library, erected as a consequence of the Dublin Science and Art Museum Act, 1877. Designation, by order, of premises other than those listed in the Schedule as authorised repositories and amendment or revocation of such orders is provided for, so it is envisaged that other libraries in the same building as Collins' Barracks, such as the National Library of Photographic Art, will be designated as repositories under this procedure.  That is what is involved in the First Schedule.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that matter.  There might be some merit in either board designating a special status to libraries or institutions holding nationally important collections to ensure accessibility, protection and full registration or listing.  My informants tell me that there is a similar provision under the National Archives Act, 1986, in respect of places of deposit.  Perhaps the Minister is aware of that.  What is suggested here is that the board would be allowed to designate places of deposit other than those which are in the Schedule as the occasion would arise.</P>

      <P>What I am providing for is scheduled as I have described it.  The force of the legislation will apply to the buildings.  I am not dealing here with another issue which deserves separate consideration which is in relation to the registration of other places.  It is a separate issue and I am very sympathetic towards it where it arises.  The issue is how to assure the greatest access but at the same time meet the requirements of conservation, security and capacity to exhibit to a standard.  We will come to this issue, but here we are talking about the specification of buildings to which legislation applies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (5), line 6, to delete &ldquo;may, at its discretion,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall, from time to time,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the boards are required to diffuse knowledge of human life in Ireland throughout the rest of the State.  The phrase &ldquo;may, at its discretion&rdquo; is a very relaxed formulation for achieving the objectives specified earlier in sections 11 and 12.  If these are the objectives, it is very difficult to see how it can achieve any or all of them without being obliged from time to time to go down the country.</P>
      <P>It looks like a very cumbersome amendment because I do not see how one can oblige the board to go into Northern Ireland if nobody there wants it.  It can hardly be obliged to do that but such a judgment could be left to its own discretion.  However, as far as diffusing knowledge within the State is concerned, there seems to be a logical sequence from the principles and functions enunciated earlier to say it shall do so from time to time, which is a reasonable formulation.</P>

      <P>My reluctance to accept Senator Lee's amendments &mdash; Senators will note that I have been receptive to a number of <Col N="222" /> suggestions &mdash; is that if we use the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; it could lend to a construction that this shall happen irrespective of the other needs of the institution which may, for example, be conservation or the need to research a crucial area.  It could end up, though I am sure this is not what Senator Lee intends, that exhibition is deemed to be compulsory irrespective of what crucial tasks have to be performed at the National Library. That was the reason why I chose the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Senator, who says that the interpretation of &ldquo;may&rdquo; could in turn appear to be so weak as not to give it the strength that the legislation needs.  How does one deal with these two possible interpretations?  The matter is resolved in terms of the degree of trust one is willing to have in the board and the quality of its members.  I will look at it in the spirit in which the argument is developed.  In order that I do not mislead the Senator, I should say that at the moment my conviction is &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the better word because it comes down in favour of a board that sees its functions and has its objects and purposes expressed in a previous part of the legislation.  One must trust it to do this rather than making it compulsory.  That is the thinking that led me to use the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I will try to see whether there is a balance between &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but at present I am in favour of using the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I take note of what the Minister said.  My amendment uses the words &ldquo;shall from time to time&rdquo; which were intended to accommodate a situation where there would be pressure on resources at various times.  It does not suggest compulsion on an annual or monthly basis.  I was taking cognisance of the point the Minister has quite rightly made.  Under section 11, the principal functions of the board include the increase and diffusion, in and outside the State, of knowledge of human life in Ireland.  This ought to be central to the board's activities in the light of section 11.  How one does it at any given moment is a matter of judgment, but to say that it may go outside Dublin at its discretion seems to me to be weakening the intent and the purpose of section 11.  I appreciate that the Minister is prepared to look at it again but I hope he will use &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or some alternative phraseology, Shakespearean or otherwise, as a way of impressing on the board that this is the Minister's desire and the desire of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>My reason for proposing the deletion of section 18 (1) (g) is in a way taking up the point about autonomy.  The board may lend subject to a number of considerations, and after seeking the opinion of the Heritage Council.  If <Col N="223" /> the board is supposed to know anything it is supposed to know its business about the library materials under its control.  Why does it have to seek the opinion of the Heritage Council when there are six other preconditions already including impressive researches to do with the physical conditions, the risk to library material and whether a loan will be inconsistent?  Why is another layer of opinion required to enable it to reach an informed decision on a business about which I presume it is deemed to be the best authority?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot have it both ways in this world, although that is the aspiration of many people.  If an institution takes a decision, it leaves itself open to the construction that it took the decision within the framework of its own institutional experience without taking a broader context into account.  The Heritage Council, now established autonomously on a statutory basis, has a very wide remit.  It could, for example, take the views of a local group of people or a local authority into account and it is there to balance the national institution review against other views; it is accepting the suggestion that the national institution review may not be the totality of the national view.  There might be a regional or local view which dissents.  That is the reason for the Heritage Council's role in so far as it is perfectly reasonable.  I can see where their role fits in but that was the thinking behind it.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee's suggestion is to delete that role. Senators must remember that they are listed as one source of opinion.  Surely it is consistent with Senator Lee's stated aspiration for regionalism and a truly national impact and that their view would be taken into account.  In offering an opinion on loans the Heritage Council is consistent with equivalent provisions in respect of its roles in relation to the museum.  That is why I cannot accept amendment No. 17.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (2) (d), line 15, to delete &ldquo;State&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Dublin area&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose behind these amendments will be clear.  Amendment No. 18 states &ldquo;to delete &lsquo;State&rsquo; and substitute &lsquo;Dublin area&rdquo;&rsquo;.  From a user's point of view there can be, and is, a copy of the same book in Trinity College Library, the National Library and the Royal Irish Academy but there may be no other copy of that book in the entire State.  Therefore the word &ldquo;State&rdquo; may give a misleading indication of the accessibility and availability of that book.  If there is a copy in Cork that is no reason for getting rid of a copy in Dublin.  On the whole, there is more access in Dublin to most things, but if there is a copy of something in Galway, Limerick or Cork, then it would not be sufficient reason to say it is a &ldquo;duplicate or replica of other material in the collection of another institution in the State&rdquo;, and to get rid of it from the National Library.  I am not saying this would be done but it would be allowed by the phraseology here.</P>
      <P>Section 18 (2) (e) would permit getting rid of material that &ldquo;does not relate to Ireland&rdquo;.  That is far too sweeping.  &ldquo;Does not relate to Ireland&rdquo; could be defined as meaning there is no reference to Ireland in it.  However, the subject matter, the treatment, the methodology, the learning potential for someone working on the same subject in Ireland could be considerable.  So the wording &ldquo;does not relate to Ireland&rdquo; raises big questions about what is of service to Irish researchers even on Ireland.  In a lot of current academic activity the comparative perspective is loaded or is urged.  Some of the best insights into the study of Irish society can be derived from the study of other societies by people who may never have heard of Ireland.  Nevertheless, Irish readers may derive a great deal of benefit from that type of work.  The wording of section 18 (2) (e) appears too loose and too sweeping.  If my formulation was accepted it would reconcile the decision making in the library with the functions and powers in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 21 relates to the disposing of library material, and again the Dublin/non-Dublin distinction arises although in a contrary direction to what we were talking about previously.  It tries to impress on the board the national responsibility and not simply the local one.  I have already said that there should be an opportunity for institutions elsewhere in the country to acquire material if they so wish before it is sent abroad, even if a copy is held in a Dublin institution.  These amendments were drafted to get a level playing field in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I have an understanding and a certain amount of sympathy with Senator Lee's aspiration in this regard.  However, what surprises me, and I was waiting for the Senator to expand his contribution a little, is why not fall in line with my amendment in relation to subsection (e)?  I am suggesting that this be deleted in its entirety. I come at this from a different point of view to Senator Lee and I have no doubt that in granting these functions to the boards of the library and the museum it could be a poison chalice.  For example, because of lack of space, staff, under-resourcing and under-financing many of our priceless objects are currently stored in a haphazard manner in both the museum and the library.  When these boards are set up and start to go through much of the material which they have, some of it, through time or neglect or both, may have to be disposed of.  This will not be because a decision was taken on their lack of intrinsic value but because they may no longer be viable as cultural objects.</P>
      <P>We are giving both boards power to decide that if something does not relate to Ireland, they can dispose of it after due consideration in any way they wish.  I can see the headlines already: &ldquo;Priceless Irish Heirlooms to be Burned by the National Library or Museum&rdquo;.  It will be like the distortion surrounding our discussions earlier on section 13.  Human nature being what it is, some cub reporter with little else to do but ferret out stories with a hint of the truth will write this.  A sub-editor will say it is a great story and he can put a dramatic headline to it.</P>
      <P>This subsection should be deleted.  There is still sufficient power for the board to dispose of something but if it is given this power and it is criticised for diposing of material it will state that it has the statutory right to do this.  There will be administrative and public relations elements that may become disastrous and deflect from the real work of this section.</P>

      <P>The proposed deletion of subsection (e) might be construed as unnecessarily narrow and chauvinistic, suggesting we do not want this foreign material.  It can sometimes be quite problematic to determine to what extent articles relate to this country.  Is a very fine Chippendale chair originating in 18th century London but in one of the great Irish houses since its manufacture being construed as Irish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could say the same about a book.  Is a book written by someone who is not Irish and the <Col N="226" /> subject matter of which is not Irish but which has been in an Irish collection since the time of its printing to be regarded as non-Irish?  This slightly chauvinistic feeling which may attach to this subsection is worrying although it is not the Minister's intention.</P>
    <P>Subsection (c) states: &ldquo;printed matter, a copy of which may be made by the Board, whether by photographic or other means, or&rdquo;.  I welcome that but should it not extend beyond printed matter? Among the important collections the library may have are manuscripts.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify if these are included and if not, he might include it in an amendment of his own on Report Stage or accept one from me.</P>
    <P>The Yeats family has been extremely generous to the library in giving materials which are not printed but holograph.  There are also collections of letters, particularly those to, from, by and about James Joyce.  This brings up the matter of the disposal of these kinds of materials.  I would not like us to be placed again in the position we were put in by Stephen Joyce, the grandson of James Joyce.  He acquired a number of letters from the library which had been left to it by the late Paul Léon and indicated he was going to destroy these on the grounds that they were personal.  I understand a desire to retain privacy over a period of years but to distribute materials out of collections in this manner is grossly wrong and should not be done.  This concern should be met and in future the library should not find itself in such a position.  It was extremely embarrassing and resented internationally by Joyceans because of Stephen Joyce's attitude.</P>
    <P>I welcome amendment No. 22, which states:</P>
    <P>...&ldquo;(3) Before disposing of any library material under subsection (2), the Board shall publish a notice in Iris Oifigiúil and in at least two national newspapers stating its intention to dispose of library material pursuant to this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This should be teased out.  Can the Minister indicate the purpose of this?</P>
    <P>If this information is published in a newspaper, is it intended to give Irish institutions the opportunity to bid for them, request them for retention in this country or is it merely a question that the library, for reasons of space, is sharpening its focus on particular collections and bits and pieces are no longer germane?  There may be other collections in the State which would welcome this material.  I hope this is intended to allow such acquisition by other bodies but this is not provided for in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with a point made by Senator Mooney, the provision only applies to the library.  The museum cannot dispose of anything.  Amendment No. 22 goes some way towards addressing some of the concerns and I do not want to brush any of them aside.  It was for interested individuals or institutions to put views or suggestions to the board on the proposed manner of disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> Senator Lee suggested that in disposing of material the board should give first refusal to appropriate institutions outside the Dublin area. I am sympathetic to his idea of more than one source even if we cannot manage a regional representation, which might be unrealistic in most matters.  There should be a bipolar development, which I favour.  I am prepared to consider some provision in this area and will see how I can accommodate it while being fair to the board of the institution.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the proposal.  I am inclined to accept Senator Mooney's amendment which proposes to delete subsection (2) (e).  Thinking about it in the course of the debate there is a ring to the paragraph which I do not like.  It might make the provision too easy to apply to material that does not relate to Ireland.</P>
    <P>However, a word of caution should be borne in mind.  I voice it as an inveterate hoarder of books and papers.  When I was preparing the National Archives legislation I consulted a senior librarian who told me to remind Members of the Oireachtas of the distinction between the National Archives and the national attic.  My own house resembles an attic in which paper is hoarded.  I do not wish to cause offence to several international institutions but there is material that can be disposed of without causing great hurt to the national consciousness while giving more space to staff.  We must be careful that we give discretion to the board to get rid of material.</P>
    <P>I hope Senator Lee will accept that it might be cleaner to delete &ldquo;(e) does not relate to Ireland.&rdquo; rather than relate it to the functions which is a type of conditional tie on the wording.  I am inclined to accept the amendment that suggests the deletion of paragraph (e).</P>

      <P>The Senator's version of the famous visit, if I can call it that, is one for which I have sympathy.  I have heard the versions from both principles regarding the Leon papers.  The issue is interesting.</P>
      <P>I did not think in terms of danger to manuscripts.  There is a distinction between having printed material of which there is a copy and manuscripts.  It is not suggested to extend danger to manuscripts and imperil them by making a copy of them.  That is not intended.  I can come back to this point in detail on Report Stage.  I will examine the question of a copy made of a manuscript and a printed alternative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is looking at this from a slightly different point of view although his comments are valuable.  The Bill gives wide <Col N="228" /> powers for disposal of material but does not draw a distinction between printed material and manuscript material.  There is no absolute prohibition on the disposal of manuscript material.  Should there be a recurrence of the regrettable Paul Leon case in which autographed letters were disposed of, although I do not wish to confine it to that case, and should it be determined by the board to dispose of such items, I hope the board would keep a photographic or other type of copy.  There might be more than one copy of a book but there probably will not be more than one copy of a manuscript item unless the library goes to the trouble of photographing the manuscript before it is disposed of.  I accept the Minister's indication that it is unlikely that this circumstance could recur but it might.</P>

It is a judicious decision and in the spirit of this discussion.  I am pleased with the Minister's amendment which goes some distance towards meeting my concerns and I am encouraged that he will think further about a better way of achieving the objective we have in common.  The Minister was a practising academic and is aware of the difficulties for academics outside Dublin.  There is little realisation among people who live close to institutions of the difficulties for people who must travel long distances to those institutions.  It is similar perhaps to the differences between Members from Dublin constituencies and Members from constituencies outside Dublin.  It is easy to forget the problems of people who must travel.</P>

    <P>I thank the Minister for accepting the amendment.  He might emphasise, in the context of this debate, that the library board be given the right to dispose of material under specific and rigorous conditions.  It costs money to keep, preserve, conserve and catalogue every item in the library and the director and the board must be permitted to make informed decisions about duplicate copies of low grade material.  I do not wish that the section, as amended by the deletion of paragraph (e), should give the impression that the library will start a flurry of activity to dispose of material.

In that regard it is useful to take into account the broader view of the Heritage Council.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(b)  1 shall be appointed in accordance with subsection (8).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have expressed my unease at the manner in which the nominees from the Royal Dublin Society and the Royal Irish Academy were to be selected by the Minister from a list supplied by these institutions.  If these institutions are invited <Col N="230" /> to make nominations and if it is worthwhile that they have representatives on the board of the museum and library, they should be deemed to be the best judges of who those people ought to be.  If their judgment is not trusted in that respect, I am unclear as to why they should be asked to submit nominations.  Members of these societies will know what names have been submitted.  The Minister is then put in the potentially invidious position of making a selection among people who are presumably highly qualified and of some public standing.  Any decision made will be divisive within those institutions and among the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Given that the Minister solely appoints the vast majority of members of both boards, it cannot be said that he does not know the make-up of these boards.  It is undesirable that a decision which should be made in a constructive spirit of cooperation between these major organisations ought to have this potential element of friction and disagreeableness.  I am not saying the Minister's decision would not be Solomonic at all times.  However, if one is giving a vote of confidence to the institutions to make the nominations, in a sense one is passing a vote of no confidence in their ability to choose the best person.  That is inherently contradictory.  For a small gain, if it is one from the Minister's point of view, the procedure envisaged is cumbersome, potentially divisive and will cause more damage than it will give assistance to the institutions involved.</P>

      <P>The atmosphere is cooperative and constructive rather than laden with tension.  As I said on Second Stage, the preparations for this legislation were lengthy. There was consultation and agreement between the RIA and the RDS.  Because the agreements of 1881 and 1890, to which I referred on Second Stage, were legal, I was advised to enter into a legal agreement with both institutions, which I did recently.  My proposals in the legislation are by agreement with both institutions and are consistent with the legal agreements I have signed with them.</P>

      <P>The Minister is accountable and carries the can in relation to policy.  He is nominated a Member of the Cabinet and that is voted on by the Dáil, to which he is elected by the people.  If a Member is elected by the public, it does not mean he is disadvantaged.  Senator Mooney would like to see a link by Statute with the Library Association of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> The amendments set out by Professor Lee are at variance with my written agreements with the RIA and the RDS concerning their future roles in the museum and library.  These agreements amend their specific agreements of 1881 and 1890.  I would have to tear up the legal agreements with both bodies.  Specific provisions on their roles and the creation of the boards are included as an integral part of the agreements into which they have both entered.</P>
    <P>These aspects of the agreements are faithfully reflected in the proposed statute arrangements.  I am giving statutory effect to what I agreed.  I am satisfied that these arrangements are in the interests of all concerned and are consistent with the view that as far as possible, all members of the board should be appointed by the Minister of the day and should serve in a personal capacity.</P>
    <P>It is important that members of a board take a broader view.  The interest source the member has come from should not be the only view represented.  A wider view which transcends this should be taken.  The Minister of the day is accountable to the Oireachtas for the appointments he makes to a board.  The members of a board are accountable for their actions as members.  I believe this is the democratic arrangement which serves the public interest best. Allowing the Minister to select from a number of nominees allows factors such as regional balance to be taken on board, as well as other factors relating to the group.  If the Minister is to carry the burden of gender equality, which I have legislated for frequently, and regional balance, he is entitled to discretion in choosing the slate of names to be put forward.  I do not favour writing nominating bodies into legislation.  The RIA and the RDS are exceptions because of the legal agreements to which I have referred. Accordingly, I cannot accept these amendments.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the intent behind Senator Mooney's amendment for the same reason as I appreciated that of Senator Lee, I cannot accept it either.  I will bear the proposal in mind when it comes to deciding on the composition of the board.  I understand Senator Lee's desire to establish closer links between the National Archives Advisory Council and the library board, as archives and library matters are closely linked. However, as I am already empowered to appoint all the members of the advisory council, the best way of achieving close links is through linkages created by me.  This could perhaps be achieved by providing an element of common membership, depending on the exigencies of the time.  I do not think it appropriate to go further in this regard in terms of legislative structure, and, therefore, I cannot accept this amendment.  As regards regional balance, I accept this will have to be borne in mind in appointing board members and should be one of a number of factors to be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>The Minister's argument on a board keeping its integrity away from vested interests has inevitably been breached to some degree by the legal agreements he has entered into with two institutions.  If he wanted his argument to be pure, he would not, if given the choice, have either the RDS or the RIA included in legislation.  The Minister would be given the freedom to decide whether they should be included.  The purity of his argument has been breached.  I suggest the National Library above all should have a representative of the Library Association of Ireland on its board, irrespective of the competing interests of any other institutions.  I ask the Minister to take this on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann</P>
      <P>(1)  welcomes the Supreme Court Judgement of 24 October, 1996 on the Dundalk residents case against B.N.F.L. and</P>
      <P>(2)  takes note of Government policy on nuclear safety and radiological protection and in particular commends the Government for the following:</P>
      <P>(a)  the continued efforts to monitor the activities of the nuclear industry in the U.K. and elsewhere and</P>
      <P>(b)  the steps which the Government is taking to minimise consequent risk to the Irish public and the environment.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has tabled an amendment to this motion.  There has been, and it is in our interest that there continues to be, a bipartisan approach to matters relating to Sellafield and the British Government.  I accept Fianna Fáil's amendment which I hope will enhance the spirit of bipartisanship in the House and elsewhere.  I would like to place the efforts of this Government in context while underlining the fact that it has been extremely vigorous in pursuing a policy which will ensure the dangers posed by the Sellafield complex are minimised and, hopefully, eliminated at some stage.  I would like to quote an article in today's <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
      <P>The four Dundalk-based plaintiffs who won a notable victory against Sellafield's operators, British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), in the Supreme Court last week characterised the Government's reluctance to support their case as &ldquo;disgraceful&rdquo;.  This may be over stating matters.  The Government, itself a defendant in the case against BNFL, probably did everything that was legally possible to support the case &mdash; but it has certainly been very circumspect in its approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> The irony is that this Government has been more active than any of its predecessors on the issue of Sellafield and the potential threat it represents to the people of the Republic.  Last January, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Mr. Emmet Stagg &mdash; to his great credit &mdash; travelled to Cumbria to give evidence against a preliminary plan by UK NIREX to store radioactive waste deep underground at the Sellafield site.  He was the first Irish Minister ever to intervene directly in a British planning inquiry, and his presence underlined the marked shift of emphasis in the approach of the Irish authorities to the nuclear threat from Cumbria.</P>
    <P>In retrospect, it is a pity that the Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; flush from its famous victory in the 1977 general election &mdash; was not represented at the inquiry that year which led to the £1.85 billion Thorp plant at Sellafield winning approval.  But then, and despite questionable safety standards, we didn't see BNFL's nuclear reprocessing operation in quite the same way we do now; after all, the ESB was planning its own nuclear power station at Carnsore Point.  Another two years would pass before the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania, which had such a dramatic effect on the future of the nuclear industry, and eight years before the Chernobyl catastrophe.</P>
    <P>Throughout the 1980s, there were several more accidents or incidents at Sellafield itself, fuelling public fears about its safety.  But apart from issuing the odd statement, successive governments here did much too little; it was this record of inaction on such an important issue that helps to explain why the Dundalk plaintiffs took their case against Ireland and the Attorney General as well as BNFL.  There are indications that they may be prepared to confine their action to the operators of Sellafield, dropping the State as a defendant, and Mr. Stagg has said this would improve the chances of underwriting their costs in an action which is bound to prove both lengthy and expensive.</P>
    <P>The Dundalk plaintiffs want the Thorp plant closed down because of the harmful effects its operation would have on them and on Ireland in general.  But BNFL is relying on a 1994 judgment in the English High Court, which dealt with the same issues now being raised here &mdash; and found in the company's favour.  In view of the seriousness of the matters at stake and the daunting costs involved in arguing them in court, the Government must, at the very least, seriously consider more full-blooded support for these plaintiffs; anything less would denote a return to the sorry days of complacency about the threat posed by the nuclear industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> In that context, I accept the timely amendment tabled by Fianna Fáil.  There can never be a return to complacency by a Government of any hue as matters have moved on in a dangerous way.  Members will know of the work of Adi Roche and her team with the children of Chernobyl.  Indeed, this House was host to children from Belarus in the Members' Restaurant a number of years ago.  In her book <i>Children of Chernobyl</i> is a quotation by Albert Einstein which would remove any trace of complacency.  He said: &ldquo;The splitting of the atom has changed everything except our way of thinking and thus we drift toward unparallelled catastrophe.&rdquo;  We have serious indications of the truth of Albert Einstein's prophetic words.  On 27 March 1979 we faced the possible meltdown of a nuclear reactor in Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania which we saw in all its horror in Chernobyl on 25 April 1986.  The House and the people can be comforted by the fact that no Government of whatever hue can be complacent about nuclear power or the effects of nuclear accidents.</P>
    <P>The Sellafield complex on the west coast of Cumbria, about 100 miles from the east coast of Ireland, contains British Nuclear Fuels reprocessing plants.  Nuclear fuel is recycled to extract uranium and plutonium for reuse for civil and military purposes.  The new Thorp plant which opened in March 1994 forms part of that complex.  People talk about Sellafield as if it were a single building operating in a particular way.  I call it a nuclear theme park because it has so many parts to it, some of which we know.  The site also contains four Magnox reactors called Calder Hall as well as a vitrification plant for high level radioactive waste.</P>
    <P>Sellafield is a huge employer and its nuclear activities extend to many other areas of Britain's home and export markets and to the defence industry.  To that extent, we are facing a British Government which will attempt to frustrate and defeat the Irish interest in this matter because of its economic and military priorities.</P>
    <P>Since Deputy Stagg was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications with responsibility for nuclear safety and radiation protection, he has made the issue of nuclear power his main public and private priority.  Public and political opinion is firmly opposed to nuclear energy.  Our nuclear policy objectives place a heavy emphasis on nuclear safety and radiological protection.  The Government remains opposed to any expansion of this industry, especially as certain serious problems remain unresolved, including the risk of serious accidents and problems relating to transport, reprocessing, storage and disposal of waste and the decommissioning of nuclear installations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> Despite the <i>Exxon Valdes</i> disaster in Alaska, the environment improved in a short number of years.  We cannot expect that to happen after nuclear accidents.  We know that from Chernobyl and Belarus where vast areas are still uninhabited and will be for a long time.  There is no comparison between the scale of destruction from nuclear accidents and that from natural disasters.</P>
    <P>Many European countries, including Britain, have retained nuclear energy as an option for power generation but we remain firmly opposed to this option.  A dominant factor in the public's opposition to nuclear power is the risk from the UK's nuclear industry of a catastrophic accident similar to Chernobyl.  This fear is now getting the priority it deserves.  In April this year we commemorated the tenth anniversary of the tragic nuclear accident at Chernobyl.  The horror of this ongoing disaster brought home to many people the serious radiological, health, environmental and socio-economic consequences of a nuclear accident.  It demonstrated above all that radioactivity respects no frontiers.</P>
    <P>Because of its proximity to Ireland and its complex nuclear operations, Sellafield has long been a source of grave concern to successive Irish Governments.  The history of mismanagement and the frequency of incidents at the complex over the years confirmed the view that the plant should be closed down.  The four aging Magnox reactors, which are now 40 years old and well past their sell by date, should also be closed down.</P>
    <P>A blueprint for action has been drawn up to implement the various proposals on Sellafield and the Irish Sea.  A ministerial task force, chaired by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, was established to co-ordinate a concerted strategy for progress in the Government's policy on Sellafield and related concerns.  The blueprint will guide the further coordinating work of the task force which will oversee its practical implementation.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, met the British Ambassador and expressed the Government's grave concerns about the number of incidents at Sellafield and other UK nuclear plants.  The Ambassador was informed that the history of mismanagement and the frequency of accidents at the complex confirmed the view that it should be closed down.  While we welcome the openness with which the British Government reported these accidents, we wonder how many accidents were not reported and were deliberately concealed.  When the accident occurred at Chernobyl, the Russian Government and some of the major western states which have a vested interest in the nuclear industry, denied information not just to people on this island but throughout Europe.  I have serious reservations about the full extent of accidents at the Sellafield plant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> As I stated previously, the Sellafield complex houses four aging Magnox reactors.  The Minister has called on the UK Government to phase out these Magnox reactors in the interest of nuclear safety and radiation protection.  These aging monsters pose a continuing unacceptable threat. The EU Commission has recently been requested by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to review those reactors under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty and to ensure their compliance with EU basic safety standards.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion and the amendment to the House.  I commend the Minister for his excellent work in ensuring that whatever can be done to protect this country from the scourge of nuclear accidents at Sellafield and elsewhere will be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I am delighted to have an opportunity to debate this matter. There must be an all party approach to this issue if we want to be successful.  Last week a group of people from Dundalk were vindicated in the Supreme Court.  The Government owes a great debt of gratitude to those people for the courageous stance they took.  The judicial route is often difficult for individuals because they do not have the backing of the State.  However, they were successful in their case against British Nuclear Fuels Limited.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Magner that this Government's record on Sellafield has been encouraging.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 26 August, Lorna Siggins said this &ldquo;Government is perceived to have adopted a more robust approach to Irish opposition to Sellafield, and legal action as well has not been ruled out&rdquo;.  The Government has moved on a number of fronts, including establishing a task force.  The Minister also opposed the UK NIREX development, which was a new step in our opposition to Sellafield.</P>
      <P>A quarter of the entire energy source in the United Kingdom comes from nuclear power.  The deregulation policy of the Tory Government means nuclear companies are now private interests, as in the case of UK NIREX.  We face a difficult task but we will only be successful if there is cross party support.  We should develop co-operation between local authorities and community and interest groups, as the Dundalk residents have done, not just on the east coast of Ireland but also on the west coast of Britain.</P>
      <P>That coalition needs to be developed not only in the narrow Irish interest but also from a British point of view.  If we are to succeed in this issue, it requires a change of mind from the British Government because it is directing the nuclear policy which could have devastating effects throughout Ireland.  We must have a change of heart at the top.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> There could be no better issue discussed during the third strand of talks than that of Sellafield, if we are to advance the issue and achieve real results in closing it down.  We must encourage and cajole the British Government to move from its position of supporting the British nuclear industry.  We must move bilaterally on that front. It will be a sign of good faith if the British Government does so.</P>
    <P>We must also move on a European level.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, succeeded in passing the Waste Management Bill, 1995, through this House.  If waste management is a European issue, the British Government must take cognisance of good practice and the change in energy resources taking place throughout Europe.  Just as we must be aware of the relevant EU regulations, so must it.</P>
    <P>One issue already discussed by the European Parliament which I would like addressed is that of changing responsibility for monitoring and controlling radiation levels in the world from the Atomic Energy Agency to the World Health Organisation.  The Atomic Energy Agency has served us poorly.  Its 1990 report discussed evidence of diseases linked to fallout in a variety of countries but did not make a causal link, to the detriment of many countries in Europe, particularly the Chernobyl region in the Ukraine. I do not believe the Atomic Energy Agency has a proud record in monitoring this situation.</P>
    <P>The central issue which will be discussed in the courts is how we can change the burden of proof. The challenge is not for the objectors, the residents of Dundalk or the Irish Government to prove that real danger exists, but for BNFL and British nuclear policy to show that no danger exists or will ever exist.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion.  I am delighted the Minister is accepting the Fianna Fáil amendment. It shows the spirit of cross-party support for this issue.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;environment&rdquo; to add:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;;and calls on the Government to agree in principle to funding the STAD case against BNFL in the courts and to enter immediately into negotiations with the STAD group to ensure that the Government is removed as a defendant in the case and thus remove the outstanding obstacle to the Government funding the case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  We, on this side of the House, are gratified that the Labour Party has, on this occasion, decided to accept our amendment.  I say that in a generous spirit because politics can sometimes get in the way.  This issue is above and beyond politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It arises from a case brought by four people: Constance Shortt, Mary Kavanagh, Mark Dearey <Col N="238" /> and Ollan Herr, who are residents in County Louth and are pleading that their health has been affected by the presence of Sellafield and the Thorp reactor.</P>
    <P>On one level, these four people are saying their lives have been affected and, on another, all Ireland is affected and concerned.  We have seen from the Chernobyl disaster that if a nuclear reactor or reprocessing plant has a serious fault we would all be affected.  Dublin could become uninhabitable, people could be killed and there could be hundreds of thousands of cancers.  We are all urgently concerned, as some speakers have said.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister and was delighted when he travelled to England and made his objections.  Dublin Corporation has been fairly active in that regard and engaged consultants in England to advise it on what is involved.  I understand legal representatives of Dublin city have at various times made legal representations in the High Court cases involved.</P>
    <P>The four people taking this case are to be commended for their endurance and bravery as are their legal advisers.  I imagine that this is case is not well resourced.  It is a tribute to the legal system that lawyers are prepared to take on these cases where there may not be light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>What is hoped will be achieved is the closing of Thorp.  This may not be possible because there is a huge vested interest involved.  It is no exaggeration to say that Thorp is socially and environmentally unacceptable to the Irish people, particularly from a health perspective.</P>
    <P>We have decided we wish to remain a nuclear free country.  Dublin and other local authorities have declared themselves to be nuclear free zones.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, accepted an amendment to the Harbours Bill, 1996, that no ships with nuclear cargo would be permitted to enter Irish ports.  That is a marvellous development.</P>
    <P>The action the four Louth residents bring seeks reliefs under a number of headings.  Mr. Justice Barrington in a recent Supreme Court decision stated that the plaintiffs' claim, moreover, that British Nuclear Fuels, before carrying out the said Thorp project, should have carried out an environmental impact assessment as required by EC Council Directive, but failed to do so.  That is a very serious charge because British Nuclear Fuels is a company whose shareholder is the British Government and the British people.  The allegation is that a major plank of European environmental impact assessments was not carried out.  It is an important point.</P>
    <P>The second point concerns a breach of the Euratom Treaty and the third point is that the site at Sellafield has already caused considerable personal health and environmental damage and <Col N="239" /> economic loss in the area where the plaintiffs live. The fourth point is that the project involves a significant risk of serious accidents which could involve incalculable harm to civilians and property.</P>
    <P>They have had the benefit of expert opinion including that of Mr. John Henry Large, a chartered engineer, who has described what goes on at Sellafield.  In addition, Dr. Mary Grehan, a medical practitioner in the Louth area, has carried out an extensive study of physical abnormalities detected over a period.</P>
    <P>In a sense it is exciting because new legal frontiers will be discovered.  The Supreme Court said that an action can lie in this jurisdiction against alleged torts or civil wrongs committed outside the jurisdiction against people here.  This is largely without precedent.  For the first time a civil action based in Ireland will be taken against the British Government for wrongs allegedly done in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As the Minister will agree, the issues are complex not just from a legal viewpoint but also from the health, technical and environmental viewpoints.  The funding of such a lengthy and complex action will be very expensive and, obviously, British Nuclear Fuels will fight the litigation tooth and nail.  They have shareholders who take profits and make a good living from this business which we do not support.</P>
    <P>Thorp has not yet been fully commissioned but when it is it will be one of the largest nuclear reprocessors in the world.  It is frightening to have this time bomb waiting to explode on our doorstep.  The issue is bigger than the four brave people who have taken the court case, it concerns everyone on this island.  I commend the Labour Party for tabling this motion and I thank the Government side for accepting the Fianna Fáil amendment.  It is a practical amendment for which the people of Louth and Ireland in general will thank us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.  This issue is bigger than all of us.  The other night I saw a television film about Chernobyl with the chilling message that it was the final warning. One of the actors in the film, which was based on fact, said the next time an accident of that magnitude occurs it will wipe out the world.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes correctly said that one quarter of Britain's electricity is generated by nuclear power.  Given the way I feel about such power, I would not mind if England was in the dark tomorrow morning.  According to Senator Mulcahy the UK's nuclear stations are among the largest in the world and are sitting just a short distance across the water from us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is irresponsible for any country or government to continue in the manner in which the UK authorities are going.  Regardless of <Col N="240" /> shareholders and the money involved, once it explodes there will be no need for money.  The shareholders will not have to worry either because they will no longer be there.  What happened in Nagasaki during the war would only be a little pop compared to what could happen if something went wrong with Thorp.</P>
    <P>The Opposition is happy with the Government's motion and we are glad it accepted our amendment.  I hope it will find agreement with the Start group to ensure the Government will be removed as the defendant in this case.  It is easy to point a finger at government responsibility.  During the debate on the Harbours Bill, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, was ready to accept my amendment concerning nuclear power.  It was probably the first legislation ever to ban from Irish harbours any vessels carrying nuclear weapons or waste.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why successive Governments have not put strong legislation in place to enable us to take our case to the European Court or even to the World Court.  In that way we could voice our objections which are not being heeded.  People on the east coast who live close to these nuclear plants claim their health is being damaged as a result.  It is good that we can all agree on an occasion like this.  What we read in newspapers has frightened all of us.  If something happened we would all be wiped out, not just those on the east coast.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Hayes who said that people with objections both here and in England should be mobilised to make their case in a better and clearer way.  As politicians, we will go along with a group who lobbies us on an individual basis. In the same way, if English people lobby their politicians they will get the message passed up the line and hopefully something will come of it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendment and I praise those who took the initiative and went to court.  I hope that following this historic case the fight will be funded by the Government.  The Government should give any help it can to those people to ensure we are on the right road towards legally closing down the United Kingdom's nuclear power stations.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State as well as those who tabled the motion and accepted our amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Labour Party Senators for tabling this most timely motion which gives me the opportunity to up date the House on developments since I last addressed it on this issue eight months ago.  The House will recall that I undertook at that time to return so that I could be assisted by Senators' opinions and they could be kept abreast of developments.  I also thank the <Col N="241" /> Fianna Fáil Party Members for the amendment they have tabled and to which I will refer later.  I thank Members who have spoken so far for their kind remarks.</P>
      <P>As we all know, the nuclear power industry was born of the bomb and nuclear reactors were first built for military usage.  In the 50 years since then, the world has been learning to live with the use of nuclear energy for civil purposes.  The learning process to some has been exciting, to others frustrating, and to others frightening.</P>
      <P>The history of nuclear power has been littered with false hopes.  From the beginning, it was proclaimed to be plentiful, cheap and safe. However, the elusive Holy Grail has never been achieved and the history of nuclear projects and incidents has belied the earlier hopes that were held.</P>
      <P>Here in Ireland, public and political opinion is firmly opposed to the production of nuclear energy.  This Government, and indeed previous Governments, has taken a strong stand against the threat from the nuclear industry, especially in Britain.  It is one issue where there should be and is consensus across the political spectrum.  Since I became Minister of State, one of my top priorities has been to deal with public concerns about nuclear power and to emphasise the need for enhancement of nuclear safety and radiation protection worldwide.</P>
      <P>While recognising that certain countries have retained nuclear energy as an option for power generation, we remain opposed to any expansion of this industry especially as certain serious problems remain unresolved.  These include the reprocessing and transport of nuclear materials, problems relating to radioactive waste disposal and the decommissioning of reactors which have reached the end of their useful life.</P>
      <P>However, above all, the dominant factor is the ever present risk of a catastrophic nuclear accident, whether due to human or operational safety failures.  As Senator Magner remarked, Chernobyl has demonstrated that radioactivity respects no frontiers.  The Government shares the general concerns of the public about nuclear power, especially concerning the British nuclear industry.  My views on nuclear operations have been made known to the British authorities on many occasions and in international fora.</P>
      <P>Previous Governments have exerted pressure in this area throughout the years but to little avail.  The Government decided that a more positive and realistic approach should be taken with regard to Sellafield and its effects on the Irish Sea.  We recognise that a meaningful and ultimately successful strategy will entail consistent action over many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its policy document <i>A Government of Renewal</i> the Government set out its views on nuclear threats arising not only from <Col N="242" /> Sellafield/Thorp but other installations and made proposals for dealing with these concerns.  Each of the actions proposed have been implemented or are being actively tackled by Departments.</P>
    <P>The major focus of interest from the public's point of view relates to British Nuclear Fuel's facilities at Sellafield, which lies on the west coast of Cumbria approximately 100 miles to the east of Ireland.  It contains British Nuclear Fuel's two reprocessing plants where spent nuclear fuel is reprocessed to extract uranium and plutonium for reuse.  The new Thorp plant, opened in March 1994, forms part of the Sellafield complex.</P>
    <P>There are also four Magnox reactors on the site, called Calder Hall, in addition to numerous high level waste storage tanks and a vitrification plant for transferring this waste into a glassified form.  The UK authorities have also identified the Sellafield area as a potential site for a nuclear waste dump to be built about the year 2010.</P>
    <P>The Government strongly opposes the continuation and expansion of reprocessing of spent fuel by British Nuclear Fuels at Sellafield. The main reasons for this are, first, the increase in risk to the health of the public and of environmental contamination arising from discharges of radioactive effluent; second, the risk of accidents arising from the reprocessing activity and the storage and transport of nuclear fuels, plutonium and radioactive wastes; third, the accumulation of large amounts of radioactive waste on one site close to the Irish Sea and to Ireland; fourth, the risks of nuclear weapons proliferation from increasing stocks of plutonium; fifth, the so far unsolved problems of long-term safe storage and disposal of radioactive waste and, sixth, there is no demonstrable economic benefit from reprocessing which would balance and justify the risks involved.</P>
    <P>The Government considers that the Thorp reprocessing plant, which began operations in 1994, represents an additional and unnecessary risk to the health and safety of the public.  When Thorp was originally given the planning go-ahead in 1977, nuclear power was still generally believed to have a prosperous future and spent fuel reprocessing was thought to be a key factor in the uranium fuel cycle.  Today, the arguments for reprocessing are not convincing.  The anticipated expansion of nuclear power has not materialised and the plutonium and uranium recovered from spent fuel reprocessing are adding unnecessarily to the huge stockpile of nuclear materials which exists world-wide and which is considered by some countries, including Ireland, to be a major security, health and environmental as well as a political problem.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission examined the implications of Thorp and issued an Opinion on 30 April 1992 under Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty that the implementation of the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste from Thorp is <Col N="243" /> not liable, either in normal operation or in the case of a range of accident scenarios, to result in radioactive contamination, significant from the point of view of health, the water, soil or airspace of another member state.  Notwithstanding this Opinion, many requests were made to the UK authorities from Ireland and elsewhere during 1993, to hold a wide-ranging public inquiry into Thorp and to have an environmental impact assessment undertaken, but these requests were refused by the UK Government.</P>
    <P>The decision by the UK authorities in December 1993 to proceed with Thorp in spite of two detailed submissions from the then Government was extremely disappointing given our strenuous objections.  While BNFL may think Thorp is a major step forward in its nuclear programme and a cornerstone to its international activities, it is to my mind one of the biggest white elephants produced by the nuclear industry.</P>
    <P>The four aging Magnox reactors at the Sellafield site, built as far back as 1956, are considered by me to have a higher risk of a major accident when compared with modern reactors. The life span of these reactors has been extended by the UK authorities for mainly economic reasons.  It would cost £1 billion to decommission just one of these.  According to its 1996 annual report, BNFL is now hoping to run them for at least 45 years.  Another cause of concern is the routine radioactive contamination of the marine and aerial environment from Sellafield which, I believe, should be prevented and eliminated.</P>
    <P>The House may be aware that, for the first time, the State actively participated in a UK public planning inquiry and objected formally to a further planned development at Sellafield.  UK NIREX, a publicly owned nuclear waste disposal company, has plans for an underground nuclear dump near Sellafield.  For the moment it wants planning permission for a rock laboratory underground to test the geology and hydrogeology of the area.</P>
    <P>Although NIREX say the siting of a dump is not inevitable, at the inquiry I strongly contended that the massive expenditure and resources already incurred in the project meant that NIREX had no intention of seeking an alternative site.  In the meantime I am looking at further possible options open to the Government in the event of planning permission being given. Copies of my submissions to the planning inquiry have been sent to the EU and the EU Commissioner with responsibility for the environment and nuclear safety.</P>
    <P>It is not yet known when the inquiry inspector's report will be available.  When it is, the UK Secretary of State for the Environment will have to consider the report and recommendations.  I am consulting with the Attorney General about what further action is open to me under EU and <Col N="244" /> international law detailing my objections to the rock characterisation facility.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Supreme Court's recent jurisdiction decision concerning BNFL.  The House will be aware that in 1994 four County Louth residents initiated legal action against British Nuclear Fuels regarding Thorp.  The plaintiffs sought an injunction to restrain operations at the Thorp plant on the basis that they maintain it has not fully complied with the EU Directive on environmental impact assessment and also the justification principle under Euratom legislation.  Ireland and the Attorney General have also been named by the plaintiffs as co-defendants in the substantive proceedings.</P>
    <P>In March 1994 the High Court made an Order allowing the County Louth plaintiffs to serve a plenary summons outside the jurisdiction on British Nuclear Fuels but over the past two years BNFL have sought to have this decision overturned.  An appeal to the Supreme Court was heard on 24 and 25 January 1996.  On this occasion as previously, counsel for the State gave support to the plaintiffs in their case to maintain BNFL as a party to the proceedings in the substantive case to follow.  The State has also agreed to make available to the plaintiffs' solicitors a very large amount of official files and documents to assist the County Louth residents in the preparation of their substantive court case. A number of Departments and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are co-operating in this process.  My Department has already disclosed to the plaintiffs the nature of the documentation available there concerning Sellafield and related aspects relevant to the substantive case.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Supreme Court last Wednesday which finally established the jurisdiction of the Irish courts to hear the substantive case brought by a group of County Louth residents against British Nuclear Fuels concerning Thorp is, therefore, very welcome. Effectively, it has rejected BNFL's appeal.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government, I congratulate the four people who took this action, namely Constance Shortt, Mary Kavanagh, Mark Deary and Ollan Herr.  I want to pay tribute to those four brave people who have selflessly stuck to their guns, with no possibility of personal gain and with the potential for great personal loss. Their stand has been compared to David and Goliath and we know that result of that contest. We are all pleased with this result.</P>
    <P>In its judgment, the court was unanimous in its decision to uphold the 1995 judgment of the High Court establishing the jurisdiction of the Irish courts to hear the substantive case.  I believe this is a significant decision on the right of access by citizens on issues of concern to them in the courts of their own country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> The judgment confirmed the entitlement of the County Louth plaintiffs to sue for damage arising in Ireland from the Irish courts.  The extent to which they could pursue their claims based on European Law was considered to be a matter for the trial judge.  The County Louth residents were awarded their costs against BNFL &mdash; they had already obtained costs in the High Court.  The State was ordered to bear its own costs.</P>
    <P>Legal issues arising from the judgment are now being assessed in conjunction with the Attorney General.  The County Louth residents were given leave to serve summons on BNFL within four weeks of the date of the judgment.  The substantive case taken by the plaintiffs will then be scheduled for a hearing in the High Court; it is not possible at this stage to state when the case will actually be heard.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to the Fianna Fáil amendment which in some ways enhances the Labour Party motion and thereby better reflects the thinking of the Seanad and public.  I would urge a continuation of this bipartisan approach. It is most desirable that this House, the Government, the Opposition and the people are at one on this important national issue.</P>

      <P>I have offered to meet the plaintiffs involved in the court case because it was indicated publicly on their behalf that they were anxious to co-operate with the State towards shared objectives of both parties.  The latest correspondence I have received from the plaintiffs' solicitors points out that they would prefer a meeting on this subject with legal representatives attending on both sides.  I have sought urgent comments on this modified suggestion from the Attorney General.  I received a letter today.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, is calling a meeting of the Committee of Ministers on Sellafield tomorrow at which this subject is being discussed.  It is clear there is widespread opposition in this country to all operations at Sellafield.  The Government is committed to taking all possible action open to it to secure the objective of the eventual closure of the plant.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Ministers on Sellafield last year asked the Attorney General to reassess the possibilities for legal action against Sellafield.  My Department, acting on the advice of the Attorney General, is organising the gathering, investigation and processing of the available scientific evidence which might provide grounds for legal redress by the State.  One possibility includes the question of recourse to arbitration under the Paris Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Land Based Sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> Additional scientific information and studies which have recently come to hand concerning the tank storage arrangements for highly active liquid waste at Sellafield are under consideration.  In that regard, I wish to express my horror at the possibilities arising from this practice at Sellafield.  This highly active liquid waste is stored in 21 separate tanks which are cooled by a variety of systems.  If that cooling system were to fail for a short period of just eight hours the resulting pollution would be equivalent to 100 Chernobyls 100 miles from Dublin.  If the breeze was blowing in the wrong direction from our point of view at that time, agriculture in Ireland would be wiped out forever; scientists say it would be for a period of 100,000 years.  That is forever as far as I am concerned &mdash; two ice ages occurred in an equivalent period.  It is nonsense to suggest that the time involved is measurable.  That does not count the immediate effect on the people's health and lives.  The BSE problem would fade into absolute insignificance in comparison.</P>
    <P>Proposals have been made from outside sources for further research which is considered to be necessary into this aspect of the matter and these proposals are under active consideration. Detailed consideration continues to be given to all options for legal redress.</P>
    <P>The biggest threat to Ireland in terms of the UK nuclear installations is, as I said, a catastrophic accident.  I am, therefore, continuously monitoring the frequency and totality of UK incidents with a view to highlighting the need for significant safety improvements.  My Department is also pursuing the establishment of formal bilateral arrangements between Ireland and the UK concerning the transmission of information subsequent to incidents at nuclear installations and general matters related to nuclear safety and radiation protection.</P>
    <P>My Department is assisted in its role of nuclear safety and radiological protection by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &mdash; the RPII.  The RPII's statutory role and functions are contained in the Radiological Protection Act, 1991.  In particular, the institute concerns itself with hazards to health associated with radiation both from nuclear plants and medical uses.  It monitors radioactivity throughout Ireland on land, sea and in the air.  The RPII also assists in the development of national plans for emergencies arising from nuclear accidents and in the implementation of measures to deal with radiological emergencies.</P>
    <P>My Department, of course, cannot directly monitor on site the day to day operations of Sellafield.  However, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland monitors the levels of radioactivity in Irish waters to study the distribution of contaminating radionuclides, identify trends and assess the risks to public <Col N="247" /> health.  In relation to the Irish Sea, the monitoring programme involves the routine sampling and analysis of sea water, seaweed, sediments, fish and shellfish along the east coast.  Samples of sea water and sediments are also collected from the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Sellafield discharges continue to cause contamination of the Irish Sea.  Such contamination is objectionable and unacceptable and I consider that all radioactive discharges should be progressively reduced and ultimately eliminated at the earliest possible date. International conventions on discharges from land based sources place such an obligation on member states so as to prevent pollution of the seas.</P>
    <P>The national emergency plan for nuclear accidents was published by my Department in 1992.  As Minister responsible for nuclear safety and radiation protection matters, I have responsibility for the emergency plan and for ensuring the co-ordination of the responsibilities and functions of relevant authorities.  The plan is designed to provide a rapid and effective response to accidents involving the release, or potential release, of radioactive substances into the environment which could give rise to radiation exposure.</P>
    <P>A test of the plan took place in October 1992 involving the main Departments and agencies. The plan was further tested in May 1993 as part of an international emergency exercise arranged by the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD. Arrangements for a further review of the national plan are currently in place and I am pleased to inform the House that next month Ireland will be participating in a major international nuclear exercise.</P>
    <P>This exercise is being organised by the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and will comprise at least three different test exercises in 1996 and 1997, each with a different &ldquo;accident&rdquo; scenario.  Ireland has so far agreed to participate in the first of these exercises which will be hosted by Switzerland.  It will involve a number of Departments and agencies in a day long simulated accident with the participation of international organisations such as the International Atomic Energy, the EU, the World Meteorological Organisation and over 30 countries.  The exercise will be used to test many important aspects of our national emergency plan.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to using every available opportunity, in all appropriate fora, to voice its concerns about the safety aspects of the British nuclear industry, in particular the potential hazards associated with reprocessing spent nuclear fuel and the ageing Magnox reactors.  We will continue to press for the highest possible <Col N="248" /> safety standards to be maintained and strive to prevent and eliminate radioactive discharges into the marine environment.  The cessation of activities at Sellafield will remain a priority for the Government and this will be highlighted and pursued in every international forum.</P>
    <P>I am committed to continuing action on these issues and to implementing a meaningful and ultimately successful strategy to minimise and eventually remove the threat posed by the nuclear industry in the UK and on a global scale. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject under discussion will be of most concern to future generations because we are now aware of a number of facts.  The Irish Sea is continually contaminated on a daily, weekly and monthly basis and this will not improve while Thorp continues in operation.  We are also aware of the nightmare scenario which would leave Ireland a wasteland if there were an easily understood human or technological error in the plant less than 100 miles across the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>It is probably a reflection on everybody that we get so worked up and worried about minor amounts of antibiotics in the food chain and minor levels of disease arising from certain aspects of the beef industry but the biggest single threat to life, limb, agriculture and the future of the State operates on a daily basis less than 100 miles away.  The environment is our legacy to our children, their children and their grandchildren and it is our responsibility to guard it.  This must be central in what we do as public representatives.  This concern should always cement, unite and direct joint action.  The day this issue becomes politically divisive it will reflect in the worst possible way on the political leadership of the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister's statement was the strongest and most unequivocal I have ever heard made by a Minister on any issue in my time in the House. The Minister should be congratulated for his unwavering and highly effective fight on this issue since he was appointed.  I have no hesitancy in offering my congratulations to him.  I intended to support the Fianna Fáil amendment, irrespective of whether it was accepted by the Government. However, I am delighted it has been accepted because the signal on this issue must be clear and unambiguous.  The Minister has done much in that regard this evening.  The open way in which he congratulated the residents and the upfront manner of his involvement in this issue to the extent of participating in the public inquiry in the UK is the type of action people want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also proves that green and environmental issues are not the preserve of a particular group in this country but the concern of every party and elected representative.  Anybody who tries to bamboozle the general population into thinking that such issues are the consideration of only one <Col N="249" /> group are not doing it any service.  Politicians who have no concern for the environment do not deserve to be elected.</P>
    <P>The message from the House is one of support for the four brave people in County Louth who took the case.  They took on the establishment and put themselves forward.  How could they not do so, given the information which has emerged from that area over the past 15 years?  A previous speaker mentioned the data on physical abnormalities and the higher incidences of leukaemia and Down's Syndrome.  These incidents have gone way beyond the possibility of coincidence and are undoubtedly the outcome of pollution from nuclear waste.</P>
    <P>Nuclear waste in some form, however minuscule, is moving into the food chain.  The Minister's words should be universally quoted; the Irish Sea is being contaminated daily.  The results of tests carried out daily confirm this.  No action will be strong enough to satisfy people if the worst happens and it is, therefore, important that political leaders can point to their records and requirements.  It is not a matter of vote gathering but of protecting our future and that of our children.</P>
    <P>It is crucial to examine the impact of this issue. The worst scenario will turn this country into a wasteland.  The fishing industry in the Irish Sea is already suffering.  People in restaurants in Dublin ask if the fish was caught in Dingle, Killybegs or Howth and they decide whether to have it on that basis.  People will not swim in the Irish Sea and this hits the tourism industry.  The issue is undoubtedly impacting on many areas and it is also a consideration in the commercial arena.</P>
    <P>The debate would be a milestone if people are comforted and reassured that the Government has done everything possible to date on this issue by raising it internationally, attending local investigations in the UK and using the legal system to support people who have brought the matter to this point.  This is government of the people for the people.  If it works out, it will be the best possible way forward.  However, if it does not work for constitutional or legal reasons or the negotiations prevent the Government taking the step proposed in the motion, it behoves us as public representatives to do whatever we can in a personal leadership capacity to secure popular support for this case.  It must be viewed as a people's movement and there is no better way to define such a movement than to have the grassroots and the Government work together on behalf of everybody for the good of the country in the future.  I commend the motion and congratulate the Minister on the leadership he has shown on this issue.  I wish him well in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Supreme Court decision which clears the way for legal action to <Col N="250" /> be taken against BNFL.  Thorp represents an ongoing threat to the health and safety of everybody living on these islands.  The case being taken by STAD is, in a very real sense, being taken on behalf of us all.  It is for that reason that the State should take the necessary steps to finance the group's action.  There is some indications of that coming from the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Government has been consistent in its opposition to Thorp in particular, and to the UK nuclear industry as a whole.  I am glad this was mentioned by the Minister today.  The Minister, Deputy Gilmore, in particular has sought to strengthen the provisions of the INF code to ensure that nuclear materials are included, and has made it clear that vessels carrying such material to and from the UK are not welcome in Irish ports.</P>
      <P>The campaign against Thorp must be waged on several fronts &mdash; diplomatic, commercial and legal.  It has been clear for some time that the Euratom Treaties are outdated and have not kept pace with either scientific or political change. They should be amended to take account of the concerns of non-nuclear jurisdictions sharing land or maritime borders with nuclear states.  After all, radioactive fallout is no respecter of boundaries. I am aware that there is considerable opposition within the EU to any such change.  However, I hope the Government will continue pursuing this matter at various levels.</P>
      <P>British Nuclear Fuels is a business and, like any business, its strategy is determined primarily by the bottom line.  The market for the reprocessing service provided by Thorp is shrinking and there may well come a time when Thorp proves commercially non-viable.  Diplomatic pressure by the Irish has a role to play in dissuading potential Thorp clients from using the facility.  I again commend the Minister for his outright and forthright statement here this evening.  There is no ambiguity or ambivalence about that position.</P>
      <P>While public concern in Ireland has been largely focused on Thorp, I am equally concerned about the UK's other nuclear installations. Reports of leaks have become commonplace and it is clear that the fines imposed by British courts, while welcome, have done little to force the industry into adopting a more rigorous safety attitude.  Indeed, the recent privatisation of a large part of the UK nuclear industry &mdash; advertised with the bizarre slogan &ldquo;a final burst of energy &ldquo;&mdash; has heightened concerns about safety.  I am aware that the Radiological Protection Institute and the relevant Departments, have forcefully represented Irish concerns in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this Government will continue exerting maximum pressure on the UK authorities with regard to the safety not only of Thorp, but of the UK nuclear industry in general.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Roche.  I welcome this debate because it is above politics; it is a health issue.  We are debating the case of four brave people who took on BNFL in the highest court in the land to try to highlight the situation, at huge loss to themselves.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is accepting the amendment because this issue is not about party politics.  This is a health issue, about accidents which may occur, about the storage and accumulation of radioactive waste and the impact this has on the environment, on public health and on every aspect of life.</P>
      <P>An example of this is the Chernobyl disaster.  I saw a programme on television recently about a baby who has huge injuries to his eye as a result of the Chernobyl disaster.  The programme showed what medicine can do to help that little baby.  These examples should be highlighted time and time again to show the impact of the Chernobyl disaster on the world.  As the Minister said, if the wind had been blowing in our direction or if there had been a severe storm at that time, the impact in this country would have indescribable.</P>
      <P>This problem has been going on since the 1980s.  Much documentation has highlighted this issue and we have had many public inquiries yet we do not seem to be making any progress.  I congratulate the Minister for taking a stand against BNFL trying to relocate near Sellafield. BNFL still does not listen to what the public is saying.  Everybody must speak out at length and at every opportunity and we must ask again for Thorp to be closed down.  That is the issue at the moment.</P>
      <P>Medical research has shown the impact of Thorp on the younger generation.  Research and studies have proven that it has had a huge adverse effect.  I welcome this debate.  We should use our good offices to let it be known that this problem will not go away until we have finally persuaded the UK Government to close the Sellafield site.  We must use every means at our disposal &mdash; such as EU inquiries and so on &mdash; to have these reprocessing plants closed down once and for all in the light of the dangers they pose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ormonde for sharing her time with me.  This is an important debate which transcends party politics.  There is nothing as important as life itself.  We are talking about the life of the nation.  It is no exaggeration to point out that the British nuclear industry is playing a form of Russian roulette with the life of this entire nation.  It is no accident that when the British Government decided to site these particularly noxious industries in a portion of their land mass, it sited them in the portion furthest from their own population centres and, by coincidence, closest to ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> We are all too familiar with the reality and the track record of this industry.  This industry is based on deceit.  It has its basis in a lie.  If we go back over the history of the nuclear industry, places like Dounreay, Three Mile Island, Windscale and Sellafield come to mind.  They have all been based on one reality.  This dream is a nightmare in disguise.  The dream of cheap nuclear energy which was fostered by the nuclear industry and by mad scientists in the 1950s and the early 1960s has turned out to be a nightmare. The reality of the nightmare is that the nations that have been foolhardy enough to commit themselves to this industry are not able to contain it.  They have mortgaged the well being, not only of their own people, but of the people on this island in this case, for generations to come.</P>
    <P>I live in a maritime county.  I am all too aware of the pollution that is the reality of the Irish Sea. I am all too aware of the contamination of the fish stock in that sea and of the health problems that have occurred over the years.  Inexplicable clusters of cancers have occurred in County Wicklow and I believe they are in some way associated with the nuclear experimentation that the British Government and its agencies have conducted for the best part of two generations now.  I believe that the incident, some years back, of children born with limb defects which cannot be explained in medical terms are attributable at least in part to this.</P>
    <P>If there was just one accident on the scale of Chernobyl or Three Mile Island in the British nuclear dustbin which they have created on their west coast, we on this island would find ourselves in peril.  Problems like BSE and menaces we have had in the past would pale into insignificance.  It is an important responsibility of every Government, irrespective of political hue or make up, and of every public representative in this country, to be at one.  That is why I compliment the Government side on accepting the Opposition amendment and I compliment the Labour Members on their motion.  This is something on which there should be no cruel political divide. We are all at one.</P>
    <P>It is because this industry is such an extraordinarily cash consuming enterprise across Europe and there is so much money committed to it, that in Europe there is a lethargy that borders on criminality to it; not just to Sellafield, Thorp or the appalling record of the British nuclear industry but the nuclear industry across Europe.  Many of our European neighbours have committed so much to this industry over the last 40 years that they are in a cul-de-sac and are finding it very difficult to get out.  There is an adage in politics &mdash; when you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.  That would be a good adage for them to adopt.  Some European nations have made a start because they have decided to cancel or slow down future involvement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> However, Euratom and the International Atomic Energy Agency have both proven themselves to be frustratingly impotent to say the least.  Euratom and the Euratom Treaty were founded on a need to build a European nuclear industry.  Euratom is wrongly focused.  What we need is leadership which will dismantle the European nuclear industry.  The IAEA and the OECD have been remiss because they have afraid to use the powers of their founding treaties to curtail the activities particularly of the British. If one looks at a series of responses given recently in the European Parliament to questions put to the Commission and the Council by Jim Fitzsimons, MEP, one sees that they are redolent of attitudes of carelessness.  They put the issue on the long finger.  There is an unwillingness in Europe to take this monster by the neck and deal with it appropriately.</P>
    <P>I find that the incremental contamination which is the reality of the Irish Sea and our environment unacceptable.  We as a nation decided to turn our backs on nuclear energy even at a time when fossil fuels were becoming expensive and it looked as if nuclear energy could be a cheap alternative.  That was a brave decision. No other member state, and certainly none that likes to regard itself as a good neighbour, has the right to foist on us the outcome of their own futile investments in this area.  I find, for example, the responses in the European Parliament on Thorp to be unacceptable, complacent and lacking any sign of willingness to get to the nub of the problem.</P>
    <P>Politicians have to say no to this industry.  Far too many European and British politicians have not only said yes but they have sold themselves, their own integrity and the health and well being of this and future generations.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's very positive attitude to the Fianna Fáil amendment which strengthens the motion and I am glad he has found it possible to accept it.  It is important that a motion of this kind should not be a matter of party political contention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues have been well rehearsed.  The Minister has rightly indicated the concern felt by Irish people at developments, particularly in Sellafield which some of us remember as Windscale.  This is a plant with an unfortunate history in terms of its management responsibilities and a series of accidents which occurred there and were concealed from the public.  The implications of that concealment are still being dealt with, not just in terms of the impact on the environment but also in terms of <Col N="254" /> the public's perception of the safety of this kind of plant.  People are concerned about the safety of nuclear fuel particularly in the light of Chernobyl. Many of us are concerned that the situation in Chernobyl has not been effectively addressed.  It is not just a question of the age or design of the reactor.  One of the major problems in a facility such as Chernobyl is the chain of accountability. People in charge at Chernobyl are subject to political direction and they can be told what to do, even though they may advise the authorities that certain practices are not recommended.  This is highly dangerous.</P>
    <P>Something similar applies in terms of the Sellafield project, namely, a lack of public accountability.  The authorities at BNFL appear, despite their public relations exercises, not to be accountable to the public either in Britain or Ireland.  In terms of what has happened at Sellafield, the British have turned out to be very bad neighbours.  They are not living up to the standards one would require from them.</P>
    <P>I am particularly saddened that requests from Ireland and other European countries to hold a wide ranging public inquiry into Thorp and have an environmental impact assessment undertaken have been refused by the British Government. BNFL hires extremely sophisticated and expensive public relations bodies to conduct their side of the case, but if they really believed the case they are making, why are they not prepared to be open about it?  If they have nothing to conceal, if the figures they produced are justifiable and the scientific case they put forward is genuine, why are they not prepared to put it to the acid test of an environmental impact study? There can only be one reason &mdash; they fear the result would be negative for them.</P>
    <P>The real goals of BNFL seem to be commercial and for that reason I suspect them.  The materials they deal with have lives of many hundreds of years and people will have to cope with the results long after we are dead.  We are not just dealing with plans to cope with the generating capacity at Sellafield with its outdated Magnox reactors we are dealing with a commercial proposition to bring into this part of the British Isles spent fuels which other countries have wisely decided not to store on their own territory. This has negative implications and considerable dangers for this country.  It is surprising that the European Commission gave an opinion that the implementation of the plan for the disposal of this radioactive waste from Thorp was not liable, either in normal operation or in the case of a range of accident scenarios, to result in radioactive contamination significant, from the point of view of health, water, soil or air space of another member State.  It is incredible that they could have come to that conclusion especially in the light of an incident such as Chernobyl, which clearly demonstrated that radioactivity does not <Col N="255" /> respect the easily drawn political boundaries on a map.</P>
    <P>The range of accident scenarios must have been very small.  Earlier this afternoon I was at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which listened to evidence from Mr. Ernest Rodker campaigning for the release of Mordechai Vanunu.</P>

      <P>Some of the initial concern about Sellafield was the increased incidence of Down's Syndrome.  There were eight cases over a short period of time where children were born to girls who had attended a small school in County Louth at a time when it was felt there was a nuclear incident in Sellafield.  This was believed to have been part of the cause of the incidence of Down's Syndrome.  A small survey conducted by the late Dr. Patricia Sheehan and Professor Irene Hillary is now being extended and Dr. Geoffrey Deane, former director of the Medical Research Board, is taking in a larger area of County Louth so we should get more information on this in the near future.  I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and his acceptance of the Fianna Fáil amendment.  Irrespective of political divides, we all want Sellafield closed as we regard it as being inherently unsafe and a serious environmental hazard.  I endorse Senator O'Toole's comment that environmental issues do not belong to any one political party or Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of what the Minister said this evening, and his responses to questions in the Dáil on 24 October, there is no great difference between the substance of what he said compared to several of his predecessors speaking in debates here and elsewhere.  However, there are two differences.  The first is he will now meet STAD, whom I compliment and congratulate on their court victory, and the second is in respect of NIREX.  It is not surprising that the Government was not represented at the inquiry on Thorp which took place in 1977.  There was a public consultation process subsequent to that.  It is extraordinary that one of the determining authorities in allowing Thorp to proceed was the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Its competence in the matter would have to be called into question.  On 15 December, 1993 the British Embassy issued a press release on Thorp saying public consultation was held following which the Inspectorate reported that the draft authorisations would &ldquo;effectively protect human health, the safety of the food chain and the environment generally&rdquo;.  Further consultation took place after that in which 42,000 responses <Col N="256" /> were received.  There is a contrast between the responses received and the assertion that it would effectively protect human health, the safety of the food chain and the environment generally.  That must be called into question.</P>
    <P>What can be done to advance our case practically, realistically and legally in closing the plant and what action can be taken through the courts?  The Minister of State and I realise we are subject to international agreements and many, if not all, our European partners use nuclear energy so most of them have a vested interest in the maintenance of Sellafield and Thorp.</P>
    <P>The question of the safety of the plant arises. The advertisements about the virtues of BNFL seen almost daily on British television are offensive but if they are prepared to stand over what is said in those advertisements on the safety of the plant, it follows that there should be no objection at any level to allowing an independent inspectorate to enter the plant and to check if it is safe.  There is such an authority.  The International Atomic Energy Agency in Austria has expertise in this area.  I commend the work done by the Radiological Protection Institute but it can only work at one remove.  The British Government will not allow the Institute into Thorp, although it would be great if they did agree.  Operating at one remove means we have an arm tied behind our back.  If the plant is safe there should be no objection to allowing independent monitoring.</P>
    <P>One of the most disturbing things to emerge, apart from the Minister of State's revelation about the potential for devastation on a huge scale, was what we saw on television about Dounreay.  There was a waste shaft which had its top blown off by an explosion and it took 20 years for the facts to emerge.  That is an appalling indictment of that industry and its disregard for human life and the environment.</P>
    <P>When the case was taken by Lancashire County Council and Greenpeace to the High Court in London, it was disappointing that the Irish Government was not joined in it.  That should have been done and the courageous people from Dundalk should have been given financial support and every assistance by the Government because they were performing a valuable public duty.</P>
    <P>It is pleasing that the Minister of State is to consult with and make documents available to them because it contrasts with an answer he gave in the Dáil.  He said he was advised that it would not be prudent or to the State's advantage to divulge details about the authorship and date of publication and content of such studies.  That is a slightly different matter and I am not accusing him of misleading the Dáil but it is a slightly different emphasis.  What initiatives can we take? One is to pursue objective inspection.  There is also the Paris Convention to which the Minister <Col N="257" /> of State referred.  We could have been more active on that in the past and we have mentioned that previously in the House.</P>
    <P>What initiatives can be taken to ensure that this environmental obscenity is closed down forever? These matters have been raised continuously by previous Ministers at European Council level and the response has not been favourable.  If legal action can be taken it should be taken.  Whatever assistance can be given to the Dundalk group should be given.  They are to be congratulated for again bringing to the fore a matter of huge environmental consequence which has the potential to damage life and cause death, if it has not already done so.  The facility should be closed.</P>

      <P>I support the motion and the amendment.  I congratulate the Minister of State for his persistence and energy in ensuring that this issue is fought at every level in order to secure the elimination of a disaster that is waiting to happen.  Experience elsewhere, especially in Chernobyl, has shown that Sellafield and the difficulties encountered there by British Nuclear Fuels are indicative of potential disaster.  One hates to imagine the effect it would have on Ireland, and especially its eastern coast.</P>
      <P>It is accepted by most experts that Sellafield is the cause of health problems among people living on our eastern coast; it is the cause of serious pollution problems in the Irish Sea and it introduces radioactive material into the food chain.  I have no doubt that it has a serious effect on people's health at a time when we are extremely sensitive about the quality of our food. There has been a long debate about the effects of the disposal of nuclear waste.  No matter how low the British claim it to be on fish life in the Irish Sea, it is a matter of extreme concern and Ireland must continue to oppose the nuclear industry in the UK.  We must object at every opportunity both at national and international level.  The public is extremely concerned about the issue.</P>
      <P>There is a high level of public awareness about the effects of the British nuclear industry on this country and its potential for the destruction of our State if a disaster occurred.  The problem of transporting nuclear material must be resolved. Nuclear material is being transported to Britain from as far away as Japan.  One is at a loss to explain why waste should be transported that distance to be disposed of in western Europe.  As a consequence we have the problem of storing and dealing with radioactive waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the problem of decommissioning nuclear reactors when they become redundant and the potential for nuclear fall-out at that time.  Nuclear power is a complex area and we must support and respond to public awareness and concern in Irish society.  We must also endeavour to educate the British public <Col N="258" /> about the danger in their midst as there is not the same level of concern there when there should be.  Every opportunity should be taken to press for the highest safety standards in Britain.  We have seen the reports on accidents which have occurred.  They were not as serious as they could have been, but we owe it to future generations to ensure a safe environment.  We also owe it to future generations to provide them with the quality of life we would wish for them.  It is our duty to fight for the protection of that quality of life at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Labour Party for bringing forward this motion and giving us the opportunity to put on record our support for the Minister of State and the Government in their efforts in this regard.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  This debate saw the House at its best.  There are times when the House unites and internal threats to the institution of the State is one such occasion.  On this occasion we are discussing an external threat.  There are issues which supersede narrow political dimensions and this is one such issue.  In that regard I thank my colleagues in Government, Fine Gael and Democratic Left, and the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Group in the Seanad, Senator Wright.  I had no difficulty accepting the Fianna Fáil amendment because it strengthened the wish of the House that this nightmare be brought to an end as swiftly as possible.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that at some stage the nuclear industry will cease to operate.  Harry Oppenheimer, when he saw the results of the first nuclear test explosion in the New Mexico desert, said that the world had been brought to the edge of a chasm from which there was no return.  I visited West Point in upstate New York and saw the bomb that was not dropped.  It is on display in the US military academy and it was destined to be dropped on Nagasaki had the Japanese not surrendered.  An industry that is uncontrollable in terms of its inability to control and dispose of its own waste within several lifetimes cannot possibly be described as viable in a human context.  I draw no distinction between dropping an atomic bomb from an airplane or having a nuclear plant sited on the ground.  Both have the same destructive force and results.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Labour Party was supported on this motion tonight and I am grateful to Senator Wright and the Fianna Fáil Group for their amendment.  On issues such as this, which transcend narrow political considerations, I hope the spirit of bipartisanship will continue.  I pay particular tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, for not only his work in the past but for the dedication he will bring to this task in the future.  I, my party and the House are grateful for his efforts, as was generously expressed this evening.</P>

      <P>County enterprise boards were established following discussions held under the 1992 Government.  The early indications were that there would be no room for elected county councillors on the boards.  This was subsequently modified to include the cathaoirleach of the local authority involved and one other elected member.  This matter exercised the minds of many of my colleagues in this House.  We made several representations to the then Fianna Fáil Ministers who were steering the legislation through the House, sadly to no avail.  The view was that the county enterprise boards, in their concept and execution, would be more widely representative of the communities in which they operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the lobby did not end with the change of Government and continued into the Labour and Fianna Fáil Administration where the Minister's predecessor, Minister of Finance, Deputy Quinn, was charged with tidying up the legislation and introducing the statutes which established the boards.  As a result of the representations made to him, he agreed there should be an expanded role for elected councillors and that there would be four members of the council and no distinction would be made between the cathaoirleach or an elected member. However, although he did not state publicly in the debates at that time, I know, because of the interest I and others had in this case, that he was not inclined to introduce expenses for members. It was a debatable point as to why he would not and was more philosophical and ideological than policy driven.  He believed that because these boards were, in the main, of a voluntary nature <Col N="260" />&ldquo;a better quality of county councillor&rdquo; would serve on them if the carrot of expenses were not dangled in front of them when the local authorities concerned were making the decisions as to who would be the four members.  I found this argument spurious.  In effect, it suggested that county councillors were only interested in going to board meetings and being nominated to committees because of the expenses.</P>
    <P>This has resulted in a growing discomfort and chorus of disapproval at what is seen as the somewhat discriminatory nature of this decision.  While many of those serving on these boards do not receive expenses from the Exchequer or any Department, they receive some form of allowance from the representative organisations. This means that locally elected councillors now have to rise at all hours in the morning.  In County Mayo, Councillor Pádraig Cosgrave says that in order to discharge his duties as a member of the Mayo County Enterprise Board, he has to rise at seven o'clock in the morning.  Most of his working day is gone and he, as a farmer, finds this an intolerable burden on him and his family.  He believes it should be ended.  I concur with that view.  I have experienced the functioning of the county enterprise boards and seen proof of the integrity and commitment of councillors on boards.  They continue to play a significant role in the development of county enterprise boards. The least the Government can do is to give them some form of travelling allowance which will help to defray the financial burden placed on those who are loyal and voluntary public servants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mooney and I are not concerned about the money but about the humiliation of an elected local authority member who is in a minority on a county enterprise board. County enterprise boards were set up in a blaze of publicity.  We were told communities would decide on matters but the boards are useless. They would be better if there were a greater input by local authority members who should have some responsibility.  I listened to Commissioner Wulf-Mathies, who is responsible for regional development, speak about accountability.  My county enterprise board is laced with people who have no experience but have an allegiance to the Labour Party.  Our county manager, who is an excellent manager and chairman, was not able to attend the last county enterprise board meeting.  Although there were four local authority members on the board, none could act as vice chairman.  We had to ask a Labour Party hack with no experience which was embarrassing and humiliating for elected local representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> While I accept the Minister for Enterprise and Employment's concern about employment and job creation, county enterprise boards are going nowhere.  People have no confidence in them nor is there commitment at any level.  Funding is used to pay administration costs and the expenses of staff going out to look at small jobs.  Last December the Donegal County Enterprise Partnership Board had projects worth £1.1 million but it only received £90,000 on 1 January. That was the most embarrassing situation I have faced as a member of a body.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney was right to focus attention on the position of council members on county enterprise boards.  I urge the Minister to reappraise the value and experience of council members who would be enthusiastic about participating in these boards.  I look forward to the day when the Minister restructures the county enterprise boards without lacing them with people who only have an allegiance to the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fundamental need to rethink the county enterprise boards, a point which has been well made.  The principle we are discussing is one of equity.  It is neither just nor fair but downright iniquitous that councillors who, by and large, give voluntarily of their time should not be recompensed for the time they invest on county enterprise boards or for out of pocket expenses, such as travelling expenses. That is not a mean-spirited suggestion nor is it to say that councillors are in it only for what they can get out of it.  Councillors who represent their communities make a value contribution and it is not fair or reasonable to expect them to do so without being recompensed for, at least, out of pocket expenses.</P>
      <P>There is a propensity by central Government, in particular at administrative level, to downgrade the role of the county councillor and the elected representative in every area.  This is part of that thinking which is centrist, negative and antidemocratic. To regard councillors as some form of lesser being, which is implicit in this attitude, is to turn one's face against the evidence.  Elected representatives have a unique feature which places them above representatives of the Civil Service, local government, local enterprise or the staff members of the functional areas of Government, the State sponsored bodies, that is, they have a democratic imprimatur.  They are selected and go before the people who pass judgment on them.  We do not have the right to pass judgment on county managers, county secretaries or on other public servants who serve on these boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The negative approach being adopted to county councillors and elected representatives is reflected by the mean-spirited attitude adopted by central Government which goes back a <Col N="262" /> number of years.  I ask the Minister to take on board Senator Mooney's well-founded proposition.  It is not only in the interest of Fianna Fáil councillors but those from Fine Gael, Labour, Democratic Left and Independents who serve the people.  We should elevate and celebrate the role of the local elected councillor and accede to the request in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for raising this issue and a wider debate on the role of the county enterprise board which was implicit in what was said.  My response is geared to Senator Mooney's original matter.  When the county enterprise boards were established it was recognised that local authority members had a distinctive role to play.  Unlike many other local initiatives, the councillor's role is a core part of the county enterprise board.</P>
      <P>The blanket policy has been that travelling expenses are not provided out of money available for enterprise and development.  That has been applied across the board.  It is easy to understand the decision that uniform entitlement to travelling expenses would not be part of this.  It was an attempt to harness community support which was live and strong and to develop and channel that into the creation of enterprise.  There was a sense that we had to focus resources on enterprise creation rather than on administrative overheads.</P>
      <P>Having said that, it was implicit that if participation caused hardship for people, the board could use its administrative funds to ease the problems of those who might be at a disadvantage.  If we want representatives of the unemployed to participate, we must be sensitive to that.  The approach was that, on an exceptional basis, the county enterprise board would be able to ensure broad participation by meeting such expenses.  That is different from providing in statute for the payment of travelling expenses for every member.  I understand why that line was taken.  I accept it creates difficulties and people will be out of pocket if they participate but it is applied uniformly to all members.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is their affair.  The setting up of these boards was designed to harness local enthusiasm and to give communities a vehicle in which to become involved.  They were not designed to cover incidental expenses.  If disadvantaged groups suffer a particular hardship, the county enterprise board could make provision for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject the suggestion that this is a useless vehicle.  Any vehicle must be evaluated and I would like to see the impact of such evaluation. Some 4,663 full-time jobs and 1,078 part-time jobs <Col N="263" /> have been created at a cost of approximately £3,500 per job, which is a good performance. People will ask if these jobs will survive in the long term.  It is important to determine if these are better projects because of the support of the county enterprise boards.  The county enterprise boards have not taken the easy route of grant aiding everything which comes their way.  People on the board must be able to say they have a limited budget so they cannot help everyone.  Part of the task of the county enterprise boards is to sift through the projects and decide which is the most viable.  They must also develop supports to make these projects a success.  While the jury is out on these boards, I am happy they are having an impact and that they will prove themselves in the long term.</P>
    <P>Senators said there should be a stronger democratic input to these boards.  I would like to see how such bodies interact with local authorities.  For example, Dublin Port should present its plans to Dublin Corporation for scrutiny by local authority members and many local bodies should have that degree of scrutiny in relation to local authority members.</P>
    <P>This is a novel vehicle which has the support of many people, including trade unions, employers and community and voluntary groups.  The early indications are that it is adding value and we should review it to see if it needs greater democratic scrutiny.  We must take a pragmatic approach to this issue.  If people are experiencing hardship, money should be given to them at the board's discretion.  However, we should not set up a permanent payment structure for travelling expenses for all members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise this issue which has reached crisis point.  North-east County Wicklow has witnessed an extraordinary expansion in population in the past 20 years.  The population in the Greystones, Kilcoole, Delgany, Newcastle and Newtownmountkennedy areas has grown out of all proportion.  I remember moving to Greystones in 1971 when it was a small sleepy village; it is now a large thriving town.  Greystones has one second level school, St. David's, which serves the children of the hinterland.  However, there is no second level school in Kilcoole to serve the children of Newcastle and Newtownmountkennedy.</P>
      <P>As a result of an earlier Adjournment debate here, some changes were made to allow children from the Newtownmountkennedy, Newcastle and Kilcoole areas to be bused to the schools in Wicklow town which had spare capacity. However, in the past two or three years we have witnessed an extraordinary increase in house building in Wicklow town, in the greater Greystones area and in Bray which has led to an increase in population.  There is virtually no space available in any second level school between Wicklow town and the Dublin border.  Although Department of Education officials will insist at the beginning of each academic year that there may be some places available in one school when the recruitment process is completed, there are no spaces available in the majority of schools. Parents are denied the choice to send their girls to a girls school and their boys to a boys school because of the lack of spaces.</P>
      <P>A decade ago Wicklow County Council bought an 11 acre site in Kilcoole, adjacent to the industrial estate, on behalf of Wicklow vocational education committee.  That site was earmarked because the council representatives from all parties insisted that it should be bought for the building of the second level school.  Last year, as a result of the building of the Druid's Glen golf course, the original site changed hands because Wicklow County Council sold it to the developers.  It made a nice profit on the transaction which it used to purchase a ten acre site for the second level school in Kilcoole. Wicklow County Council has exhausted its patience waiting for the Department of Education to sanction the school.  It has now formulated plans to build much needed social housing on that site.  It is in negotiation for other lands, some of which may be earmarked for the building of a second level school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a crisis in second level education in north Wicklow.  The population is rapidly <Col N="265" /> expanding in Wicklow town.  The schools in Wicklow town, which were able to take the students from Newcastle, Newtownmountkennedy and Kilcoole, will not be able to do that in the next two or three years.  The school in Greystones is already full to and beyond capacity.  The second level schools in Bray are not capable of taking in the additional population as a result of the expansion of house building activities in north Wicklow.  In 1985 it was decided in principle that there would be a new second level school in the Kilcoole area.  It is now 1996 and, as yet, Wicklow vocational education committee has not been given the green light for this school project.  It has asked for an urgent meeting with the Minister for Education to discuss this issue.</P>
    <P>I hope to get some indication that progress is at last being made because, if not, I will be back here in six months time.  We have seen the population figures for north-east Wicklow and the type of demographic movement there.  The population trend in second level education in other parts of the country does not apply in north-east Wicklow.  In places such as Greystones, Newcastle, Newtownmountkennedy and Kilcoole, there is a real educational crisis.</P>
    <P>There has been bureaucratic indifference and indolence on this issue from numerous Administrations dating back to the late 1980s and the response to requests from the locality has been negative.  A generation of young boys and girls in the area is being disadvantaged.  That is not good enough.  The challenges the children of Newtownmountkennedy, Newcastle, Greystones and Kilcoole face in entering third level education are the same as those of children in other parts of Ireland.  This and previous Administrations, including Fianna Fáil Governments, have not cherished the children of that part of Ireland equally.  We guarantee Irish children that they will be cherished equally.  The children in north east Wicklow are being disadvantaged.  I ask for progress on this.  I wish to see the green light for that second level school. I hope we do not have to wait until another election is imminent to obtain another promise on the issue.  We should have progress now.</P>

I represent the Minister for Education and will undertake to inform the Minister of the Senator's observations which possibly amplify what is dealt with in the reply.  I will bring it to her attention that certain pupils cannot obtain placement, particularly those who wish to opt for single sex schools, and that there is a lack of space in schools.</P>

    <P>Kilcoole is in the Bray-Greystones catchment area of Wicklow.  The majority of pupils in the area attend post primary schools in Greystones and Bray but some also attend post primary schools in Wicklow town.  In 1994, the Minister for Education approved a revised transport arrangement to provide full transport for pupils <Col N="266" /> in the general Kilcoole area to Wicklow town as well as to schools in the Bray-Greystones catchment.</P>
    <P>In January 1985, the former Minister for Education, Mrs. Gemma Hussey, approved a new second level school for Kilcoole and Newtownmountkennedy in view of the then anticipated growth in population in the area. County Wicklow vocational education committee made arrangements to purchase a ten acre site at Kilcoole from Wicklow County Council for the proposed school.  In 1988, however, it was decided not to proceed with the proposed school as existing schools were in a position to cater for all pupils seeking places.  The Department withdrew its sanction for the purchase of the site.  It is understood that the site is not now available and that an alternative site has been identified by the local authority which I understand is now being assigned for social housing.</P>
    <P>In late 1989, County Wicklow vocational education committee sought the Department's approval for the exchange of the site owned by Wicklow County Council at Kilcoole for the site and buildings then used as the vocational school in Rathdrum which were to become vacant.  The Department formally instructed the vocational education committee in December 1991 that it was not in a position to sanction the proposed exchange and that the Rathdrum site must be disposed of as soon as it became vacant.  This is currently being disposed of to the council.</P>
    <P>There are seven post primary schools in the general area, including a fee paying school and an all Irish school in Bray, one in Greystones and four in Wicklow town including the east Glendalough school.  Previous reviews carried out by the Department indicated that these schools between them can cater for the demand for pupil places.  The planning section of the Department will shortly commence a review of the post primary school needs of the general area from Bray to Wicklow town.  The key factors which will influence the need or otherwise for a school for Kilcoole will be the capacity of the existing schools to continue to cater for the area, demographic trends and new housing developments which I understand are significant, and this reflects what the Senator said.  When this review is completed and assessed, the Minister will be in a position to decide whether a post primary school is needed for Kilcoole.  In the meantime, it would not be prudent for the Department to sanction the purchase of the site.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister is handling, in his own courteous way, a brief which has been written by another Department but if he were from the Department of Education, I would give him a sharp response.  The person who wrote that brief should be shot.  That is an appalling response.</P>

      <P>This is a plea not just from me but from the Minister's party colleagues on Wicklow County Council and vocational education committee.  If Senator Ross were present he would wish to be associated with it.  This is a real <Col N="268" /> crisis and I ask for the Minister for Education to be informed of our views.</P>
