      <P>I have notice from Senator Ormonde that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure the retention of a second teacher in Scoil Naomh Mhuire, Castlegal, County Sligo. </P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Farrelly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education when a design team will be appointed for an extension to Kells community school, Kells, County Meath; and the reason for the delay in bringing the much needed extension to completion. </P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to expedite the provision of a new primary school for Kilkee, County Clare, in view of the fact that the convent school has been condemned; and the reason for the delay in proceeding with the project. </P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1690" /> The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding for a swimming pool in Wicklow town. </P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ormonde's and Senator Farrelly's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2 and 17, motion 34. Item 1 will be taken until 1 o'clock and there will be a sos until 2 p.m.  Item 2 will be taken from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. and item 17, motion 34, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  A period of 20 minutes per spokesperson is suggested and 15 minutes thereafter on items 1 and 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business as outlined is agreed to.  In view of events in the Lower House yesterday, the Acting Leader should urge the Government to initiate more legislation in this House.  In particular, I strongly recommend her to urge the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to initiate his second attempt on the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Bill in this House.  In that way we may have a tram extended to the airport, as it should be, by the year 2000.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Government might have expected to lose two votes here yesterday but did not, and the growing minority in the Lower House, more legislation should be initiated in the Seanad.  Could the Acting Leader arrange for Senator Cosgrave and the other Whips to visit the Whips in the Dáil to explain how they are so successful in winning votes here when they cannot win them in the Lower House?</P>

      <P>On a more serious point, we welcome the appointment of former US Senator, George Mitchell, to the chair of the forum in the North.  We hope those parties who felt they could not agree to his chairmanship will now reconsider and enter the talks.  We hope the IRA will restore the ceasefire so that Sinn Féin can participate and we can progress to the meaningful discussions required to bring peace to this island.</P>

      <P>There are times when one has to ramble in this House.  A report has been issued this morning which deals with the protection of children <Col N="1693" /> in sport.  Unfortunately, the headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> claims that the new guidelines &ldquo;will&rdquo; protect children in sport from abuse.  I do not know how anybody can claim in a headline that something will protect children.</P>
      <P>The substance of the report must be addressed by this House.  I have been involved in sport at many levels and I have not encountered instances of abuse.  I have seen reports of abuse and there is no doubt that it happens. However, it goes against the grain to think that anybody who gets involved in sports coaching, whether professional or amateur, will have to get clearance from the Garda to do so.  That will be the death knell of sport.  It means that if somebody volunteers to do a job they will have to get a clearance certificate from the Garda.  I do not know what sporting bodies were involved in this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious question and it should be addressed by the Oireachtas, and particularly by this House, before the the personal lives of many good people involved in sports coaching is called into question by virtue of the fact that they will have to seek clearance from the Garda.  It is a nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>What arrangements have been made to send the Freedom of Information Bill, which passed Second Stage in this House, to a committee for Committee Stage?  A select commitee of the Dáil is currently looking at the draft heads of a Government Bill. However, the Freedom of Information Bill, which was introduced over a year ago and passed Second Stage, should get precedence over that Bill.  At least it has been accepted by one House of the Oireachtas while the other Bill has not proceeded beyond discussing the draft heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1694" /> In the recently published Government package for public service reform, legislation on the curtailment of the concept of ministerial responsibility was promised.  This would be an excellent forum to deal with that legislation.  It would be more suitable than the Dáil and the Bill could be progressed before it reaches the bearpit of Dáil politics.</P>
    <P>The Acting Leader of the news emanating from Burma of yet another clampdown on the democratic movement.  In particular, there appears to be a threat to the life and liberty of Ms Aung San Suu kyi, the leader of the democratic people of Burma.  This House should at some stage in the future be given an opportunity to consider infringements on human rights worldwide.</P>

      <P>Senator Wright and Senator Dardis raised the question of introducing more legislation in the Upper House.  The An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill is being introduced in the Seanad today.

      <P>Senator Dardis also referred to the talks in Northern Ireland.  I, too, welcome the fact that progress was made late last night with regard to Mr. Mitchell's role in the talks. We wish them well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGowan asked about the new house grant scheme.  I agree with the Cathaoirleach that it would be a suitable matter for an Adjournment debate.  Senator Mulcahy mentioned the <Col N="1695" /> national convention centre.  It might be a suitable matter for the Adjournment but it could be debated in a wider context. There have been many calls for a debate on tourism, which were heard sympathetically by the Leader of the House, and that issue could be debated in that context.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the document introduced by the Minister of State.  Deputy Allen, yesterday on the protection of children in sport.  We have not had many debates on sport and it would be a suitable topic for discussion. The timeframe before the summer recess is tight; but if there is time available, sport would be a suitable subject for a short debate.  Senator Roche mentioned the Freedom of Information Bill. I am aware that there are procedural difficulties in moving the Bill forward but I will discuss it with the Leader of the House on his return and ascertain what progress can be made.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to ministerial responsibility and local government reform.  Last week I suggested holding a debate on the financing of local government.  There is great interest in that area on the part of Members of the House and I hope we will have an opportunity to debate it. There is also a great deal of interest in foreign affairs and human rights issues. We have held debates in the past on East Timor and other problem areas so I hope it will be possible to facilitate Senator Roche's request.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1696" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan) Jimmy Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a simple and straightforward Bill.  Its purpose is to increase the membership of An Bord Bia and each of its two subsidiary boards by one, and to provide for the filling of these additional places by consumers' representatives. The problems currently being experienced in the beef sector have brought home to us, as never before, just how consumer perceptions and concerns can impact on our food industry and what an important component of the industry the consumer dimension is.  That is a dimension of which An Bord Bia is well aware.</P>
      <P>As a promotion and market development agency An Bord Bia does not have any statutory functions in relation to food safety.  That is as it should be. Food safety is a regulatory function which should be exercised by the regulatory authorities.  This does not mean that the board is not conscious of or concerned about consumer requirements and fears, quite the contrary.  As required by the legislation under which it was established &mdash; An Bord Bia Act, 1994 &mdash; the members of the board and its two subsidiary boards are all persons with knowledge and experience of consumer requirements.  Anybody who doubts this has only to look at the membership lists for the board and its subsidiaries. These include the chairmen and top executives of some of our most prominient food companies, whose success is due in no small measure to the attention which they give to the needs and requirements of their consumer customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of that influence can be seen very clearly in the board's five year development strategy published last year.  The basic tenet of that strategy is to build stronger and better linkages <Col N="1697" /> between the industry and the market-place. The current BSE crisis is a clear example of that strategy in operation.  In conjunction with my Department, the board has worked tirelessly, both at home and abroad, to allay the fears and concerns of consumers.  The aim of this Bill is not, therefore, to rectify any deficiencies in the board's structures and operating procedures but to reinforce the very strong consumer dimension which it already has.</P>
    <P>An Board Bia has been in existence for just over 18 months and during that time it has notched up an impressive list of achievements.  Within six months of its inception it published its five year market development strategy.  That strategy was devised following a period of intensive research and a comprehensive consultation process involving all sectors of the industry, including consumers. It sets out in detail how the board will carry out its statutory remit to promote, develop and assist the marketing of Irish food and how it will fulfil the task assigned to it under the national development strategy for the food industry of implementing the marketing and promotion measure of the Structural Fund sub-programme for the industry.  The implementation of that strategy is now well under way.  Two company grant schemes have been put in place and the board has undertaken a comprehensive range of promotion and marketing activities.</P>
    <P>The board's probably most important undertaking to date is taking place as we speak, which is the Horizons food and drink exhibition and conference at the RDS.  The exhibition is the largest ever single display of Irish food and drink and has attracted 600 buyers from 30 countries, something of which to be proud.  I advise Senators to visit the RDS where they would all be very welcome. There is an absence of politicians there at the moment for various reasons.  Senators, such as Senator Rory Kiely who is very interested in food, should visit this impressive exhibition.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the Bill is short and uncomplicated.  Section 1 is <Col N="1698" /> a short definition section.  Sections 2, 3 and 4 provide that the membership of the board and each of its subsidiary boards shall be increased by one, that one member of each board shall be appointed on the nomination of organisations which the Minister considers to be representative of consumers, and for certain minor consequential changes resulting from these amendments.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is a saver provision inserted on the advice of the Attorney General's Office to safeguard the position of persons who have already been appointed to the board and subsidiary boards. Section 6 provides for the Short Title and collective citation and construction of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his invitation to the RDS which I accept.  This is the third An Bord Bia Bill since 1994.  This Bill is an inadequate and belated response to a crisis in the Irish food industry by a Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry who set out to systematically ignore consumers.  From his first day in office the Minister, Deputy Yates, wedded himself to a producer agenda and the legitimate interests of consumers and processors alike were ignored.  The Minister's agenda was a political one based on the simple calculation that it was among farmers that votes could be recovered for Fine Gael.  Processors were numerically insignificant while consumers were too disparate and disorganised a group to count.  The Minister's Road to Damascus conversion at the food fair yesterday is welcome, if it is genuine.  It is, however, belated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The occurrence of such a ludicrous situation which makes it necessary to bring forward legislation at this point in the life of An Bord Bia to allow for representatives of consumer groups underlines the futility of the policy that has prevailed to date.  The only moves made to date by the Minister, Deputy Yates, in relation to An Bord Bia have been to strengthen farmer representation on the board by appointing, as of right, the <Col N="1699" /> presidents of the IFA and ICMSA.  The Minister felt so strongly about the necessity to do this that he introduced amending legislation in 1995.  He was not prepared, however, to countenance the representatives of consumers being recognised at all, let alone being treated on an equal footing.  The background to the introduction of this Bill is a series of sorely missed opportunities.  An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill, 1996, is a desperate measure from a desperate Minister in desperate circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not look too desperate at the Horizons exhibition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Putting a token consumer representative on An Bord Bia will not materially affect consumer confidence. The ineffectualness of the step being proposed is underlined by its isolation. Since the House of Commons announcement on the BSE crisis on 20 March there has been absolutely no concerted political response from this Government.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has worked to keep the political spotlight on the crisis.  Besides numerous occasions on which the matter has been raised in the Seanad, there have also been three separate debates on the issue in the Dáil.  In proper reflection of the importance of this issue to the entire economy, no issue other than Northern Ireland has received such sustained attention from my party in recent times.  Two of the three Dáil debates were held in Fianna Fáil Private Members' time, while the third was held in response to persistent demands from Fianna Fáil.  There was also a Seanad Adjournment debate on the issue and one during Fianna Fáil's Private Members' time.  We are looking forward to the full debate on agriculture promised by the Leader of the House before the end of the session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has, from the start of the BSE crisis, advocated a concerted political campaign for Ministers to support the beef industry.  There is a good story to tell about Irish beef to our consumers <Col N="1700" /> at home and abroad.  The tragedy for our beef industry is that this positive message has not been communicated. Ironically, and in spite of the commanding position held by farmers in the board rooms of the agri-business sector, farmers have been the first and worst affected victims of this crisis.  Consumers at home and across our markets were not persuaded by assurances from bodies from which they were largely excluded.  In our crucial Middle East markets this loss of confidence was exacerbated by the complete failure of any Minister to make a personal pitch for Irish beef.</P>
    <P>The position of our beef industry was further undermined by our explicable lack of a system of total traceability, which means our competitors have been able to undermine our position in the marketplace.  Fianna Fáil has repeatedly called for such a system to be put in place.  The Minister is quoted in the newspapers this morning as saying that a system &ldquo;might&rdquo; be in place in two years time.  The Minister has been in Government for 17 months and his response, although welcome, is belated.</P>
    <P>The ludicrousness of the current situation is well illustrated by Operation Matador on the Border, which was put in place in an attempt to ring fence the Southern herd from their cousins in the Six Counties.  The Garda has estimated the cost of the operation at £400,000 per week, which puts the annual cost of the operation at over £20 million.  In response to questions from the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Agriculture, Deputy Cowen, last week the Minister, Deputy Yates, conceded an annual cost of £16 million.  I am sure the Garda would be delighted to hear about the £4 million savings to be made in its operations. The real issue is that a computer system to allow for the total traceability of all animals which would be compatible with the existing system in Northern Ireland could, in the Minister's own estimate, be put in place for between £10 million and £14 million.  This estimate was given by the Minister to the Dáil <Col N="1701" /> Committee reviewing his Department's Estimates last week.</P>
    <P>When the Minister, Deputy Yates, announced his proposal yesterday to install a system for traceability, he had whittled the cost down to a firm £12 million.  I would like to know where the missing millions have gone.  I also want to know if this £12 million is coming out of the existing budget, if extra money will be provided by the Government or if farmers will have to eventually pick up the costs in some form.  It is an indictment of this Government that no system for traceability of stock is in place 17 months after the Minister came into office.  The plan he announced yesterday is one that &ldquo;might&rdquo; be in place within two years.</P>
    <P>Operation Matador is a gross waste of Garda time.  If the Minister is serious about restoring consumer confidence, a comprehensive system for the traceability of all stock must be put in place sooner rather than later.  Put the gardaí back on the beat to deal with drugs, drug dealers and murders.  We cannot afford to have our gardaí standing behind ditches on the Border waiting for Daisy and her pals to come south. The present operation is a shameful waste of resources.  It is time, over three months after the House of Commons announcement, to move on from the stop gap and theatrical measures that both this Bill and Operation Matador represent.</P>
    <P>From the beginning, Fianna Fáil has put forward a cogent political programme to deal with the BSE crisis.  On the issue of consumer confidence, which this Bill is supposed to address, Fianna Fáil wants an independent agency set up that has the duty to guarantee the integrity of the food chain at all points.  It is feasible that veterinary inspection functions of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the environmental health officers and some or all of the functions of the Drugs Advisory Board might be included in such a body.  It is lamentable that far from proposing the fundamental reforms that are necessary, <Col N="1702" /> the Minister has confined himself to the window dressing allowed for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There must be a sustained campaign by Ministers in our main markets.  The refusal by Government Ministers to make a personal pitch for Irish beef in third countries allowed the bottom to fall out of Irish beef sales without a hand being lifted.  To date, no Government Minister has visited Libya, Egypt or Saudi Arabia &mdash; our most important third country markets.</P>
    <P>Ireland, the most severely affected of all EU countries, has to date failed to have its urgent concerns addressed at EU level.  On the eve of Ireland assuming the EU Presidency, and three months after the House of Commons announcement, the Minister has failed to build support for Ireland's position. The £57 million on offer is totally unsatisfactory. While the Minister complains publicly about the deal, he has not delivered anything better.  The lack of progress on the issue can be measured by the inability of the Taoiseach to achieve a united position with Chancellor Kohl on the matter during his recent visit to Germany.  Ireland must get its problems addressed at EU level.</P>
    <P>There must be total traceability of all cattle.  The Minister is wasting scarce Garda resources on a short term fire brigade measure while a value for money, long term alternative is being ignored.  Only total traceability can underpin the integrity of the national herd in the long term.</P>
    <P>Teagasc, the body charged with working with farmers to achieve higher efficiency and standards, must be given the personnel to allow it fulfil its mandate. Teagasc has been starved of resources by this Minister.  The &ldquo;new blood&rdquo; promised has not been delivered.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on the ground advising them on the production and quality of their beef.  It is ironic that when the BSE crisis is at its height, Teagasc has had to let go its only research scientist working on organic farming. This scientist, based at Johnstown Castle, operated a research programme into the production of organic beef. Although production of organic beef cannot keep pace with demand, Teagasc did not have the resources available to them to keep the research programme going.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will vote for this Bill because we believe that Irish agri-business must be consumer driven.  The token consumer representative that this Bill allows for is better than nothing, if only just.</P>
      <P>Let there be no doubt, that three months after the BSE announcement in the House of Commons, this Bill is a pathetic response to the crisis.  It is a step the Minister himself strongly resisted in fairer weather.  The BSE crisis requires a concerted political response from the Government as a whole.  Sadly, there is no sign of that.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I am also delighted to hear the subject of Teagasc being introduced.  I thank the Minister for reappointing two persons on contract to the advisory service in Longford.  This matter caused concern because of the embargo.  I am happy the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Minister for Finance and the board of Teagasc have reintroduced these contracts.  The advisory service in County Longford has one more adviser than three years ago.  We were criticised left, right and centre because of socalled decimation.  The whole Teagasc advisory service was decimated in 1988. That was called good government.  The Members of the Opposition know that. I am surprised to hear criticism coming from that source when their own Minister for Finance decimated the service and nobody was put in their place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1704" /> I welcome this Bill.  It is a development which has been called for by consumers in the past year.  The Minister has shown his foresight and interest in all aspects of food in this country.  The worst thing we could do, and it has happened again today, is blame the Government for BSE.  That is the policy now.  Fianna Fail should have responsibility. This is the second, if not the primary national industry.  The more we talk about it, the more we talk it down. Fianna Fail should ensure they speak with responsibility because the eyes of our customers across the world are watching this House.  They should be careful of what they say.  One can understand the temptation to lash the Minister of the day &mdash; that is politics.  It is important that, as a major food producing nation, the right image is conveyed abroad.  We have the right image and we can only do damage to ourselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The Minister has put a consumer representative on the board.  An Bord Bia, as mentioned by the Minister of State, has put on an exhibition in the RDS this week which proves what we have to offer.  I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State for doing a fine job in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in general terms and I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We may have a slagging match about what was not done, but I am positive about the Bill. It can pass very quickly as there are not a lot of speakers here.  We have had a general political barter.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to cover the important marketing area of the food industry.  The Bill is not comprehensive. It is a short measure and there are still serious gaps.  There is no representation from the fish processing industry.  There is a civil servant from the Department representing fish processors.  If we did not have fish processors in Donegal, the Irish fish industry would not exist.  The factory ships would take our fish and there would be no benefit to the Irish people who need the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> There is a European policy to review rural towns and villages.  Is the Minister serious?  How can Europe achieve its objective in building up rural towns and villages, especially fishing villages, if the industry is not protected?  The Minister should be realistic and take politics out of this; he should be courageous enough to appoint somebody to represent the fish processors.  It is not too late.  This is not written in stone.  It is an attempt to do something that is long overdue and very necessary.  I do not understand how any Minister or departmental officials can leave out the fish processors.  I am angry that they have been excluded because they have played a major role. They have gone abroad, marketed their products, added value and employed people.  Go to Killybegs or any other town with a major fish processing industry, and look at the number of people who are employed there.</P>
    <P>The average number in Europe per fisherman out at sea is six and a half persons employed on shore; our average is one and a half persons per fisherman. There is a serious gap and the Minister should recognise this.  This Bill does not help those involved in the fish processing industry.  The Minister's I Q is high enough to know that this is not a political barter.  I say this with sincerity and commitment.  The Minister should take it on board.  There is no loss of face in recognising that a mistake has been made.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider that aspect.</P>
    <P>I have experience of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  We have two civil servants from Belfast and two civil servants from Dublin as four commissioners managing the Foyle Fisheries Commission but nobody from the industry. The little man with the net says, forget about them all.  It is patriotic to push and challenge.  We are preaching this but nobody will listen.  We are out of touch.  The Minister should recognise that however good the person &mdash; and the person in charge of the Foyle Fisheries Commission is a civil servant and a very able person &mdash; he is not acceptable to the people on the ground.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1706" /> Whether it is the teachers' organisation, the nurses' organisation or any organisation it will have to be seen to have representation and an input from those it represents.</P>
    <P>The Foyle Fisheries Commission was a joint operation between North and South.  It has largely failed because successive governments &mdash; not this Minister of State or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry &mdash; have failed to recognise that the industry must be given the opportunity to participate.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this again.</P>
    <P>Every morning I listen to 7 o'clock news which covers the whole of Europe. Ireland is included with Britain every time we discuss the beef crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, when the British threaten the Europeans and the Europeans insist on a ban, we are put into the same category as Britain and all the countries which imposed a ban on British beef automatically included Irish beef.  The Minister is scurrying around Europe in an attempt to get them to accept a few tons of beef. In reality, there is a ban on Irish beef in most countries at the moment and there is no serious attempt being made to get that ban lifted.</P>
      <P>We have been very unsuccessful in projecting the clean image of Irish beef across the world.  Whether the British succeed in their fight with Europe, it does not concern us as we still have to represent our producers.  The British are forgetting that they could force the Europeans to lift the ban but the housewife who goes in to buy a few pounds of beef will not buy.  It is the consumer who has the answer and is the decision maker.  Britain can force Europe to partially or entirely lift the ban but the European consumers will not buy British beef.  We are perceived to be in the same category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish beef is not being promoted in France or any other country at the moment.  They are being nice and diplomatic when the matter comes up for discussion <Col N="1707" /> but it is going nowhere.  I have asked on numerous occasions for clarity in a statement about taking cows out.  I am not drifting into a discussion on the beef problem.  I have asked on numerous occasions that we be courageous enough to say we will take out all the cows that have served their useful lives producing milk for ten or whatever number of years and that have been dosed heavily.  I ask for that because we need to convince the consumer.  This Bill is about marketing and perception. We have to hope that it will do what is intended.</P>
    <P>As far as the beef industry is concerned, we must be positive.  We must make sure all our cattle are disease free, unlike Britain who say they will take out some of the older animals.  That will convince nobody.  What does &ldquo;some of the older animals&rdquo; mean?  It means nothing.  The consumer is fairly well informed these days.  Let us have enough courage to say that all the cows need to be taken out of the food chain to restore public confidence in the beef industry.</P>
    <P>Last night I had a meal with six people.  It was a bit of a joke to ask if one was eating beef.  This is not good enough; people looked at each other and said they would eat fish.  There is not a positive attitude towards the beef business, which is the backbone of the small farmers.  We pontificate about keeping families on the land but we do not have a positive attitude.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made my point about having a representative of the fish processing industry on the board.  My second appeal is to restore public confidence in the beef industry.  The Minister is just running around Europe, shaking hands and saying everybody believes Irish beef is free of disease, but nothing has been done on the ground to convince the people.  We need to adopt a positive approach to this industry which is the backbone of this country.  It was not always well managed by the beef magnates but they sought markets when it was a risk taking business and when <Col N="1708" /> the risk of not getting paid was high.  It was so lucrative that the big beef barons ran a cartel.  However, the average producer recognises that the beef industry is of paramount importance to Ireland. Beef producers must go out and sell and recognise that they must put their house in order.</P>
    <P>This Bill is too short.  It does not represent the entire food industry.  It is an attempt to recognise that there is a problem and that there must be more emphasis on producing quality control, selling and marketing.  Those people in the industry whose livelihoods depend on it should be part of the structure. This Bill is more of a political gesture than a serious attempt to involve them. I welcome the Bill for what it contains, but it is a miserable attempt to do a job that is long overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent BSE scare has probably brought home the fact that we cannot take for granted Ireland's green image upon which we have relied for so long.  We have not capitalised sufficiently on our justifiable reputation as a producer of top quality wholesome food.  Apart from the success of Kerrygold butter, we have very few branded products which can command top prices and which can retain market share in times of difficulty.  The Kerrygold brand has resulted in this country now selling more butter in Germany than in England and Ireland combined.  This is some achievement, but we need to do the same for more Irish products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the merging of An Bord Tráchtála and CBF and the livestock commission into An Bord Bia, which now has a pivotal role to play in promoting Irish food both at home and abroad.  The fundamental job at present, especially with regard to beef, is to convince the consumer of the whole-someness and purity of Irish beef.  This can only be done with some kind of credible quality assurance scheme, with definite traceability of the raw material in place.  To date, our attempts to establish such a scheme have not been adequate.  We must involve all State <Col N="1709" /> agencies in a co-ordinated and credible way.  An Bord Bia should lead the industry in establishing and developing a scheme which would ensure that raw materials which form part of the food chain are of the highest possible standards. Such a development would benefit the producer, the processor and all those involved in the marketing of food in the domestic and export markets.  The consumer demands such assurances.  I am pleased to see that An Bord Bia has produced guidelines for such a scheme and I hope they can be implemented without delay.</P>
    <P>While I support the board's policy in introducing tactical genetic branding and Irish identification where relevant, I wonder if this is enough.  Increasingly, many foods in Europe are sold under their own labels.  However, branding of Irish food, especially beef, could be very profitable if the requisite promotion and advertising capital were made available.</P>
    <P>However, the reduction of £3 million in the allocation to An Bord Bia in the Estimates suggest that this will not happen from central funds.  However, there must be scope for the industry, involving producer and processor, to provide funding through sales levies.  I urge the Government to match any contributions made in that way pound for pound. While a considerable amount of beef is exported to third country markets, the branding debate will not get the attention it deserves.  Germany is well underway to having such a scheme.  We must not ignore this important area.</P>
    <P>The recent visit by An Bord Bia to China, where a number of Irish companies were exposed to the rapidly expanding Asian food ingredient market, is an example of forward thinking and the support which Irish food companies require.  Similarly, the report by An Bord Bia on the marketing of Irish lamb is important.  It concluded that British lamb is outselling the Irish product at higher prices.  This kind of information, properly used in key national strategies, could pinpoint the successful way forward for Irish food products.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1710" /> This country has an ambitious developing plan for the food industry, involving a total investment of £640 million to the end of 1999.  An Bord Bia will have a pivotal role to play in this plan with the industry.  In this regard, I welcome the Horizons food promotion fare currently underway in the RDS. This is the biggest ever single promotion of Irish food and drink at which many of the key food buyers from abroad have been targeted by the board.  It is steps like this which will eventually succeed in portraying Ireland as a producer of the highest quality food and drink products, a reputation which we richly deserve.</P>
    <P>Beef is of the utmost importance to the economy.  It is not enough to have farmers or the industry certifying the product.  The consumer must also certify it before we can make progress.  This is a good Bill and has may support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Minister of State to the House as a man from my own county, this does not mean that I have the same welcome or enthusiasm for what brings him here today.  An Bord Bia was established only 17 or 18 months ago, yet already the Minister proposes that membership of the board be increased by one to include somebody from the consumers' interests.  However, as all present members of the board are consumers, I do not understand why he wishes to include one specifically.  Is it because he wishes to include somebody from the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party?  I hope not.  I hope the person appointed by the Minister will be good, responsible and respected.</P>
      <P>I do not have problems with the Bill, but I have a problem with the make up of the board.  There is a food fair in the RDS this week.  An Bord Bia has a huge stand at the fair, but An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has a stand in an isolated corner trying to sell fish.  How can this waste of money continue?  I am primarily interested in the fishing business, but I also have an interest in the beef industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> Not long ago the Government appointed the Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Marine to a position. I have no problem with the Assistant Secretary.  However, I have a huge problem with the fact that the Minister could not find somebody from the fishing industry to represent the fish processors of Ireland on An Bord Bia.  We owe them that much.  I was critical privately to a Minister from my own party with regard to the same point.  We have forgotten a fishing industry which is worth £300 million and gives employment to about 16,000 people.</P>
    <P>In light of the difficulties in Europe with beef and BSE, An Bord Bia should be doing more.  They should be out in Europe every day hammering home that there is nothing wrong with our beef and that it is the best beef.  They should be countering what Australia is doing.  The Australians are spreading rumours all over Europe in order to get their own beef into Europe because it is far cheaper.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to appoint a fish processor to the board.  A man who knows the business is needed rather than a front.  There are boards all over the country covering all walks of life which are full of people who know nothing about what they are representing. If the board is concerned with farming why not appoint a farmer and let him say what he has to say?  Why not appoint a fisherman rather than somebody from the Department of the Marine, the same Department which destroyed the fishing industry and has done nothing for it?  I have to be very strong on this point because my reason for speaking is to stress that we must look after fishermen.  I appeal to the Minister to consider appointing somebody from the fish processing industry when he is increasing the membership of the board.</P>
    <P>The Government is doing very little about the beef problem in Europe.  It is clear from the length of the Minister's speech that there is little he can say about An Bord Bia.  Has it produced its <Col N="1712" /> first report yet?  I searched for it in the Library yesterday but failed to get it.  If the board has been in existence for 18 months, it must have a report.  I would be glad to see that report.  I am not saying it has not been published but I asked for it in the Library on two occasions yesterday and they had not located it up to late last night.</P>
    <P>Generally, I do not have any great problem with the Bill.  I am critical of the addition of one person specifically for consumers.  As I said, everybody on the board is a consumer.  I am a consumer and the Minister is a consumer; we are all consumers.  Who specifically will be on the board?  Why not spell it out in time and say Mr. X will be on the board?  I think that all the Minister is doing is making way for some one of his own supporters; or maybe it is one of Deputy De Rossa's supporters.</P>

      <P>It was interesting to listen to Senator Fitzgerald as well as an education.  It is great to broaden the mind every so often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is important legislation, even though it is simple.  In light of BSE, mad cow disease and the problem pertaining to the beef industry, it is important that the consumer is represented <Col N="1713" /> on this board.  An Bord Bia was established 18 months ago.  Every new board or semi-State body takes a while to become active.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia has an important role to play in the future of our economy.  If the BSE scare continues and Irish beef cannot be sold abroad, it will have extreme consequences for the economy of this country.  I heard the Taoiseach say that agriculture is 16 times more important to this economy than any other economy in Europe.  This highlights the need for export and marketing.  Over the last 20 years we have had good products to sell but we have not marketed them properly.</P>
    <P>In continental Europe people find it difficult to distinguish between England and Ireland.  They seem to think they are the same place in the British Isles. The establishment of An Bord Bia was a step in the right direction, but it will have to focus aggressively on marketing the food industry in continental Europe and all over the world, including northern America.  I have no doubt that it has the expertise and support of the Government.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and An Bord Bia for organising Horizons, the food fair in the RDS, which runs over the next three days.  It is the largest ever such exhibition brought to this country and has attracted buyers with over £1 billion to spend on food.  It is a huge opportunity and represents the type of activity in which An Board Bia should be involved.</P>
    <P>I have no doubts about the appointment to the board of an extra member to represent consumers.  Senator Fitzgerald said that we are all consumers, but I assume that this person will be from one of the consumer organisations or bodies.  It is extremely important to regain consumer confidence in Irish food and to be able to sell a quality product all over the world. I have no doubt that over the next number of years, through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and An <Col N="1714" /> Bord Bia, this will be done satisfactorily and successfully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill.  I am pleased to see that the amendment put forward by the Progressive Democrats to the original Bill in 1994 that one ordinary member shall be appointed to represent the views and interests of consumers has finally been accepted.  We seem to have an annual An Bord Bia Bill.  We had Bills in 1994 and 1995 and now we have one in 1996.  I look forward with eager anticipation, assuming that we are all here, to the Bill that will come to us in 1997.  It will probably address the concerns which Senator Fitzgerald raised.</P>
      <P>We also moved an amendment to the Bill in 1994 on the Bord Iascaigh Mhara aspect.  I moved that on the establishment day those functions of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara which relate to the export marketing of fish and fish products shall stand transferred to the board. At that time the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, said that they were not in a position to give An Bord Bia the marketing functions of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  A review was being conducted and he said that when it was complete, and with the consent of the Minister for the Marine, those functions could be given.  What progress has been made?  Perhaps I have laid the groundwork for the An Bord Bia Bill, 1997, which we look forward to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the genesis of this amendment Bill derives from the BSE crisis and that it took that incident to drive home to us a fact which we should have known and to which we paid lip service, that is, that the consumer rules.  The consumer decides <Col N="1715" /> what products to buy in a well supplied food market.  It has taken this unfortunate incident to drive home and to underline that point.  We have come from a background of intervention where the market would clear everything if there was oversupply and where things were being dealt with on a commodity basis.  It has taken this huge shock to the system to convince producers &mdash; I am one &mdash; and those in marketing that it is the consumer who counts.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that all members of the board are consumers, which is true.  That point was made when discussing the original Bill and it was changed to say that people with a knowledge of consumer requirements would be appointed to the board.  I would have gone a step further by saying that it should be a representative of an organisation.  I note the Bill does not say it should be a consumer, but a consumer to be appointed on the nomination of an organisation which the Minister considers to be representative of consumers, which is reasonable. After all, we amended the Bill to ensure that farming organisations would have adequate representation on the board, to which I do not have any objections.  I hope we do not get to a point where there is one for everybody in the audience and that the board will become so large as to be unwieldy.</P>
    <P>The matter of traceability is something to which we will have to pay more attention.  During an earlier debate I alluded to the fact that the Northern Ireland stand at a Spanish food show was very well visited because it had a computer programme on display showing how animals in the North could be traced back to the farm on which they were born.  We have a problem in terms of the multiplicity of movements within the lifetime of an animal.  Traceability will be at the heart of our efforts to convince consumers that the meat they eat is good and wholesome, which it is.  I fully accept the safety of Irish meat, but the problem is that we must convince <Col N="1716" /> the consumer.  One of the ways in which it can be done is to ensure that traceability exists.  I welcome a statement by the Minister in one of this morning's newspapers that he is to introduce measures to allow that traceability to take place and that there will be a computer based system where movement can be traced so we know from where animals are coming.  I know better butchers and outlets are already doing this so consumers can be assured that they know from where animals come and how they have been fed, which is an important point.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia has a difficult job in the present circumstances and it must be given support, financial and otherwise, by the Government to fulfil its remit and to market Irish beef on international markets.  It is unfortunate that once we cross the Channel to mainland Europe that the majority of consumers and, I suspect, buyers on wholesale markets regard British and Irish beef as one. The &ldquo;Newsnight&rdquo; programme on BBC quoted an article from the German newspaper, the <i>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</i>, which stated that all beef from the British Isles should be banned and should not be sold in Germany.  Even an eminent German newspaper was unable to make a distinction between Irish and British beef.  An Bord Bia faces a difficult marketing task, one which I hope it will be able to do well.</P>
    <P>Several speakers mentioned the research backup behind the meat industry, not only the producer.  Teagasc is not being given the resources it requires to fully exercise its remit in this area. When we debated some of these matters in the past, the Minister mentioned various fora, including the one for TB and An Bord Glas.  While I have been quite critical of the proliferation of fora, the Government should establish a forum comprising the interests in the industry, including producers, meat factories, butchers, wholesalers and consumers.  A coherent strategy should be devised by that forum to bring us forward.  I am worried that a lot of what we have been doing in response to the BSE crisis has <Col N="1717" /> been on an <i>ad hoc</i> and an immediate response basis.  I am worried about what will happen in the autumn when a glut of cattle will come on the market.  How will we clear those cattle?  How will producers be able to buy cattle with any confidence to fill sheds for the winter? That is something to which I have referred before when we debated the BSE crisis, and the Minister is aware of it.  A coherent strategy across the industry needs to be devised to deal with this problem.  A plan of action which is a little more forward looking than that at present is needed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fair which is taking place at present, which is a step in the right direction.  Those responsible for it are to be congratulated.  It is the right way to go about getting large buyers to come here, to see Irish grass and how we produce our animals and to convince them that the green image about which we talk is real.  On many occasions I have said the perception we assume Europeans have as regards our green image is our perception of what they think, which may not be the reality.</P>
    <P>As regards third country markets, I would like to go back to the matter of Libya and Iran and the statement the Minister made in the Dáil a couple of weeks ago when he said he would visit Libya as soon as the necessary arrangements could be put in place.  He said he was disappointed the visit had not taken place.  What are the necessary arrangements which must be put in place?  We need to re-establish those markets.</P>
    <P>According to the explanatory memorandum, section 5 contains a saver in relation to persons already appointed as members of the board or of a subsidiary board under section 16 of the Principal Act.  I do not understand the need for this section.  Am I to assume from the insertion of this section that there is a question mark over the status of appointments to the board to date and that we now must introduce a section to regularise their position?</P>
    <P>I am unclear why that section is needed or required and about its background, other than telling us that it shall <Col N="1718" /> not affect the appointment under the Principal Act.  Has somebody been appointed under the Principal Act who should not have been, whose status is not quite legal or correct and must we now put an insertion into the Bill to regularise it?  I need an answer to that before I can unequivocally support this Bill.  However, I very much welcome the appointment of a representative from a consumers' interest body to the board. While I welcome the Bill, I have that caveat on section 5 and I would like an explanation of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the fact that there will be a consumer interest on the board of An Bord Bia.  It is important that we set up structures and patterns of communication between the producer, consumer and processor.  There is such a changing pattern of eating habits and of the production and processing of food that unless we are on top or ahead of that market, we will not be able to maintain our position of being an excellent producer and marketer of food.  In that regard, Senator McGowan is right in saying that the Bill is as much about marketing as anything else.  This is a changing and competitive market, particularly for our exports, and we should do whatever we can to ensure we are getting our message across.  I welcome the Horizons exhibition and I hope we will have the opportunity to visit it and to see the Irish food on offer.</P>
      <P>One only has to go into a supermarket and see the changing variety of foods on the shelves to recognise the enormity of the challenge to our food industry.  New food products, such as sauces and frozen foods, are constantly coming onto the market and there is an internationalisation of eating habits which did not exist many years ago.  In the past Irish people ate certain kinds of food while other countries did the same. We did not have the crossover that exists now.  We could now as easily be eating food that originated in Mexico.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While that makes matters more difficult in some ways, it also provides us <Col N="1719" /> with many opportunities.  There are great opportunities for providing value added jobs in our food industry.  Since we are primarily an agricultural country and produce excellent raw materials, it is important we bring that value added aspect into our food industry so we can create jobs for people in developing the raw material into a product that can be sold to the consumer.  It is important to have continuous support in research, product development, education and training for producers, farmers and others further along the line.  Denmark is a model that many people look to as being a country which has been able to develop a series of value added industries from its agriculture base.  The Horizons exhibition is an aspect of that.</P>
    <P>Food centres &mdash; there is one on the outskirts of Limerick &mdash; provide a support structure for our food industry and give the kind of backup that small individual processors might not be able to provide, such as in research, marketing and assisting people working in the industry to respond to the constant demands for diversification.  An Opposition Senator referred to organic production. Many new products, such as venison, are being developed and are providing us with new opportunities to create jobs.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we produce most of these raw materials at home, although we will have to import others &mdash; we cannot grow some products in this country. We still import raw materials that could be grown in this country in the making of food products like pizzas.</P>
    <P>While Teagasc has primary responsibility for training and education, there is also the question of training professionals in courses like food science, human nutrition and biotechnology.  All these areas are being developed in our third level institutions.  The points for entering these third level courses for leaving certificate students have increased dramatically in the last few years, which indicates there are jobs available for people who are trained and expert in this area.  It is essential that the <Col N="1720" /> third level institutions ensure they provide enough places for these courses.  It will be essential to have experts who can work with the industry in developing value added products.</P>
    <P>The beef crisis was not of our making but our response to it is crucial.  Senator Quinn knows a lot about consumerism. He said that when he talked to French, Germans and other Europeans about beef, he was told that it was not a question of not buying Irish beef but that they preferred to buy their own.  The major obstacle we must cross is that each country is inclined to put up walls of protection.  It is a major battle that we must fight aggressively.  Marketing is crucial aspect of this issue.  I welcome this legislation because it indicates the progress needed in constant feedback between the producer and consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important legislation and we are heading in the right direction.  The food industry is still our single most important industry and will remain so for a considerable period of time.  The only other industry that may come anywhere near it is the tourist industry in around ten years' time.</P>
      <P>We produce approximately £9 billion, between the export trade and the home market, of produce from the land and the food and drink sectors.  The amount of import content is so low that it is physically impossible to analyse it and state its benefits to the economy in comparison with other areas.  The figure is somewhere between 5 and 8 per cent &mdash; nobody has ever contradicted that. Although many commentators have said they are higher, I do not believe this to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers must be described as key players in the food industry.  They provide the raw materials which must meet the requirements of processors on quality, cost and time of delivery.  The commercial partnership between farmers and processors must be fostered, as should be the partnership between farmers and consumers.  I very much welcome the Minister's inclusion of consumer representation on the board of <Col N="1721" /> An Bord Bia.  Consumers are important and this has been borne out in our current problems in the beef industry.</P>
    <P>We should never lose the opportunity to express our views in respect of the beef industry.  The butchers and supermarkets, since the problems in respect of the beef industry arose in March, have failed miserably to decrease their prices in line with what they pay for the raw material.  The top chains are charging approximately £1 a pound up to £6 a pound for beef on supermarket shelves.  This is sad because the price paid to farmers has reduced from approximately £1.08 to £1.10 a pound last year to 90p and less this year.  This is an approximate reduction of 20 per cent, but there is no sign of it in the prices in supermarkets or butchers' shops.</P>
    <P>I studied the prices in one of the largest supermarkets last weekend and I spoke to consumers there. It would be unfair to name the outlet because one should study all the supermarkets to draw a comparison.  Women with large families told me they thought that when the price paid to farmers was reduced by 20 per cent, there would be a corresponding 20 per cent reduction in the prices on supermarket shelves. However, the opposite has happened and one lady told me she thought the price had increased by 2 or 3 per cent in the past six weeks.  This is unbelievable.</P>
    <P>My wife buys all the meat for our household and I asked her about the prices.  She said she was not sure, but the lady to whom I spoke in the supermarket said she shops every week and she thinks the price of meat has increased by up to 3 per cent in the last six weeks. Supermarkets are buying meat from processors at a considerably cheaper price and I call on them to bring their prices into line with what they are paying to producers.  The poorest section of the community should be given a chance to buy beef.  No meat compares to beef in terms of its iron and nutrient content; the importance of beef to women and children is well known.  The issue of <Col N="1722" /> price should be examined and I call on the supermarkets to reduce their prices and bring them into line with what they are paying to producers.</P>
    <P>The problems in the beef industry are not exclusive to Ireland or Europe.  As I said on the last occasion, it affects the world.  The EU should get together with other beef producing countries, including Argentina, Canada, America, New Zealand and Australia, and start a worldwide advertising campaign to inform consumers about the benefits of beef.  As another contributor said, I hate to think what will happen at the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We should try to get the live shippers and the factories to agree here and then move on to the rest of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that point. The problem is worldwide and I ask the Minister of State to bring to the Minister's attention the need for not just an EU but a worldwide effort to inform people of the benefits of beef.  This country can brag that it has the cleanest beef in the world and I pay tribute to Senator O'Kennedy and the previous Government which rightly insisted on immediately depopulating herds if BSE appeared in them.  This policy will not be changed, but there will be a serious problem over the next couple of years until the consumption of beef worldwide increases.  I ask the Minister of State to bring this point to the Minister's attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research and development are most important.  I am a beef and a milk producer and Teagasc's current role is being undermined to some degree. There is undoubtedly a huge void between Teagasc's advice and farmers and I am most disappointed about this aspect.  Having spoken to Teagasc advisers, there is something amiss.  Are sufficient resources being provided to Teagasc?  As consumers become more sophisticated, their demands will grow and if the link between research and development and producers is not maintained <Col N="1723" /> and sustained, we will lose out in the long term.  The importance of Teagasc advisers having a clear understanding of how producers operate has been proved over the years.  However, at present the advisers do not understand how producers are operating, and when the BSE problem arose in the beef industry they were ill equipped to deal with it.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that the volume of live shipments has not increased over the past six weeks.  The point was made earlier that it is the middle of June and only two months remain until thousands of weaners and store cattle come onto the market.  There is a serious danger of the price collapsing.  Consumer confidence is one aspect, but the feeders must also have confidence.  If they do not have confidence, they will not buy stock and the price will collapse.</P>
    <P>Such a collapse happened in 1973 and 1974.  The then Minister, former Deputy Mark Clinton, was one of the best Ministers for Agriculture ever to hold office, but he could do little about it.  However, it is certain that if the number of live shipments do not increase over the summer months, there will be a surplus in the market and the price will collapse.  I appeal to the Minister of State and the Minister, who is from my county, to ensure every possible step is taken &mdash; I do not suggest everything is not being done &mdash; in respect of live shipments. The level of stock on hand must be reduced before the autumn when a huge number of animals, particularly in the west &mdash; many Wexford farmers buy animals in the west and I have bought animals there &mdash; come onto the market.  If feeders have no confidence in the price for the remainder of the year, it will collapse. This must be avoided.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and I favour support for the consumer.  In the past we found to our peril that the consumer representative is an important person on a board because consumers dictate the pace as far as products are concerned.  I wish the Minister well and I support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and constructive comments. Senator Kiely was most critical of the promotional and marketing campaign carried out by An Bord Bia and the Minister since the BSE crisis became real.  However, in fairness to the board and the Minister, much has happened in the past three months.  An Bord Bia has developed a comprehensive marketing plan to reinforce the quality and integrity of Irish beef to trade customers and consumers in the home, European and international markets.</P>
      <P>To date, the marketing response in the domestic market to the BSE crisis has included consumer advertising campaigns and information leaflets.  For example, over 500,000 leaflets were distributed to all multiple supermarket chains and independent butchers.  In addition, point of sale materials were issued; approximately 5,000 posters were distributed to multiple supermarket chains, independent butchers and the catering sector.  An information line on Irish beef has been established, which is a free 'phone service, for concerned consumers and daily statements have been issued to the national and local media.  These were accompanied by a large number of radio interviews at various times, reassuring consumers that beef is safe to eat, and extensive briefing documents were distributed to all retail outlets and the meat trade in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the EU market, I and my colleagues have visited Sweden, Spain, Italy and other countries to reassure our customers that our product is safe to eat.  This morning I met people from Sweden whom I met there some months ago.  They came out strongly in favour of the Irish product publicly on television at a time when it was very sensitive and when it would have been easier for them not to have done so.  They visited a number of farms in Leinster yesterday and came in this morning unannounced to thank me for the information which I had given them <Col N="1725" /> when I was in Sweden.  They confirmed the information themselves by going out to the farmplace to see where the product was being developed and where the cattle were reared.  They visited the abattoirs and meat plants and were happy with what they saw.  The Swedish consumer is probably the most discerning in the world.  Beef consumption in Sweden is at the same level it was before the BSE crisis because they have confidence in their own product and also the importers have confidence in their source of the product and that includes Ireland.  That is a positive message which we should send out to the consumer not only here in Ireland but also on the European market as well.</P>
    <P>We have distributed a number of trade briefing documents throughout Europe to our overseas offices in eight languages &mdash; German, Spanish, French, Italian, Swedish, Finnish, Dutch.  We have had ongoing trade development over the past three months and have established intensive contacts with key retail chains and importers by market based executives to protect current market position and capitalise on opportunities. We have distributed a consumer information leaflet on the facts about Irish beef.  We have also had a consumer advertising campaign in each of the markets with the slogan &ldquo;You can be sure of Irish beef.&rdquo;  That has been shown in Italy, Spain, Holland, Germany and Sweden and has been accompanied by press statements and point of sales material.  We have provided supplementary veterinary and health certificates and these were developed in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to further reassure consumers of Irish beef.  These certificates are being issued by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry on request in the main European languages.  We have live cattle trade briefing documents prepared for circulation to key customers of Irish live cattle.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, An Bord Bia has developed and is <Col N="1726" /> implementing a strategic approach to protecting and reopening key international markets.  The Government has relied on Government to Government contacts in our key markets.  Veterinary officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry have visited these markets and veterinary officials in our key markets have come to Ireland to be briefed by senior Irish veterinary personnel.  We have embassy briefings on an ongoing basis as well.  An Bord Bia's approach has been to have market visits for trade consultation.  They have distributed trade briefing documents and these have been prepared for international markets in Arabic, Russian and other languages.  We have an ongoing public relations and media advertising campaign, which will be intensified as the crisis settles down.  We have issued press releases in the Gulf States, Egypt and Jordan.  The Chief Executive was interviewed by CNN for relay to international markets.  Minister Yates made a successful visit to Russia recently, where there are major opportunities for Irish beef.  It is more than a slight exaggeration for Senator Kiely to say that An Bord Bia, the Minister and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry were doing nothing about the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The work is ongoing and I have been reassured by the meeting I had with the representatives of one of Sweden's big multiples today that we can regain consumer confidence.  If we can do it in Sweden, surely we can do it in the rest of Europe.  Senator Kiely mentioned also an independent food safety agency.  An Bord Bia does not have and should not have safety functions. Existing food safety regulations are being examined by an interdepartmental committee which is chaired by the Department of Finance.  We have a food safety advisory board.  This is being looked at on an ongoing basis; and with the high standards we have in this country, food safety will remain an important <Col N="1727" /> aspect of our industry and rightly so if we are to preserve the integrity of our product.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan, Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Dardis mentioned the involvement of somebody from the fish processing industry on the board of An Bord Bia.  The marketing functions of Bord Iascaigh Mhara will now be transferred to An Bord Bia.  I would remind Senator Fitzgerald that Bord Iascaigh Mhara has a spectacular display at Horizons. It is by no means hidden away and is one of the best stands out there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go through the transfer of BIM functions to An Bord Bia.  Section 9 of An Bord Bia Act, 1994, provides for the transfer to the board of food marketing functions exercised by other agencies.  Any such transfer would be affected by waiving an order made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister with responsibility for the agency from whom functions were being transferred.  The Minister has agreed with the Minister for the Marine that the export marketing functions of Bord Iascaigh Mhara are to be transferred to An Bord Bia.  The first step in implementing this agreement has been taken with the appointment of the Minister of the Marine's nominee to the board of An Bord Bia in November 1995.  The other arrangements necessary to effect the transfer, including the establishment of appropriate structures and linkages between BIM and An Bord Bia, will be completed later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime the two boards have a close working relationship.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is kept fully informed of and participates as appropriate in An <Col N="1728" /> Bord Bia's activities and programmes, including in particular its trade fairs and other overseas promotions as well as its financial assistance programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fish is represented on An Bord Bia's generic display of Irish food at Horizons, for example, in consultation with BIM and this will be complemented by a sectoral stand organised by BIM on which ten seafood companies will exhibit.  BIM participates on An Bord Bia's Irish stand at major international exhibitions such as Alimentaria in Barcelona and SIAL in Paris.  Processed seafood companies have exhibited at the Green Week in Berlin and CIBUS in Parma on the Irish stand co-ordinated by An Bord Bia.  An Bord Bia is currently in discussion with a number of seafood producers regarding the development of an Irish brand for smoked salmon.  It is also in discussion with up to 20 companies regarding their individual export market plans and financial assistance towards implementing these plans.  I want to point out to all the Senators that the marketing of fish is a priority of An Bord Bia.  When all the functions relating to fish are finally transferred and the board is operating in that regard, it should be successful.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan mentioned the confusion which exists in distinguishing Ireland from Great Britain in international markets.  Certainly confusion exists.  People on the Continent and in international third markets fail to differentiate between Great Britain and Ireland.  They fail to see Ireland as an independent island nation and a major publicity campaign had to be put in place to ensure Ireland has a distinctive image on international markets.  An Bord Bia and the Minister are working hard to dispel that notion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a big media advertising campaign in those countries in their own languages, buyer briefings, numerous diplomatic initiatives, and ministerial and veterinary contacts between our <Col N="1729" /> main markets, An Bord Bia and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to dispel this notion.  We must continuously reinforce this campaign that Ireland has a different and more strict veterinary regime than in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Despite what Opposition Senators said about sealing off the Border to protect our industry, I think that has worked quite effectively and I cannot see how else we could have managed it. To protect Ireland's image abroad, the Department had to do that.  One of the questions I was asked at a number of promotions for Irish beef was &ldquo;What is Ireland doing about its Border with Northern Ireland?&rdquo;  I was happy to say there was surveillance in place and that it was working.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan mentioned branding and, as all Senators will appreciate, this is an expensive route to the market which many companies just cannot afford.  However, we are looking at other routes, such as own label, and the food service and ingredient areas.  In addition, An Bord Bia's market development strategy deals with the issue of a brand for Ireland and we are working towards that.  The objective is to establish a distinctive and unique brand or brands for Ireland over the medium term.  However, it is not simply a matter of having a distinctive brand for Ireland because much of Ireland's food is sold under own brand labels in the supermarkets.  The supermarkets brand Irish meat as their own and this poses a difficulty.  The more the industry can move towards a quality Irish brand for all Ireland's meat, the better.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald made much play about the annual report of An Bord Bia. The 1994 Act requires that the report be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas by 30 June and that requirement will be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis was concerned about the saver.  With regard to section 5 of the Bill, under section 14 of the 1994 Act, as amended by the 1995 Act, the ordinary membership of the main board <Col N="1730" /> was increased from 11 to 13 by way of an order made by the Minister under that section.  The Attorney General's Office has advised that, on the enactment of this Bill, the order under section 14 will automatically be repealed and that, consequently, a doubt could arise as to the legality of the position of the two ordinary members who were appointed on foot of that order. The above saver provision will prevent this from happening.  Although it is probably not necessary to do so, the saver is also being extended to cover subsidiary board members.  It was on the advice of the Attorney General that the saver was included to protect the members.  It may not have been necessary but to ensure the matter is totally above question, it was felt prudent to include it.  I hope the Senator will accept that explanation.</P>
    <P>With regard to a forum, it is a matter which I will discuss with the Minister and the Secretary of the Department.  I established a forum on horticulture some time ago and it is working effectively. I can see the relevance of putting in place a forum such as the one the Senator suggested.  Now could be an appropriate time.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators from all sides of the House for their contributions.  This Bill simply places a consumer on the board and its subsidiary boards.  It does not go beyond that.  There may be other questions which could be addressed in 1997 but it is important that a consumer be on the board to represent a recognised consumer group.  As Senator D'Arcy said, the consumer decides now so we must reassure not only Irish consumers but European and third country consumers that Irish beef is safe to eat. I am confident that we can do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Seanad for giving me the opportunity to introduce this debate.  Anyone looking at Ireland's performance in recent years would be anxious that we start to look ahead to see what we can achieve over the next 15 years.  That is what Forfás has done in this report.  It has set out an ambitious yet realistic set of targets which will stretch us but which will deliver tangible results.  It sets out objectives to create employment, to halve our rate of unemployment and to increase our standard of living from 65 per cent up to European standards.</P>
      <P>It also shows what we can achieve as a society if we get consensus on a set of targets and we are willing to accept the challenges necessary to deliver them. Anyone looking at our performance and the transformation wrought in the past ten years will equally recognise that social consensus on certain objectives is a huge part of that success.  We now have the fastest growing employment rate in Europe &mdash; we are regarded as the Celtic tiger by many commentators &mdash; because we have been willing to take a long-term view.  That is what this report is saying, but we can achieve more.  We must address some difficult challenges in the future but we will be able to overcome them and to meet the opportunities if we achieve social consensus on what must be done.  These challenges will be more difficult to deal with if we do not have social consensus on what we can achieve as a society. That is what makes this report worthwhile and important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report is stretching the planning horizon well beyond the life of any Government or social partnership agreement.  It is saying we need to move to a new Ireland 15 years from now which offers benefits in terms of the quality of life, the standard of living and support for disadvantaged groups in our community.  This report is important, not as an A to Z of where we must go <Col N="1732" /> and what decisions we must make but because it sets the challenges we must meet along the way.  This report is the first of its kind to map out a clear set of objectives with a long-term horizon.  It is important that we begin to think beyond the planning horizon of any one Government.</P>
    <P>At this stage in our development there is a need to take stock, to look at what has been achieved in social and economic development, to identify those who have been excluded from the prosperity achieved and the underlying reasons for their exclusion, to assess the forces of change at work, both local and international in shaping our economy and society at present and how they are likely to evolve in future years, to set ambitious but realistic targets for future growth and to establish the broad direction of the policies needed.</P>
    <P>The report can make a major contribution to the debate which is needed on these issues.  It outlines the contribution which the enterprise sector can make to the achievement of wider national, social and economic objectives, including the area of employment creation in particular and public policies needed to support this.  The work and analyses undertaken by Forfás will make a significant input into developing and implementing the policies required to raise  performance in employment creation even above the very good results achieved in recent years.  I hope the report initiates a serious examination of these issues.</P>
    <P>The long-term view is the key contribution of Forfás's work.  It gives us a structure and a platform to consider the long-term impact of critical choices facing us and it helps to shape our agenda. It maps out the potential rewards on offer from adopting a radical, coherent and challenging action plan.  <i>Shaping Our Future</i> is not intended to be the last word on, or the A to Z of, enhancing our society.  No work with a longer term horizon can promise to anticipate all the range of choices we will face in the future.  This is recognised by Forfás and the wide range of people who contibuted <Col N="1733" /> to this valuable work.  What it does, however, is identify the most likely scenarios facing us and bring forward for clear analysis the starker choices we must make.  It also paints for us a future that is attainable and which I would like to see realised.</P>
    <P>We could choose not to shape our future in a strategic way.  The alternative is to adopt short-term horizons, be reactive and bob about like a cork in a globalised sea of international competition. I reject that type of thinking and approach.  Ireland can and must adopt new and more sophisticated strategic directions to secure a better future.  If we really believe in transforming our society for the better, then we need to develop a revised consensus on the way forward.  We need to marshal our strengths against the obvious threats, to make some sacrifice in favour of the overall good and to seize opportunities. If we do so, we will build on the already strong economic foundations.</P>
    <P>The outcomes in 15 years of appropriate policy choices are laid before us in the Forfás document.  These include halving the present rate of unemployment to 6 per cent, reducing long-term unemployment to no more than 50,000, increasing living standards in terms of GNP <i>per capita</i> to average EU levels, compared to 65 per cent at present and raising the quality of life for all our people.  <i>Shaping Our Future</i> maps out an agenda for change through, for example, harnessing the growth potential of the services sector where 300,000 jobs can be achieved in the next 15 years, transforming Irish owned manufacturing industry which can realise 12,000 jobs, doubling the profitability of Irish owned companies to 8 per cent and strengthening foreign direct investment which could yield 33,000 extra jobs.  It identifies critical support policies needed for enterprise development &mdash; taxation and public finances, skills, telecommunications, transport and logistics, science and technology and finance for development among others.</P>
    <P>We must envisage a new society which is characterised by higher living <Col N="1734" /> standards, greater equity in outcomes and an economy which is renowned for its competitiveness.  There have been many critics of our 75 year history who said that we had an insufficient strategic vision of where we were heading or no strategic direction at all.  While I do not necessarily agree with everything they said, it is now time to chart the path for the future in a more mature and systematic way.</P>
    <P>There are many forces of change at work in the world economy which are increasingly impacting on Ireland. These forces are in such areas as the globalisation of trade and competition. That is followed by the reduction of trade barriers in the Internal Market and on the broader GATT rounds. Technology development is growing at an increasing pace and diffusing more rapidly across national boundaries. There are dramatic changes in the workplace where team work is becoming a feature of high productivity environments. There is greater emphasis on human resources versus fixed capital. The recent EU White Paper on the Year of Learning indicated that human capital should appear on the balance sheet as an asset in the same way as fixed capital.  However, we are a long way from adopting such a radical view of accounting policies.  Human resources will be a major determinant of the competitiveness of a company in the future. European Monetary Union will impose strict disciplines upon us if we want to exploit the opportunities it offers.</P>
    <P>World trade is growing rapidly and barriers to trade are diminishing. Increasingly, taking advantage of the new and more liberal order for international trade, foreign direct investment in the manufacturing sector but also to a growing extent in the services sector, is bringing about new patterns of industrial production.  We have benefited from these tendencies.  We have seen many foreign companies choose to invest in Ireland attracted by the conditions here and the skills we can offer but also by direct access to the European market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1735" /> Technological change is also fuelling this process.  New technologies make it possible to locate different parts of the production process in different areas of the world.  Telecommunications is of particular importance in encouraging this tendency to global market, and it is also assisted by the growth of advanced manufacturing techniques in industrial automation.  In general, our society is characterised by a high level of technological know-how.  Technology is the driving force behind economic growth.  Technological innovations dominate the everyday lives of individuals, enterprises and the economy.</P>
    <P>Our competitors are making huge investments in strengthening their technological capability.  Technology policies and strategies are now a key component of economic development efforts in all countries.  In Ireland, however, we have been slow to accept this message.  Industrial policy and State funds have been focused significantly on the attraction of inward investment and not sufficiently on encouraging research, development and innovation in local industry and on building up the scientific and technological infrastructure.</P>
    <P>These points have been forcefully made recently in the report of the Science, Technology and Innovation Council &mdash; STIAC &mdash; chaired by Dan Tierney. The Government has accepted the principle of this report.  There is also the increasing importance of innovation to enterprise development.  It points out in the report that innovation is wider than technological innovation alone.  Marketing and management innovations are also important.  Technological changes are behind many of the innovations in marketing and management which are regularly cited; for instance tele-marketing would not be possible without digital telephony or the developments in personal computers.  Mobile telephony is still in its infancy, with the potential for a fundamental impact on the way our lives and businesses are organised and run.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> A further aspect of the changes under way in the world economy is the way in which economic strength is shifting to new regions.  In particular, the rise of the Asian economies over the last 20-30 years has been the most striking phenomenon.  Some of these have managed to sustain high growth rates and high investment rates for decades.  As a result, although they have started from a low base, major transformations have occurred in their economies and major investments in infrastructure, in technology and, most significantly, in human resource development.  Fundamental economic reform in Latin America may lead to another group of countries joining the Asian economies in the future as examples of dynamic growth.</P>
    <P>Nearer home, the countries of Eastern Europe, having transformed their economic and social systems following the collapse of Communism, are now poised to become important exporters as well as attractive locations for foreign direct investment.  Within the European Union, we are now on course for Economic and Monetary Union, which represents a logical completion of the Single Market.  However, it is not a strategic decision that can be taken in isolation.  It has to be part of a commitment to transform the Irish economy to one of high efficiency, responsiveness and flexibility if we are to be sufficiently competitive to exploit the opportunities that trading in the new environment will create.</P>
    <P>Ireland in many ways is at a turning point in its economic and social development.  Over the last few years we have seen a fundamental change in the characteristics of the economy and a significant departure from the practices and disappointments of previous years. Growth is continuing at a sustained level, with rates significantly above those of our European partners and with good prospects for their continuance in the years immediately ahead. For the first time, this growth appears to be broadly based and is not accompanied by any renewal of upward inflationary pressures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> Moreover, especially recently, it has been accompanied by a significant net employment creation, with a total of 88,000 jobs created in the last two years, an unprecedentedly high number compared with the achievements of earlier years.  We are at present one of only three countries to satisfy the Maastricht criteria.  Those criteria, as Members know, cover inflation, interest rates, exchange rate stability and debt targets among others.</P>
    <P>Looking ahead, the demographic situation is also favourable.  Changes in the population structure mean that declining numbers will enter the labour force. At present, we have a much higher youth dependency ratio than the rest of Europe but the trends in the future will take us towards the EU average.  These trends will make it easier for us to meet our economic and employment goals.  It will be easier to raise living standards and it will be easier for people to find jobs.  With the right policies in place, ambitious economic and social goals appear within our reach.</P>
    <P>However, the achievements to date must not lull us into a sense of complacency. Unemployment remains unacceptably high.  Moreover, the problem is exacerbated by the extremely high share of long-term unemployed in the total of unemployed.  It is clear that we face a problem of major dimensions, one which has serious implications for our social cohesion and one which will require sustained action on all fronts if it is to be fully addressed and solutions found.</P>
    <P>In this sphere, much work has already been done in analysis and identification of appropriate policies.  Senators will be aware of the task force on long-term unemployment and the NESF report on unemployment.  My Department has drawn together many of these strands in the form of the recently published Government approved strategy for the labour market entitled <i>Growing and Sharing our Employment.</i></P>
    <P>However, it is a significant virtue of the Forfás document that it has placed this problem of unemployment, and <Col N="1738" /> long-term unemployment in particular, in a wider context.  The challenge is to sustain the recent economic performance and to adopt policies that ensure future prosperity can fully address the intractable problems of unemployment and its most distressing manifestations in terms of youth unemployment and long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>There is also concern as to whether the transformation has yet run deep enough to withstand external challenges in the future.  The long run competitive capabilities of our businesses and the development of our human resources will be the determinants of Ireland's success in a changing world.  We need a long-term framework for enterprise policy if we are to build upon the recent success we have achieved and respond adequately to the challenges we now face internally and externally.  Innovation will be the only successful response to rapid change in the world economy; the emergence of new challenges and opportunities means that the range of goods and services we offer to the world market has to be updated and developed continuously.</P>
    <P>The Forfás report stresses that we need to improve our national innovation performances if we are to succeed. Industrial competitiveness has two parallel but equally important components: increasing revenues through a constant stream of new ideas and product innovations and increasing profits through unceasing improvements in productivity.  As far as Irish manufacturing industry is concerned, we are lagging far behind our competitors in terms of product introductions.  A Forfás survey has shown that between 1990 and 1992 only one third of Irish firms introduced new or improved products compared with a rate of around 50 per cent for some other EU states.  There are some grounds for cautious optimism in the strong growth in business sector research and development, admittedly from a low base, between 1988 and 1993.  A new survey later this year will indicate whether this has translated into <Col N="1739" /> a better performance in product and process innovation.</P>
    <P>The ambitious overall objectives in <i>Shaping Our Future</i> have been translated by Forfás into a set of second level targets that will provide the focus for policy action in the future.  Targets are established in the report in the fields of innovation, investment, exports, skills, telecommunications, transport, tax and finance and employment.  It is the intent of the Forfás document to set out principles to be followed in determining the details of action in particular cases, and not to attempt to anticipate actions the Government may need to take in any one year or period in the light of prevailing circumstances.</P>
    <P>With these objectives and targets set out, the Forfás document defines a strategy for enterprise.  In the first place, the role of the services sector has been too long neglected.  As I mentioned in the figures I quoted earlier, clearly 85 per cent of the additional jobs that Forfás projects as being achieved in the next 15 years with correct policies will be in the services sector.  I do not think anyone could say that our industrial policies and our general economic policies have sufficiently reflected the importance of the services sector in creating employment and competitive advantage.  The report calls for a new emphasis on this sector, to place it with manufacturing at the heart of enterprise strategy.  The report shows the potential for a major expansion in services employment, not only in internationally traded services, which would be significantly dependent on a rapid improvement in our telecommunications system, but also in local services.  Here a considerable expansion is possible, based on increased use of services by the manufacturing sector, on an expansion of tourism and the growth of personal services as a result of increasing incomes.  I am currently developing a strategy for services that I will bring to Government in the near future.  In my period in the Department I feel I would add value if I start some new thinking <Col N="1740" /> about how to tackle the opportunities on offer in the services sector.</P>
    <P>The manufacturing sector outlined in the report distinguishes between Irish owned and foreign owned firms.  There are difficulties in both groups, but they are different.  For foreign investment, the problems are increased international competition for location and the need to maintain the attractiveness of the package offered by Ireland to companies considering locating here. The problems of Irish owned enterprises often relate to strategic market positioning and innovation.  The report outlines a broad based strategy of enhancing scale and profitability and assisting Irish companies to reposition into new areas and positions in the value chain.</P>
    <P>Anyone looking at the industrial value chain in recent years will see that manufacturing and assembly are declining in relative importance.  The real core value added elements in the industrial chain are moving at the early stage to product development and design, and in the later stages to marketing, customer service and selling.  Those are trends to which Irish business has to respond.  We will not survive as a country if we find ourselves located in low value added manufacturing assembly.  We have to migrate to the higher added value segments. The big challenge for Irish business is to move away from low margin activities into the margin that requires higher human resources that goes into design, customer services and marketing.</P>
    <P>A central message of the report, however, is the broader one of an encouragement of enterprise.  We have to recognise the requirements of enterprise and make these the driving force of industrial policy.  Most crucial will be the maintenance and improvement of an environment in which enterprise can flourish, in which new businesses can start and thrive.  Many aspects of industrial policy, and economic and social policy generally, will have to be harmonised and focused in order to bring this about.  The barriers <Col N="1741" /> to entry will have to be lowered, access to finance will have to be improved, administrative burdens will have to be eased and the right infrastructure and support measures will have to be in place.</P>
    <P>Existing Irish owned companies will be in need of an updated and strategic package of support measures in which the development agencies will have an important role.  Less tangibly but more importantly, an enterprise culture will have to become pervasive; one that respects and encourages enterprise because it creates the wealth that will allow us to reach our higher goals as a society.</P>
    <P>The crucial nature of education and training for the success of the strategy for enterprise is clearly recognised in the paper.  Significant proposals are made in the report not only in terms of increasing training activities in industry but also in the wider and fundamental areas of the schools system and university education.  There is also a major focus on work organisation and regulation and on long-term unemployment. The overall message is that these areas are interlinked and progress in one cannot in the long term be sustained without progress in others.  Skills and creativity in the workforce are the main determinants of competitiveness in the enterprise sector.</P>
    <P>It is worth dwelling upon that thought.  There is no doubt that as we move into the next century what will determine our ability to compete is the willingness to have a vision of the way a company is heading, to use the talents of the workforce effectively and also to be willing to plough resources back into improving the workforce, the way they work and the intelligence they bring to bear on problems.</P>
    <P>One of the major themes I hope to have addressed at the end of my period in office is human resource development. Irish firms have traditionally been weak and have not had sufficient foresight to invest in human resources and in training.  We have clearly identified skill gaps between some of Irish industry <Col N="1742" /> and overseas competitors.  There is a need to upgrade many of those who are entering into the workforce without adequate skills to sustain them in the longer term.  That is an important element of this report and one that will be a growing focus of attention.  It will be at the heart of the preparations that I am currently making for a White Paper on human resource development. We are close to finalising it and will soon be able to circulate it to other Departments for comment.</P>
    <P>Equally, if we are to place this greater emphasis on human resource and developing the talents of those at work, we will need a more open style of industrial relations where managers and employees work together to innovate, continually improve and manage change.  We are seeing encouraging indications of that.</P>
    <P>The old adversarial approach to industrial relations is, thankfully, on the wane.  There are many interesting documents being produced from both sides of the social partnership which address this issue of how we can manage change in a partnership rather than as part of old style adversarial industrial relations.</P>
    <P>In business support development, a broad based response will be needed in the areas of science and technology, international trade and marketing and in the provision of finance in the development of the enterprise sector. Creating and sustaining knowledge driven competitive advantage across all sectors of the economy will be crucial.</P>
    <P>As a small open economy, Ireland's development depends fundamentally on success in international trade.  With increasing innovation worldwide, Ireland's enterprises will need wide support and encouragement to increase their activity in this field.  For this reason, the capital markets must become more relevant to the vast bulk of Irish owned industry and improving the flow of finance for investment in young, high growth companies will be a priority.</P>
    <P>The Forfás report identifies key areas where action is needed to improve <Col N="1743" /> our performance in relation to science, technology, innovation and competitiveness. These include technological skills, accessing technology and strengthening our research and development capability and performance.</P>
    <P>Surveys have shown weakness in proficiency in science at age 13.  Similar surveys have shown a worrying ignorance of basic scientific facts among adults. The Department of Education is now addressing these issues in its new schools curricula and we must ensure that these proposals are pushed forward with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>More also needs to be done to bring support for basic research and post-graduate training up to the level of our competitors.  We also need to improve our performance relating to the accessing of technology from abroad as a counterpart to generating it within the country.  Networks, a mix of formal and informal contacts, are an important means of enabling firms and other organisations to identify and access technology worldwide.</P>
    <P>The evidence is that in Ireland only one in seven manufacturing companies is involved in technology licensing.  This is an area where there are the beginnings of significant change.  In recent times Forbairt has emphasised forms of strategic alliance as a valuable way in which small Irish business, perhaps without the financial strength to invest heavily in research and development, can form alliances with companies in other countries &mdash; most notably in the US &mdash; and thereby fill a gap by way of technology franchising or other alliances.  For a small company that can be a fruitful way of getting foreign investment into the country than through the traditional greenfield route because you are effectively taking the indigenous companies and dramatically strengthening their growth.</P>
    <P>The report focuses on infrastructure which will be an important element in the success of enterprise development. It will depend both on the investment in and the pricing of infrastructural services. <Col N="1744" /> Telecommunications, transport and logistics, energy and the physical environment are all areas to which the report has paid particular attention.  Of these four important areas, two have been especially emphasised in the report &mdash; telecommunications and logistics.</P>
    <P>There is a need for immediate action in the field of telecommunications so that our systems can once again be the most advanced in Europe.  The new science of logistics represents the integration of transport planning with stock control, production, storage and delivery systems.  The need for Ireland to have a greater focus on logistics as a strategic choice for a geographically disadvantaged economy is highlighted in the report.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of Senators to that section of the report because new and interesting thinking is being developed there.  It is like Columbus discovering America; it was easy when he discovered it but to point out what should be obvious can often be a significant discovery too.  As an island economy located on the periphery, we should be developing key skills like logistics and transport; how we get our products to market in time without excessive stock carrying.  The call for more strategic thinking in this area is a valuable part of the report.</P>
    <P>In the energy area the report has called for increasing competition and ensuring competitive prices as the central focus of future energy policy.  As regards the physical environment, the principle of sustainable development and the opportunities offered by the environmental industry itself, and the growing appreciation of the environment as a competitive asset, are also explored.  In this regard, I have established an expert group on &ldquo;Enterprise and the Environment&rdquo; to bring forward proposals for action.  Opportunities are being opened up there that as a country we can exploit.  Too often Irish business sees environment as a question of obligations rather than opportunities.  It is <Col N="1745" /> important that we bring into that picture those very real opportunities.</P>
    <P>The final set of actions in the report deal with the public finances and administration. The taxation principles set out have as their fundamental objectives the stimulation and sustained support for an enterprise economy, where risk is encouraged and rewarded.  The broad thrust of the taxation recommendations relate to reducing personal and corporate taxes and widening the tax base over time.  Competition policy will require continued monitoring and strengthening in order to ensure that the conditions for successful enterprise growth are favourable.  A Bill to deal with that issue is currently before the House.</P>
    <P>As the report notes, there is no prospect of achieving the challenging social and economic objectives outlined without a well managed, innovative and efficient administration system.  At the level of regional policy, the importance of a wide spread of diffusion of enterprise culture is outlined; the objectives can only be achieved with a full participation of all sections of the community and for this reason an essential target will be action at the regional and local level to ensure that enterprise growth and development are understood, appreciated and shared by all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The issues raised in this report with regard to the development of an enterprise economy could be summed up in the word &ldquo;competitiveness&rdquo;.  As the report has made clear, competitiveness means far more than costs alone.  Competitiveness is determined by the factors we mobilise, the institutions we build up and the skills of our own people.  These factors, in turn, have to be brought together and allowed to function to maximum efficiency.  Thus the process of competitiveness, the way in which the factors are combined and allowed to flourish, is of crucial concern. The competitiveness agenda in this report is central to our ability to foster enterprise, to create jobs and to export. <Col N="1746" /> I intend to incorporate a significant initiative in this regard in the enterprise strategy I will publish in the coming months.  I am also planning to accelerate action on the competitiveness issue at European level, and during our Presidency of the EU this year we will encourage initiatives in this connection.</P>
    <P>The Forfás document is of exceptional value and will provide guidance for this Government in the detailed application of many of the policy areas discussed in the report.  It has already provided major inputs to the strategy documents in preparation in my Department dealing with enterprise, services and human resources.  In addition, I have already taken action to implement the recommendations with regard to the information society initiative outlined in the report. This is an essential component of enhanced competitiveness in the Irish enterprise sector to meet the new challenges raised by advances in telecommunications and computing.</P>
    <P>A working group, chaired by Vivienne Jupp, a director in Arthur Anderson, is considering the issues surrounding the information society in Ireland and what we need to do to prepare for its further development.  A fundamental transformation is now taking place towards an information intensive society and a knowledge based economy in which advanced technologies, particularly information and communications technologies, and other forms of innovation have a strategic role in economic development.  Government has an essential function in promoting an environment which fosters and supports innovation &mdash; enabling enterprises to turn new knowledge into innovation and thus into growth and job creation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to express my appreciation to Forfás for the work they have carried out.  Forfás is a cross-social and cross-agency partnership.  It has a wide range of expertise and this report has benefited from the broad vision of the board.  Tom Toner, the chairman, and John Travers, the chief executive of Forfás, deserve our congratulations.  I hope the report can be widely debated <Col N="1747" /> and its overall thrust accepted and further developed through discussion and dialogue at all levels.  Building on this we can better define the course of action needed to make a reality of the goals that are outlined.  It is for this reason that the document is being debated here today and I am sure the House will give it the serious and detailed consideration it merits.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not outstayed my welcome in presenting this report.  It is an exciting and valuable report and I am encouraged by the welcome it has received as an important contribution to policy making not only within the business and economic community but also from political parties.  I look forward to the rest of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister in welcoming this report.  It is exceptionally good, one of the best ever presented. However we, the politicians, will fail to implement it.  Government &mdash; I am referring to all Governments &mdash; fail to respond to this type of report.  I listened carefully to the Minister and it must be said that if I was in his position I would have presented the same speech.  That clearly points out what is fundamentally wrong with enterprise development in this country: the failure of politicians &mdash; I blame politicians across the political spectrum &mdash; to respond to reports such as this.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, this is a most welcome report and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, is to be complimented for initiating it.  However, we will not take the positive action outlined in the report.  While we waffle about it the Asian tiger economies, which provide the inspiration for long-term strategic economic planning, are moving ahead by leaps and bounds and doing everything this report says should be done.  As I said, we know that as politicians we will not implement the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I outline the areas in which we are severely negligent, I welcome how the report has set out strategies and <Col N="1748" /> identified actions that must be taken.  Its clear central targets include the creation of 364,000 new jobs in the manufacturing and, primarily, services industries. That would lead to an unemployment rate of 6 per cent by the year 2010.  It suggests that growth in public spending should be reduced to 2.5 per cent of GNP and that we require an average growth rate of 5 per cent per annum over the next 15 years at a time of global uncertainty and restructuring.  Can politicians, irrespective of who is in Government, honestly say they are going to try to achieve those targets by implementing the action this report recommends?  We must be honest and admit that progress to date by all parties in Government has consisted of running away from tackling those problems.</P>
    <P>While the objectives in the report are worthwhile and consequently have been welcomed by all parties, the reality is that we do not have the will, the courage or the commitment to implement those strategies.  Will any coalition hold public spending to 2.5 per cent over the coming years, especially in view of the current rate of economic growth?  Will any Government take a serious attitude to the tax reform recommended in the report as necessary to secure the climate required for changes in the economy? There is an unambiguous commitment to free enterprise in the report.  How do the left wing parties feel about that?  We have not heard much from them but the report is quite clear in its commitment to free enterprise as the way forward for economic growth and development.</P>
    <P>It is when one comes to the specifics in the report that one must face the fact that we are failing in a serious way. Telecom Éireann is referred to and the report goes on to outline the importance of the services sector in the achievement of the report's objectives.  However, when one looks at the performance of Telecom Éireann to date &mdash; and the performance of all politicians in regard to telecommunications &mdash; it is clear that this significant development in terms of telecommunications is not going to take place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> The report describes telecommunications as a critical area.  It states that major investment in broad band technology, both by Telecom Eireann and a revamped cable industry, could throw up opportunities in areas such as audio visual production, database development, medical diagnosis, home shopping, remote loss adjusting, distance learning, computer games, remote surveillance, electronic publishing, home banking and travel information. However, when I checked on the development of the broad band infrastructure in this country, I was informed by companies which are interested in this area that there is no hard evidence of Telecom Eireann being serious about putting such an infrastructure in place at present, and there is certainly no hard evidence of any serious effort to have it done on a price competitive basis.</P>
    <P>The use of voice and data integration in a broad band system is critical to us being at the forefront of the international service sector.  However, we politicians have no interest in pursuing the development of the most effective broad band infrastructure in Europe, which is what we need if we want to be serious about this aspect of the report. As I said, if I was the Minister I would have made the same speech.  However, it would have been much more beneficial to the debate if the Minister had told us specifically about the various policy initiatives being taken by the Government and Telecom Eireann to put in place that aspect of the report, on which early action was described as extremely important.</P>
    <P>I have already raised the question of the development of a centre of excellence for telecommunications.  If we are to become serious players in international services, the best centre of excellence in telecommunications in Europe must be based here.  The development of an integrated telecentre is a first priority.  We have talked about it for years but we still have not put such a centre in place.  We have made some progress in areas such as film and telemarketing, but we are only scratching the <Col N="1750" /> surface and are being left miles behind by our competitors.  That is a second area which we as politicians are not taking seriously.</P>
    <P>The debacle about the privatisation or part privatisation of Telecom Eireann adds up to a situation where the political will is lacking.  I am being very careful here not to be party political because it was not any different in our time and we all stand indicted in that respect.  The reality is that we, as politicians, are not doing anything to break the barrier created by our geographic peripherality and to bring us into the main frame which would enable us to be competitive.</P>
    <P>We can see the developments which have taken place in other peripheral areas.  For example, three peripheral areas in the United States where development was historically slow &mdash; the Carolinas, Seattle and a mid-west city &mdash; have grasped the nettle in regard to telecommunications and have the most cost effective and modern policies in the United States.  They are generating hundreds of thousands of jobs, while we are languishing with the opportunities at our feet and seem unable to take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>The report sets out a very good strategy for this specific area but the response of politicians is miserable.  We should acknowledge that fact in this House.  If instead of the Minister reading out a speech today which was a set of pious platitudes &mdash; and I would not have done it any differently if I was the Minister &mdash; we identified the areas in this report on which immediate action needs to be taken and brought that action about, we would be doing a good service.</P>
    <P>The report is also specific about the need for action on the improvement of education and training.  A great deal of attention is paid in the report to the learning of languages.  We have talked for many years about the importance of a multilingual culture with people leaving school able to speak fluent French, German, Spanish etc.  However, the reality is that our present school system <Col N="1751" /> is not capable of teaching young people to speak any continental language fluently.</P>
    <P>French is the predominant language in the education system.  Young people study a fairly intensive French course at school for up to six years but leave school with a very limited ability to speak the language.  This report outlines the importance of oral language skills for school leavers.  My daughter is sitting her leaving certificate examinations at the moment.  I speak very little French but, while she hopes to do well in the examination, my knowledge of French is as good as hers.</P>
    <P>We politicians need to take practical steps in the area of language training. There is no indication that such steps are being taken now or will be taken in the future.  The report has identified the importance of language training but we, as politicians, do not have the will or courage to put those recommendations into practice.</P>
    <P>The report refers to the mainstream European languages.  It also refers to languages of emerging economies such as Russian, Czech, Polish, Hungarian etc.  Our language training in these subjects is almost non-existent, despite the fact that those emerging economies are recognised by the rest of Europe as the key areas of economic growth and development.  Will there be any major initiative in this respect?  The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Our total disregard for making a contribution to the economic development of Eastern European countries is summed up by the fact we have one economic counsellor for all the former CIS countries based in Moscow.  The former CIS countries are in receipt of massive amounts of investment, trade development, and business from countries like Germany, France, the Netherlands and Britain.  We have one good lady who is given the task of promoting Irish business in all the CIS countries, which sums up our lack of interest.  We are better placed in terms of communications than most other European countries, <Col N="1752" /> with the possible exception of Germany, because we have three or four flights a day from Shannon to most of those countries.  Yet we have failed to seize the opportunities unlike other European countries.  The language aspect of this development is seriously neglected.</P>
    <P>Regarding the strategy framework outlined in the report, I agree with the seven areas identified.  The development of the transformation in Irish owned industry to reposition, innovate and compete is one with which we would all agree.  Irish owned industry is prepared to put 3 per cent of wages turnover into training and development, which is a significant percentage of the payroll; it is greater than is being put into training, research and development at present.  It is difficult to see a major change unless particular incentives are provided.</P>
    <P>Developing the product that is Ireland which we offer to foreign investment is one of the areas where we have been successful.  Ireland as a product for foreign direct investment is probably more effective than most other countries. I have dealt with the reform of taxation, which I cannot see happening.</P>
    <P>In relation to the major drive in raising the skills profile of Irish people, there is no great evidence we are going to put in the kind of investment that is necessary to bring about a major improvement in our skills.  The Minister spoke about world class logistics infrastructure in Ireland.  It has taken so long to bring about obvious changes, such as the welcome creation of super ferries, that one wonders if we will get around to the strategic development in transport and stock control, which the Minister outlined we need in order to bring us up to speed in this area.</P>
    <P>There will be great difficulty implementing this report.  I mentioned the inability of politicians to have the will to implement it.  Consigning this report to the shelf as a great report that was never implemented can be compared to the response when Telecom Eireann tried to balance their charges about two years ago.  For the first time <Col N="1753" /> we tried to be competitive in international telephone charges.  Telecom attempted to bring reality into local call charges in order to reduce international and long distance charges.  There was uproar in the country about this decision.  <i>The Gay Byrne Show</i> went on for weeks about disaster befalling the country as a result of balancing Telecom charges.</P>
    <P>Until we convince the ordinary people that for us to bring about the type of economic growth and development to which we all aspire, people must make sacrifices.  These can only come if we are prepared to implement the fundamental and radical change outlined in this report.  I hope that we, as politicians, can convince the public that those sacrifices are worth making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this report.  There are a number of areas mentioned by the Minister and Senator Fahey where we are all sceptical of whether actual decisions will be taken.  It is interesting to note the changes that have taken place in the growth of the economy and where jobs are being created.  In 1960, agriculture accounted for 25 per cent of the country's GDP, today it accounts for 9 per cent; industry went from 30 per cent to 38 per cent of GDP and the service area went from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.  The report states a possible 300,000 jobs could be created in the service area where there is huge potential for growth.  A substantial amount of that growth is in the tourist development area.  Having had discussions with possible investors, it was interesting to note costs here compared to those in nonEuropean countries.  People were amazed at the difference in the costs of employment, hotels, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question the report seriously in this area.  The report discusses halving the present rate of unemployment to 6 per cent and reducing long-term unemployment to no more than 50,000.  I look at the numbers of people who went into the industrial sector when I was growing up.  There were opportunities to go into <Col N="1754" /> trade and serve one's time as an apprentice carpenter or fitter.  The report discusses shaping the future yet we have forgotten about this area.  I sent details to the Minister some time ago about the possible growth and opportunities for the thousands of young people who decide to go on to further education. They are missing out on the opportunity of getting into an area where there is long-term employment.</P>
    <P>Last week, I spoke to someone in the specialist area of turners providing and repairing machinery for major industry. He told me he could do with six people but there is nobody available.  He has put advertisements in local papers but he cannot find the people he needs and there are jobs available for them.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what has happened in the industrial area in the last ten years, the actual training involved, the cost of that training and the fact that the employer will be responsible for the training during the period of apprenticeship. Perhaps the Government should discuss with the unions the formation of a policy where sufficient funds would be made available for companies to provide an incentive to give young people the opportunity to become tradespeople. Employers in this area tell me it is too expensive to train people.  This means we are missing out on a generation to carry out essential repairs and other necessary functions in industry.  I have written to many companies who, years ago, took on substantial numbers &mdash; ten, eight or four people &mdash; on a yearly basis to be trained in these trades.  Today these companies are taking on a fifth of what they used to take on; some take people on every second year.  If we are talking about shaping the future, providing jobs and involving ourselves in telecommunications and other areas where we could become a base for Europe, we are forgetting the basis on which we were established.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the vocational schools system before they received approval to hold leaving certificate classes.  I guarantee the figures would show that at least 50 per cent of all the students, especially <Col N="1755" /> male, went into apprenticeships and many of them are today in the service industry and employing people.  How can we say that, in the last ten years, we have adopted the right approach when we speak about shaping the future, when we are missing a generation of people to supply essential services.  Now we propose to shape the future into the 21st century and the people who created this report have missed out one important area.  I feel deeply about this because I see the changes locally as a result of the lack of this sort of development. In any further review of this policy, I would hope for a new chapter stating that it is policy to increase the numbers serving apprenticeships.  I know the Minister has supported the idea of ongoing review.</P>
    <P>The area of research and development is a new phenomenon in Ireland. We knew of research and development but it was not an aspect of industry here. I am delighted to note from the report that there has been a substantial increase in this area.  I hope it continues at the level at which it has been developing because that will protect jobs and ensure the future and the expansion of many companies.  If they had not got involved in R&amp;D they would soon have been left behind. Many companies still have not become as involved as they should.  The only way forward for those reluctant to get involved in R&amp;D in their own right is to do it collectively with a group of companies with similar operations that can afford to assemble a R&amp;D base.  They might all be in the same area and that would be the R&amp;D base for, say, ten companies.  Sharing the cost would help to develop these companies.</P>
    <P>The report mentions reform in taxation in great detail.  We are all pro taxation reform.  Some parties in both Houses would reduce the high rate of tax to 40p in the £ to get things moving. We should remember our neighbours across the water decided that the reduction of the high rate of tax to 40p in the £ would lift all boats but they <Col N="1756" /> found out very quickly that the people who had their tax reduced saved their money instead of spending it and the economy has not been going as well as those who made the decision thought. As for an overall policy of tax reduction in the last two budgets, the Government attempted to reduce the cost of labour. That has to be part of future policy and the incentives given have helped companies to expand, apart from the economic boom.  There will be no tax reform until the overall concept of financing local authorities is taken into account with the total amount of tax that people pay.  If radical reductions to 40p in the higher rate and 25p or 22p in the lower rate are made, from where will the funding for the services we provide to local authorities come?  That has to be done in the context of an overall policy on financing and taxation.  All Governments and all parties &mdash; and we have had five parties in Government in the last few years &mdash; have done nothing about this.  I do not see the will to propose anything, even the Opposition are proposing to abolish only one aspect of a tax which is unpopular in some areas. That will do nothing for real tax reform.</P>
    <P>I accept what Senator Fahey said.  We now have this report but what are we doing to ensure that many of the recommendations will be implemented?  If anyone makes an effort to implement parts of any report the present Minister will use his influence in Government. His thinking in this one has been, and will continue to be, positive.</P>
    <P>A policy document which looks forward and introduces ideas on the development of areas of the economy which will create the opportunity for a huge increase in the number of jobs that can be created is to be welcomed.  We have the opportunity to service many parts of the new and expanded Europe through the expansion of many companies which are based here.  The report outlines the areas where this can be done successfully, but it will only be successful if the will is there to ensure its implementation. <Col N="1757" /> What is happening to the long term economy, especially in the area where many people are not being given the opportunity to get into the workforce at levels which will develop their skills? We have allowed this situation to deteriorate over the past ten years to such an extent that if it is not addressed, there will be a waiting list for employees with specialist skills, such as construction workers, fitters and mechanical workers.  The Government must pursue a policy in agreement with the trade unions, IBEC and other agencies which will ensure that there are sufficient numbers of people available who will demand a sizeable income for themselves and their families which will add to the further development of the economy over the years.</P>
    <P>In the past two years 88,000 jobs have been created, which is close to 100 new jobs per day in the past 12 months.  This rate of employment growth continues. Substantial new developments, including the expansion of small companies, are taking place.  We must ensure that a trained workforce to service these economic developments is in place so that in ten years time politicians in both Houses will not be asking why they closed their eyes to such an extent that twice the price will then have to be paid to have such services provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  Cuirim failte roimh an Aire agus roimh an da imleabhar seo chomh maith ó Forfás.  I have not had time to read the entirety of the two volumes, so I am basing my contribution mainly on the summary &mdash; I am sure nobody else is doing this &mdash; and I start therefore from a behind position.  I apologise if something I say is answered in the big volume on the basis of questions arising from the small volume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the report.  It is very thought provoking and timely and is doing something that is rarely done in this country.  Instead of producing reports as crisis management responses to perceived short term failure, we are now producing them at a time when <Col N="1758" /> things are going remarkably well by previous standards and are asking how we should be thinking strategically 15 years ahead.  It is very important to have this mind-set inculcated into us.  I welcome the report partly for that reason, even if I were to disagree with everything in it, which I do not.  We have now got a sense of the need for strategic thinking built into our perspectives on how we approach issues.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the way the report tries to take on board a range of issues. The Minister listed them in his speech. They include taxation, public finances, skills, telecommunications, etc.  One of our abiding weaknesses in economic analysis is that we tend to home in on one variable, whether it is taxation, periphery, science and technology, and tend to imply that if only we got that right everything else would follow in a much improved way. We are now getting a large number of things reasonably right.  The question now is: how does one get the most effective blend between them all?</P>
    <P>We are confronting an intriguing intellectual conundrum, which I am sure the Minister has pondered, when we look at economic policy making in this country.  Historically our mind-sets, including my own, are based on the premise of asking what has gone wrong and what are we doing wrong?  We have now had relatively rapid economic growth &mdash; astonishingly rapid in the past four years, according to some figures &mdash; so we must be doing something reasonably right.  This means that the type of out and out condemnation, which we brought to the point of near perfection at times, is something we must modify in the light of changing circumstances, even if some of us might believe, if we wish to be pessimistic, that we are getting the good figures at present because nearly everything that is going right is doing so simultaneously and if all of them were to go wrong simultaneously &mdash; many of them are beyond our control &mdash; we would revert to much lower growth figures.  However, I am prepared to continue to talk up the economy as <Col N="1759" /> far as possible and to assume, therefore, that some of the things that are going right are doing so as a result of us getting things right ourselves and are not just a matter of luck.</P>
    <P>While it can be debated, it is my firm conviction that the target for reducing unemployment ought to be the main criterion over 15 years of the degree of success achieved.  However, it depends on what would be regarded as the unemployment level now.  This report takes the labour force survey; others may choose to take the live register.  A ILO figure is also referred to in the report which is a little above or a little below the labour force survey.</P>
    <P>A great deal depends on what one regards as the correct unemployment figure in terms of assessing the plausibility of the target.  I would be grateful if the Minister would ponder this and take us further than Government documents have done hitherto on what he regards as the key factors in the differences between the labour force survey and the live register, because our starting point makes a difference to the way we evaluate the postulated targets.</P>
    <P>My criticism of the report reflects at one level on its strength.  There is a good deal of integrated thinking, but integrated thinking does not go far enough because of the unfortunate title of the report &mdash;<i>A Strategy for Enterprise.</i>  In his speech the Minister rightly said that all of the issues raised could be summed up in the word &ldquo;competitiveness&rdquo;.  The report's first recommendation for urgent action &mdash; even though it appears to mean setting up another body &mdash; is the establishment of a council for competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I far prefer &ldquo;competitiveness&rdquo; to &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; because there is an ideological undertone in enterprise to the effect that it only occurs in the private sector and that if it not private it is not enterprise.  I began playing with terminology and considered referring to this as the &ldquo;market sector&rdquo;.  However, there is enterprise in both the public and private sectors and we lack enterprise in both <Col N="1760" /> sectors.  There is an unfortunate and unnecessary polarisation between public and private when we need partnership between the best in every area.</P>
    <P>If one compares what the report says about human resource management with what the Government document on the public services said last week, they are nearly interchangeable.  Some people might say &mdash; I know the Minister would not &mdash; that this is academic waffle and they might ask how much vocabulary matters.  Language influences mind-sets and perspectives.  Those who can capture the commanding heights of the vocabulary have a disproportionate advantage in setting the agenda for discussion. Language matters very much and &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; is an unfortunate alternative to &ldquo;competitiveness&rdquo; because we need competitiveness in every area.  They are so interlinked that it is misguided to try to rip the threads out of the totality of the national economic performance texture.</P>
    <P>The report itself comes from Forfas, which is a Government body.  If it had been written by the same authors as private consultants it would be in the enterprise sector.  As it stands it is in the non-enterprise sector, as defined in the report itself.  That highlights the artificiality of a good deal of the type of distinction drawn here.  I hope we get away from it and do not become trapped because much time &mdash; perhaps some of my time at the moment &mdash; will be taken up on what ought to be a nondebate. If we were to focus on competitiveness we could avoid and pre-empt a great deal of that debate.</P>
    <P>As far as specifics are concerned, I will deal first with communications.  I agree with what Senator Fahey said about implementation.  However, the focus on both telecommunications and logistics is correct.  They are playing to our potential strengths.  There will be insuperable difficulties if they are weaknesses rather than strengths, so I agree with that.  I have a number of queries about specifics, the first of which relates to markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1761" /> The report rightly places enormous emphasis on markets.  It identifies the western European market as the main source of growth for the next 15 years and the British market as a source for Irish industry, Irish owned firms and small firms.  I would like to see more emphasis placed on the potential of the western European market for our small indigenous firms.  I take the point about the difficulties of growing.  We demand much from our small firms by expecting them to be able to export at a much earlier stage in their product development and growth because of the small size of the home market than is demanded of small firms in a number of other countries.  It is pointless to invoke what America has achieved through small firms when much of what passes for small firms in America are large firms by our standards.  Those are misleading analogies.  They are not in this report as such but are often invoked and are often misleading.</P>
    <P>One should try to raise sights as to possible markets.  The report mentions markets nearly everywhere in the world, including eastern Europe, south-east Asia and Latin America.  However, the summary, at least, does not mention the north American market and the USA market in particular.  If it does, it is in a very fleeting way.  Are we in effect writing off the richest single market in the world as a source of potential growth for Irish exports?  If we are, maybe it is right; I do not know enough about it to know whether we should.</P>
    <P>However, I have just spent some time in New York and I am very conscious of the diaspora concept, which many ridiculed when President Robinson originally tried to launch it and which was not received with a great deal of reverence in the other House when she spoke about it some time ago.  I am conscious of the way consciousness of an Irish dimension seems to be growing among a number of Irish Americans of second or third generation.  This is not in a romantic, hazy, nostalgic or slushy way, and I do not believe anybody <Col N="1762" /> would buy anything Irish simply because it was Irish if the quality was not there.  However, there is marketing potential in the diaspora.  This potential is not in each of the 42 million who have some Irish blood somewhere in some generation but it is present in a substantial number of them if they are approached systematically and in the right way.</P>
    <P>If this report is tending to say that we must consider the American market largely closed I hope there will be a rethink and some attempt to at least identify why it must be regarded as closed.  The potential is considerable. Anything that contributes to consciousness raising about Irish identity and can be linked to economic development has potential which should not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general thrust of the section on the environment.  It is right that one should not regard environmental protection and industrial development as mutually exclusive or adversarial. However, the section highlights compartmentalisation even within the integrated mind-set of the report.  It speaks about the physical environment and states:</P>
    <P>For consumers, concern for the environment now transcends physical surroundings...to include the food they eat, the products they use, where they go on holiday, and the sort of world their children and grandchildren will inherit. </P>
    <P>That is quite right.  The report goes on to state that within industry there is concern about compliance costs.  As they stand those emphases are correct, but splitting them tends to assume that business people are not themselves consumers in a range of ways and are themselves often concerned about the sort of world their children and grandchildren will inherit.</P>
    <P>This leads to compartmentalised thinking when one should be trying to pull the strands together.  It may be necessary for analytical purposes but it is pigeonholing where one should be <Col N="1763" /> breaking down barriers.  I accept that there will be pressure on some business people from time to time to seek short term specific advantage, even at the expense of long term general gain. However, I hope that they can be liberated from the box into which they are put and seen as consumers and citizens who share many of the concerns attributed to consumers.  I am encouraged by the stress the report places on the importance of the environment to both quality of life and marketing, in terms of the green image of Ireland and so on.</P>
    <P>I have major queries about the section on education.  I always have queries about the sections on education in economic documents.  I hope it does not come from a defensive mentality of protecting one's own patch or from the NIMBY mentality.  I welcome competition pretty well unreservedly in most areas, including education, and I have said that on previous occasions.  In fact, I do not just welcome it; I relish the idea of competition.  I am quite convinced that, given equal resources, our education system can compare with education systems anywhere.</P>
    <P>In this context I am talking about the main report because I was moved sufficiently to find time to read it.  Where the report makes criticisms of education, particularly higher education, which is the area I know best nationally and internationally, it should be more specific about those criticisms.  It talks about standards not being sufficiently high and so on.  I have no problem with that provided the evidence is presented. Much of the time in the education area one finds a great deal of assertion based on fragments of individual experience or the recollections of individuals as to what the education system was like when they were going through it at every level and assumptions that it is the same today.</P>
    <P>There has been enormous change in education at third level.  Anybody who has seen what is happening at second level, at least in some of the better, more advanced schools, knows how <Col N="1764" /> much capacity for change is built in. Some of the change may be uncoordinated and <i>ad hoc</i>, but there is certainly a receptiveness to change.</P>
    <P>I would criticise the report when it says that the education system must develop a culture of responsiveness.  To hell with responsiveness.  The education system should develop a culture of innovation and anticipation rather than waiting to be told what some employer needs this week, next week or in a year or two and responding to that in the short term.  Where the universities and the regional technical colleges have sought to respond to specific employer requirements or Government directives the results have often been disastrous.  In 1979 we turned ourselves inside out to meet demands from the IDA for graduates in computer studies on the basis of their projections.  Four years later when they came on stream 50 per cent had to emigrate because the projections were wrong.  The report rightly lays much emphasis on foreign language learning.  Just 11 years ago we were told to close down small language departments because they were to be rationalised and there was no real need for them.  I hope there will be some understanding, because there is a degree of scepticism in some educational quarters about directives apparently based on projections which may be based on inadequate analysis of the issues under discussion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the emphasis on adult education. The report states that the Government should consider the introduction of tax credits for individuals paying for their own adult education.  It is conservatively estimated that the requirement for part-time third level places &mdash; part-time extends beyond adult education, but includes it &mdash; will triple by the year 2010.  How far is this supported by the action of the Minister for Education in appearing to place adult education on a lower level of significance than day or undergraduate education and by the lack of emphasis on graduate education, which is crucial <Col N="1765" /> to future developments and which has been eliminated from consideration so far in terms of fees?  There is considerable potential for integrating Government thinking in that area in the light of this report, apart from its intrinsic merits.</P>
    <P>I would welcome further exploration of the role of the education system.  The report makes a number of worthwhile points, but in many cases is based on incomprehension of where we are and where we should be.  The report is also based on incomprehension of one further point, which is a basic criticism I have.  As long as it confines itself to the economy, its value system and judgment and so on may be accepted.  However, from time to time it equates the economy with the country.  It states that if the management of education and training institutions remains unchanged, they will become progressively less well adapted to the needs of the nation.  The nation is not the economy and education must service a wide range of citizen requirements.  The economy is very important &mdash; I am not for one moment suggesting otherwise &mdash; but it is not the nation.  People who write such reports must be clear about what they are writing and when they slip from one category to another, their value system must be made clear.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up a point made by Senator Farrelly.  I strongly support the report's recommendations on regionalism.  However, it envisages a more active role and therefore more financing for local authorities.  Again, this brings one to integrated thinking, because it is now talking about the political system as part of the infrastructure for enterprise culture.  I agree with that because the political system is very important to the way economies develop.  However, it should not suddenly talk about local authorities and Government structures when it has not considered those details.  If we are to have a truly integrated report on shaping our future as a nation and not only a strategy for enterprise or for competitiveness, those dimensions must be systematically <Col N="1766" /> integrated.  We must be clear about our presuppositions, what we have in common and where we differ.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this large report.  Given that it covers such a broad canvass, I suppose we will each concentrate on different aspects of it.  I support what Senator Lee said about the report being from the perspective of the enterprise sector and that it does not always take on board other aspects of activity. However, it is fairly straightforward about this when it states that while Government policy formation must necessarily take a wider perspective, the approach set out in this report is unambiguously from the perspective of the enterprise sector.  The report is honest in terms of how it is approaching this.</P>
      <P>I have some difficulties with the tone and perspective of the report; perhaps it is because of the type of language used. However, the report contains a lot of good points.  The Minister referred to the need for social consensus.  There is a need to debate these issues from other perspectives as well as that of the enterprise sector.  I am confused about the enterprise sector and whether it includes public as well as private enterprise.  There is also some confusion in the report about that, particularly in the section on regional and local development.  On the one hand, it seems to be saying that there is an important role for local government structures, while on the other hand, when it refers to community, it says that there should be the least possible public sector involvement.  It is important that we have a long-term strategy and approach to how we develop our economy and enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Things are going well at present and I take Senator Lee's point that we are sometimes better at looking at what is wrong rather than learning from what is right.  Our economy is growing, while at the same time inflation is being kept under control.  We are also getting things right under the Maastricht guidelines. Yesterday's report from Davy's <Col N="1767" /> stockbrokers on 1995 was very positive in terms of growth and the potential for future growth.  The ESRI report which comes out today will say similar things. The economy is being well managed and we seem to be getting the balance right, which we must continue to do.</P>
    <P>There are different traditions in relation to the market to which much of this document refers.  I do not believe we can have a pure <i>laissez-faire</i> market economy like the Thatcherite model, nor would we want one.  There are many models around but we must develop a suitable Irish and, indeed, European one, developed from our traditions rather than from others.  Like the Thatcherite model, the US one is fairly market driven.  While the Japanese model is successful, it has a culture of looking after people.  Then there are eastern models which clearly exploit people by paying them low wages. These economies are taking a lot of jobs which might otherwise come to places like Ireland because they pay people a pittance.  We do not want to facilitate that type of investment.</P>
    <P>We must develop a tradition of social solidarity which allows business to develop while protecting the less well off.  I welcome the fact that this document puts long-term unemployment at the centre of the agenda.  It suggests that we reduce unemployment by half in 15 years, specifically long-term unemployment. That is a good point which perhaps counteracts some of the arguments I put forward about its approach.  The present rate of unemployment is approximately 12.9 per cent.  More than 60 per cent are unemployed for more than one year and over 41 per cent for over two years.  Clearly, long-term unemployment is a crucial problem which faces us.  While I welcome the emphasis on this, the report may not be as specific as other investigations and reports like that which the Minister mentioned from the Economic and Social Forum on long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> Some interventions have made a difference. I hope the local employment service and the monetary provisions to encourage employers to take on the long-term unemployed will also make a difference.  We must target groups in this area as well as in education.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Education of a scheme called &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo;, which aims to reduce the pupil/teacher ratio of schools in disadvantaged areas so there would only be 15 pupils per teacher in junior classes of certain targeted schools.  We must go the way of targeting and the kind of intervention proposed under the local employment service in which the problems of individual unemployed people are faced and focused.  For example, training schemes must look to the needs of the unemployed and not just provide training.</P>
    <P>With regard to private industry and encouraging enterprise etc., what is the planning mechanism for getting the firms to do what we want &mdash; for example, to reinvest money?  Our natively owned firms do not have a good record of reinvesting in research and development and support for apprenticeship training and I would welcome a committment to that.  However, I am not sure of the mechanism to be used.  We cannot leave it entirely to the market and hope that what we want to happen will come about.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the way labour relations is covered in the report.  I again welcome the suggestion in the report and the remarks by the Minister that we would not want confrontational labour relations to dominate.  There would be general agreement that the consensus approach is productive and can work well, but it must be genuine.  There must be a genuine stakeholding for all people working in a company; and if it is making profits, they should be benefiting as well as those at the top of the ladder. There must be genuine partnership in industrial relations.  The report says that &ldquo;the team should be the basic organisational cell of the firm&rdquo; and that is very much in keeping with the modern trend <Col N="1769" /> of how industrial relations should work. However, this must be genuine teamwork and not only when it suits the employers or the people at the top.</P>
    <P>There is a growing dichotomy between those who have money and those who do not.  In the Japanese model there is a closer convergence between the wages of people at the head of large firms and those on the factory floor.  However, there seems to be a growing divergence in Ireland and the rest of Europe.  We are told that we must pay people at the top of semi-State companies high wages because otherwise they will not take the jobs.  That belief is driven by the level of wages they would get if they were working in the private sector.  If people are to feel a genuine stakeholding in their company, they do not want to feel the amount of money they are receiving or the number of hours they work is disproportionate to the hours and responsibilities of those at the top of the ladder.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of money around the country.  One only has to look at the price paid for a house in Shrewsbury Road recently, property prices generally and the number of new cars sold.  A lot of money is moving around in our economy but not every sector of society is getting it and the rising tide is not lifting all boats.  We must concentrate on people at the bottom of the pile.  When we consider changing our taxation systeam we should first look at the tax wedge and poverty traps and try to reduce the tax burden for people at the bottom half of the wages scale.  There have been changes for the better in the last few budgets in making it easier for businesses to operate, take on more people and in how they pay their taxes and PRSI contributions etc. and we must continue in that regard.</P>
    <P>We can see definite possibilities for job creation and improvement in some areas.  The service sector has shown strong increases in its employment potential in recent years while other sectors have decreased.  Therefore, we must give it whatever support we can.  There is also much scope in value added food <Col N="1770" /> products &mdash; we discussed the An Bord Bia Bill this morning.  With our raw materials, we can create jobs in the food processing sector.</P>
    <P>The environment was also mentioned and I welcome the fact that it has been covered in the report.  The concept of sustainability and agenda 21 are about how we can incorporate good environmental and enterprise practice.  I agree with Senator Lee.  There should not necessarily be a divergence between those two aims.  We should be able to carry both of them together.</P>
    <P>There are measures in this report that some would welcome more than others. Everybody will have problems with some parts of it.  The leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Harney, welcomed its trend, but would she welcome all of it?  For example, one section on taxation refers to property tax.  It says that currently a little over 5 per cent of our revenue comes from that source &mdash; it is 11.4 per cent in the US, 11.1 per cent in Canada and 10.5 per cent in Japan.  The report says it is important to consider some increase in yield from property taxes.  There are some pills in the report which we are being asked to swallow.  For every up, there is a down.  If we do not take taxes from the current areas, we must look elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The best thing we could do would be to bring extra people into the tax net by creating more employment and that should be our focus.  The more people there are in employment, the greater the taxes that will be paid.  We should not be talking about cutting support for services like health, education etc.  The emphasis should instead be on bringing as many people as possible into the tax net and the workforce.  There are many good and positive measures in that regard in this document.</P>
    <P>We have learned a lot over the years about the problems faced by firms, particularly smaller ones.  The only way to learn that is by having a hands on approach and examining the individual problems of small firms from their point of view.  We have a high number of <Col N="1771" /> small and medium sized industries in comparison to large ones.  If each one could even be developed to the extent of taking on one or two extra employees, we would make a big dent in our unemployment figures.  We must examine their problems.  While many people set up enterprises, by no means are all of them successful.  It is important that they are given the kind of supports they need.</P>
    <P>To what extent do we intervene?  It is all very well to say that everything should be market driven but many small firms genuinely need intervention and support.  I recently spoke to a person whose job is to assist small firms and examine their problems.  Many of their problems relate to marketing and research and development difficulties. However, he told me that one of the biggest difficulties firms face is how to set their prices and work out a cost structure where they are accounting for all of their costs, make a profit for the firm and at the same time not be uncompetitive in the marketplace.  That is a major dilemma for small firms. Sometimes they may not have the expertise to work that out for themselves and may need outside help from bodies like Forfás, Shannon Development and other agencies to give them that hands on approach.</P>
    <P>This is a core activity of organisations such as Forbairt.  They should support small firms and give them whatever assistance and advice they require.  The Minister mentioned networking outside and inside the country and getting people in contact with markets.  An Bord Tráchtála runs successful schemes which match companies outside and inside Ireland with markets.  This and other work must be done.</P>
    <P>The strategy is detailed and I am glad it is so widespread.  However, it also imposes limitations because it comes from a particular perspective.  The report should be a catalyst for discussion to include employers, trade unions, the National Organisation for the Unemployed and other sectors in <Col N="1772" /> society, including educational establishments, etc., which also have a role to play.  I hope conclusions will ultimately be reached about where society should go over the next 15 years, which is the period covered by the document, and how we can build on the strengths developed in recent years without throwing away the good things achieved.  At the same time, problems and possibilities must be identified and the process taken forward in a spirit of social consensus.  The report is the beginning of discussion and I hope it will be widespread.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The report contains tens of thousands of words and I asked myself how I could read them all, grasp the meaning of the strategy and come up with a formula which would work over the next 15 years.  I examined the good aspects first and these include that Ireland is on course to become a founding member of the economic and monetary union system.  National wealth is constantly increasing and the level of economic growth in Ireland is one of the best in the European Union.  However, the other side of the coin is that the level of emigration is high, a huge number of people are unemployed and there is enormous poverty in urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>Given this background, the strategy document was established to come up with a plan for the next ten to 15 years. It examines the changes necessary to ensure a better standard of living and a better quality of life and considers if that can be done through measures in the enterprise sector.  The thrust of the debate is how the number of jobs can be increased through that sector and we must examine the changes required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no quick fix solution in terms of what will work.  The nature of work must be examined, including the impact of changes in terms of what type of jobs are likely to exist in the future.  This aspect must be considered in the years ahead.  The concept of careers and their structures is changing in relation to the tenure of work.  Job security is no longer <Col N="1773" /> what it was and the idea of a permanent, pensionable position is gone.  In the future people must take into account whether jobs are for life or a certain length of time and that once it is complete, one moves on to another area.</P>
    <P>There is much unrest in relation to the entire nature of work and the concept of careers in the future.  Regarding organisational and professional structures, many people job share or work on flexitime while others work on contract or part-time.  In this context, the enterprise sector as a whole must take note of how the number of new jobs can be increased.  This is a major task and, given the content of the report, I am not sure it will succeed.  The report does not deal in detail with future work ethics. For example, will jobs be for life?  What is a job and what is a career?  How is work defined?  This aspect should be debated in terms of how many people will be working ten or 15 years down the road.  How do we consider ourselves in relation to work?  Is a way of life more important than a job?  Perhaps this matter is covered in this huge document but a wider debate on this area is required. I have only touched on it.</P>
    <P>However, the purpose of the debate is to examine how enterprise can create jobs in the future.  The report touches on the services sector, but I was unable to analyse it clearly.  Ireland lags behind in relation to services and not much thought was given to this area in the past.  The traditional view was that one should aim for a job in a factory or organisation.  However, we must rethink that idea and concentrate on jobs in services. Little research has been conducted into what constitutes a job in the services sector, where they are available and the potential of the industry in local areas.  An example is local spin off incomes from tourism.</P>
    <P>The services sector must be examined because future progress will be in that area.  Education is important in that regard.  It will provide a market for young people at leaving certificate and post leaving certificate levels and consideration must be given to the type of <Col N="1774" /> skills required.  Ireland is a member of the European Union and it should be a hub centre in terms of services and the movement of goods.  Ireland can become a centre for financial services, computer skills, engineering skills and languages.  A golden opportunity exists to develop a link between enterprise and the educational world, but this matter is not properly covered in the document. It is a subject for another debate. However, by international standards, the Irish education system is the best in terms of how well young people are prepared. Nevertheless, a definite link between this system and the world of work, and how one moves from one to the other, does not exist, given that many skills are useful in the services sector.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to Senator Lee's contribution.  However, the educational system should not be geared towards enterprise alone.  Young people should be prepared for the variety of work opportunities which exist and encouraged to note that Ireland could become increasingly involved in services because there is great job potential in that area.  The future strategy should ensure education is linked to services. Many young economic, engineering, computer and marketing graduates have a golden opportunity to tap into the services sector.  There is an opportunity for us there because we are not into marketing to the same extent as other nations.  We are more into analysis.</P>
    <P>Telecommunications is another area that works and where we would also be in the lead internationally.  This would link us in with financial services, publishing and office administration and make Ireland a centre of administration and service activity for European based companies.  This would be a great system if we could link into this European dimension.  Many European countries would use this country as their base also.</P>
    <P>I would like to look at the structure within companies and new ways of doing things to increase productivity, new ways of identifying the needs of <Col N="1775" /> new and existing clients and new ways of general management and administration. Perhaps, there is a need for change in those areas.  If we looked at them and had a wider debate here, that would make this a realistic document to implement over the next ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>We have become so obsessed in this administration that I fear mentioning another committee, but perhaps some council should be set up which would embrace the social partners and expertise in the areas I have outlined.  It would take on board the link between the service industries and our educational system, compare our competitiveness with other countries and evaluate why we are not doing well.  Perhaps that is the way we should strategise our thinking in relation to this area over the next ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>There is a wider debate here.  This is a worthwhile document with many good things in it.  It will call for further discussion. I would not like us to leave here thinking that our education system should be dictated by the enterprise sector.  On Senator Lee's point, I would like to think that our thinking about life would allow us to use our skills in any way we want.  It has to be that rather than the enterprise sector dictating how we should think and read and the path to be followed by our education system in the future.  I would keep the two of them separate.  There are many areas to develop and link the two but we should not have one overlapping the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I always get suspicious in this House when I find a universal welcome for anything.  It is quite extraordinary how everybody, not so suddenly, believes that this document is the panacea for all our ills.  It makes one wonder why it was written because every speech which I have heard this afternoon has been uncritical of this report.  I do not blame them.  I feel very similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy to write a report which spells out a recipe for happiness and paradise in 15 years time.  It tells us what we all <Col N="1776" /> want but not how we are going to get there.  This could have been written by many people less qualified and with less sophisticated titles but with equally ambitious intent.  I am afraid that this report is to a large extent a reflection of the paralysis in which the Irish economy finds itself in terms of action.</P>
    <P>Forfás has a big problem.  It was not meant to exist.  That is difficult for a semi-State organisation because it does not have a role.  Forfás was set up because there was an argument in the last Government between one part of the Government and another about who should do what, which is what coalitions tend to argue about.  As a result it was set up as an umbrella body over IDA Ireland and Forbairt.  It did not have much to do.  When you read this report you will find that one of the problems of the report is reflected in the first page which tells you what Forfás has to do. Forfás has to advise the Minister on matters relating to the development of industry in the State.  It has to advise on the development and co-ordination of policy for Forbairt, IDA Ireland and An Bord Tráchtála.  It has to promote, encourage and again advise and coordinate.</P>
    <P>This particular document is full of advice, targets, objectives and will do what the Minister suggests; it will provoke debate.  I am sick and tired of debating these issues, which have been debated at least since I came into this House in various forms and will be debated as long as we are alive and for many years afterwards.  There will always be problems of unemployment, inflation, social partnership and national debt and whatever economic problem is current at the moment will probably be a problem for the future.  Yet we have a £400,000 document doing the same again, but the big gap in this document is not its aspirations, which we all have, but its detail.  It is pointless telling us that this is where we want to be in 15 years time, but we do not know how it is going to be done.  It is ridiculous.  It is something, of course, with which everybody can agree; it is very clever.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1777" /> One of the problems we have in this economy at the moment is what the Minister and everybody in this House calls consensus.  Consensus is a disaster because we all agree &mdash; those of us who have platforms and power and who are part of the Forfás report and consensus &mdash; on the way forward, but we are a small club.  The authors of this document are the same people we so euphemistically call the social partners, which are Forfás, IBEC, the ICTU, FÁS, representatives of the IDA and a few people from the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  They all sit down, scratch each other's backs and come to an agreement which suits them all.  It does not suit the taxpayer, the unemployed and small business; but it suits the people who wrote this report and who happen to have a stranglehold over the Irish economy.  The one piece of evidence that shows they have failed so badly is the one problem which is intractable, and that is unemployment.  I do not suggest for one moment that I have the solution to unemployment in this country, but I do know that the stream of reports which have suggested that they have solutions to the unemployment problem have been abysmal failures.  This is only one more which is a bit overhyped.</P>
    <P>Unemployment stands at 13 per cent. Its level is marginally lower that it used be and credit should be given for that, but it is still a chronic problem which has not been radically addressed.</P>
    <P>Here we have a piecemeal solution to unemployment like all the others.  Little bits here, little bits there; that is what the Forfás report suggests.  It states that it will not be easy to solve the unemployment problem and then goes on to make a multitude of suggestions as to how this should be done &mdash; as, indeed, did Culliton, Moriarty, the Central Bank, the ESRI and the National Economic and Social Forum.  I could go on all day listing the number of reports which have suggested the solution to unemployment and I see no reason to believe that this report has the answer more than any of the others, except that it sets <Col N="1778" /> a target of 6 per cent by the year 2010, which, because it sets a target, you somehow believe it will be achieved.  It will not be achieved, and I will tell the House why.  The report's objectives, where there are such details, will never be achieved because this report is not about action.  This is a report by people who are outside the political world, some of them totally academic about things which ought to be done.  The real world of what will be done is here, and it is paralysed.</P>
    <P>The enterprise economy in which we all apparently now believe is totally unacceptable to the left wing.  Let us look at problems the Forfás report does not tackle because of the sensitivities of those who wrote it.  We do not really hear what Forfás has to say about one of the great issues of the say, privatisation. Does Forfás believe that privatisation is a good or bad thing because Ireland is the most backward country in Europe in the area of privatisation?  We do not privatise except when we give companies away &mdash; as in the case of Irish Steel. Otherwise there is a ban on privatisation. Does Forfás believe that privatising An Post, Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus, Telecom Éireann and all the other State companies would be in those companies' interest?  Would it be good for the Exchequer or is Forfás frightened of tackling that problem?  Forfás should have tackled that subject because it has been tackled everywhere else in Europe.  It should have stated that it believes the semi-State companies should be privatised by the year 2000 in the following order and listed its effects as follows: so many people will be unemployed, it will save the State so much money and the money should go towards this, that and the other.</P>
    <P>One cannot have specifics when people with vested interests sit on a report like this, and that is what has happened.  IBEC, Forfás, FÁS, the Department, ICTU and all the other organisations fudge these issues because it suits them.  That way they can share out the national cake as they have been doing recently, to the cost of everybody <Col N="1779" /> else.  There is a tacit deal in place.  We do not privatise because it keeps ICTU happy.  For the sake of the State and the national debt, to which we all pay lip service, we should privatise but this issue is not tackled in any meaningful way.</P>
    <P>Again, why cannot a report of this nature &mdash; which pays lip service to the need to cut the national debt but does not tell us how &mdash; say we are spending too much, we still have a budget deficit but we are going to tackle it and we suggest the following ways.  Did anybody ever hear a politician say they were going to cut public expenditure?  No. Why?  Because they are frightened of saying that it has to be done.  What we should have got from a report of this sort was a statement of how the budget would be balanced, which it ought to be, and how taxes would be cut.</P>
    <P>It makes an extravagant claim about tax cutting.  The report states that 80 per cent of all income tax should be cut to 25 per cent by the year 2010.  I could not agree more.  I think it is a very good idea &mdash; I also think all babies should be given ice cream from birth and for the rest of their lives.  Forfás goes on to say that the rest should be taxed at 40 per cent. Wonderful, great.  I think the Government should do that, but everybody knows the Government is not going to do it; it is pie in the sky.  The report could have said we will do that, it will cost hundreds of millions of pounds and it will be done this way.</P>
    <P>Most politicians who speak about this matter say natural growth will bring in revenue; this is nonsense because they have it spent long before the revenue comes in.  Forfás could have said public spending is too high: we will reduce the strength of the army on the Border and will save a couple of hundred million pounds but they are not going to do that; it could have said social welfare spending is a little high and we will cut the social welfare budget by 10 per cent &mdash; that is £300 million or £400 million &mdash; in the following ways: by cutting the dole, weeding out the difference <Col N="1780" /> between the live register and those on the dole and examining FÁS, that great taboo which nobody dares discuss.</P>
    <P>FÁS costs the Exchequer &mdash; and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; about £430 million per annum which is not a bad bill for the Department of Enterprise and Employment &mdash; approximately £1.2 million per day.  Perhaps this report could have said this will be done by giving the director general of FÁS £250 million next year and he would just have to make do with it. However, it does not tell us how it is to be done.</P>
    <P>I find this report, like many others, a little tiresome.  It is full of words like &ldquo;strategic initiative&rdquo; which means absolutely nothing.  It is full of such words but has no detail whatsoever.  Forfás states, when it gets down to detail, that we must involve the banks and encourage them to give a little more money to small and large business, that we must make them take a few more risks.  Forfás cannot do that.  The banks will not move.  They are not in the business of helping out the Government or the State but of looking after their shareholders.</P>
    <P>We had tributes paid to the need to support the services sector.  Fine.  That is not news to anybody in this House.  The trouble with this report is that while we all agree with it, we know all this will never happen.  Forfás has told us a great deal about what is necessary with regard to public spending and public service pay but the report gives no detail.  It is a waste of £400,000.</P>

      <P>I also have a problem with this report because the aspirations it sets for Ireland in 2010 are too low. They will fail to motivate and to generate the type of consensus needed to achieve the radical change this report outlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1781" /> I welcome the process of which this report is part.  In the past we never made a conscious attempt to chart long-term strategies.  Instead, we reacted to external changes and crises as they arose. That approach is totally inadequate for the changed world into which we are moving.  If we do not seek to shape our future, other people will do it for us.</P>
    <P>I also welcome, like a breath of fresh air, the report's strong focus on the importance of market forces and national competitiveness.  This was emphasised by the introduction of the An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill, 1996, this morning which appoints consumers to An Bord Bia.  When competitiveness is mentioned by those who are not in business, I get the impression they do not understand that the main objective of most businesses is survival.  This report seems to understand that.</P>
    <P>The report comments on many of the things I and others have talked about for years, but it is still a major step forward that they are written on paper with a harp on it.  That did not happen before.  If this report plays a part in shifting the entrenched attitudes in the public service to the realities of the enterprise culture, it will have been worthwhile.  Last year I met a group of Americans in the United States and I was told by a man who was on a number of boards that he had adopted a policy of working hard to ensure they never opened another factory in Ireland.  That surprised and annoyed me.  He said the reason was that when they had to close a factory, they found it difficult to do so because it was not understood that market forces sometimes mean businesses cannot survive.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report's emphasis on the importance of the services sector in job creation.  One of the most carefully hidden facts is that the engine of job creation over the past 25 years has been the sector which got no handouts from the State and which was actively discriminated against in terms of taxation. Some 255,000 jobs were created in the services sector in the past 25 years.  The report stresses that 85 per cent of net <Col N="1782" /> new jobs between now and 2010 will be in the services sector, of which the overwhelming majority will be local services not internationally traded ones.  That is probably an underestimate of what will happen.  We are a long way from appreciating the implications of the services sector for the economy.</P>
    <P>It is clear from almost every page of this report that the old discredited view of manufacturing as the only worthwhile source of job creation will take a long time to die.  Many of the recipes suggested in the report deal with manufacturing. We must continue to nurture and expand our manufacturing sector but we must stop thinking that it will make a dent in the jobs problem.  Manufacturing is about creating wealth in our economy, not about creating jobs.</P>
    <P>The Forfás report sets out an extensive and radical programme and it details all the areas we must address if we want to achieve certain goals by 2010.  However, those goals are unacceptably low and I disagree with the Minister's reference to them as being ambitious.  We should leave aside the goal to bring up our living standards to the EU average by 2010 because that is not the most important point.  The central goal is jobs.  The report states that if we do all the things it suggests we should do, we can cut unemployment in half by the year 2010.  Our goal should be to reduce long-term unemployment from 127,000 to 50,000 in 2010.  Are we satisfied with such modest aspirations for the year 2010?  This contradicts what Senator Ross said.  Are we so unambitious that we could tolerate such enormous levels of unemployment in 15 years' time?</P>
    <P>A few years ago Senator Lee made a great impact with his book which argued that our economy has constantly underachieved since we gained our independence. He argued that instead of feeling satisfied with ourselves, we should be ashamed of the relative lack of economic progress we have made in comparison to other countries.  Now the same thinking is at work again.  We are ready to crawl along a road when we <Col N="1783" /> should be walking or running; we are unwilling to set ourselves challenging targets and we prefer to move forward in tiny steps when we should be contemplating giant leaps.</P>
    <P>What we achieve is related to the goals we set for ourselves.  If we set a low target, we may achieve it or even surpass it, but not by much.  However, if we set the bar high, that will determine our expectations, and our expectations put a limit on our performance.  Goals do matter; they are not an abstraction.  I remember when I was at school I wanted to be on the second rugby team so badly that I worked hard and got on the first team.  Senator Dardis will remember my record in rugby but I would prefer if he did not talk about it. It is not just in sport and business that targets are set and achieved, but in life generally.  It is amazing what can be achieved if we set targets and say we want to be the best.</P>
    <P>Goals are important for motivation. The Forfás report calls for radical changes which are not particularly attractive, such as widening the tax base by putting V A T on food and introducing a broadly based property tax.  It also calls for a change in attitudes.  However, we need to be motivated.  The object of this operation was to create the type of single-mindedness many of us had seen elsewhere.  In Singapore, for example, everybody is involved in trying to make the economy work.  I arrived in Singapore airport at the same time as two other jumbo jets and I thought we would be hours getting through it.  The first stop as we got off the aeroplane was to immigration.  We were through immigration within seconds with someone who welcomed us to the country and then checked the purpose of our visit and so on.  We moved into the baggage retrieval area and our bags were actually on the belt before us.  We moved on to customs.  I remember that part well because a very hard faced Malaysian lady asked me whether I knew that the death penalty exists for importation of drugs into Singapore and <Col N="1784" /> whether I had any with me.  The answer to one of those questions is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and the answer to the other is &ldquo;no&rdquo; and it is not advisable to get the two answers mixed up.  I answered correctly and got through customs promptly.</P>
    <P>Someone from my hotel was waiting for me with my name.  He took me to the door where he asked me to wait a moment. There was a delay of two or three minutes and then he arrived with the car.  He asked me what I thought of the airport and I told him that it was marvellous.  He told me that they came second to Amsterdam last year in the competition for the best airport in the world.  He told me that they were out to win it this year and asked me how I got on at immigration.  I told him that immigration was very efficient. He asked me whether my bags had been ready for me at baggage retrieval and I told him they had.  He was pleased about that and told me that they had lost marks for baggage retrieval last year.</P>
    <P>He asked me whether customs was efficient and friendly and I told him it was.  He asked me whether I had noticed that he did not leave his car parked on the double yellow lines outside the terminal building.  The airport had lost marks the previous year because people had double and treble parked and he told me that Malaysians as a nation had decided no one would park outside the airport.  All drivers would meet their guests first and then bring the car to them.  It seemed to me that the whole nation was involved in competing in trying to win the competition for the best airport of the year and that is exactly what they did a few months later.</P>
    <P>It is possible to drive a nation to succeed by setting targets that it really wants to achieve; that is what I mean when I talk about motivation.  We can set targets and enthuse over them. Create motivation and it is much more likely those targets will be achieved.  I believe passionately that we could create the same kind of motivation here that was created in Singapore, but only <Col N="1785" /> if we choose goals which set people on fire.  We can do this if we tell people that by working together we can completely wipe out long term unemployment by the year 2010 and reduce temporary employment to an absolute minimum. People would ask the price; but even when told that the price will be very high, I think they would decide to do it. They would decide to do it because the goal itself would be motivation enough.</P>
    <P>However, if all we can tell people is that by the year 2010, some 150,000 people will still be unemployed, 50,000 of whom will effectively be unemployed for life, why should we be surprised if they are not excited by the prospect? Why should we be surprised if they are not prepared to pay the price?  Why should we be surprised if politicians are not prepared to stick their necks out in favour of measures which they know will be highly unpopular?</P>
    <P>I am not saying that we should set unrealistic goals, but we have more control over what is realistic than we think. We can wipe out long term unemployment altogether if we believe enough in ourselves to do it.  We can reduce overall unemployment to a fraction of what it is at present if we believe in ourselves. If we create the right motivation, we can succeed beyond our wildest dreams; but without the right motivation we will find it extremely difficult to realise even the very modest dreams set out in this Forfás report.  Which way do we choose to go?  The answer is in our hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I received this report about a week ago and as a member of the National Economic and Social Forum, I set about reading it in anticipation of this debate.  It is a very weighty document and I agree with Senator Ormonde when she says that even with the summary it is very tough going. However, unlike Senator Ross, I do not claim to be a specialist in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are broad aspects of this report which I do not understand.  The authors state with some pride that the promotion of the enterprise sector within a wider framework of social and economic <Col N="1786" /> objectives has not been previously attempted in this country.  If the authors are right about that &mdash; I am not sure that they are &mdash; why should one believe that concentration on a limited sector of the economy would lead to reduced unemployment, raised living standards, a better quality of life, including the quality of the physical environment, the general state of health of the population, the level of crime, the richness, diversity and accessibility of the arts and of cultural heritage facilities?</P>
    <P>If the Minister believes that promotion of the enterprise sector will deliver all of these benefits, then we are living in different worlds.  This is particularly true since the enterprise sector, as the report sees it, does not appear to include the agricultural or State sector but includes only the manufacturing industry and traded services.  Agriculture is extremely important in my constituency of Limerick West.  In County Limerick we have something like 10 per cent of the national milk quota.  Agriculture is of extreme importance in such a constituency.</P>
    <P>Only one page in the report deals with the food industry in any detail. There is no recognition in this report of the importance of enterprise in agriculture. In my opinion, therefore, the report is very unbalanced.  Any report that minimises the contribution which agriculture and the State sector has made in the past and can continue to make in the future to the development of this country cannot be taken seriously.</P>
    <P>I also have difficulties with other aspects of the report.  While saying that economic activity should be shifted from the public sector to the enterprise sector, the report sets a target of high environmental standards.  The assumption is that industry will look after the environment.  However, we all know that given a chance, and without the intervention of the State through the Environmental Protection Agency, local authorities and various other agencies, no industry will adopt high environmental standards.  They will not put in scrubbers <Col N="1787" /> or adopt cost effective methods of cleaning their waste before releasing it into the environment.  Private enterprise will continue to break environmental guidelines unless constantly monitored and they can only be monitored effectively by public agencies.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the issue of long term unemployment the report is somewhat lacking in credibility.  While it acknowledges that dealing with the problem of long term unemployment must be a central part of any long term development strategy, it rather simplistically states that there should be a new approach, that of creating an open high trust environment in which workers are encouraged to think about the purpose of their jobs and their contribution to the success of the enterprise.  I would like to ask some of those who have recently been made unemployed,&mdash;for example the Packard workers in Tallaght or the Neodata workers in Newcastlewest&mdash;about that.  These workers put everything into their jobs, yet those jobs were taken from them overnight without any redress whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The report's solution is to ask workers to accept greater flexibility and more part-time, temporary or fixed contract work.  In my town that means taking up work for ten weeks of the year. Who is to support those workers and their families for the rest of the year? The State?  Our economy cannot become solely dependent on part-time, temporary or fixed contract workers. The majority of those part-time, temporary or fixed contract workers will be women because they are seen as the disposable workers in our economy.  I would not like to see the economy going in that direction.</P>
    <P>It hardly comes as a surprise when one comes to the section of the report that advocates tax reduction as a prime target of society.  It argues for a 5 per cent reduction in the total tax take in the next 15 years.  The main justification for this apparently is &ldquo;to make clear the implied relative shift of resources towards the market sector of the economy&rdquo;. <Col N="1788" /> How will this tax reduction take effect and how will it affect necessary current expenditure on social welfare, health and education?</P>
    <P>Every page of the report calls for Government support but support is a euphemism for providing money.  What other type of support can one give except that which has to be financed?  In every page of the report, whether it deals with education or public administration, the word support is used without defining what it means.</P>
    <P>There is great emphasis in the report on the free enterprise market, but no country has adopted a totally free enterprise culture.  Even the United States does not have such a culture; it has successfully negotiated trade agreements that protect its own industries while imposing penalties on countries such as Canada and Mexico that adopt a different international trading position <i>vis-à-vis</i> Cuba.</P>
    <P>The United States will adopt a free enterprise culture when it suits, for example, when it comes to exporting its own products.  However, when it comes to foreign imports the US is not so keen to see Japanese cars flooding the market.</P>
    <P>The United States is not a model we should follow.  Ireland has a mixed economy, comprising public and private enterprise, which is working well.  Just as no team manager would switch key players or the game plan half way through a match, neither would it be in the best interests of our economy to radically change direction.  To do so would leave vast sectors high and dry.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that only three-quarters of a page in the report is devoted to regional policy.  One of the big problems facing any public representative from a rural constituency is the growing awareness that native industries setting up in Ireland are drawn towards large urban centres.  This leads to massive problems in rural areas, yet the report provides no solace to anyone from a rural area who is hoping for a re-examination of regional policy.</P>
    <P>In the 1960s and 1970s there was a marked regional policy that tried to <Col N="1789" /> divert much industry away from cities into rural areas, but that policy has clearly been abandoned.  Cities like Dublin are growing without any major overall plan; they are sprawling at an enormous rate and are creating huge social problems.  Meanwhile, large areas of the west are devastated and young local people who have been trained are leaving to work in cities.  There is nothing in the report about this serious social and economic problem which needs to be tackled.  It will have disastrous consequences for the social fabric of rural areas if it is not dealt with.  The report contains nothing to counterbalance the problem.</P>
    <P>Much of the report can be praised as it contains fresh thinking.  While I do not wish to be overly critical, I raised some points in case we all got lost in a sea of congratulations and bualadh bos for the report.  There are serious gaps in it and serious problems in the approach it takes to various areas.</P>

      <P>I welcome the contributions that this Forfás report, <i>Shaping our Future</i>, can make to the debate on industrial policy.  It is a valuable document in that respect.  We in the Progressive Democrats are pleased with the thrust of the report in so far as Forfás seems to support many of our key policy positions on the economy.</P>
      <P>Some of the options favoured by the document include a reduction in personal taxation to increase the incentive to work; reductions in both capital and corporate taxes to promote job creating enterprise; the provision of key State companies to enhance competition in sectors such as telecommunications and energy and encouraging greater private sector involvement in the provision of public infrastructure, particularly in the transport area.  All these ideas can be found in recent economic policy documents published by the Progressive Democrats.  From that point of view I welcome the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks my colleague, Deputy Molloy, has argued for an innovative and imaginative approach to funding <Col N="1790" /> the Dublin light rail project, and the involvement of private sector finance in this major infrastructural development. He obviously argued this so successfully that the Government was defeated on the matter yesterday in the Dáil. However, there is no evidence that the Government has made even a cursory examination of private sector funding despite the fact that such partnerships are becoming increasingly common around the world.</P>
    <P>As Senator Quinn said, the report is too gradualist.  For instance, Forfás talks about reducing the basic rate of income tax from 27 per cent to 25 per cent by the year 2010.  However, cutting two points off income tax over 15 years is not a very ambitious target.  When the Progressive Democrats were in Government they succeeded in clipping five points off the basic rate in just three and a half years.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about promoting industrial development and generating new jobs, a more radical approach is called for.  We need a five year programme of tax reform that would transform the economics of job creation within the lifetime of a single Government. The basic rate of tax could and should be cut to 20 per cent and the top rate to 40 per cent.  We should reduce the number of taxes on earned income from four to one by abolishing employees' PRSI, the health levy and the training and employment levy.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about job creation we cannot persist with a system that taxes the earnings of a worker on £247 per week at a marginal rate of 56 per cent.  What kind of crazy tax system do we have when a person on £2,500 a week faces a lower marginal rate than someone on £250 per week?  We must also move to reduce the level of employers' PRSI.  This is essentially a tax on jobs and it must be brought down if we are to give firms an incentive to take on additional employees.</P>
    <P>Solving the unemployment crisis must be our number one political priority. The economic costs of unemployment are huge.  We have paid out over £5 <Col N="1791" /> billion in unemployment compensation in the last five years alone.  The Government's task force on long-term unemployment estimated that taking account of dole payments and income tax foregone, the cost to the Exchequer of having a person out of work is about £10,200 per year.  Given that the real level of unemployment is of the order of 350,000 people, the cost of joblessness to the Exchequer is now running at £3.5 billion per year or almost £70 million a week.</P>
    <P>The social costs of unemployment are all around us.  We can see the human misery it causes as well as the deprivation and disadvantages that result from it, and the culture of drugs and crime which prospers in the midst of unemployment.  We have now reached a point where whole areas of our towns and cities have effectively become detached from the normal workings of the economy because of the impact of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Forfás document is but the latest contribution to the debate on how we solve the unemployment crisis.  It points out that reform of our tax system is an essential part of any job creation policy and my party fully agrees with that. Four years ago the Culliton report on industrial policy came to the same conclusion and just last week the European Union published a report on the Irish economy which highlighted the same issue.  We might be short of jobs but we are not short of analysis and advice.  It is about time we got down to implementing that advice.</P>
    <P>Everybody is aware of the crippling burden of our tax system and the impositions it places on the competitiveness of Irish industry.  Take a typical company employing 350 people.  The typical worker in that company earns a gross wage of £193 per week.  A Government that was strongly committed to creating, protecting and maintaining employment in the Irish economy would ensure that workers in such companies were given <Col N="1792" /> every incentive to work.  However, the reality is different.</P>
    <P>The workers in the company I cited pay four separate taxes on their weekly wages.  They pay income tax, employee's PRSI, the health levy and the training and employment levy.  This means the same slice of income is taxed four times so effectively the workers are paying tax on tax.  After paying the four taxes a typical single worker in that company takes home the princely sum of £148 per week.  Some £45 per week, almost one-quarter of his or her weekly earnings, is swallowed up in tax and deductions.</P>
    <P>This is not much of an incentive for people who are on the dole to move into paid employment.  How many plants, such as the one I described, have closed because of our crazy tax system?  How many such plants have failed to locate in Ireland because of our tax policies? If the situation is bad for employees it is just as bad from the employer's point of view.  The company must pay employer's PRSI, a fifth tax on the total wage bill.  This brings the weekly wage cost for the average worker to £209 per week.  Within the past week I received a communication from the Farm Tractor and Machinery Trade Association, the people who sell farm machinery, which made exactly the same point and said how difficult it was for them to employ people.  We have the incredible situation where it is costing a company £209 to pay each of its workers £148 per week in take home pay.  The Government, through five separate taxes, collects no less than £61 per week from every worker in that typical company.  That is tantamount to imposing a 30 per cent tax on job creation.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn that we need to give people a stake in the nation.  That brings us back to the example of the airport in Singapore where people felt they had a stake in its success and were prepared to go out and work for it.  We can do the same if we give people the same feeling that they have a stake in the nation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this report is likely to join the other reports on the political <Col N="1793" /> shelf.  Essentially it argues for the creation of an enterprise economy and I doubt that the present Government supports that.  That has been confirmed by the contribution of Senator Kelly which demonstrated the divergence of views among the Government parties on this matter.  The Government is deeply divided about several important issues and taxation is just one of them.  Fine Gael in Opposition was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The last budget made virtually no progress in reducing the burden of taxation on work.  A single person on £300 per week gained £1.71 from the budget, less than the price of a pint.  Income tax in total will rise by £260 million in 1996 and almost 90 per cent of this will come <Col N="1794" /> from the PAYE sector.  The January budget increased the overall burden of taxation on the economy by £730 million, which is equivalent to an extra £14 per week in tax on every household. Taxation this year is budgeted to increase by 6.5 per cent, three times the rate of inflation.  If the Government had moderated its appetite for increased taxation and kept the increase in line with inflation, it would have been able to reduce the basic rate of income tax by almost 7 per cent to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party came to power in 1992.  By the end of this year that party will have succeeded in pushing up the Government's total tax take by £3.25 billion, an increase of 35 per cent, almost four times the rate of inflation. It is a sobering thought that if the increase in overall taxation had been kept in line with inflation since the start of 1993, we could have halved everybody's income tax bill.</P>

In deference to the Senators' feelings I had better move away from taxation since it causes such problems for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report makes a wide range of proposals in the broader area of industrial policy which, while eminently sensible, may be described as provocative given the composition of the present Government.  It advocates the sale of Telecom Éireann's Cablelink subsidiary <Col N="1795" /> to an independent network provider as a means of increasing competition in the telecommunications sector.  It also advocates privatisation in the energy sector and that private sector provision of generating capacity should be encouraged. As a means of achieving this it suggests that the sale of existing ESB power stations to the private sector should be considered.  It will be interesting to hear the views of the Government on these issues.  We are moving slowly towards greater competition in areas such as telecommunications and electricity but this is only because we are being directed to do so by Brussels.</P>
    <P>There appears to be no great appetite for the promotion of competition in the Irish administrative system.  Indeed, by using derogations and other devices, we have endeavoured to limit as far as possible the extent to which EU directives will open up State monopolies to competitive pressures.</P>
    <P>One of the key ideas running through the Forfás report is that the State should be willing to reduce the extent of its direct involvement in the Irish economy. The authors of the report are to be commended for their bravery in putting this suggestion before the Government, which appears to have set its face firmly against any such development.  It is time we recognised that Governments do not create jobs.  If they did we would have achieved full employment years ago.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Kelly's comments about the scope within the agriculture and food sectors for development and job creation.  There are many highly successful organisations in those sectors, such as the Kerry Group, but they are exceptions rather than the rule.  Much of our native industry has passed into foreign hands.  More could be done to ensure that indigenous companies contribute to the economy and that, as a result of our policies, we do not force them to locate their processing and other downstream activities, which should provide jobs in rural areas, in other countries.  Our present system discourages investment and enterprise and <Col N="1796" /> if it continues, those companies will continue what they have already started and go to other countries to carry out their processing and added value activities. That would be a major loss to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report.  It is a useful document in terms of creating debate on these important matters.</P>

I join Senator Dardis in congratulating the Leader of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;the Taoiseach&mdash;and the Members of the party who, while in Opposition, created a mood of acceptance of the notion that if something is taxed there will be less of it.  If we want more enterprise, we have to reduce the taxation of enterprise.  It took a long time for even economists to accept that.  My party hammered away at that notion in Opposition while I was a Member of the other House between 1989 and 1993.

Politics is the art of the possible, not the art of selfdestruction. I would be very disappointed if the Fine Gael Party was wiped out in the next general election because it is making a tremendous contribution to the development of society. I want it to stay in Government and to <Col N="1799" /> continue to offer that necessary leadership.</P>
      <P>This report is valuable.  I do not agree with my colleague who said it was a waste of money.  It is another step in a particular direction.  If an evaluation is carried out in four years' time, a completely different set of proposals will be made.  Society is changing at such a rate that nobody in their right mind would even attempt to forecast what kind of society we will have in 2010.  The changes in technology and education, and the changes our young people will make to society, mean we cannot forecast very far into the future.  I am happy with many of the ideas in the report.  It has aspects which some people will like and others will not.</P>
      <P>When did value for money become a matter of ideology?  Most of us in the Government are united on that point. Value for money is not a PD notion but something to which we all aspire. People, such as Senator Kelly, are afraid that if we take a wild notion to turn society upside down overnight the poor and those in need of support will not be helped.  I share her views on that.  My first and basic principle is that the weak in society should be protected.  Once we have agreed on that we can look for value for money.  From talking to my colleagues in other parties I cannot see any blockage in that area.</P>
      <P>The old labels of left and right are nonsensical nowadays.  There was a time when people used to say that because the Labour Party was on the left it would not agree with certain matters. However, there has been a change there.  While certain matters might not have been acceptable to them at one stage because they were unacceptable to their forefathers, that has now changed. An evolution is being forced on us because society is changing so quickly. Nobody is going to nail the Labour Party and say it will not do certain things because they are &ldquo;lefties&rdquo;.  The Labour Party has always been very responsible in Government.  It has changed and will continue to change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" /> We have to agree first that we are not going to throw the weak and poor in society to the wolves.  Once we have agreed that, we can move to value for money and look at every part of our public administration system.  If we wish, we can decide to change that and get better value for money.  However, we are not going to interrupt, destroy or sacrifice the poor and those who need our support in society by making changes.  Every party will support it.  The ideological lines drawn years ago are totally irrelevant now.  When people refer to the Labour Party, they are not referring to today's Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that we should get full value for money with regard to everything we do and that services are delivered in the most efficient and cost effective manner possible.  I, and many people who would be so-called &ldquo;lefties&rdquo;, agree that market forces should be brought to bear on as much of our economic activity as possible.  Many people would agree with that but there might be details with which they would not agree.  We will not serve our people right or well unless we seek value for money in every area.  There are changes necessary.  The Civil Service needs changes implemented in the way they do their work.  We have to release the full potential of every individual working in the Civil Service and the old system will not allow that.  We have a Strategic Management Initiative now in place.  When we evaluate that in a few years time we will probably have a different approach.  That is all right for today but it will not be all right for tomorrow.  We have to constantly change.  Therefore, I want value for money.  I do not agree with Senator Dardis that the ideal lower rate of tax should be 20 per cent.  The ideal rate of personal tax is zero per cent.</P>

      <P>We should be aiming at the lowest possible rate of personal tax. I do not want to hang any tag on it.

We want to see this going ahead, with better control over our public finances, less demand by Government on scarce money within the economy and more growth.  There is an evolution of thought going on and the Progressive Democrats have been caught up with it long ago.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Banks do not invest in the Irish economy. They pick and choose.  They do not take equity in companies.  They lend money only if they are sure of getting it back.  This should be examined.  Some day we should pass legislation forcing the banks to take equity in the Irish economy.  We should be thinking in terms of 30 per cent of their profits being injected into the economy in the form of equity, not in the form of lending. I would like us to examine whether that is feasible.  I know from experience, the banks in other economies take equity and are involved in business.  The banks here are sheltered.  They pick the sweet apples and give them money in the full knowledge they will get it back. They make huge profits but do not <Col N="1802" /> invest any of it in the Irish economy. They must do this.</P>
    <P>We can easily identify the weaknesses in the Irish economy.  The indigenous sector has huge problems.  Management capacity has to be improved.  When that matter is discussed, one is drawn into talking about the way we have been using the grants system.  We would need another hour or two to discuss that.  The most important thing the Irish economy has to do is to continue trying to capacity build at management level. Poor management implies poor performance and earning.  It implies putting a low value added product on the market and low earning for the worker and the State.  Capacity building at management level must form the centrepiece of everything we do from now on.  Innovation is part of the function of management. Any of the innovative factories of which I have had experience, which continually develop products, have excellent management.  The ones that do not have weak management.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister and those responsible for bringing this report before the House.  It gives us an opportunity to discuss the situation and, more importantly, inform ourselves and the public.  It is an effort to create new moods within which we can operate and continue to develop the economy until we have reached a better standard of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that the Minister is present to listen to the debate on this report.  Many aspects of the report are familiar, because many of its proposals and issues were raised by the Minister as the Opposition spokesperson on industry.  As the Fine Gael policy co-ordinator, he did tremendous work in sparking off discussion and debate within and outside the party in promoting an enterprise culture.  This report is well timed.  I am delighted the Minister is here as Minister for Enterprise and Employment as he is in a position to implement the proposals and recommendations in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" /> We should take the opportunity to compliment the Minister on the work he has done to date in engendering an enterprise culture within the Irish community and encouraging people to establish their own businesses.  The arrangment that £60 million be set aside for venture and seed capital is a major initiative for people to start their own business.</P>
    <P>The Minister's promotion and implementation of the special loan scheme for the small and medium sized enterprises has been extremely successful because it assisted businesses which were in difficulty and could have gone to the wall. The £208 million set aside will enable many businesses to survive.  He has helped small businesses by providing support for innovation services.  All this lends to the spirit of enterprise within the community.  One of our industries that has recently been subject to huge job losses is the clothing industry.  Just weeks ago the Minister announced a major plan to bring that industry into the next century so that it can compete on European and international markets. That is extremely important.  The announcement as regards assistance in auditing and design was welcomed by people in the industry.</P>
    <P>These matters are fundamental to the viability and success of a business.  I believe the Minister is moving in the right direction.  His statements as Opposition spokesman for Fine Gael and his actions in Government have leaned towards helping business and enterprise. I hope he will be in that position for quite some time to come as he has foresight and understanding of what is necessary.</P>
    <P>This report is very interesting and I am delighted it has sparked off such a level of debate and varied contributions from the Opposition and the Government parties.  That is very healthy.  With such a report, <i>Shaping Our Future</i>, it would be very bad if we did not have varied opinions and the freedom to express them.  We are expressing constructive <Col N="1804" /> suggestions that can be pulled together in the interests of the people.</P>
    <P>This is a discussion document which I hope will get a response from interested parties across the community.  Everybody&mdash;the trade unions, industry, farming, public or private sectors or the service industry&mdash;should read this report, comment on it and have an input from their perspective.  We are an island nation, on the periphery of Europe, at a competitive disadvantage and we must ensure that we are cost-competitive with international trade.  Given that from a telecommunications, technology and transport point of view, the world is becoming smaller it is imperative that we are alert to the pitfalls of the future and take preventive action rather than trying to remedy the situation after a problem has arisen.  That is why this report is important.</P>
    <P>It could be said that, in a sense, it is idealistic and coming from one position, that is, Forfás, a combination of the IDA and Forbairt, who has one underlying objective&mdash;to create enterprises. They deal with this from their own specific viewpoint but a politician has to look at the overall good of the community. That is why there has to be a political face on it.  One criticism of the report is that it is aspirational but there is no cost mentioned and no proposal has been analysed for cost.  For instance, mention is made of achieving tax reform and a substantial reduction in the national debt.  I would like to see how that might be done and its cost over the next 15 years.  Both aspirations are highly commendable but in the end, the politicians will have to implement them and we have no formula in this report to help us achieve that.  The Minister and his Department might arrange for an analysis of the cost of how the combined aspirations might be secured.</P>
    <P>It is important to continue to engender in the minds of the Irish people the importance of self-sufficiency, first as individuals, and second as a country. For too long we have looked to the Government and State agencies.  The dependency culture that has been generated <Col N="1805" /> in the last 20 years is not too laudable.  I am delighted that we are focusing on self-reliance and enterprise. People are being asked whether they can succeed in starting a small service or manufacturing business.  I was disappointed that while the report recognises that there has been a huge fall in employment in agriculture and its levelling off means it will not be as dramatic in the future, it does not deal in any great detail with how to create an employment spin-off in agriculture. More consideration should have been given to our natural resources, agriculture, food processing, fisheries, etc.</P>
    <P>There is a commendable tendency regarding foreign direct investment.  It is important that we continue to get foreign direct investment, whether from international companies or by way of joint venture between foreign and Irish companies.  There is a great future for the joint venture approach in securing international markets and this should be pursued.  It is crucial to recognise the importance of the service sector&mdash;and how it may generate huge employment in the future&mdash;and the tourism sector to the national economy.  We need to keep a close look on the level of payment of employees in those sectors. There is a danger &mdash; especially in the tourism sector &mdash; that if employees are not given attractive employment standards, the existing potential will not be realised.  That would be a disaster because Ireland is one of the most attractive places for tourists.  Although we have made great advances, it is a sector that needs to be watched very closely.</P>
    <P>In recent years, one of our advantages has been a skilled workforce, particularly in the technological area.  A young, skilled workforce was available to new companies and that attracted many companies to Ireland.  We need to stay ahead in that area and that is why the education of the labour force is so important.  It is equally important to recognise that, while we educate our people for industry and the number of <Col N="1806" /> working hours per week will be reduced, people will need to be educated to make the most of their leisure time.  It is important to maintain the academic aspect of education for the fulfilment of the whole person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Justice to implement the recommendations of the 1995 Report of the Visiting Committee of Mountjoy Prison. </P>
      <P>The 1995 report of the Visiting Committee of Mountjoy Prison caused a little flurry of interest when it was released. However, within less than a month, concern for any of the recommendations seems to have subsided.  The report was similar to those produced by the committee over the last few years and little, but nothing, has happened to their recommendations either.</P>
      <P>One cheerful note, however, is that in all the reports the Governor of Mountjoy and his staff are frequently praised for the efforts they make to run as humane a regime as possible in impossible circumstances and with minimal facilities.  It is a consistent theme throughout the report that they are doing all they can in trying circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Management of Offenders report is now two years old.  There has not been much action on it, although it continues to be Department of Justice policy. However, the authors of the report should not complain too much because the Whitaker report is 11 years old and its recommendations also await implementation. I express my sympathy to all those who have put such hard work into these various reports to see so little achieved in an area where changes are so badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following is a summary of the recommendations made by the Visiting Committee of Mountjoy Prison.  First, to appoint an Inspector of Prisons with <Col N="1807" /> specific proposed powers, duties and terms of reference; second, to provide separate remand facilities for prisoners; third, to introduce a legal ceiling to numbers in Mountjoy Prison; fourth, to immediately commence the building of the Women's Prison; fifth, to review and restructure the Permanent Suicide Prevention Committee; sixth, to formulate one coherent medical services policy; seventh, to introduce structures of medical accountability; eighth, to increase the powers of the Medical Director of Prison Services; ninth, to review present guidelines for padded cells; tenth, to initiate a survey to establish the real extent of drug abuse within the prison with a view to setting procedures in place to eradicate the problem.</P>
    <P>On an Adjournment debate two weeks ago I addressed the need for an Inspector of Prisons.  In her reply, the Minister said it would be a relatively small development, recognised it was recommended in the Whitaker report and in the Management of Offenders report, but said it would have to wait until the question of an independent prison board was being considered.  This, therefore, is one recommendation which has been put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>Other Senators have kindly agreed to address some of the other recommendations. I wish, therefore, to focus my attention on those involving the medical service in the prison and the role of the Medical Director of Prisons.  The 1995 report section on the primary medical care services and the psychiatric services states:</P>
    <P>This medical report highlights much of what has already been reported in previous Visiting Committees' Annual Reports as well as that which has been reported to the Irish Government by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the CPT Report) which was published on 13 December 1995.  As a basic starting point we reluctantly accept that the <Col N="1808" /> provision of a satisfactory level of health care is almost impossible in a prison which is 'overcrowded, unhygienic and has very few regime activities' (CPT p. 43). </P>
    <P>As the Minister will be aware, the doctors servicing the prison work on a part-time basis.  This is desirable because exclusively prison work has been found in other jurisdictions to be detrimental to the doctor's skills.</P>
    <P>The complaints centre around the main prison which, regrettably, is a remand prison as well as a detention centre for sentenced prisoners.  No negligence is claimed by the report, but it is critical of what could be described as the quality and the quantity of the medical service to prisoners.  In view of this, members of the committee decided to do a time and motion study on the medical services in the main prison.  It could be described as an attempt at a medical audit.  The report to the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland on Medical Audit by the late Professor John Pritchard states:</P>
    <P>An audit is a detailed and critical evaluation of quality and quantity.  In modern speech the word is used mainly in a financial context&mdash;so its application to medicine has unpleasant and sometimes threatening connotations.  But medical audit in its broader and proper sense is not new&mdash;although the rapid development of a technical jargon has given the impression that it is.  Doctors have been making critical evaluations of their work for centuries.  Almost every physician has taken part in innumerable audits since he was a medical student: every death conference, every clinico-pathological conference, each clinical trial, every ward round is potentially an audit. </P>
    <P>With the severe financial pressures in the prison service and the need to ensure that the best medical care possible is given to prisoners, it is hard to see why the medical services inside Mountjoy Prison should be excluded <Col N="1809" /> from audit when those of us who work outside have to become involved in them.  Medical audit involves the systematic collection of data and the use of this data to improve the quality and efficiency of patient care.  The visiting committee appears to be concerned about the remuneration of these doctors.  Page 30 of the report states:</P>
    <P>The remuneration records in relation to medical services (obtained from the Department of Justice) clearly state that both doctors in the Main Prison earn over £15,308.  In effect this means that Dr. A earns over £15,000 for providing a medical service for 107 days in the year with some 20 medical visits being as short as 20 minutes or less.  Dr B also earns over £15,000 while providing a medical service 142 times, with 21 visits being 21 minutes or less.  We are puzzled as to why Doctors A and B in the Main Prison should be reimbursed at such a profitable rate&mdash; compared, for instance, to the Women's Prison, (approximately £9,000 per doctor) &mdash; particularly when the sessional time spent in the Main Prison can on occasions be so brief. </P>
    <P>They also query the number of patients seen by the doctors in a very short length of time.  For example, it reports that Dr A saw 40 patients in 50 minutes on January 13, six patients in ten minutes on 17 February and 43 patients in 40 minutes on 5 December and that the total visits of Dr. A to the prison in 1994 were 107, of which 53 were of an hour or less and 23 were of 20 minutes or less.  At the same time, Dr. B saw 42 patients in 42 minutes one day and 31 patients in 35 minutes on another day and that the total number of his visits to the prison in 1994 was 142, of which 94 visits were of a duration of one hour or less and 21 visits were of a duration of 15 minutes or less.</P>
    <P>This was the visiting committee's attempt at a medical audit.  However, there was one vital ingredient missing, an ingredient necessary to undertake a <Col N="1810" /> medical audit, which the visiting committee has overlooked.  A medical audit should be carried out by one's peers. Following this report, so that the doctors can be given a chance to explain the relevance of this data, it is essential that the Minister ask a body such as the Irish College of General Practitioners to set up a medical audit on the prison medical service in Mountjoy Prison.  I am sure the doctors working in the prison will welcome the opportunity, as any professional would, to put their case to their peers.  Explanations have been given that many of the prisoners who attend the clinics do so for trivial reasons, such as to get anti-dandruff shampoo.  Naturally, any person would like a trip out of the cell block and a visit to the doctor cannot be refused; but the doctors involved should be given a chance to explain their case to their peers.</P>
    <P>The report also points out that the Medical Director of Prisoners appears to have little operational control over the doctors who work in prison.  It quotes from the report of the 1993 Committee for the Prevention of Torture, which states: &ldquo;In practise the Director of Prison Medical Services has no operational control over the work of doctors in the prisons&rdquo;.  This crazy situation must be addressed immediately &mdash; one would wonder why a Director of Prison Medical Services was appointed and then given no function.  It smacks of a terrible waste of money for the State and a waste of talented man's time.</P>
    <P>Concern was also expressed about the psychiatric services.  These are provided by psychiatrists who are full time employees of the Eastern Health Board and based in the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  Often these doctors are not of consultant level, leaving very difficult cases to be dealt with by doctors in training.  Many prisoners with psychiatric problems go unattended or unassessed for days, or even weeks, according to the report, because of the inadequacy of the psychiatric services in Mountjoy.  There is a constant waiting list and the transfer of <Col N="1811" /> an offender, even when eventually seen and assessed as suffering from a mental illness, is often delayed due to lack of accommodation in Dundrum.  This means that the medical staff of Mountjoy have to deal with psychiatric patients, a field in which they do not profess to have any proficiency.</P>
    <P>The report quotes from the 1993 visiting committee report, which states &ldquo;approximately 60/70% of the patients seen by the psychiatrists are essentially requests for sleeping pills, a situation which the average GP would feel normally competent to deal with&rdquo;.  The committee also feels that the amount of money spent on paying psychiatrists is not value for money.  About £35,000 is spent every year.  They point out that this is given to people who are already in full-time employment.</P>
    <P>The report suggests, and I agree, that the Minister for Health needs to become involved with this problem area.  To help the early transfer of patients who are suffering from mental illness in Mountjoy, the Central Mental Hospital has 20 beds in an unused new building which should be opened immediately.  The area of forensic psychiatry is in need of urgent attention. Psychiatrists say they cannot treat prisoners who have personality or behaviour problems.  They say that these are social problems, not medical.  They will treat such prisoners if they have a psychiatric disease but not otherwise.</P>
    <P>When we commit people to prison, be it on remand or following sentence, we are obliged to give them proper medical care.  Having read this report and the others I mentioned, it is hard to see how it can be said to be happening in the main prison in Mountjoy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to second this motion from my colleague, Senator Henry.  As she indicated, she asked a number of us to take specific areas.  She asked me to look at the area of drugs and I am happy to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction to the report itself underlines the seriousness of the drugs <Col N="1812" /> problem in Mountjoy.  The first paragraph states that the 1995 report was prepared against a background of considerable tension and difficulty for the prison service and goes on to say that it was yet again a year of increased crime and drug abuse.  Not only do we have the problem of increased crime outside the prison, which is often related to drug addiction, but we also have a serious problem with regard to drugs inside the prison system.  I note that only four pages of the report address this problem. An examination of this subject should have taken a greater proportion of space in the report.  I hope that future reports will pay more attention to it.</P>
    <P>There are certain fundamental areas which must be examined.  One of them, for example, which is certainly not mentioned in the section dealing with drugs, is the related problem of AIDS.  It is important that this matter be considered by the visiting committee in its report because it is a problem in Mountjoy.  It is related to drugs and also to sexual activity within the prison.  We may well like to pretend that sexual activity does not take place in prisons, but it does. We may well like to pretend that the injection of drugs does not take place in prison, but it does.</P>
    <P>These are high risk practices in terms of disease and that high risk is intensified by the prison conditions because of the furtiveness with which they must take place and the lack of access to those prophylactic measures that are accessible to people on the outside, particularly the use of condoms and needle exchange.  Despite the fact that some members of the public might think it wrong to make available either condoms or free needles within the prison system, it is important that we overcome our scruples so that both condoms and needles are made available because of the life threatening nature of the circumstances involved.  Some people may dissent from this because they prefer to think there is no sexual activity and no drug taking in prison, but there certainly is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1813" /> The enormous pressure on the facility is a general problem.  Mountjoy was built as a short-term prison to cope with less than half the numbers currently involved in it.  There is a revolving door situation, so one not only has overcrowding but a constant throughput. This makes it increasingly difficult to monitor the drugs situation.  As the House and the Minister know only too well, relatives of prisoners and prisoners themselves are extraordinarily ingenious in inventing new methods, sometimes very intimate methods, of introducing drugs into the prison system for themselves and their relatives.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it would be possible to stamp out drugs until we are able to stamp them out in the wider community. I do not believe that is possible either.  It certainly will not be possible to reduce it significantly until very radical measures are taken on a global scale.  In this context I am talking about the removal of restrictions on drugs to destroy the economic base, but that is another argument.</P>
    <P>There is no sign of our winning the war against drugs in the wider community and there is little sign that we can win it in the prison system. However, we have a responsibility to try, because prisoners are not only being punished or penalised; they are in the custody of the State.  It is a fearful irony that young people go into prison drug free and, through a combination of boredom, peer pressure and so on, they come out as drug addicts and sometimes also carrying the inevitably fatal AIDS virus.  It is incumbent upon us to try to do whatever we can.</P>
    <P>Improvements in the medical service are required.  My colleague, Senator Henry, was very tactful in her remarks about the medical service.  I do not know much about it now, but over many years I visited Mountjoy and Dundrum. The medical services provided there were pathetic in the extreme and consisted largely of handing out drugs to patients in order to keep them subdued. Included in the report is a suggestion, which is very honest, that many <Col N="1814" /> members of the staff of the prison turn a blind eye to the consumption of drugs precisely because they can be used to damp down and control behaviour.  It is clearly stated that a rigorous programme of prevention would include such draconian measures that the absence of drugs as a kind of anodyne in the prison system, coupled with the aggravation of these techniques, would almost definitely lead to serious unrest within the prison system.</P>
    <P>In making these remarks I do not intend to be critical of the staff or the Governor.  I am glad to agree with Senator Henry who made the point, which is also made repeatedly in this report, that the Governor has done an extremely good job.  I have never had the pleasure of meeting him, but I have heard him on the radio on numerous occasions.  He struck me as being a highly intelligent, humane and decent person and it is appropriate that he should be so complimented.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which we could raise.  For example, in the 1977 Misuse of Drugs Act provision was made for the creation of custodial treatment centres for people convicted of drug related offences.  Where are they? They do not exist and, as the report rightly says, one of the problems is that judges have to sentence people and prisons have to accept them.  This results in massive pressure on the prisons, including a significant proportion of people involved in drug related offences and helping to spread this kind of infection. Although provision was made for them in 1977, we have no custodial drug centres.  On one occasion of which I am aware a barrister made an application to the judge, but the prisoner was sent to Dundrum.  It is simply impractical.  We must do something in this area.</P>
    <P>I refer to the sadness with which I have heard repeated stories of people dying inside Mountjoy in circumstances related to drugs.  This year I listened to the mother of a young woman who had desperately tried to get on to a methadone maintenance programme on the outside, had not succeeded, had gone <Col N="1815" /> back on the needle, had robbed or committed some criminal act in order to feed her habit, was sent into Mountjoy and hung herself.  It is a comment on ourselves that this should be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>There is a lot more I could, and should say, but perhaps the few points I made will be considered.  While they are not intended to be critical of the Minister, the drug free unit is largely cosmetic &mdash; it is the old training unit with a new name.  The committee expressed the hope that a real facility will be established, that it has been promised a detoxification unit and that it looks forward to its opening in 1996.  It must be opened and I hope the Minister can give us a commitment this evening.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Senator Henry for raising this issue and the visiting committee on its frankness and openness when presenting its report to the Minister for Justice.  The problems in prisons have been tolerated for too many decades and they must be dealt with and solutions must be found.  Some of those solutions are contained in the report's recommendations.  I concur with previous speakers by saying that the staff and Governor of Mountjoy are not at fault as they must deal with a very difficult situation.  The Governor, Mr. John Lonergan, whom I met, is an excellent servant of the State and is operating in difficult circumstances in the best interests of the prison service and prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Norris, Senator Henry asked me to deal specifically with the issue of suicide in prison and I am pleased to contribute in a positive way to this important debate.  I am concerned about the number of suicides in Mountjoy.  Since 1990 there have been 25 suicides in Irish prisons; 16 or 64 per cent, of those have been in Mountjoy, which contains 28 per cent of the prison population.  It would appear that there is a particular problem in Mountjoy in relation to suicide.  I appreciate the prison has taken steps to introduce a suicide <Col N="1816" /> prevention committee, about which I will speak later.</P>
    <P>The three deaths this year were related to drugs.  As Senator Norris said, this is probably a key issue in relation to the tendency to commit suicide in prison; I will deal with others later.  Drug addiction and drug taking are very much related to attempted suicide and suicide. According to prison statistics, those returning after temporary release are at a high risk.  The prison has ensured that they are not in a position to take drugs, because they often come in after taking drugs and there is a possibility they will overdose or suffer consequent depression.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that most of the suicides in Mountjoy were committed by people under 30 years of age, a trend which is evident elsewhere.  The highest suicide rate is among those aged 15 to 35 years.  The most frightening thing is the high level of attempted suicides among women prisoners, which goes against all trends in society.  Last year there were 15 attempted suicides by women &mdash; six were regarded as very serious &mdash; out of a prison population of 30 to 40.  This is ten times greater than the figures for the male population.  This trend is different from that in society. One female to four males commits suicide in prison.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a culture in prison of discussing the taking of one's life as a solution to the difficulties women experience in prison.  Those who understand suicide will know of the contagion or copycat effect.  If suicide is constantly discussed by the women prison population, inevitably there will be more attempted suicides.  This year we witnessed a very sad suicide in the prison. If something can be done to change that culture, it will affect the suicide rate.</P>
    <P>The Samaritans have spoken about suicide and the warning signs.  The risk of suicide is greater when there is a recent loss or break-up of a close relationship.  Many prisoners find they have very little family contact and they are often rejected by parents or partners. I know the prison is aware of prisoners, <Col N="1817" /> especially women prisoners, who do not receive visitors, which would indicate that there has been a breakdown in relationships.  Much of the criteria which identify potential suicides &mdash; many people show their suicidal feelings by being withdrawn &mdash; are particularly relevant to prisoners.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suicide prevention committee.  I hope it will link up with the suicide task force, which is preparing a report at present.  The suicide task force should avail of the experience of this committee.  There is little professional information and few guidelines about suicide prevention.  A professional approach to suicide prevention is very difficult in prisons because information and expertise do not exist.  I hope the task force will liaise with this committee to draw on its experiences and to see if recommendations on reducing suicide in prison can be made. I thank Senator Henry for asking me to deal with this particular issue.</P>

      <P>I praise the Minister for taking the initiative to publish this report.  As far as I am aware, it is not usual for such reports to be published, but by so doing it provides an opportunity to have an important debate.  The report called Mountjoy an &ldquo;appalling institution&rdquo; with which I agree, having visited the prison.  This is a crisis issue and I agree with the sentiments expressed on overcrowding.  The reports states:</P>
      <P>We regard overcrowding in Mountjoy Prison as a crisis issue, which requires a crisis response by Government.  These issues deserve a higher priority in terms of restoring public confidence, improving security, a reduction in crime and effective prisoner rehabilitation.  In tandem with all of this, the 1995 budget announcement postponing the prison building programme was very dispiriting indeed and we question was it really necessary? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with and support the list of recommendations contained in this <Col N="1818" /> report.  It now appears that Mountjoy Prison is more a part of the crime and drugs problem than the solution.  Inhumanity cannot be part of any legitimate fight against crime and the overcrowding, lack of separate remand facilities for prisoners and the situation concerning drug abuse at Mountjoy amounts to inhumanity.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, who so far has failed to properly deal with the problems of the lack of prison spaces and prison reform, should immediately appoint a person of standing and ability to head a thorough independent inquiry into the conditions in Mountjoy and this report should be available within a period of three months.  It is absolutely unacceptable that the &ldquo;appalling conditions&rdquo; of Mountjoy &mdash; those are the words used by the visiting committee &mdash; should be allowed remain into the foreseeable future.  This Government, by refusing to build Castlerea prison and bring forward proposals for changes to our bail laws, is itself guilty of negligence amounting to utter irresponsibility. Until the Government solves the prison crisis, it will never solve the crime problem.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight some of the principal recommendations contained in the report.  It says that</P>
    <P>There is no separate remand prison in Ireland.  Mountjoy, as mentioned in relation to overcrowding, suffers severely due to the fact that, unlike other prison Governors, Governor Lonergan is obliged to take every prisoner sent to Mountjoy.  Mountjoy is the only committal prison for 19 of the 26 Counties of Ireland.  On any given day there are 100 to 150 remand prisoners in Mountjoy.  They should be facilitated elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This committee is gravely concerned that remand prisoners in Mountjoy are mixing with sentenced prisoners. </P>
    <P>It also stated that &ldquo;It was yet again a year of increased crime and drug abuse, with consequent daily demand for spaces in Mountjoy regularly exceeding <Col N="1819" /> availability.  In reality, the male prison, which could reasonably cater for 450 prisoners, has been accommodating, on average, 628 inmates daily during 1995.&rdquo;.  It also said that &ldquo;When we combine these difficulties with the regular practice for Mountjoy of releasing prisoners early just to create space, it makes a farce of our legal and judicial systems. If this problem is not taken in hand, it will be a spiral to certain disaster.&rdquo;. These are strong words.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the genuine sentiments expressed by Senator Neville about suicide, his entire speech hardly mentioned overcrowding or a reference to the fact that although finance had been provided in the last budget for the building of Castlerea prison, it was cancelled.</P>

      <P>That does not take away one whit from what I said.  It is an absolute farce for somebody who is supposed to be representing the Government, to absolutely ignore the fact that the programme for building extra prison places has been cancelled by the same Government.  In an interview given to the <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash; I have quoted this before &mdash; Garda Commissioner Culligan stated that the lack of prison places was itself creating and adding to the crime crisis, which is exactly what this report says.

This proposition has been accepted by the visiting committee and the Garda Commissioner.

      <P>It was a good idea for Senator Henry to put forward this motion and to debate it, as we hoped, in a non-partisan or party political fashion, because it is worthy of debate.  It does no justice to the motion to debate it in the fashion adopted by Senator Mulcahy. The Senator alleged that the building programme had been scrapped by this Government.  The report, if the Senator read it, recognises the continuing work on the female prison in Mountjoy.  Therefore, this work is obviously ongoing.</P>
      <P>This debate is so wide ranging that we have tried to separate it into various issues.  I recall visiting Mountjoy Prison when I was a student and having my eyes opened for the first time with regard to what boredom really means. The vast majority of those entering Mountjoy would not be highly educated and would, therefore, find it difficult to pass the time by reading, etc.  The sheer boredom of being there for up to a month would drive me demented.  It was the first thing which struck me in terms of what people are faced with in the prison.</P>
      <P>The second point which struck me was the friendliness amoung prisoners.  I saw inmates openly welcomed by their friends already inside.  There appeared to be a certain camaraderie amoung the prisoners who obviously came in and out of the jail regularly.  However, that is another issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major problem in Mountjoy Prison is the overcrowding caused by the fact that the jail and Governor Lonergan must take in remand prisoners daily.  This is the most significant problem facing the prison because it means the number of people who must be catered for is up in the air from one day to <Col N="1822" /> the next.  This makes the governing of the prison on a long-term basis most difficult. The simple solution is a separate prison for people on remand and, unfortunately, such a facility is required.  The mix in Mountjoy Prison is unhealthy because it is unfair to remand prisoners and those who come into the jail with one problem and leave with another. Given that so many people learn about crime in prison, it makes sense to have a separate remand facility.</P>
    <P>Ireland is probably in contravention of the 1966 UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights by not having a separate remand prison.  Under the convention such a prison is required, save in exceptional circumstances, but I do not know to what that specifically relates.  The provision of a separate remand home would address the most important ongoing problem in Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>The report praises the ongoing work on the new women's prison.  The visiting committee pointed out that a drugs free unit and facilities for those undergoing detoxification will be provided in the new prison.  It will also include a separate area for remand prisoners.  I welcome this move because much noise, disturbance and hassle is caused by ongoing communication between the various units.  This creates immense problems for women prisoners.</P>
    <P>There is a need for more active rehabilitation.  This is a huge problem in terms of the costs involved and how the purpose of prison is viewed, whether it is punishment for wrongdoing or emphasis on the rehabilitation and rights of prisoners.  This is an ongoing battle in everybody's mind.  However, in relation to boredom, it is critical that some means for prisoners to pass the time constructively should be provided. For example, workshop facilities could be increased.  The report praises the Department of Justice for providing the computer and book archival facilities in the D wing.  The committee felt these facilities were used a great deal.  If the idea works in that section, perhaps it should be extended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1823" /> Many prisoners would benefit from more open educational facilities, not in terms of forcing it down their throats but perhaps in a more friendly fashion. The report states that a number of prisoners are taking adult literacy classes. This is most worthwhile, and it was done is a feasible way by giving the prisoners some privacy.  The fitness courses and the awarding of fitness certificates would also appeal to many prisoners.  It would be constructive in terms of prisoners passing the time in a worthwhile manner.  It would also be cost effective in terms of reducing the problems experienced by prisoners.</P>
    <P>I do not know the current position regarding the appointment of an Inspector of Prisons.  The report is vague in relation to this issue, but irrespective of whether an inspector is appointed, there is a need for co-ordination between the various prison administrations.  Perhaps such co-ordination already exists, but if separate remand facilities are established the entire prison population needs to be administered in a much better manner.  It is just my opinion, but I think more co-ordination would be helpful.</P>
    <P>The debate is specifically about Mountjoy Prison, but Loughan House, an open prison in County Cavan, is a welcome holiday home for many prisoners. They get a great break and good food before they go on their way. However, we should remember that many people end up in prison through no fault of their own due to difficult upbringings.  Such people had serious problems from the start.  If we are examining how crime is dealt with by society we must consider not just how prisoners are dealt with but also the causes of crime.</P>

      <P>In common with Senator Mulcahy, although I suspect I will diverge from the rest of his contribution in certain respects, I compliment the Minister for publishing the report.  I only read it this afternoon and I am still shocked.  One hears much about <Col N="1824" /> Mountjoy Prison but it is more emphatic to see it presented in such an unanswerable and restrained format, despite the obvious intense indignation of the visiting committee.  It is impressed on one's mind in a way that makes it impossible to forget.</P>
      <P>I do not know the Governor but I have seen and heard him on television and he comes across as most enlightened and humane.  If this is the way matters stand with such a Governor, what would they be like with somebody of the opposite nature, or if an ordinary bureaucrat was in charge?  The situation could be worse if we did not have the good fortune to have a Governor of that calibre.  This should alert us to the need for a rapid response to the report.</P>
      <P>Although the issue of a medical officer is important, I hope it will not be used by the media to divert attention from the central problems which will continue even if there is an improvement in the unsatisfactory medical officer situation.  I am not being adversarial but many of the points in the report have been made in previous reports and the visiting committee stated there must be a resistance to change somewhere along the line.  Perhaps it is at many places along the line, but one gets the impression there must resistance in the Department of Justice itself.  There have been several good Ministers for Justice in recent years who must be aware of the validity of many of the points made.  It would be most enlightening if the Minister could outline the main problems in terms of the implementation of a number of the recommendations.  Perhaps money issues are involved, but that is a question of priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the report's recommendations are practical and appear to relate to relatively small scale changes in terms of use of space, etc.  I am not familiar with the layout of the prison but the report lists a number of questions.  It would be most helpful if the Minister could give specific responses to those questions.  If time is required to implement certain matters, what is the <Col N="1825" /> schedule?  If it is not a question of time but principle, why is there a resistance in principle to implementing a number of the proposals?  It would be worthwhile to break down the causes of the delay in responding to successive reports, whether they relate to resources, time or principle.</P>
    <P>I take the points about lack of space and the impossibility of planning because, as Senator Gallagher has said, of the way the courts are required to operate.  Even if you were to do everything that the report recommends, the best you could do would be to contain and ameliorate the problem rather than make significant inroads into the basic issues behind it.  As Senator Gallagher rightly said, it has to be seen in the overall context of the crime problem in this country and whether prison is seen mainly as a deterrent or as rehabilitation. It seems to be regarded as nothing other than a place where you keep them away for a while.  Mountjoy is not acting as a deterrent because there is a 70 to 80 per cent recidivist rate.  You would wonder why anybody would want to go back in; but a majority of those in there find themselves going back, horrible though the circumstances are.  It has not sufficed as a deterrent and it has not succeeded from a rehabilitation point of view.  There does not seem to be any large scale rehabilitation programme apart from valiant efforts in a number of smaller areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher mentions boredom and there are phrases used in the report about prisoners wandering aimlessly about and away from the general melee in the prison.  The phraseology suggests an awful shambles in terms of the use of prisoners' time.  What are they doing there, beyond being kept in for as long shoved back out until such time as they return?  It seems to be an aimless exercise in many respects.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment underrate the problems of a general criminal policy. We have done very little serious thinking about it except in terms of crisis <Col N="1826" /> management.  There has been a general neglect of criminality in this country at academic and intellectual levels which reflects on our academic institutions. There probably has been a neglect at bureaucratic level.  I would like to know, and perhaps the Minister can enlighten me, if there is comparative data on recidivism in prisons in other jurisdictions. Is there a better record than ours in Britain and Western Europe or does it seem to matter what policies are followed?  Do we have the same problems coming back again?</P>
    <P>We have to recognise that there is a criminal culture, and the report in a sense does.  Crime has a different role from what it had 60 or 70 years ago. They talk about the situation in 1925 when the visiting service was set up.  If we do not have a policy to try to combat crime in the wider society, the best we can do in Mountjoy or anywhere else will be palliative.  Many of us would suggest that the general direction in which society is going is likely to lead to rising crime levels irrespective of individual policies.</P>
    <P>If you can find an effective anti-drugs policy, that will reduce the highest profile cases in many respects.  It will curb to some extent the most horrific examples of drug related crime, but it will not stamp out crime in the community. I suspect that it is highly unlikely, given the way values are going in general, that there will be a reduction in crime.  The decision not to proceed with the building of Castlerea Prison was misguided because we are looking at a rising trajectory irrespective of what we do within the prisons, but that is no reason for not trying to cope with the appalling situation which has been exposed and documented in a large measure here.  I congratulate the Minister on publishing this report and also the committee on drawing up this report and having told it as they saw it, with the potential of creating embarrassment. If you are not prepared to create embarrassment on issues of this kind then you may as well not have a committee.</P>

      <P>I discussed this issue with Senator Henry and I decided to talk about the report in relation to the women's prison.  Women prisoners represent a small proportion of the prison population.  There are 42 women in prison in this country and they have specific needs and problems which require attention.</P>
      <P>I was a member of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and we made recommendations in relation to the women's prison in Mountjoy, which we visited.  It was different to what I thought it would be.  The first thing that struck me about women in prison is how open they are.  They will tell you everything about themselves and discuss the most intimate details of their lives with you.  Many of them had sad lives.  If you look at the profile of our women prisoners, they are mainly young and are a victim of an array of personal problems. Characteristically, they come from a background of poverty.  They have low educational attainments and have specific social problems.  The vast majority are drug addicts.  They are involved in petty crime to fund their drug problems. They spend a short time in prison, but they come back again and again.  One of the sad things we learned was from a women prison officer who had worked there for 20 years, who said she is now seeing the children of women who were in prison when she first entered the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The visiting committee's report mentions that many of the women who were in prison in Mountjoy recently were now dead.  They were drug addicts who continued their habit and died at a young age.  Women are vulnerable in prison.  They are looked upon differently to men by society.  When men are in prison they receive great support from the women in their lives.  The Governor of Mountjoy mentioned this recently in a newspaper article.  He felt that the key to dealing with the male prisoners in Mountjoy was through their mothers.  They had great respect for their mothers and if you could empower their mothers, you would go some way <Col N="1828" /> towards solving the problems of these criminals who are constantly coming in and out.  I suppose you could say again that women are being held responsible, but the Governor was not holding them responsible.  His approach was to invest in or empower the mothers of these prisoners.  He felt that was the key to solving the problem.</P>
    <P>Women in prison often find themselves isolated.  The visiting group spoke about that when they were talking about suicides and deaths in custody.  They said the tragic aspect of women in prison is the breakdown in family contact, with some prisoners having no visitors for months.  In some cases they would have been rejected by parents or partners. That is specific to women and does not happen to men.  They supported the proposal of the suicide prevention committee that a list be drawn up of all prisoners not receiving visits from family and friends and that a special effort be made to re-establish contact.  It is important that mothers maintain contact with their children.  The Governor and other people in charge within the system are aware of this, but it is a particular burden for women with children. Separation from their children when they are in prison is an additional punishment.</P>
    <P>A halfway house or a support structure would be important for these women because the majority of them are so young and they are constantly in and out.  A lot of them have been victims all their lives and they thrive physically when they are in prison in the sense that they are fed, have a bed and an individual cell where they are safe.  From a physical point of view they are probably better looked after in prison than they are out in the community. I remember one of the women prison officers telling us that some of the women do not want to leave when they are released because they are safer in prison than they are in the outside world.  That is a terrible reflection on our society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1829" /> A women's prison was recommended originally by the Commission of Inquiry into the Penal System in 1985 and it was also recommended by the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  Many of the areas which Senator Gallagher discussed with regard to the separation of remand prisoners from those convicted, having separate units for drug addicts, etc., would be possible if there was a new women's prison.  I was disappointed that the Government's decision to proceed was deferred for financial reasons and I hope the Minister will provide as soon as possible the particular facilities which women prisoners need.  This can only be achieved by the building of a new prison.  The design for the women's prison had included provision for educational training, counselling, psychological, medical and psychiatric facilities which would be welcome and much needed, because, as I said, many women prisoners have huge psychological problems.  Eleven years after the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System it is disappointing that there is no new women's prison.  I accept that in the absence of the development of a women's prison there has been an improvement in the treatment of women prisoners &mdash; there is, for instance, single cell accommodation, which must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Another issue which concerned the visiting committee was the fact that female prisoners were accommodated separately until the latter part of last year when some of the male prisoners were moved back into the top floor, which caused disturbance and much distress to many of the women prisoners. Again, this shows the necessity for the urgent commencement of the building of the new women's prison.</P>
    <P>A detoxification or drugs free unit would be possible with the construction of the new prison.  Drugs are a serious problem and the issue needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  If the drugs issue was addressed in Mountjoy Prison, the women would not return to prison again and again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> Most Senators who spoke congratulated the Minister this evening.  I also congratulate her for publishing the report of the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee and urge her to implement its recommendations.</P>

      <P>The recent report of the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee made familiar reading.  Successive reports have highlighted more or less the same problems for several years and a great deal of work has been done to improve conditions.  In this regard, particular credit is due to the Governor of Mountjoy Prison.</P>
      <P>When we impose a custodial sentence we are expressing society's abhorrence of certain actions by depriving the offender of his or her liberty.  That is, or should be, the punishment we impose. But when individuals are sent to Mountjoy Prison we are sending them to serve the term in an overcrowded facility where the prisoner is immediately denied adequate basic medical, psychiatric, educational and, most importantly, rehabilitative services.</P>
      <P>The only thing to which prisoners in Mountjoy Prison have ample access is drugs.  It is extraordinary that day after day for the past number of years we have been hearing about this situation &mdash; the same applies in Cork city.  One hears from time to time of the various methods being used to supply prisoners with drugs from outside.  It is appalling, of course.  Small wonder that addicts leave Mountjoy Prison with their addiction intact, ready once again to prey on society in search of a quick deal.</P>
      <P>I welcome the improvements which have been made in Mountjoy Prison in recent years.  I also welcome many of the recommendations made in the report of the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee which provide a useful starting point for change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appropriate punishment must be one of the pillars of any justice system.  At present, prison is seen as the main sentencing option, an option which is often unsuitable.  It is scandalous, for example, that a person should be imprisoned for <Col N="1831" /> non-payment of fines or civil debt.  I have experienced people who think nothing of going to prison to pay their debts.  This practice has developed considerably in the past four or five years and I am amazed that it should occur. We need to expand and develop the system of community service, ensuring that those who have taken from the community put something back.  In those cases where prison is the only option we must ensure that it serves a rehabilitative as well as a retributive function.  In this regard the Programme for Government makes a number of useful suggestions. It includes commitments to expand the use of non-custodial sentences, to end imprisonment for civil debt where possible, to examine the possibility of establishing a prison board to manage the day to day running of our prisons and a parole board to ensure prisoners are discharged in an orderly fashion.  The full implementation of these elements of the Government's programme would, I believe, go a long way towards ensuring that Ireland's penal system serves both offenders and society.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House this evening calls on the Minister for Justice to implement the recommendations of the 1995 report of the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee and I support that call.  I would also like to be associated with the tributes which have been paid to the members of the visiting committee.  They have presented us with a report which has pulled no punches but which is fair, honest and impartial.  The report details clearly and concisely the many problems, difficulties and shortcomings which currently exist in Mountjoy Prison.  It also outlines a number of recommendations which, if implemented, would alleviate significantly at least some of the problems the report identifies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I welcome the fact that the report has been published, as it appeared at one stage that there was some question mark over whether or <Col N="1832" /> not it would be published.  I also welcome the opportunity to discuss the report in the Seanad and I thank the Independent Senators for putting down this motion.  It is absolutely clear from the report that many of the difficulties in Mountjoy Prison stem from the huge overcrowding problem which exists in the prison.  In the report's introduction we are told that the male prison, which could reasonably cater for 450 prisoners, had been accommodating an average of 650 prisoners inmates daily during 1995.  This chronic overcrowding creates massive problems for prisoners and staff as well as putting huge pressure on medical, recreational, educational and other facilities.</P>
    <P>Of course, the overcrowding problem would be much worse were it not for the early release policy which continues to operate in Mountjoy Prison.  I must concur with the report when it states that the regular practice of releasing prisoners early just to create space makes a farce of the legal and judicial systems. The report goes on to say that if the practice is not taken in hand, &ldquo;it will be a spiral to certain disaster&rdquo;.  I would go further and say that the disastrous consequences of this practice are already a reality.  Criminals who should be behind bars are being released daily and allowed out to commit further crimes.</P>
    <P>The considered views of the visiting committee with regard to the solution to overcrowding in the prison are spelt out clearly in the final two paragraphs on page 1 of the report, which state:</P>
    <P>We regard overcrowding in Mountjoy Prison as a crisis issue, which requires a crisis response by Government.  These issues deserve a higher priority in terms of restoring public confidence, improving security, reduction in crime, and effective prisoner rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>In tandem with all of this, the 1995 budget announcement postponing the prison building programme was very dispiriting indeed, and we question was it really necessary? </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1833" /> As a Senator from County Roscommon, I appeal to the Minister and the Government once more to look again at its decision to abandon the provision of a high security prison at Castlerea, County Roscommon.  This decision must be reversed.  Those prison places were never more needed than they are now. The Castlerea project was intended to provide accommodation for 150 male offenders.  The initial decision to provide the high security prison at Castlerea was seen by the general public as an essential step in the fight against crime.  It was seen as evidence of the Government's commitment to put the perpetrators of serious crime behind bars and keep them there.</P>
    <P>The decision to abandon the project after £5 million had already been spent on the perimeter wall and on the relocation of the psychiatric patients was, as has since been proven, a disastrous decision.  It is no wonder that even the most ardent Government supporters were dismayed by this decision.  How could anyone be expected to believe that the Government is seriously committed to combating crime if, as this report points out, the daily demand for spaces in Mountjoy regularly exceeds availability, as a result of which many criminals who should be behind bars are free to roam the streets?</P>
    <P>As regards the Castlerea project, the latest report circulating in County Roscommon suggests that the Minister proposes to provide a number of houses on the site which will be used as some type of open prison accommodation.  It is also suggested that the Minister will require the occupants to sign a pledge that they will not escape.  My advice to the Minister is to leave the provision of housing schemes to her colleague, the Minister for the Environment, and to reinstate and proceed immediately with the provision of the original 150 place high security prison.  By doing so, she will be sending out a much needed signal to the public in relation to her determination and commitment to the fight against crime.  She will also be sending a much needed warning to the criminal <Col N="1834" /> community that the pussyfooting days are over.</P>
    <P>The provision of 150 extra high security prison places in Castlerea, together with the building of the new women's prison as recommended in the report, would relieve overcrowding throughout the prison system.  It would then be easier to implement many of the report's other recommendations, such as the provision of separate remand facilities, the introduction of a legal ceiling for the numbers in Mountjoy, the initiation of a survey to establish the real extent of drug abuse in Mountjoy and the introduction of procedures to eradicate the drug problem.</P>
    <P>The case for the appointment of an Inspector of Prisons is also well made in the report as is the case for the formulation of a coherent medical services policy, the introduction of structures of medical accountability and the provision of increased powers for the medical director of prison services.  I regret that time does not permit me to deal in detail with all the report's recommendations. However, I repeat that the overriding need in the prison system at present is the provision of extra spaces. The chronic overcrowding makes it impossible to tackle other prison problems, such as drugs in Mountjoy.  That is why I hope the Government's response, which this report calls for, will be forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the psychological and psychiatric services. As Senator Mullooly said, it is a good hard hitting and honest report.  It is incredible there are only six psychologists for a population of 2,250, which would require 33 psychologists.  The amount of money spent in this area is small.  The report states that the psychological services are totally inadequate and that each psychologist is seeing only 12 to 14 prisoners for one hour a week. They are also involved in other things, such as the selection of prison officers, house and developmental training and so on.  Most prisoners have emotional difficulties with which they cannot <Col N="1835" /> adequately deal.  The report recommends that the psychological services should be expanded.  I do not understand why this has not happened but I presume the reason is financial.</P>
      <P>The psychiatric services are almost worse because there is a waiting list for admission and evaluation of undiagnosed, psychotically ill prisoners from Mountjoy to the Central Mental Hospital.  The inadequacy of the psychiatric services is such that prisoner assessment is exceptionally low; it can take up to seven days to have a person assessed.  It is difficult to get psychiatrists to attend because a lot of the work is done on a part-time basis and the fees paid are inadequate.  A lot of money is wasted.  It is estimated that the 11 psychiatrists in Mountjoy are paid approximately £35,000 for their work. This is in addition to their full-time salaries.</P>
      <P>I am glad Dr. Charles Smith, the Director of the Central Mental Hospital, agrees with the need for a more committed, structured and accountable approach and co-operation between the Central Mental Hospital and Mountjoy Prison.  He would like the psychiatric sessions by his staff operating in Mountjoy Prison to be part of the official job description of both trainee and consultant psychiatrists.  I do not know why anyone would want to deprive a psychiatrist of money if they can get it on a part-time basis.  It seems a waste of money when the psychological and psychiatric services are inadequate. I hope more full-time psychologists and psychiatrists will be appointed to do the job properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the visiting committee on this report and the Minister for publishing it.  I express my appreciation to Senator Henry for the manner in which she issued instructions to us on what topics we should discuss. I will speak on welfare and probation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a special responsibility to those in prison because what happens to them takes place away from most <Col N="1836" /> people's eyes.  It is easy to forget about people in prison, particularly when we are concerned about crime.  Members may have read what the Dublin Chamber of Commerce said about the huge cost of crime in Dublin city.  Such people are often only concerned about putting offenders into prison rather than about what happens to them there, but we have a responsibility to think about them.</P>
    <P>Conditions in our prisons should accord with our perceptions of human dignity.  People do not stop being human beings once they go to prison.  Yet, we must be worried about the conditions described by the visiting committee in Mountjoy.  Particularly depressing is the fact that the report repeats that this has been said for years but nothing has been done.  I hope the publication of this report and its discussion will show a new willingness to address the serious problem it documents.  One can only have admiration for the people who must work in these conditions, but that is not enough.  We should not inflict such conditions on prison staff either.</P>
    <P>The problems mentioned in the report are exacerbated by a number of factors.  The prison service is almost totally invisible to the public.  Another factor is that because the welfare of prisoners has such a low priority in the public mind, prisons have been repeatedly missed out in the allocation of resources.  The need for prison places has mushroomed in response to changes in our society.  Cracking down on crime may be sexy, but it is not sexy to put money aside to look after prisoners or to improve prisons.  Such spending does not improve our balance of payments and it does not help business infrastructure; it is the type of spending many people do not prefer.  There must be something wrong with our priorities if we fail to deal with this problem properly. Even in purely economic terms we are taking a very costly road when we go in this direction.  We are storing up trouble for the future if we let Mountjoy continue to be a tinderbox.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> Prison has a number of functions but some of them tend to fade into the background, especially when resources are scarce.  One function is to act as a deterrent against crime.  Another is to protect society from criminals.  Part of its function is punishment; the element of retribution by society which many people wrongly think is the whole point. Prison also serves to rehabilitate prisoners; mention of that function often produces a hollow laugh.  Only a very idealistic person, and a fairly short sighted one at that, could believe that many prisoners could be rehabilitated in the situation outlined in this report; in today's conditions this is a faint hope. Our proof is the ratio of probation and welfare officers to prisoners.</P>
    <P>There are seven welfare officers for Mountjoy Prison, which now houses a prisoner population of 700.  Each welfare officer is responsible for roughly 100 inmates.  By any standards, this is spreading things very thin.  The case load is such that welfare officers never get to see many of the prisoners in their care.  All their time is taken up with the most urgent cases.</P>
    <P>If a prisoner wants to meet with one of the outreach agencies, there is a permanent waiting list of over 200.  This bottleneck is counterproductive.  These are the agencies through which a planned early release is possible.  The visitors committee has been pushing for a programme of planned release since 1993 but this has not been put in place; neither has counselling been available for the families of prisoners prior to release.  Releases are unplanned and, in some cases, undeserved, not in response to a person's likelihood of being better off in the community but simply in response to the need to relieve chronic overcrowding.  As the report states, this makes a nonsense of the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>Much useful work is being done in Mountjoy in the area of probation and welfare.  For instance two 12 week courses for prisoners and their families, one on alcoholism and one on drugs, were held.  These were highly successful <Col N="1838" /> and offered us a glimpse of just what could be done in this area were more resources available.  There are plans to hold four of these courses in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Overall, two things are needed to make things better at Mountjoy.  More resources are needed; there is no getting away from that.  Perhaps the technology capable of giving us those extra resources could be used to do so.  We spoke here two years ago about the American system of electronic tagging. At the time I thought it could be used in the area of bail.  I now realise that is constitutionally not possible.  It would be possible to offer probation on a voluntary basis where the prisoner accepts electronic tagging.  This system is used in America and has been used very successfully in a number of instances.  I suggest that the Department of Justice give serious consideration to it.  It could be done on a voluntary basis.  If a prisoner wants to be released on probation he or she may be so released where he or she accepts voluntary tagging.  It would make space available in prison, it would reduce prison costs and would free up more resources.</P>
    <P>Resources are just one problem.  The second problem is the political and public will to do something quickly about these conditions.  It is surely part of our job as legislators to help the development of that will, both on the part of the general public and within the political system.  Tonight's opportunity to debate this report may be the start of creating that.  I hope this debate gets the attention it deserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice I thank Senators for providing this opportunity to speak on the 1995 Mountjoy Visiting Committee Report.  At the outset, on a more general note, I wish to say that there are visiting committees in all our prisons and places of detention, whether those institutions are closed prisons or open centres.  I would like to put on the record the Minister's and, indeed, my <Col N="1839" /> own appreciation of the work which these committees do.</P>
      <P>The members of these committees are appointed, usually for a three year period, by the Minister for Justice who happens to be in office as the vacancies arise in the various committees.  The period of office of members can, in certain circumstances, straddle the period of office of more than one Minister for Justice or Government.  There is a strong element of independence in the role of the committee.  Probably the most powerful role the committees have is to act as a sort of watchdog, independent of prison management, on behalf of the Minister for Justice and to report to the Minister anything concerning the running of their prison which they feel ought properly be brought to the Minister's attention.</P>
      <P>They have no function in the management of the prison.  If they were to take over that function it would inhibit them in performing the role assigned to them under existing legislation.  The management of the prison is primarily the function of the Governor and this leaves the committee free to be constructively critical of the prison administration. Any such criticism should be accurate and measured and need not be any the less trenchant for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to the specific report which is the subject of this motion.  The Mountjoy Visiting Committee report for 1995 has incurred some considerable controversy about one section and one section alone, that referring to the work carried out at the prison by certain individuals providing medical services to prisoners there under contract with the Department of Justice.  Following rapid consultation with the Attorney General on receipt of the report the Minister asked the committee to confirm that it was satisfied it had behaved in an appropriately respectful way of the constitutional rights of the personnel it criticised in its report.  The committee met promptly to consider the Minister's query and, having reflected on the matter decided, it stood over its comments. <Col N="1840" /> The Minister reverted to the Attorney General who advised that the report could at that juncture be made available as required by section 3 (4) of the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act, 1925. This was done without delay.</P>
    <P>Solicitors have since been retained on behalf of one of the individuals criticised in the report.  The solicitors have, in turn, been in communication with my office.  As this matter may yet come to a conclusion in another quarter, I will confine myself to the foregoing statement of facts about it.  There are, in any event, plenty of other comments and suggestions in the report to consider and evaluate.  This process has now commenced in the Department.</P>
    <P>On a general note, the problems of the Irish prison system did not arise overnight.  They are the culmination of a number of effects, including underinvestment in the prison stock, rising crime and prisoner committal levels. The Minister has been doing all in her power in her relatively short period in office to address these problems which have built up over generations.  In the short time available to me here tonight I would like to deal briefly with some of the important recommendations made by the visiting committee in its report.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an inspector of prisons was recommended by the Whitaker report and endorsed in the Department of Justice's 1994 document, &ldquo;Five Year Plan for the Treatment of Offenders&rdquo;.  The Minister envisages an inspector being appointed in the context of the overall restructuring of prison management.  In this regard, the Government is committed in the Programme for Government to considering the management structure in the prisons. This exercise has already commenced in the Department of Justice in conjunction with officials from the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The committee recommended separate remand facilities for prisoners.  The average number of remand prisoners in custody constitutes about 10 per cent of the prisoner population, 270 persons, of whom up to 30 would be women prisoners. <Col N="1841" /> These prisoners generally have multiple previous convictions and prior custodial sentences.  I make these points simply to put the proposal in context. The Minister favours the creation of separate facilities for male and female remand prisoners and her current prison building plans should create the scope to provide such separate facilities in the Dublin area at least.</P>
    <P>The committee recommended the introduction of a legal ceiling to numbers in Mountjoy Prison.  This is a nonrunner for the main committal prison in the State.  Every effort is made to keep numbers there within bounds but this proposal does not provide the Minister with a magic wand to dispose of the prisoners who would have to be turned away if the &ldquo;House Full&rdquo; sign went up outside Mountjoy of an evening.</P>
    <P>The Minister is as impatient as the visiting committee to achieve early progress on the building work in respect of the female prison.  Revised plans and costings in regard to this project are being finalised with a view to early resubmission to Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to restructure of the permanent suicide prevention committee at Mountjoy, contrary to the visiting committee's opinion, the committee in question is a permanent one.  It will now have a representative on a new national prison suicide prevention awareness committee which the Minister recently set up under the chairmanship of a senior prison governor.  This new national committee will include in its membership some of the most experienced representatives of prison management and staff as well as medical practitioners who are involved in prison work.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan</i>, to which I have already referred, outlines in chapter 7 the objectives of the prison medical service.  The medical policy aims stated there are based on the principle of equivalence with corresponding care in the community with publicly accepted standards. As well as outlining, in a policy sense, how medical services to prisoners <Col N="1842" /> should be organised and provided, this document sets out the nature of present difficulties and proposes remedies. Some of the medical concerns raised in this document have been remedied since the publication of the five year plan.  Others are in the process of being addressed.  The five year plan was circulated at the time of publication to all existing prison doctors and to the Medical Council, and comments were sought. None of them dissented from the tenor or thrust of the comments or proposals outlined in it.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal with the following recommendations together as they overlap: the introduction of structures of medical accountability, and the increase in powers of the medical director of prison services.  The ethical accountability of all medical doctors registered in the State is to the Medical Council which is essentially constituted to function as a watchdog of medical standards on behalf of the public.  No doctor is ethically accountable to another doctor.  In relation to medical management accountability, the appointment of a director of prison medical services in 1990, a newly created position at that time, did not focus on clearly defining the accountability of existing prison doctors to this new medical manager. While this omission is understandable, given the difficulties that occurred in recruiting a suitably qualified doctor to the position, it is clearly now time to revisit the relationship between the medical director and the medical practitioners out in the prisons.  As a first step the Minister has asked the medical director to review his role and to make a submission to her in the matter.  Once this submission has been reviewed the Minister will progress the matters from there.</P>
    <P>I should point out that among the intentions of the proposed common contract for prison doctors which has been under negotiation with the IMO for some time, is to more clearly define the line management responsibilities of prison doctors to both prison governors <Col N="1843" /> and to the director of prison medical services.</P>
    <P>As regards the review of the present guidelines for padded cells, the Governor of Mountjoy has already pointed out publicly the sheer practical necessity of putting prisoners in a place of safety when they start being difficult in prison. The guidelines in place for the use of padded cells require all such placements to be reported to the Department of Justice and the early involvement of the prison doctor where a stay in the padded cell is longer than overnight.  It is simply not practical to call out the doctor every time the padded cell has to be used.  Indeed, on many occasions it is used at the prisoner's request.</P>
    <P>As regards the initiation of a survey to establish the real extent of drug abuse within Mountjoy, such a study has already been commissioned from a criminologist, now in independent practice, who carried out such a study on behalf of the Department of Justice in 1986.  This study was commissioned some months back and I understand the Minister anticipates its early completion and intends to publish the findings of the survey.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to hide so far as the operation of Mountjoy Prison is concerned. A fair measure of this is, I think, that the Minister regularly allows media access to the prison to the point where hardly a week passes without a reporter or camera team visiting the premises. The Minister recognises openly and freely that there are problems with Mountjoy as our main committal system because of its age and the growing pressures on the criminal justice system in which it plays such a big part.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister took over in the Department of Justice there have been several positive changes in the operation and infrastructure in the Mountjoy complex.  These have included the provision of new kitchens and services, new surgeries, search rooms, camera surveillance of visitor boxes, a 90 space drug free unit in the nearby training unit and <Col N="1844" /> a drug treatment unit in the prison itself which will open in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>In the face of unprecedented levels of criticism and negative publicity about the prison system the Minister continues to press forward with positive measures and initiatives on a daily basis in Mountjoy and elsewhere in the system and she will continue with that approach.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly mentioned Castlerea Prison and the progress that is being made there.  I understand that 25 prisoners will be lodged in Castlerea soon.  That is a lot earlier than was planned by the previous Minister when she was in power.  The Minister for Justice is making a serious effort to come to grips with the prison problem and I urge the Seanad to support her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In any discussion on prison reform and implementing the recommendations of visiting committees, public representatives, no more than any other commentators, must keep a certain balance.  That balance is between the question of society punishing and seeking to correct wrong-doing and rehabilitating people to return to society.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest problems in Ireland today is that, unfortunately, prison society and the prison population tends to come from predictable and easily identified parts of the country.  There is something wrong with a society where one can visit the nursery of a maternity hospital and spot from its parents' addresses that a child from one area is ten or 15 times more likely to finish up in prison than a child from another area.</P>
      <P>The cost of keeping a youth incarcerated in Oberstown House or Trinity House for a month is as much as it would cost to employ a psychologist in the State education area for a year.  We must look at the way we are spending money because the demand to solve crime is a knee-jerk response to today's difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking as somebody whose house has been burgled ten or 11 times &mdash; I have lost count &mdash; I am familiar with <Col N="1845" /> being a victim of crime.  However, while we can keep building prisons and expanding the prison population this will not in itself deal with the issues that cause crime.  We need to achieve a balance in doing that.  At a very early stage we need to identify where the young people are who become adults in the general prison population.  That factor should always be tied into a debate such as this.</P>
    <P>In many ways the Visiting Committee of Mountjoy Prison has the least envied of all jobs.  It is trying to pick up the pieces where society, the education system and the community and State supports have failed.</P>
    <P>The high incidence of recidivism among those incarcerated in prison proves patently that the system does not work.  People become institutionalised in prison.  They also become addicted to substances.  They become dependent on the State and on criminal society and when they come out of prison they are no longer able to deal with society with the result that they are not long out before they are sent back.</P>
    <P>There are two ways of looking at the problem of crime committed by people on bail.  The populist way of looking at it, as can be heard in the local pub or wherever one meets people, is that it is disgraceful that people on bail can commit further crimes.  Of course it is and of course we need to change the system but that is only one aspect of the problem. The next question is, why are they so stupid to commit those crimes knowing that if they are caught they will suffer all the more?  The reality is that they do not know any different or any better. There is no difference to them between being out on bail and being out on release.</P>
    <P>Where does that attitude begin?  Usually it begins when a child of 13 or 14 years of age is sent to the assessment centre in Finglas.  If that child is interacting with other children who are there on remand or serving a sentence, that interaction can serve to get them involved in higher levels of criminal activity.  The same happens in Mountjoy <Col N="1846" /> and other places.  People get sucked into the system.  Once they have been to jail, all their friends are criminals who believe in getting more out of the system through burglary, violent assault, armed robbery and other crimes and this attitude become the norm.  That is one aspect of the problem.  Another aspect is that they become addicted or dependent on substances or they become involved in relationships with people in prison so that when they leave, other criminals are the only people they will know and the criminal environment becomes their norm.</P>
    <P>The only way to address the problem is to try to change the mindset of prisoners when they are in Mountjoy and the only way to do that is through education and training.  The report of the visiting committee emphasises time and again the problem of space.  It talks about the lack of space in many areas but particularly for training, education and development activities.  It also points out that few educational institutions have relationships with the prison population of Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>Last Saturday's <i>The Irish Times</i> carried a report on the life of a former Provisional IRA member from his earliest memories to his current position in jail, and looked at the factors that brought him to the point where he walked into a pub and killed an innocent person who happened to be a policeman in Northern Ireland.  One can see from the story that the person did not begin to think about what he was doing until he reached a particular age.  The story is somewhat similar to the history of some of our political parties.  Most of our political parties come from a revolutionary background; they came through a revolutionary or military process and developed from that.  It is a perfectly understandable progression in which people think their way through a process. We must allow the prison population to learn and accept new parameters of behaviour and new norms of judgment and give them something on which to base their future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1847" /> We need to deal with the causes of crime as much as we need to deal with the criminals.  We need to put a serious effort into changing the behaviour of people who are consistently involved in the vicious circle of under-privilege, overcrowding, poverty, unemployment, petty crime, crime and prison.  A recent survey of the prison population in the UK showed that the introduction to crime for young people was pilfering food in supermarkets.  We must ensure that people are not enticed into crime through hunger.</P>

      <P>Reports such as that of the Mountjoy Visiting Committee are not party political reports and I thank the Senators who addressed this motion in that spirit.  I also thank the Senators who addressed the specific areas on which I asked them to concentrate because of their expertise.  Senators are elected to the Upper House on vocational panels and are expected to use their expertise in various areas.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Management of Offenders&rdquo; report was addressed in a non-party political way also.  It was an excellent report, the first report produced by the Department which gave any attention to the plans we should make for dealing with offenders.  I compliment Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn on her work on that report and I also compliment the present Minister for continuing that work.  It is depressing, however, that successive reports are produced but there appears to be no sense of urgency to implement their recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn is right in saying that prisons and prisoners are out of sight so it is easy to say that no changes need be made.  There is little credit or votes in improving conditions in prisons.  One of the most depressing aspects of this matter is that the public wants politicians to deal with the crime problem but they often do not understand &mdash; a fact we must make them understand &mdash; how desperately difficult is the correlation between crime, society outside and conditions <Col N="1848" /> in prison.  We must try to address these areas.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that assessments are being carried out on the drugs situation in prisons.  That is very important.  I am also pleased that the women's prison is to be progressed.  It is most urgent because there is no space in which to locate a drug free unit within the women's prison at present.  The centre for visitors is an absolute disgrace although that was not mentioned by the visiting committee.  The Society of Friends and St. Vincent de Paul are jointly prepared to run the visitors centre if it is built.  Indeed, the prison Governor is getting so desperate he may try to put up portacabins again.  Similar centres have been built in Maghaberry in Northern Ireland and are being run with great success on a volunteer basis. It is incredible that so many people are prepared to help in the prison on a voluntary basis and it is some comfort to see that all Ministers are prepared to make use of the expertise being offered in these areas by those who can help.</P>
    <P>If any of the prisoners heard Senator Gallagher's description of Loughan House or Senator Mullooly's description of how nice Castlerea will be, they will all sign pledges to go there as quickly as possible because they sounded most attractive places and hugely different from Mountjoy.  I thank the Minister of State for giving of his time to discuss this depressing topic which must be addressed if there is to be any justice in the country.</P>

      <P>This is a busy time and I appreciate the Minister's presence in the Chamber to listen to my plea <Col N="1849" /> regarding the retention of a teacher in Scoil Naomh Mhuire, Castlegal, County Sligo.  The school asked me to make a case for them to the Minister.  Its enrolment will increase next September to 26 pupils.  There are 20 children on the roll at present, only one of whom is leaving, and three infants are beginning in the school in September.  In addition, two families are moving into the area, each with two schoolgoing children, who have indicated they wish their children to attend that school.  That would bring the total enrolment up to 26, which is enough to retain the assistant teacher. Therefore, it does not make sense that they cannot hold onto the second teacher.  Due to the number of families settling in the area, there are indications the school will be able to sustain the two teachers.</P>
      <P>The school is located in a very deprived rural area on the Sligo-Leitrim border and serves the local community. The status of the school would be damaged if it lost a teacher.  The assistant teacher has been notified that she will be placed on the panel.  It would be more sensible to retain her so that the pupils would have continuity.  The board of management has expressed a wish for the Minister to consider these points and rescind her decision.  The idea of one teacher teaching children whose ages range from four to 12 years is not modern thinking and cannot be justified. It is not sound education and is unacceptable in 1996.</P>

      <P>Since taking office I have aimed to ensure that all our children benefit fully from education.  The many initiatives I have introduced since 1993 have dramatically improved the situation at primary level, particularly in areas of disadvantage.  I have also been very conscious of the special difficulties associated with smaller schools.  My most recent initiative, <i>Breaking the Cycle</i>, targets clusters of small rural schools and provides grants and other supports to offset the educational disadvantage associated with these schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1850" /> In addition, I recently announced that no two teacher school which was due to lose a teacher under the 1996-97 staffing schedule will do so.  I am pleased to inform Senator Ormonde that Scoil Naomh Mhuire, Castlegal, County Sligo, is one of the schools which will benefit from this decision and will, therefore, retain its second teacher for the 1996-97 school year.  I thought I should come to the House to tell the Senator that myself.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue.  The Kells community school is very dear to my heart.  In 1986, in the dying days of the then Administration, the school was given the goahead to start construction.  This school is no different from any other in a town where there has been a substantial increase in the number of students.  The school has made an application to the Department for an extension and is hoping a design team will be approved at the earliest possible date so that the extension, which has been more or less agreed with the Minister's officials, can go ahead as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The school has between 600 and 700 pupils.  It is a lovely complex because two primary schools, the community school, a girls' school and a swimming pool are on the one site, which is fairly unique.  I hope the Minister can give me some good news for the pupils, parents, teachers and board of management of the school on when progress will commence.</P>

      <P>I would like to outline <Col N="1851" /> for the information of the House the background to the situation relating to Kells Community School.  Approval was granted for the provision of an extension of 476 square metres, to cater for a projected long-term enrolment of 650 pupils, for the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of appointing a design team for the project is being considered by the post primary building unit of my Department at present.  It is the intention of the building unit to make the necessary arrangements for the design team appointments as soon as possible. The school authorities will be informed of any arrangements in due course. <Col N="1852" /> When a design team is appointed, architectural planning of the proposed extension will commence.  I assure the Senator that every effort will be made to progress the planning of the project at Kells Community School as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>A decision on when this project will proceed to tender and construction stages will be taken in the light of available capital resources.  Therefore, I am sure the Senator will appreciate that it is not possible at this stage to say when the actual construction of the additional accommodation will commence.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 June 1996.</P>
