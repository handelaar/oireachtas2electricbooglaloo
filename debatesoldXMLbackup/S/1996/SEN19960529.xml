      <P>I have notice from Senator McGowan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide funding to complete a PE hall at Raphoe vocational school, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to appoint an inspector of prisons with specific powers, duties and terms of reference.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to outline his attitude to the recent Consumer Association of Ireland survey into the country's 13 big mortgage lenders.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Roche of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to make a statement on the failure of her Department to properly <Col N="1158" /> process a series of complaints lodged by the parents of children attending a school (details supplied) under the aegis of Bray vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to outline the action she proposes to take to end the strike which is to take place on the 29 May 1996 at Kilrush community school, if she is aware of the concerns of the students and parents at this development, and if she will make a statement on this matter.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator McGowan's and Senator Henry's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2 and 19, motion 31. Item 2 will follow immediately after item 1 until 6 p.m.  If item 1 does not finish by 6 p.m., item 2 will be deferred until next week.</P>

      <P>Two weeks ago I raised the issue &mdash; Senator Bohan followed it up last week &mdash; of the Government's decision to send 150 gardaí from Dublin to the Border.  I do not question the need to protect our Border in regard to the movement of cattle but I ask the Leader to convey the concerns expressed in Dublin about moving these gardaí from the most sensitive areas of Dublin.  This will become an issue.  It is already having a negative effect on Garda services and activities in the city. Garda sources have told me that this decrease in Garda numbers is having a negative effect on two of the most important manpower need areas in the city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I raised with the Leader the importance of giving people proper and full information on issues such as food, etc.  I also mentioned the fact that a lot of publicity regarding the non-risks attached to passive smoking had been subsidised by the tobacco industry.  Similarly, we were told that salt in processed food posed no danger, only to find out later that this was on the basis of information issued by the food processing industry.</P>
      <P>Matters reached a new low last week with the scare about ingredients in baby foods which may have a serious effect on the health of future generations.  The British Government is not prepared to let us know which baby foods are dangerous.  It is time our Government took a stand on these issues, made proper information available, demanded from the British Government that people are made aware of the brands that may pose a risk and until such time as the opposite is the case, we should reject such foods.  It is disgraceful.  We need to take a stand.  The Government should deal with this or we should discuss it here and go through each detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole.  It is imperative that all information available to the British Ministry for Agriculture and Food should be given to the Minister for Health.  When we had the BSE crisis in recent weeks, the Minister for Health was reassuring the public about the safety of our beef. It is imperative that a similar statement is made on baby foods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two weeks ago I mentioned the report of the visiting committee to Mountjoy Prison.  There was support for this on RTE this morning, especially in relation to the women's prison and the fact that many women prisoners who were there recently are now dead. There does not seem to be any after care or follow up facilities for our women prisoners, who account for a very small percentage of our total prisoners. Recommendations were made in this regard by the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  Can the Minister <Col N="1160" /> for Justice come to this House so that we can specifically follow up on these matters to see which recommendations the Government is prepared to put in place?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader ask the Tánaiste, representing the Government, to protest in the strongest way at the brazen effrontery of the British Government in disrupting the business of the European Union because of a problem caused exclusively by itself, particularly because of the damage it is doing to our economy?  Over 170,000 animals in Britain have been infected by BSE; we had only 126 cases; it represents 10 per cent of our GNP and a value of £1.6 billion per annum.  The British Government, which failed to take the necessary actions when required, is now blaming everybody else, including the unfortunate developing nations which will not receive their support programmes from the European Union if the British succeed in blocking European activity.  I ask the Leader of the House to protest in the strongest possible way against their insensitivity and brazen effrontery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people have been worried about the cost of the rescue services and there was much comment in this morning's newspapers about the cost of the recent rescue of two fishermen in Kerry.  I compliment the services involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in the next few months thousands of people will be using our rivers and seas for leisure and business purposes.  They will include fishermen and people bringing visitors to our islands.  If one wishes to drive a 50cc motorbike on the road one must get a licence and insure the vehicle.  However, if one takes out a boat with an outboard engine there is no obligation to have a licence and I doubt that many of such boats are insured.  Can the Leader of the House, in the interest of saving lives, introduce legislation to make it mandatory that every boat be registered, taxed <Col N="1161" /> and insured, as is the case for a 50cc motorbike?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing the matter now.  The Senator is stretching the Order of Business; he has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader introduce such legislation immediately? Then people would know who owns and hires out boats.</P>
      <P>I have another marine question to raise with the Leader.  Over recent months there have been many false alarm calls on our rescue services.  The Leader should ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Senator can find another means of raising this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Minister to make it mandatory that a log be kept of every time a two way radio is used in Ireland.  In addition, when two way radio licences are issued they should be accompanied by some type of bug that would allow the rescue services to determine the location of the call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader ask the Minister to do something about this dangerous trend of false alarm calls being made on our rescue services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's calls regarding the Garda Síochána.  There is no doubt that vigilantes appear to be taking over the city and they will take over every town in Ireland in a short time if they are not curbed.  The only people who can curb them are the gardaí.  We must support the Garda and ensure that the vigilantes do not get stronger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on food ingredients and food poisoning.  There is no scientific evidence to justify many of the reports we receive.  Often they emanate from a <Col N="1162" /> single professor who has given his opinion in the form of a statement.  That is not good enough.  In that regard, the Leader might ask the people in the RTE newsroom to put down the BSE cow they continuously show on television. The cow is well flogged now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a matter for the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it is about time she was put down.  RTE should show pictures of a herd of good cattle, grazing in the green fields of Ireland rather than damn our beef business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's request for information about the contents of baby food.  It is important that such information be made available by the Minister for Health to reassure mothers that baby food sold in Ireland does not contain harmful components.</P>
      <P>In view of the confirmed recent outbreak of BSE in County Longford&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This evening's Private Members' motion relates to that matter.  I cannot permit any discussion on BSE at this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of that fact I will make no further comment on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange with the Minister for Social <Col N="1163" /> Welfare to discuss the collapse of the current student summer job scheme? This scheme has only been established and already there has been a reduction in the provision of student employment. Many organisations applied for the right to employ students under this worthwhile scheme.  My local authority in County Donegal has advertised vacancies for students wishing to enter employment during the summer.  At the same time the Minister of Social Welfare has written to students to inform them that he cannot recommend them for employment, despite the fact that they were given jobs last year.  This is because restrictions were introduced in the amount of money provided under the scheme.  However, the Minister informed students that he understood they were eligible to draw unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>It is criminal that the Minister for Social Welfare should refer students to employment exchanges to claim benefits.</P>

      <P>It is.  Will the Leader draw the attention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to a very serious situation where over 500 farmers have received massive bills for penalties arising from the oversupply of milk? This is creating great hardship for many farmers who have very small holdings in one of the most severely handicapped and depressed agricultural areas.</P>

    <P>Will the Leader intervene to get the Minister for Education to see reason about the situation which has developed in Kilrush community school?  Teachers there are on strike today and this will not help students in the lead up to examinations.  The Minister's failure to take action to deal with this crisis has brought about this strike.

However, I will draw his concern to the attention of the Minister who will attend the House tomorrow when the matter can be raised again.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole referred to issues such as smoking, salt and baby foods and the question of proper information. The matter of baby foods is one, in the first instance, for An Bord Bia to examine whether proper information is being provided.  A Bill will come before the House shortly concerned with strengthening the consumer element of An Bord Bia.  This will provide a good opportunity to debate this issue in full.  I do not minimise its importance.  There is an extremely important problem about vested interests not being made public when supposedly scientific information is being passed off.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan raised the question of the women's prison.  I would be happy to arrange a meeting with the Minister for the Senator and any other Senators who are concerned about the issue to at least establish some facts rather than basing the discussion on a short radio programme.</P>

I am sure that, given the importance of the matter, the Senator would be obliged to do this.  I am not going to adjudicate because I do not know the facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil has made a number of amendments to the Bill.  I hope to show the House that the measure has been substantially improved as a result.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most important change has been to extend the scope of the Bill to enable attorneys appointed under an enduring power to take certain personal care decisions on behalf of the donor. Such an extension was advocated both in this House and in the Dáil and, indeed, I was urged to go further and include decisions on health care matters. However, so far as health care decisions are concerned, I remain of the opinion that it would be a mistake to amend the law on such a sensitive issue until this whole area has been thoroughly researched.  After all, we want the Bill to be enacted and brought into operation at the earliest date possible.</P>
      <P>However, I was impressed by the case for enabling donors, if they so wished, to authorise their attorneys to act on their behalf in certain specified personal care matters, and amendments were inserted on Report Stage in the Dáil to enable this to be done.  The amendments specify a list of personal care decisions and require the donor to choose which ones to delegate to the attorney.  The list is given in amendment No. 4 and it contains the kind of important personal care matters that arise in practice when a donor becomes mentally incapable, such as where the donor should live and applications for housing, social welfare and other benefits for the donor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specific safeguards are provided in relation to the exercise by an attorney of the authority to make personal care decisions.  Under amendment No. 25 any personal care decisions must be taken in the donor's best interests and guidance is given as to how those interests are to be determined.  For this purpose, regard must be had, for <Col N="1172" /> example, to the past and present wishes and feelings of the donor, so far as these are ascertainable, and to the factors which the donor would consider if he or she were able to do so.  Also, other specified persons will have to be consulted, so far as that is practicable and appropriate, for their views as to what the donor's wishes and feelings might be and as to what would be in the donor's best interests.  These persons are anyone named by the donor as someone to be consulted on such matters and any other person engaged in caring for the donor or interested in the donor's welfare.</P>
    <P>The exercise by the attorney of the authority to take personal care decisions will be subject to supervision by the court in the same way as decisions in relation to business and financial affairs. Amendment No. 33 enables the court to give directions about a personal care decision which is contemplated by an attorney or which has already been put into effect.  Applications to the court for such directions can be made in a summary manner by or on behalf of the donor, the attorney or any interested person.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 22 provides that an enduring power relating to personal care decisions will be invalidated only if the designated attorney is subsequently convicted of an offence against the person of the donor or becomes the owner of a nursing home in which the donor resides.  In other words, the attorney's bankruptcy, conviction for fraud or dishonesty or disqualification as a director will not automatically invalidate the enduring power, as it would in the case of an enduring power relating to the donor's business or financial affairs.  I stress &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; because it is always open to those notified of the execution of the power to object to its registration on grounds of unsuitability when the attorney seeks to have it registered and brought into force.</P>
    <P>A consequential amendment, No. 28, is necessary in section 7 to enable an attorney who has applied for registration of a power to make a personal care decision which cannot reasonably <Col N="1173" /> be deferred until the application has been determined.  That situation, which undoubtedly will occur in practice, has to be provided for because the attorney has to give five weeks' notice of intention to make the application to persons, such as relatives, who may wish to object to the registration.  I believe these amendments will strengthen the position of those attorneys who have to care for those who become mentally incapable.</P>
    <P>Several changes were made in the Dáil to ensure that the wishes of the donor to create a valid enduring power are not frustrated by non-compliance with the legislation.  This House had already accepted an amendment providing for the acceptance by the Registrar of Wards of Court of an enduring power which differed in an immaterial respect from the form prescribed in the regulations to be made under section 5. Amendment No. 31 goes further and will enable the court to grant relief in an appropriate case even where there are material defects in the enduring power. Before granting relief the court must be satisfied that the donor intended the power to be effective during his or her mental incapacity, that there was no fraud or undue pressure, that the attorney is suitable and that it is desirable in the interests of justice to register it.  I believe the House will agree that it is prudent to make provision for such cases, bearing in mind that the unfortunate donors will not be in a position to regularise the situation at the stage when the power is being registered, and that the safeguards being provided will ensure that their wishes are given effect in proper cases.</P>
    <P>Another change in this context ensures that the death, mental incapacity or disqualification of one joint attorney will invalidate the enduring power only as far as that attorney is concerned unless the donor has expressly provided otherwise &mdash; this is in amendment No. 38.  Again in the interests of preserving enduring powers, a donor will be able to nominate a person or persons to act as attorney in the event <Col N="1174" /> that the original attorney dies or does not act or cannot do so.  That is being achieved by amendment No. 15.  These are important additions to the Bill because, if an enduring power fails, the wards of court procedure will have to be invoked, with its attendant delays, complexity and expense.</P>
    <P>Safeguards have also been strengthened. The regulations to be made under section 5 will now make provision for the keeping of accounts by attorneys. An attorney will have to state in the document creating the enduring power that he or she understands the duties and obligations of an attorney and the document will set out what these duties and obligations are.  That is the effect of amendments Nos. 13 and 14.</P>
    <P>In addition, the provisions disqualifying certain categories of persons from acting as attorneys have been tightened up.  Amendment No. 16 gives effect to suggestions in the Dáil that the list of disqualified persons should be extended to persons convicted of certain categories of criminal offences and to those disqualified from acting as company directors. The offences specified in the amendment are those involving fraud or dishonesty and offences against the person or property of the donor.  The amendment also covers, as well as disqualified company directors, other persons who may be disqualified under the Companies Act, 1990, such as company secretaries, auditors, receivers, liquidators and examiners.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 covers a situation which arises after the power has been created and in which an attorney is convicted of such an offence or is disqualified as a director.  The conviction or disqualification will invalidate the power so far as the attorney is concerned or, if the power has already been registered, will cause it to cease to be in force.  The amendment also makes it clear that if the donor appoints a substitute attorney, any subsequent disqualification of the original attorney will not cause the enduring power to lapse so that the substitute attorney can take the original attorney's place as envisaged by <Col N="1175" /> subsection (3) which is being inserted by amendment No. 15.</P>
    <P>In the Bill as passed by the Seanad an owner of a nursing home in which the donor resides and persons residing with or employed by the owner were disqualified from acting as an attorney under an enduring power unless the attorney was a spouse, parent, child or sibling of the donor.  Amendment No. 23 extends that disqualification by including in the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; a person managing the nursing home or a director, shadow director or shareholder of a company which owns or manages the home.</P>
    <P>With a view to simplifying court procedure, provision is being made by amendment No. 5 for all applications or references to the court in relation to enduring powers to be made in a summary manner.  Amendment No. 30 makes it clear that all straightforward enduring powers will be automatically registered by the wards of court in a purely administrative procedure.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 21 amends section 5 (6) which invalidates an enduring power which is in favour of the donor's spouse if, subsequently, the marriage is annulled or the parties separate. Amendment No. 21 adds a further ground for invalidation, that is, that an order has been made under the Domestic Violence Act against the spouse on the application of the donor or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>Amendment No. 45 extends the categories of relatives who may be notified of an application to register an enduring power.  At present these categories are limited to the donor's spouse, children, parents and siblings. The additional categories are widows or widowers of children of the donor and the donor's grandchildren, nephews and nieces.</P>
    <P>The remaining amendments are of a drafting or technical nature but I shall be happy to give any explanations or clarifications Senators may wish on them or any other amendments.</P>
    <P>The debates on this Bill in the Dáil and in this House were most constructive <Col N="1176" /> and have resulted in a much improved measure.  I thank the Law Society and the Dublin Solicitors Bar Association who made many useful suggestions for the amendment of the Bill which are reflected in the amendments before the House.  The Bar Association has had a particularly valuable input into the draft regulations, a revised version of which is being sent to it.  I expect to have the regulations and the order bringing the legislation into operation made shortly after the Bill becomes law.  I commend the amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>We are glad this legislation is being brought forward speedily. Many people become unable to deal with their personal and financial affairs through incapacitation.  It is difficult to respond to all the amendments.  I was not fully aware of the nature and extent of the amendment of the Bill.  However, I agree with almost everything the Minister said.</P>
      <P>Whether attorneys should be involved in the personal care decisions of the donor was not raised in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  It is an issue which should be dealt with carefully because it involves an attorney making lifestyle decisions on behalf of a donor. These are extremely personal and sensitive matters.  I hope the Minister is satisfied that the ongoing policing and monitoring of these arrangements is adequately provided for in the Bill. Whenever a person is put in charge of the affairs of another, we must be extremely careful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expressed my concern that the power of attorney system would be misused, as it is in other countries, by what I referred to as the Al Capone syndrome. People could seek to divest themselves of their powers and, there-fore, their responsibilities so that they could avoid responsibility for their actions and live their lives through <Col N="1177" /> another person.  I am happy that the monitoring procedures and the safeguards in the Bill are sufficient.  As I said, personal care decisions are extremely sensitive.</P>
    <P>There does not seem to be provision for the religious or spiritual life of the donor.  I would have thought that would be an important personal care decision which an attorney might have had to see to on behalf of a donor.  There could be other areas of an individual's personal life which could have merited attention by a donor that might not be covered by this list, and this draws attention to the fact &mdash; and I believe the Minister will agree &mdash; that it is dangerous to list things one can do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about amendment No. 4.  The danger in specifying seven personal care issues means that if something else arises, the courts may feel excluded from dealing with them.  Is the Minister satisfied that the courts would be in a position to consider other personal care decisions?</P>
      <P>As regards amendment No. 30, I agree these applications should be registered with the wards of court office.  I presume the purpose of that is to provide for a registration system which would be open to the public, including legal practitioners, and that is the only intended involvement of the wards of courts office in relation to this aspect of law.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that.</P>
      <P>I agree with amendment No. 31.  If the courts note that an instrument may be technically faulty, the must have power to register it if provisions (1) to (iv) apply.  If this was not the case, tragic circumstances could arise and what otherwise would have been a valid instrument could not be registered and an unfortunate person could be left without an attorney.  This is undesirable.</P>
      <P>I agree with amendment No. 16, but is the Minister happy it is sufficiently wide?  The amendment states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1178" />&ldquo;has not been adjudicated bankrupt or convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty or an offence against the person or property of the donor...</P>
    <P>Some people make compositions with their creditors on a personal basis and yet are not adjudicated bankrupt.  If somebody was to all intents and purposes bankrupt, but not declared so, one would not want such a person involved as an attorney.  Are such circumstances covered by the amendment?</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;an offence involving fraud or dishonesty&rdquo; is unclear.  Does it mean a conviction on indictment or a summary conviction for fraud or dishonesty? Is there a time limit?  If somebody was convicted of an offence up to 40 years ago, are they debarred from acting as an attorney?  I ask the Minister to address this point in his reply.</P>
    <P>Regarding amendment No. 21, will the Minister clarify the position of an attorney or proposed attorney in circumstances where the parties separate or the marriage is annulled?  Does the measure cover the concept of divorce as we might know it or will it be necessary to amend the Bill if divorce legislation is introduced?  If so, a broader policy question arises.  Why is somebody from whom one is separated or about to be divorced, or if one's marriage was annulled, considered an inappropriate attorney?  I am not arguing the point, but perhaps the Minister will explain the rationale behind it.  People could have separated or divorced in amicable circumstances and a donor might be happy to have that person act as an attorney on their behalf, notwithstanding the fact that they are separated or the marriage was annulled.</P>
    <P>As on the previous occasion when this side welcomed the legislation, we hope the Bill will be passed.  Many, if not all, the amendments made by the other House are worthy.  I thank the Minister for his work and I hope the Bill will become law without delay.  I look forward to examining the regulations, which I am sure will be laid before the <Col N="1179" /> Houses of the Oireachtas.  The regulations will be most pertinent because they will cover the mechanics of applications and registrations.  I ask the Minister to respond to my queries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill back to the House and congratulate the Minister for listening to the improvements suggested by the Seanad and the Dáil. The amendments strengthen the Bill and make it more effective and many people will be better off as a result.</P>
      <P>I welcome especially the main provision which enables attorneys appointed under the enduring power to take certain personal care decisions on behalf of the donor.  This is very progressive. It was discussed in this House and a good case was made for it.  It will allow the attorney to intervene and make decisions of a personal nature and be concerned about the donors' personal difficulties.  I agree with Senator Mulcahy that this must be handled delicately but it is also important to have it present when decisions have to be made.  We all have experience of cases where interventions should be made. The lifestyle and quality of life of some people would be better if there was an attorney to intervene and make decisions on their behalf.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 lists matters which can arise in practice when a donor becomes mentally incapable &mdash; where a donor should live, applications for housing, social welfare which can be important, and dealing with health boards.  These decisions are made regularly but when somebody becomes mentally ill and is incapable of making these decisions it is important that they are made for them so that their quality of life is the best possible.  Giving an attorney the power to make such decisions will improve the quality of life for donors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 25 ensures personal care decisions must be taken in the donor's best interest and guidance is given on how these interests are to be determined.  This covers any concerns <Col N="1180" /> we might have about misuse of the donor's position when taking personal care decisions on their behalf.  The Bill extends the number of persons to be consulted, where it is practicable and appropriate, to ensure their views on what the donors wishes and feelings might be are known.  Anyone named by the donor is to be consulted on such matters as well as other persons engaged with caring for the donor or interested in the donor's welfare.  A broad spectrum of people who have interests in the welfare of the donor must be consulted now under the Bill. This is further protection that all decisions in the personal care area are taken in the best interests of the donor with wide consultation between those who are concerned for the donor's welfare.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 22 provides that the power relating to personal care decisions will be invalidated only if the designated attorney is subsequently &ldquo;convicted of an offence against the person of the donor&rdquo; or becomes the owner of a nursing home in which the donor resides.  The enduring power is not invalidated where the attorney's bankruptcy, conviction for fraud or dishonesty or disqualification as a director occurs.  When dealing with financial situations it is surely important that that would invalidate the enduring power of attorney but in personal care areas, it could be a close member of the family who, despite any difficulties they experience in life elsewhere, will continue to be caring, concerned and effective in making decisions in the personal care of the donor.  I agree with the Minister that the amendments in this area will strengthen the position of attorneys who must care for those who become mentally ill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 31 enables the court to grant relief in an appropriate case even where there are material defects in the enduring power, but the court must be satisfied that the donor intended the power to be effective during his or her mental incapacity, that there was no fraud or undue pressure, that the <Col N="1181" /> attorney is suitable and that it is desirable in the interests of justice to register it.  This adds further protection for the care of the donor.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that it is prudent to make provisions for such cases when one considers that the unfortunate donor will not be able to regularise the situation at the stage when the power is being registered.  Safeguards will now be provided to ensure their wishes are given effect.</P>
    <P>Section 5 will make provision for the keeping of accounts by attorneys.  I see a reason for it as long as undue pressure, work or bureaucracy, is not put on the work of a donor.  Of course, when one is dealing with the financial affairs of another, it is prudent and important that one keeps proper accounts and is seen to do so.</P>
    <P>The Bill is much more effective as a result of these amendments.  The last two lines of the Minister's speech are among the most important: &ldquo;I expect to have the regulations and the order bringing the legislation into operation made shortly after the Bill becomes law.&rdquo;.  Concern was expressed in this area to ensure that it was brought in immediately.  Rumours &mdash; they are no more than that &mdash; suggested it may be months or even early next year before these regulations would be made.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he will bring them in immediately after the Bill is brought into law.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for listening to the debates in the Dáil and the Seanad.  We have a much better Bill now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I congratulate the Minister and his officials on the Bill.  The amendments he accepted from the Dáil have greatly improved and strengthened it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill first came into the House I said that I would deem &ldquo;affairs&rdquo; as covering medical affairs; I see that my idea was scotched and only financial and business affairs are strictly laid down.  I am sorry the Minister did not include &ldquo;medical and allied matters&rdquo;<Col N="1182" /> because these can be extraordinarily important to someone nearing the end of their life.  There are difficulties in that area and I hope the Department will not forget about them.</P>
    <P>A great deal of legislation regarding gender equality in legislation was introduced in the 1970s.  We had the earliest and best legislation in this regard in Europe and it is continually being quoted in other European countries. This Bill will be examined by other countries as one which thoughtfully considers the donor's position and the grave responsibilities of whoever is their power of attorney.  I like the way &ldquo;the best interest of the donors&rdquo; is constantly stressed throughout the Bill.  This, after all, is the nub of the matter.  We must ensure that, whatever legislation is put in place, it is in the best interest of the donor.</P>
    <P>It is difficult, as Senator Mulcahy said, to enumerate personal care decisions, etc., and some matters which we would like to add may be left out.  For example, I would like to have seen some directives, if possible, regarding a person with the power of attorney being able to give registered medical practitioners and other health care professionals instructions regarding the future health care of the person.  This, of course, can cause extreme concern for elderly people who may feel strongly, for private and religious reasons, against using heroic measures to prolong their lives.</P>
    <P>Living wills have not proved very satisfactory in other jurisdictions, particularly in the United States.  We must examine health care in the power of attorney area and the Minister and his officials should continue to keep this in mind.  We should try to grapple with the problem.  It is not easy but there is no need for us to wait for anyone else to solve this problem.  We are as able as anybody else to deal with such matters from an ethical and moral point of view in a compassionate way.  I hope this will not be forgotten just because it is not in this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> I compliment the Minister on amendment No. 25 and the great stress being put on &ldquo;the need to permit and encourage the donor to participate, or to improve the donor's ability to participate, as fully as possible in any decision affecting the donor&rdquo;.  Donors are likely to be elderly people and, as we all know, sometimes people may be more alert one day than another.  There is no harm coming back another day to ask someone their views, if they feel they should be moved to another nursing home, if they are satisfied with the care they are receiving, etc.  These considerations are very important.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 25 also states that &ldquo;so far as ascertainable, the past and present wishes and feelings of the donor and the factors which the donor would consider if he or she were able to do so&rdquo;, this should be taken into account, and &ldquo;any person named by the donor as someone to be consulted on those matters&rdquo; should also be stressed.  All these matters are extraordinarily important and it is good to see them being stressed in this legislation.  It makes it humane and compassionate.  I try not to comment on whether matters are legally and totally proper.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and his officials on this Bill and in accepting these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments improve the Bill to a greater degree than when we first discussed it.  The Minister has, as always, considered what was raised in the debate.  We had a good debate on the last occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is important legislation.  Many people fear growing old because they think they will go senile, lose their independence or lose control over their welfare, their choice and freedom.  To be able to address this in some way through the power of attorney is critical and important.  This is not to be underestimated. The abuse of putting many people into old folks' homes and relations wanting them to make their wills at a time when they may not be up <Col N="1184" /> to it is so widespread that this measure is badly needed.  This is an undramatic Bill but it will be of great benefit to a large number of people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendment that provides for personal care decisions.  As Senator Henry said, it is important that one is permitted to obtain the wishes of and encourage the donor to decide, in so far as that is possible, what their choice might be on such matters.  It is not a matter of somebody else taking control. Instead, deciding what is best for the individual concerned can be a shared decision in many ways.  That amendment is most worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 31 is also important. It allows the court to rule a power of attorney to be valid even when there might be a small technicality militating against it.  As in the case of wills, the clear intention of the donor should be respected.  If by virtue of a technicality it might not be considered a proper document, the court should be allowed to consider and decide the matter.  It is also important to have the complete registration of the powers of attorney kept in the ward of court.  The form of notices given with regard to that registration to various relatives as are listed in the amendment is also important.  It is a matter of providing enough checks and balances and allowing people to be notified and have their say.  Above all, we must remember that the donor has the ultimate power to decide; that is critical.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendments which add to the effectiveness of the Bill.  It is important for people to be able to make decisions about important matters such as where they might wish to live and the medical care they wish to have.  This Bill gives them a say in their future in that regard and I commend it to the House. I congratulate the Minister and his officials on their valuable work on this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on these amendments. This is an important Bill.  The Minister and other Members of the <Col N="1185" /> House have been generous in their compliments to people and organisations involved in the processing of this legislation. The Minister said that many amendments were made to the Bill in its progress through the Oireachtas and he was satisfied that it was a better Bill as a result.  He extended his compliments to the Law Society, the Bar Council and other bodies.</P>
      <P>Members have congratulated the Minister on his willingness to listen to proposals.  He deserves my congratulations as well.  Too often we have had the experience of dealing with Ministers whose legislation was cast in tablets of stone.  The strength, value or basis of an argument made about such legislation, by Members or by interested bodies, was immaterial; they simply were not taken on board.  I welcome the Minister's reaction to such arguments in the context of this legislation and, indeed, in dealing with other legislation.  It is a vindication of the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas when Ministers are willing to accept well argued amendments. It enhances and justifies the role of backbencher participation in the progress of legislation through the Oireachtas.  I congratulate the Minister on his willingness to listen to reasoned argument.  I hope it is an indication of what we can expect from Ministers in the future.</P>
      <P>This is important legislation.  It is a response to sad human situations which must be dealt with and which require legislation.  It safeguards, in a substantial way, the interests of the donor and reduces, as is only right, the possibility that exploitation may arise as, unfortunately, has happened in the past. Amendment No. 4 relates to personal care decisions and paragraph (c) refers to &ldquo;whom the donor should see and not see&rdquo;.  When I read this first I was concerned and, although I might be about to answer my own query, I would appreciate the Minister's comments; my fears might be allayed by amendment No. 25 in so far as it gives certain powers to interested parties to take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> I am concerned that amendment No. 4 might give an attorney the power to refuse a family member access to the donor.  Amendment No. 25 might safeguard against that but I would like the Minister to confirm it.  Of the seven personal care decisions that are within the power of the attorney, that one, from a humanitarian point of view, most concerned me.</P>
    <P>I can offer a measure of support for the arguments made by Senator Mulcahy and Senator Henry.  Senator Henry referred to the absence of provision for decision making about medical care. Senator Mulcahy said he would like to see provision in the Bill to safeguard or protect the religious beliefs and practices of the donor.  Paragraph (g) of amendment No. 4 might provide the opportunity for the Minister to take account of the concerns of both Senators in drafting the regulations.  The subsection refers to &ldquo;housing, social welfare and other benefits for the donor&rdquo;.  The phrase &ldquo;other benefits&rdquo; could be expanded to take account of the points raised by the Senators.</P>
    <P>The regulations will be most important and I am glad no delay is likely to ensue following the passage of this legislation.  The Minister has given the House that assurance.  I welcome the fact that a much strengthened and improved measure has returned to the Seanad and I am happy to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of myself and the officials in my Department who worked hard during the preparation of this Bill and the amendments relating to it, I thank all Senators who contributed for their helpful and constructive remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Mulcahy, Howard, Neville and others referred to the insertion into the Bill of the personal care decisions provision.  Comments were also made with regard to whether the list involved was too broad or narrow, and one Senator was of the opinion that one provision is somewhat untoward.  The crucial factor which must be borne in mind <Col N="1187" /> in relation to personal care provisions is that the donor is in the driving seat. There is no obligation on a donor to include all or any of these optional provisions. For example, Senator Howard referred to the provision relating to whom a donor should see and should not see.  A donor may include that provision if they wish to grant such power to their attorney.  They may inform their attorney that they will see certain people and will not see others.  This is at the discretion of the donor and does not follow automatically from the granting of a power of attorney.</P>
    <P>Personal care decisions can be excluded from or included in the power of attorney if the donor wishes.  The donor is in the driving seat at all times. When constructing a power of attorney and giving instructions for its preparation, the donor makes a decision in advance about the extent to which personal care decisions should be delegated to the attorney.  Nothing follows automatically and matters are entirely in the hands of the donor when preparing the power of attorney.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy inquired whether the power of attorney will be dissolved as a result of the annulment or dissolution of a marriage by a law outside the State.  The provision is that, unless otherwise provided, the power of attorney will be invalidated.  The person who granted a power of attorney can have it continue if they wish, notwithstanding an annulment or dissolution. This matter is on a par with the rule that a will is automatically revoked when a person marries.  The change in marital status is very basic and a will is revoked by a subsequent marriage on the part of the person who made that will.  A power of attorney would also be dissolved in the event of annulment of a marriage or dissolution under the law of another state.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy also inquired if the Bill would require amendment in the event of the introduction of divorce in Ireland.  I must inform him that such amendments would be required.  We <Col N="1188" /> cannot deal with the possibility of dissolution taking place in Ireland until that matter is fully resolved by the courts.  It could not be dealt with under the Bill and an amendment would be required to cover local divorces, if and when they come into play.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy also raised the issue of whether personal care decisions will be policed.  This problem will be tackled in two ways: prevention and supervision. Under prevention, safeguards are provided at the time the enduring power is executed.  The provisions relating to solicitors and doctors must be met in accordance with the Bill and the regulations. With regard to supervision, the power of attorney cannot come into force until it is registered by the courts. It must be borne in mind that relatives can object at that stage, having been notified, as they must, under provisions laid down in the Bill.  Following registration, any interested party can apply to the courts to have the power cancelled or annulled if there is a basis for doing so.  The function of the registrar of wards of court is to register the enduring power.  This is an administrative procedure and the register will be open to public inspection.</P>
    <P>A person convicted of fraud or dishonesty will be debarred, irrespective of when the offence occurred.  This is a reasonable precaution because the donor's financial affairs will be involved. If a person's offence involved other crimes, that might be a different matter. However, one would have to exercise great caution about granting power of attorney to someone convicted of fraud or dishonesty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that an exception to the general rule regarding long-term previous convictions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but this is a special situation involving fraud and dishonesty. We are discussing the handing over of one's property to another person. The nature of the power of attorney must be kept in the forefront of one's mind at all times.  It is a very <Col N="1189" /> major step to take and means that one is handing over one's property, lock, stock and barrel, into the hands of an attorney.  For all practical purposes a person's property is placed in the name of the attorney, who can write cheques under the authority of the power of attorney granted to them.  They are also entitled to sell a person's property, farm or public house.  The provision is very extensive and far-reaching and great care is required.  The Oireachtas would be remiss if it permitted someone with a conviction for fraud and dishonesty to be granted power of attorney.</P>
      <P>A person who has made a composition will not be debarred when the enduring power is made.  However, objection could be made when the attorney applies for registration.  The court could refuse such an application in an appropriate case if grounds of unsuitability existed.  Much would depend on the basis on which the composition was made.  It could arise under differing types of circumstances but it is open for people to object at the registration stage.  If the court finds that the person is unsuitable by reason of the composition, it is open to it to refuse the registration.</P>
      <P>Senators referred to the list of personal care decisions.  Any list can be open to criticism on the grounds that it is too narrow or too broad.  I have included the decisions which seem most likely to occur in practice.  I sought to avoid including any which could possibly be regarded as being controversial. This is an innovative step in the law and I am of the view that it is prudent to hasten slowly in this regard.  When experience has been gained in its operation over a period, we may be in a better position to judge what would be the definitive list.</P>
      <P>I believe I have dealt with the points raised by Senators.  On my behalf and that of the staff of my Department, I thank them for their kind remarks and comments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if we had made a great deal of progress in terms of the Minister of State indicating her position on the matter or other speakers contributing to the debate.  I did not say everything I wanted to on the last occasion.  I do not want to spin out the matter unnecessarily but some very important policy matters have to be decided.  I am not trying to slow down the proceedings in any way, but from representations made to me there seems to be genuine concern about this.  I was thinking about this today and I would like to rephrase the question somewhat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How will the public or members of the legal profession get to know about refugee cases, if at all?  I raised on the last occasion the issue of whether a matter <Col N="1191" /> brought before the High Court on a point of law could be reported if it led the public to identify a person as an applicant under the Act.  These are extremely important questions.  We have already decided that the hearings of the Refugee Appeal Board should be held in private, with which I agree.  My logic for supporting that is, perhaps, different from that of the Minister of State.  I support it because I am afraid certain applicants would use their application to the Refugee Appeal Board as a propaganda exercise and would seek to publicise alleged wrongdoings in other countries which it might not necessarily be possible to check.</P>
    <P>Section 19 is very wide ranging and draconian and debars an applicant from having their case highlighted, unless the Minister so consents.  The Minister of State must provide the House with a very strong rationale for this rigid and hidebound prohibition on revealing the identity of the applicant.  I accept we are only talking about the identity of the applicant rather than the case itself. However, it is not difficult to think of cases in which the person would have such a high profile that the mere mention of the case could lead the public to identify them.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely important section from the point of view of civil rights and democracy.  I do not want to delay this matter too much, but I hope the Minister will provide the House with some inspired reasoning for this section. These are not my original thoughts but those of people involved in this work, of which the Minister of State has greater experience than I do.  Genuine representations have been made to me and the House deserves to hear the Minister's rationale in this regard before we vote on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We went into this matter very thoroughly the last day but I want to add a couple of points.  I can understand why the Minister of State is anxious that people could be abused by <Col N="1192" /> the publication of stories which would have serious effects on their families at home and so on.  That would certainly be the case with children and the mentally incapacitated, who would need protection.  However, there is a possibility, as Senator Mulcahy said, that even telling the story could identify the person.</P>
      <P>When we spoke about this section last week we said it was mainly a person's name which would identify them. Senator Neville gave the example of the X case.  However, on the other hand, there are thousands of teenage girls in Dublin, so referring to someone as &ldquo;girl X&rdquo; did not mean that telling the rest of the story would allow the person to be identified.  I will not discuss again poor Saddam's relations who foolishly went to Jordan rather than here and, worse still, were unwise enough to go back to Iraq.  However, how could one publish the details of the case of such high profile people without allowing them to be identified?</P>
      <P>Even if a person wants the details of their case published in the press, it is not possible to do so if the Minister refuses. Pressure was brought on the Department of Foreign Affairs regarding the beef tribunal and the granting of visas, which shows that pressure can be put on Ministers.  I understand the Minister has to give consent in regard to work. However, pressure can be put on Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any similar legislation in Europe which requires the consent of a Minister before the details of a case can be published?  Is it the norm that one has to have ministerial consent if the applicant gives consent?  Would it be possible for the Minister of State to alter the words &ldquo;the consent of the Minister&rdquo; to &ldquo;following the advice of the Minister&rdquo;?  I do not know if the word &ldquo;advice&rdquo; has legal connotations but it is not quite as draconian as &ldquo;the consent of the Minister&rdquo; which could block the whole case from being reported.  Only the name need be withheld, but the Minister might consider that the rest of the case would identify <Col N="1193" /> the person involved and she may refuse to give her consent.  It may not be possible to say that it was unreasonable to refuse consent.  Again, major commercial concerns could put pressure on the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave reasons at length regarding this section on the last occasion.  I am glad that Senator Mulcahy now accepts that what is in question is the identity of the applicant and that the target of this provision is the proper privacy of the applicant.  This does not fetter the media in giving coverage to the circumstances of the application or details of the political cause espoused by the applicant.  All that it requires of those who would engage in publicity is that they exercise caution and prudence in the material they use so as to avoid information which would tend to identify the applicant or the applicant's home connection. Most practising journalists are familiar with the wide variety of techniques, whether it is the print or television media, where cases can be highlighted while the identity of the applicant is a matter of privacy.</P>
      <P>I am aware from the earlier debates that the principle of there being a second line of defence for an asylum seeker under pressure to forgo privacy was widely accepted.  I have had much contact with refugees and the organisations dealing with them, especially the primary organisation, the UNHCR.  It is very anxious to see that refugees are not abused &mdash; there are cases where this can easily happen &mdash; and that the proceedings under which refugee applications are dealt with are proceeded with in a proper manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must take cognisance of the representations I receive, especially of the factors I outlined in detail &mdash; I do not want to go over all the ground again because we spent a great deal of time on this.  Of the three cases we have had in the past five months, the question of people being identified worked significantly to their disadvantage.  I told the <Col N="1194" /> House last week of the case where an applicant's identity had been made known.  A newsroom of one element of the media contacted the embassy of the country of origin of two asylum seekers inquiring about their case.  This embassy subsequently contacted the Department of Justice seeking further information about the applicants.</P>
    <P>In much of this Bill we are seeking to draw a balance between the rights of the asylum seeker, the protection of the asylum seeker who may have fled from a difficult and complex political situation, and the protection of Irish society and citizens.  There have been no less than three cases in the past five months &mdash; such as the two I have outlined &mdash; where the identification of applicants can put at considerable risk, not the applicants, who are safely in this country, but their families at home.  There is perhaps a job to be done by all of us in educating the media as to how to use information sensitively in a way which is responsible but not in a way which puts at risk either the asylum seeker or the families of the asylum seeker.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the House to take note of these practical points.  I am not referring to legal theories but to poor people under considerable pressure and danger.  I hope the Senator would be worried about the implication of the case I mentioned becoming common practice, both for the asylum seekers and their families back home.</P>
    <P>I would also draw attention to subsection (2), where the Minister's consent cannot be unreasonably withheld and is, therefore, subject to all the normal court challenges.  Anybody acting as a Minister must do so under advice on the principles of natural justice and the fact that her decision may be challenged in court if it is unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to take account of the balance of interest, which is what we are concerned with here, and how we draw the balance correctly.  The balance is drawn correctly in this section so as to allow for publication of the story but the withholding of identity in certain situations. This will be necessary to protect <Col N="1195" /> the asylum seeker.  Many asylum seekers welcome this protection because they may themselves be subject to pressure, either because they are not experienced in handling certain media situations, but more usually because the exile politics of their own situation is highly complex and there is the possibility of them being abused.  I do not refer here to my experience in this matter just in this country but in many other jurisdictions where exile politics and refugee politics are highly complex.  People can be abused.  They may wish to be protected from that abuse but they have no mechanism to do so because they must say one thing in public and they may wish for another thing in private with regard to themselves and their families. This is what they so advise us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Minister.  This is why, when some of these agencies approached me and <Col N="1196" /> asked me about confidentiality within the Refugee Appeals Board, I went against them because I considered that the primary point was the protection of the applicants and their families back home.  However, unfortunately it is not that simple.  For example, recently a North Korean soldier defected by flying a MIG fighter aircraft into South Korea. His family may suffer as a result of what he did, but that person took a decision and it was reported.  I put it to the Minister that there is a strong public policy argument to be made for reporting that story, although the identity of the person might not have been revealed.</P>
    <P>I am broadly sympathetic with what the Minister is saying, but again it is not that simple.  With all due respect, I do not think the Minister should try to proceed on the basis that she has the <i>imprimatur</i> for her particular stance from the UN because when it suited her she was quite happy to go against the UN.  I have in my hand the comments of the UNHCR on the Refugee Bill, 1995, and the right of asylum seekers to employment. Basically, it argued for the right to employment.  The Minister is picking and choosing, so she should not use what the UN says as a basis for her argument.  She should base her argument on the strength of its merits, not <i>ex cathedra.</i></P>

      <P>It is not only agencies that work in the area of refugees which are concerned.  The National Union of Journalists are also concerned.  A media release from that organisation, the date for which I do not know, stated that section 19 of the proposed Refugee Bill seems to directly contravene the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  It requires the consent of the Minister for Justice as well as the applicant before details of the case can be published or broadcast.  Should the refugee wish for anonymity, he or she of course is perfectly entitled to that, subject to a public interest override; but should he or she wish to make the public aware of the case, it would seem that a Minister who found such information embarrassing could prevent it getting out under a severe penalty, and any journalist concerned with such a publication or broadcast could face a fine of up to £1,500 and/or prison for up to six months.</P>
      <P>Again, I am not presenting that as a conclusive argument, but if one reads the section closely the phrase used is &ldquo;no matter likely to lead members of the public to identify a person as an applicant... shall be... broadcast&rdquo;. Who will define &ldquo;no matter likely&rdquo;?  It will be the courts.  That will bring an element of uncertainty into this matter, where a refugee applicant decides he or she wants the story to be told, the person tells the story to a newspaper or a television or radio station and a judge decides subsequently that the matter was likely to lead members of the public to identify that person.  This section is vague and uncertain and it will produce great difficulty in the future.  The Minister said that we must train journalists. Maybe we must, but the Minister or I will not do it.  Journalists being journalists, it will not happen.</P>

      <P>The case I raised of the journalist telephoning the embassy of the country concerned for information on asylum seekers in this country is, in <Col N="1198" /> my view, a gross departure from good journalism practice and an absolute indicator of the need for training in the area.</P>

      <P>Nobody will argue more strongly than I that journalists should be better trained.  In fact, many people should be better trained.  The reality is that journalists will make mistakes and may well find themselves being the subject of a fine or imprisonment for what is an innocent mistake.</P>
      <P>In my view, this section is vague, dangerous, ill thought out and ill prepared, and it should not proceed as planned.  As the Minister quoted authorities, why have the voluntary agencies which deal in this area argued against this section?  They are the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Referring to amendment No. 38 in particular, it is proposed by me, among others, that the words &ldquo;and the consent of the Minister (which shall not be unreasonably withheld)&rdquo; be deleted.  In other words, it should only be up to the person to decide.  They may make decisions which will have an impact on them and their families, but it is a question of weighing up which is the greater evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also asked questions which the Minister did not answer.  How are we to build up a body of knowledge on refugee affairs and law?  The appeal board is to be confidential.  The Minister will shrug her shoulders and say that it is not important legally.  The fact of the matter is that a jurisprudence in this area has built up in almost every European country, but nobody will know anything under our system.  The long-term sufferers will be refugee applicants who cannot avail of a body of expertise to argue their case, and there will be some arguments.  The Minister seemed to <Col N="1199" /> indicate on the previous occasion that this would all be plain sailing.  She knows there will be arguments.  There-fore, with regard to amendment No. 38, if everything is to be confidential, how will lawyers and the refugee agencies gain knowledge of refugee affairs?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I sometimes lose the thrust of Senator Mulcahy's argument. In one area he is arguing that refugees' identities must be protected at all cost, while on another point he almost said there should be open information on the matter.  The fact that the section includes the provision to require &ldquo;the consent of the Minister (which shall not be unreasonably withheld)&rdquo;, is an important part of the Bill because refugees are very vulnerable people.  They will come under pressure to release their names.  Their organisations will put them under pressure to have their names released for good objectives, but the thrust of this Bill must be to protect the individual refugee and his or her family in the home country.  There will be occasions when refugees will feel obliged, due to their cause or the pressure of well intentioned organisations, to reveal their names.  This may have the effect of causing difficulties for the refugees, as they may be targeted by groups, or for their families in the home country. Therefore, to ensure refugees are protected is an important area of the Bill.  Senator Mulcahy seems to agree that we must take all precautions to ensure refugees are protected.  To ensure the Minister is in a position to withhold permission, but not in a position to do so unreasonably, is an important precaution which can be tested in court.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the argument that we should let the UN write our legislation.  We must listen to their recommendations and accept them if we believe they are right but we are a sovereign State and we must decide what is right for this country; we cannot have the UN deciding for us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Senator's questions about High Court proceedings, my understanding is that the same procedure applies as in rape cases, that is, newspapers may not publish details which identify the applicant. In this case, we are discussing the identity of the applicant not being made known if the consent of the Minister is withheld, and such consent may not be unreasonably withheld.  I have outlined the circumstances in which this measure will be protective of the interests of the asylum seeker.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the thrust of the Senator's arguments.  He appears to agree with the underlying principles of the section and as a practising barrister seems to accept the reality of what I say about many areas of court proceedings where identities and only identities are withheld.  That is not a barrier to the facts of the story being told but it may be important to protect the identity of the applicant.  If a Minister acts unreasonably, that action is subject to review by the court and I think that puts a heavy onus on any Minister to act reasonably in this area.  I reiterate that in relation to this Bill it is necessary to strike a series of balances in terms of the refugees' interest, the public's right to know the identity of the applicant rather than the story and the broad public interest.  I suggest that, in this section, given that the Minister's right to withhold her consent &ldquo;shall not be unreasonably withheld&rdquo;, the balance is fairly struck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are speaking about degrees of an argument here.  The Senator says he accepts the underlying principle and I am not aware of any evidence relating to court proceedings or proceedings of this nature which show that sections such as this have been abused.  The section specifically provides that the consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and any Minister acting in relation to this section has to take that into account.  I cannot break confidentiality but the reason I seem stickier on this point than might seem reasonable to Senator Mulcahy is that I have a number <Col N="1201" /> of cases in mind in which I know that the protection of a provision such as this is important.</P>
    <P>I debated this point with an official of the National Union of Journalists.  We had an extremely reasonable discussion in which I explained we were talking about identity and he accepted that.  I invited him to write to me and to meet me in the Department to address the concerns of the NUJ but I regret to say the union has not done so.  There was a statement and an interview, I responded and we had a discussion which ended amicably enough.  My invitation to the NUJ was not responded to so my broad assumption is that the matter rests there.  I sought to address any concerns the NUJ have but equally I want to address my concerns in relation to the specific cases about which I have spoken.  For that reason I would have warmly welcomed an opportunity to meet the NUJ.</P>

      <P>I do not speak as a lawyer and I entirely accept the bonafides and importance of what the Minister is trying to do.  To return to a point I made the last day, in so far as the protection of identity is for the applicant's good, one has to support it, but if there is any suspicion that there might be concealment of identity because of interests the Minister might have, that would be a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the use of the word &ldquo;unreasonably&rdquo; but we do not know what a court would presume to be reasonable or unreasonable.  If the Minister were to plead national interest, how would a court respond?  Apart from that, what timescale is involved here? This issue has arisen time and again during the debate: can courts respond instantly?  How long does this take? Might the issue be long over before the <Col N="1202" /> matter comes to court as to whether reasonableness arises?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister in a position to indicate how this will work in practice?  She is arguing that she knows better than the individual involved what is in his or her interest; that might objectively be the case but it is an intrusion on the liberty of the individual to decide what is in his or her interest.  If it were possible to include the phrase &ldquo;without the consent of that person after consultation with the Minister&rdquo; or something of that order, I would prefer it to the phraseology currently in the Bill, which ultimately allows the Minister to tell applicants that since they do not know what is in their best interest, the Minister will decide for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am considering withdrawing the amendment because I am in sympathy with what the Minister said. Senator Neville said my thinking is confused but it is not; there are two interests in conflict and it is probably impossible to reconcile them.  The Minister could be right that a decision must be made on one side of the argument and almost certainly it is better made for the safety and welfare of the applicant than for any other reason.  I disagreed with the agencies about the confidentiality of the appeal board &mdash; they wanted it to be non-confidential but I argued for the opposite.</P>
      <P>The Minister said she understood it to be the case that High Court proceedings arising from this Bill would carry the same confidentiality as a rape or incest case.  That might be so in terms of the reporting of that case &mdash; section 19 (2) states:</P>
      <P>no matter likely to lead members of the public to identify a person as an applicant under this Act shall be published in a written publication available to the public or be broadcast...</P>
      <P>However, this does not necessarily mean the court proceedings have to be held <i>in camera.</i></P>

    <Col N="1203" />

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is adding too much to it.  Unless there is an <i>in camera</i> provision, the subsection does not seem to exclude the possibility that a diplomat or observer of a country where there was oppression could go into court and take notes, which would defeat the Minister's purposes.  Bearing that in mind, if the Minister accepts this is possible and notwithstanding that it may have been addressed, would she consider referring the matter back to the Office of the Attorney General for a final opinion?  I think it is a pertinent point.</P>
      <P>My last question relates to building up a body of expertise &mdash; I do not call it case law because the Minister is concerned about lawyers becoming involved, although they are involved in many other countries.  The voluntary agencies will want to learn from these cases to discover patterns of conduct in other countries or to learn how best to represent applicants.  There is no specific provision for the voluntary agencies to attend before the appeal board, except in a representative capacity.  The prohibition on publication will prevent cases appearing in newspapers.  If they are not allowed to be present in the High Court, there is a possibility there will be no public or specialised expertise built up.  Having agreed with what the Minister has said, I am inclined to with-draw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking about the facts of an application but the identity and identification of the applicant. An applicant would have to agree to the publicity and if it appears to the applicant that the Minister's consent is being unreasonably withheld, the applicant may with his or her lawyers or advisers apply to the courts.  I am sure the courts would hear any such case with considerable alacrity.  The net point is not the story but the identity of the applicant.  It may seem I am labouring this point but it is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> There are no <i>in camera</i> provisions in the Bill because we are not seeking to have a heavy hand; rather, we seek to strike a balance between the need in certain cases to protect the identity of the applicant while not inhibiting the publication of the story.</P>
    <P>It is highly unlikely that NGOs will not be able to build up a knowledge of what happens in refugee cases.  When a person arrives in this country he or she will receive the multilingual advice form which will contain the names and addresses of several NGOs.  From the very beginning the NGOs are involved in the process.  At present there is no law and applications are dealt with by the Department of Justice, the UNHCR and the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister of State at the Department of Justice there has not been a practical problem in this area, except in three cases where there was unwarranted identification of the applicants which resulted in disadvantage to them.  I found it astonishing that in one case an embassy was contacted by a journalist for information about named asylum seekers.  The embassy then contacted the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Senator's sense of balance and practicality.  There is no difficulty in this area at present and I am not aware that any of the agencies have suggested there are difficulties.  Asylum seekers receive a form indicating the NGOs which they can contact. However, a balance must be made between telling the story and, in some cases, protecting the identity of the applicant.  The balance is appropriately drawn in this case.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 38 not moved.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 19 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 19 (1) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioner, the Appeal Board, the Minister, the Minister for <Col N="1205" /> Foreign Affairs and their respective officers shall take all practicable steps to ensure that the identity of applicants is kept confidential.</P>
    <P>It appears to envisage an active policing role by those categories in respect of any possible breach in the confidentiality of the applicant's identity.  In so far as court procedures are concerned, would a situation arise under subsection (1) in which the Minister for Justice might apply to the court to have any hearings before the High Court held <i>in camera</i>?  It seems there would be an obligation on the Minister for Justice to make such an application and that the Minister might be failing in his or her duty in not doing so.  If that is the case, I am opposed to it.</P>
    <P>It is only in the most exceptional of cases that <i>in camera</i> proceedings take place in the High Court &mdash; in family cases as a matter of practice and in incest and rape cases as a matter of law. However, in some of those cases legal practitioners or members of caring agencies are allowed in the court to accompany the alleged victims.  If sub-section (1) gives an active role to the Minister to police a total confidentiality of the application, I oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree in general with Senator Mulcahy.  However, the section places an onus on the various parties mentioned to protect the confidentiality of the applicant's identity.  That is the practice in many areas.  We are talking about a practical situation.  The Senator is reading more into the section than is there.  Confidentiality is required in many areas and there is an onus on parties involved in certain administrative areas to maintain the confidentiality of people's identities.  It does not mean there cannot be a sharing of information to the parties legitimately involved in the area in question.  There are no <i>in camera</i> provisions in the Bill.  The Senator's fears are unreasonable and he is taking them several steps further than what is provided for in the Bill.  I hope I have been of some reassurance to him.</P>

Although I am not certain, I believe the fine could also be increased.  If somebody breaches this provision &mdash; we all agree on its seriousness &mdash; people could lose their lives.  Will the Minister consider a larger fine on summary conviction?  Is there a need for a larger penalty on indictment? It is serious offence and the penalty could be seen to be light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a sufficient deterrent to place on notice, the media and journalists in particular, that the breaching of the identity of an applicant is a serious matter.  The provisions made are adequate.  We are trying to strike a balance.  In this case we are trying to strike a balance &mdash; admittedly in a protective way &mdash; in the interests of the applicant.  If we were talking about a totally liberal disposition we might say there should be no restraint on the side of the applicant.  The penalties are sufficiently severe.  While the media are generally responsible, there have been a number of incidents, which I outlined to the House, where I would have been concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a point about the drafting of subsection (4), which states: &ldquo;that the publication or broadcast in question was of such matter as is mentioned in subsection (2).&rdquo;  It would have been better to draft it as follows: &ldquo;was of such a nature as <Col N="1207" /> to lead to the identity of the applicant&rdquo;. That is a drafting point which the Minister might take on board.</P>
      <P>Should this be an offence of strict liability?  There is enough scope in sub-section (4) for somebody to argue ignorance, which should never be an excuse for breach of the law.  A strong case could be made for this, bearing in mind the extreme seriousness of this matter, with which I agree.  We should consider making this an offence of strict liability. Although the Minister said that if the Minister's consent is unreasonably withheld they will go to the courts to get a speedy resolution, there is no guarantee of a speedy resolution in the courts of any matter.  If a Minister disagreed that he or she was being unreasonable, they could appeal that decision to two or three courts, which could take five years.</P>
      <P>In a case where a publication or a broadcast led the public to identify a refugee applicant, it would be a lot quicker to convict and it would bring irresponsible journalists &mdash; there are some &mdash; to heel.  This should be an offence of strict liability with an automatic fine being imposed in circumstances where there has been a breach of section 19 (1) and (2).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>That phrase was provided by the parliamentary draftsman &mdash; draftswoman in this case &mdash; who is the expert in this area.  This section is a balanced one.  As regards Senator Mulcahy's earlier point, one can envisage situations where a journalist did not know the circumstances where they were misled.  This section, which provides for a defence, is reasonable.  We want to prevent the unscrupulous exploitation of a refugee by a journalist or <i>vice versa.</i>  I argue that the balance is appropriately struck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> An area of which the legal departments of our newspapers, RTE and other broadcasters would be well apprised is the existence of these provisions in relation to the identification of applicants.  The balance struck is fair in relation to protection, penalty and defence.  We have tended to talk about the potential exploitation of refugees by a journalist; but, particularly with an unscrupulous applicant, it could happen the other way around.  We are trying to strike a balance in relation to all three.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's second point, but I would disagree with it in principle.  Offences of strict liability can be very unfair in that they do not give people a way out or excuse.  As the Minister correctly pointed out, the consequences of some of these breaches could be serious.  As regards the drafting of this subsection, I do not believe it is fair to try to defeat my argument by saying this is the wording approved by the parliamentary draftsman.  I tabled an amendment which the Minister accepted because I had spotted a legal error.  With respect, if I am capable of spotting one legal error, I am perhaps capable of spotting two.  I am not saying this is an error but the wording of this line should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards subsection (5), does a broadcast include a transmission via the Internet or a computer?  I would also like to ask about written publications, which perhaps answers the query I raised earlier.  This subsection states: &ldquo;does not include an indictment or other document prepared for use in particular legal proceedings.&rdquo;  Does the phrase &ldquo;particular legal proceedings&rdquo; refer to appeals to the High Court by way of a judicial review or otherwise following a determination of the Minister, the commissioner or the appeal board?  If so, the possibility is open that, incongruously, the identity of the applicant could be revealed in written affidavits because such documents come within the ambit of a document &ldquo;prepared for use in particular legal proceeding&rdquo;. <Col N="1209" /> This point must be examined. Is it possible all the facts, including the person's identity which one is trying to keep confidential could be revealed through the back door?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is treating some of the subsections as if they were the leading elements of the section.  The context of the section is reasonable action by the various parties involved to ensure the identity of applicants remains confidential.  The qualification is that it is subject to the agreement of the applicant and to the Minister not withholding consent.  Everything else is in the context of those leading elements.</P>
      <P>The Senator's point about Internet proceedings is covered by subsection (5) which states, &ldquo;...a record that is not in a legible form but which is capable of being reproduced in a legible form...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Subsections (1) and (2) are relevant to the phrase &ldquo;particular legal proceedings&rdquo;. They are the leading elements under which the Minister must consider whether he or she is acting unreasonably.  We are trying to ensure it is practical.  In some cases people may be anxious to tell their stories but that their identity is withheld.  In other cases people may want their identity broadcast but the Minister may, while not acting unreasonably, withhold agreement to such a move.</P>
      <P>The overall balance of the section's construction is intended to provide for the protection of refugees in a specific context in terms of the Minister not unreasonably withholding consent and the various parties to the application seeking to keep confidential the identity of the applicant.  The purpose of the subsections is to explain and qualify the matter.  However, it is not necessary to explain this to the Senator because he is a lawyer.</P>
      <P>In relation to the wording of the section, as Minister I am subject to the advice of the parliamentary draftsman's office and the Attorney General because that is their job.  I am not meant to be a drafter.  I take their professional advice and that is reasonable.</P>

      <P>I cannot presume what legal proceedings may or may not take place in relation to any person in this country under whatever status.  No Bill <Col N="1211" /> could set out to do so.  This is a definition section which seeks broadly to capture the areas where the identity of the applicant may become known in ways which breach the leading subsections (1) and (2).  We are discussing a practical Bill under which we must work with applicants.  This also applies to the various parties set out in the various sections.  I cannot presume what legal proceedings may or may not be taken by any of the parties or applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case the position is worse than I thought because the Minister is including the possibility that, in legal proceedings taken under the Bill, or a review of a decision made by somebody with responsibility for the Bill, all the facts, including the identity of the applicant, could be mentioned in affidavits prepared in furtherance of the legal proceedings.  The Minister is aware that affidavits are lodged in the central office of the High Court.  They are public documents and anybody could go in and read the identity of an applicant. This would make the entire section useless. The section should contain a total prohibition on the inclusion of the name or identity of the applicant in documents prepared for legal proceedings under the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister should not say I am clutching at straws.  People's names are included on documents in affidavits lodged in the central office of the High Court.  It would not be beyond the wit or wisdom of a representative of some country where there was oppression to go to the High Court office, look at the documents and learn the identity of the applicant.  If this possibility is open in the Bill, why does the earlier part of the section mention keeping the identity of the applicant confidential?</P>

      <P>The answer is yes because there are no <i>in camera</i> provisions in the Bill in relation to any High Court or court proceedings which may be undertaken. This is an attempt to strike a series of reasonable balances.  The Senator may feel the prohibitions are not sufficiently severe, but the prohibitions on the publication of identity of applicants strike a reasonable balance in protecting the applicant.  They do not seek to censure the courts or court documents and therefore there are no <i>in camera</i> provisions.</P>

      <P>I understand the position is that people attending hearings in the court will know the person's name.  The names will be on legal documents but there will be a prohibition on the publication of those names.  All the Bill does is prohibit the publication of the identity of the refugee.  This is what we have been discussing for the past hour and a half.  I see a situation where the only prohibition is in the publication of the identity of the person.</P>

      <P>This section should be opposed because it is a nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the one hand, &ldquo;The Commissioner, the Appeal Board, the Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and their respective officers shall take all practicable steps to ensure that the identity of applicants is kept confidential.&rdquo; Similarly, various people are prohibited from publishing material which will lead members of the public to identify a person.  Yet, if there are documents before the court which are publicly available, this section will permit the name and identity of the person to be on those court documents.  For instance, a member of Government or an agent of a country where oppression <Col N="1213" /> is taking place could send themselves or their agents into the High Court, get these documents, identify the name of the person who is bringing the application, discover all the background material and all the affidavits that were sworn.  Do not forget some of these affidavits could be sworn by persons who are in the original countries of oppression and, therefore, very vulnerable to attack.  This exposes them to huge danger.  This matter could be consistently dealt with by a prohibition on naming the person by their correct name on written legal documents.  There would be a total prohibition and protection of identity.</P>
    <P>I will not be a party to passing a section which on the one hand seeks to protect identity and on the other admits to the possibility that that identity will come out.  It will go through the channels of people who want to know about it, if not into the public arena.  People will say I am worrying too much.  The Minister of State knows the kind of political intrigue and pressures that are brought to bear in these cases and must admit that if the identity of the people is on the legal documents they and their families back home could be in trouble. Given that I withdrew my amendment on the basis of what the Minister of State said, it would not be unfair for the Minister of State to consider copperfastening the protection of identity by bringing an amendment to the final words of the &ldquo;written publication&rdquo; paragraph to the effect that the identity of the person in written legal documents would be protected.</P>

      <P>Senator Mulcahy has come full circle since we started this debate.  Initially, the Senator wanted openness; he wanted information fully available to NGOs and the Press.  The Senator now wants everything <i>in camera</i>; no information must be available. This counteracts the Senator's argument that NGOs must have relevant case laws or experience of what is happening in the area.  You cannot have it both ways. Names in rape cases are not published, <Col N="1214" /> but the names do appear on legal documents and are available to the people Senator Mulcahy has mentioned.  The Minister of State is trying to strike a balance. If somebody unscrupulous enough wants to find out the name of any refugee they can do so.  They can employ people to do so, such as private detectives. All this Bill can do is give reasonable protection to ensure we do not facilitate the easy publication and identification of names in the public arena.</P>

      <P>I have not come full circle. I told the House honestly I was divided on this and the Minister of State accepts there are two conflicting theories and two conflicting aims.  There should be a body of expertise.  I have no problem with the agencies being in court and hearing the cases.  For example, it is possible for the courts to change the names of the applicants on the affidavits or to take what measures they deem necessary to protect the identity of the applicants.  In the X case it was not Joanna Jones; it was Madame X; it was the X girl.  The name on the proceedings should be blotted out so that the identity of the person could not be known.  I am being totally consistent. Senator Neville has a bit of a nerve to say I have come full circle when I have openly and honestly said I was divided <i>vis-à-vis</i> the two competing things.</P>

      <P>I would love to continue listening to this all day.  I have sympathy with Senator Mulcahy's position. It is true he has changed his position in one way, but he did so by <Col N="1215" /> accepting the general thrust of the need to protect identity.  Within the terms of reference of the section, he is pointing to an inconsistency in it.  That is how I understand it.  I speak with the handicap of not knowing how the courts operate. It is a little peculiar that one has this section blocking possibilities of identity and then there is an out clause &mdash;&ldquo;does not include&rdquo; etc. &mdash; on lines 30 and 31. The analogy with rape is not a valid analogy in these circumstances.  There is no danger of rape victims or their relatives being subject to attack; maybe there is in some cases.  There can be in certain circumstances and I can see possibilities of that.  The situation we have here is a more wide ranging one. I trust the Minister of State's judgment on this.  She has thought about this deeply. Will she ponder on finding a more appropriate phraseology or on ensuring greater consistency between these lines and the general thrust of the section to try to copperfasten it further within her own terms of reference?</P>

      <P>The Bill is not an appropriate vehicle for censoring court documents. While theoretically documents in the central office are public documents, the practical situation is quite different. In cases where there are prohibitions on the publication of the identity, our courts are open.  It is open to anyone to go into a court case and for a neighbour, perhaps, to see the parties to the court case and to see them coming out of court, just as it is possible for people to sit outside the offices of the refugee agency or stand in Stephen's Green and outside the offices of the Department of Justice looking at those who come in and out and drawing certain conclusions from that.  The argument in relation to the section is to draw up a reasonable balanced framework.  I would suggest to the Senator that the section does in fact do that.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1216" /> SECTION 20.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 20 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for the prohibition of false information and alteration of identity documents. Section 20 (2) states that &ldquo;If a person, for the purposes of or in relation to an application under <i>section 8</i>, gives or makes to the Commissioner, the Appeal Board or to an authorised officer any statement or information which is to his or her knowledge false or misleading in any material particular, that person shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;.  Many people coming to a country seeking refugee status will be travelling on false documents.  We must ensure that the issue of duplicitous applications does not get intermingled with that of genuine refugees travelling on false documentation.</P>
      <P>I am worried about the wording of section 20 (2).  The normal problem encountered is that a proposed asylum seeker upon first arriving in a new country gives false information and in many cases tells lies.  According to the experts, such people are normally wary, suspicious, tired, bewildered etc.  They may have had to tell many lies to have got this far and it may take them a period of time in a new country to stop doing so and to give a full picture of their circumstances, where they come from etc. It would be a serious matter if they gave a false story to the commissioner or appeal board &mdash; one would think they would have settled down at that stage. However, I am worried about &ldquo;or to an authorised officer any statement or information which is to his or her knowledge false or misleading&rdquo;.  Although &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo; is defined in section 1 (1), I am worried it might be too wide.</P>

      <P>If the Senator reads section 20 (5) again he will see that it refers to somebody who &ldquo;sells or supplies&rdquo;. We are not aiming this provision at the applicants but at those who may be in the business of supplying forged identity documents and trading in human beings on a false basis.  Unfortunately, such trade does exist internationally and we must protect ourselves from it.  These provisions, in the context of what we know about the trade and trafficking of human beings in certain parts of the world, are important and appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section covers a tricky but important area.  The Minister <Col N="1218" /> must have a power of revocation.  I am delighted to see that in so far as the Minister might exercise that power, there is an appeal to the High Court. While this is not the place to make a policy statement, if the numbers of refugees coming to this country increase substantially over the next few years, how actively will the Minister go down the revocation route?</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) (e) refers to a person who &ldquo;can no longer, because the circumstances in connection with which he or she has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself or herself of the protection of the country of his or her nationality.&rdquo;  That envisages a case where, for example, somebody was being oppressed because of a civil war in their country and if it ended and peaceful conditions came, the Minister could then consider using her powers of revocation.  What would be the theory and practice of that in regard to our Bosnian refugees, for example?  When this Bill is passed, now that the Bosnian situation has been sorted out to a large extent by the United Nations, it could be argued that the conditions under this subsection are such that the Minister could invoke it.</P>
      <P>There does not seem to be in the Bill, and it should be in this section, a power to deport.  Section 9 gives leave to enter or remain in the State.  Would it not have been more appropriate to include in this section a specific power to the Minister to be able to deport people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to make a point about the list of circumstances where the Minister is satisfied there should be a revocation. Where one specifies a list of circumstances in which a power can be exercised, there is a rule of statutory interpretation that if other circumstances exist they are excluded.  There does not appear to be a catch-all formula for circumstances in which the Minister can use the power of revocation; perhaps there should be.  It could be argued that such a provision would be dangerous and open to abuse.  However, the safeguard is the appeal mechanism to <Col N="1219" /> the High Court.  When the Minister lists the circumstances in which he or she can act and then finds a circumstance in which he or she wants to act, the court might decide the Minister cannot act because the list has been published. These issues should be properly addressed in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bosnians arrived in Ireland as programme refugees.  I have spoken publicly to the Bosnian community and my comments were recorded by the national media.  I told the community that Bosnians who had come to Ireland as programme refugees were more than welcome to stay here. Equally, members of the community who wish to return home because the situation there has changed are free to do so.</P>
      <P>We have facilitated various members of the Bosnian community returning home to examine the situation there. This has been done under the auspices of the refugee agency.  Some of these Bosnian refugees came here because of their injuries and some were serving soldiers. Many of them would feel an intense desire to return to Bosnia. Other refugees came from areas where there appears to be no possibility of their being able to return.  The only way they can return is if they have relatives there or there is an opportunity to settle in another part of the country.  The Bosnians are welcome to stay but they are also free to return home if that is their choice.</P>
      <P>The circumstances in which a declaration would be revoked could only be expected to arise infrequently. However, situations can change.  Somebody might come to this country as a refugee and some years later the circumstances giving rise to their refugee status would no longer apply.  The section provides for such a decision, although it would be most unlikely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hungarian refugees arrived in Ireland following the Hungarian uprising.  Some of them are still living here.  The circumstances which led to them arriving here <Col N="1220" /> as refugees no longer apply but those people would, in general, no longer describe themselves as refugees.  Indeed, they would be in a position to apply for citizenship and many of them have done so, as have many of the Bosnians who have more than three years' residence in this country.</P>
    <P>A revocation is most likely to occur where the commissioner and/or the appeal board and the various Departments were seriously misled by an applicant and where an application was granted on false or spurious grounds.  I do not expect that to arise frequently. There are clauses in the Bill which provide for an appeal.  There is also the clause which allows the Minister to grant humanitarian leave to stay, even where technically refugee status might be revoked because of certain circumstances. I cannot envisage such circumstances arising frequently; it would be a very rare occurrence.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bosnian refugees, we are happy for those who arrived as programme refugees to stay.  Equally we will understand if some members of the community wish to return home in the context of the Dayton agreement.  The Senator referred to a catch-all section.  I believe it would be excessive and that is why it is not included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State must be realistic and agree that there is a distinct possibility that there will be substantial increases in the numbers of refugees coming to this country, whether they are programme refugees or otherwise.  According to the Irish Refugee Council, in 1991 there were 31 arrivals and by 1995 that figure had risen to 424.  That is a huge increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State attends EU meetings and will be aware that Germany is talking about burden sharing. Burden sharing will mean that we will have to take a proportion of the large number of refugees who arrive in the largest refugee receiving countries.  The power to revoke a declaration may have to be used to a great degree.  Hundreds of thousands of refugees arrive in Germany <Col N="1221" /> every couple of years.  If there were, God forbid, civil war in places like the former Soviet Union, India or the Middle East, it is not inconceivable that large numbers of refugees would come to Ireland.  If the circumstances giving rise to that refugee problem ceased, a Minister for Justice under this section could be under pressure to exercise the power of revocation and deportation. The Minister of State did not address the deportation issue which I suggested should have been included in this section.</P>
    <P>Under section 21 (1) (e) the Minister would have power to revoke the declarations in respect of potentially large numbers of people.  Those people would have a right of appeal to the High Court.  It is not fair to answer my query by referring to a small number of Hungarians and Bosnians and saying they are welcome to stay.  It may not always be the case that large numbers of refugees would be welcome to stay in Ireland in circumstances where the reason for their leaving their country of origin has changed.  That is the rationale of this section.  I am not commenting either way on that but I would like to have some information on it.</P>
    <P>I am also not clear about the Minister's reference to programme refugees; I am not clear if section 21 caters for them.  Programme refugees can, in their own time, apply for declaration.  They do not get a declaration automatically by virtue of a Government decision to take in a group of programme refugees. They must apply for such a declaration. Incidentally, there does not appear to be provision for a group application by programme refugees for refugee status. From the wording of the Bill, it appears that each individual member of a group would be obliged to apply for refugee status.  However, that is merely a technicality. Does section 21 apply to programme refugees?  Does a ministerial decision made under section 21 (1) (e) have the effect of reversing a Government decision in relation to programme refugees in circumstances where large <Col N="1222" /> numbers of refugees might face deportation?</P>
    <P>Section 21 (5) contains another item of concern and involves a person appealing to the High Court against a decision of the Minister to make a declaration of revocation.  The section also states that the High Court may, as it thinks proper, on the hearing of the appeal, confirm the decision of the Minister or direct the Minister to with-draw the revocation of the declaration. Not that one would wish to fetter the discretion of the High Court in any way in such circumstances, but there are no grounds listed as to the considerations the High Court should enter into when deciding whether the Minister had properly exercised discretion under section 21.  The section is completely open and contains no directions for the guidance of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Section 21 does not contain grounds upon which the High Court might act, such as the Minister acting in bad faith, without authority or capriciously.  On what basis can the High Court decide that the reason for the refusal has not been complied with?  If, for example, the Minister makes a decision under section 21 (1) (e), is it for the High Court to decide whether the circumstances in the country of origin had ceased to exist?  Is it the responsibility of the High Court to decide that the Minister had not properly considered the matter?  These points must be clarified.</P>

      <P>With regard to programme refugees, seeking a specific provision to deal with the revocation of any declaration regarding such refugees seems to defeat the Senator's purpose. By definition, these refugees enter the country with the Government's permission. In legal terms, this represents the granting of a licence which can be revoked at any time.  This is made clear by the provisions in section 24.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any appeal to the High Court would be on the basis of general administrative law.  The judge would be obliged to consider whether the Minister acted within his or her power and whether their <Col N="1223" /> decision complied with natural justice. Such matters are not for this House to decide, they are the responsibility of the High Court.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the revocation of a declaration that a person is a refugee and has been for some time.  As with other sections of the Bill, careful checks and balances are being drawn to protect the asylum seeker &mdash; the person being granted refugee status.  Equally, it offers a mechanism for the State to protect itself where the process has been abused.  I believe this is an appropriate provision.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Mulcahy's point relating to the High Court, I could not presume with regard to that court's decisions on particular cases.  The Senator referred to his frequent contacts with the various NGOs which are expert in this area.  I understand that these organisations and the UNHCR are satisfied with this section.  I have not encountered the concerns expressed by the Senator on previous occasions.</P>
      <P>Earlier I specifically replied to Senator Mulcahy's concerns about programme refugees, who are not the subject of this section but of section 24.  I am anxious to reassure the Bosnian community at all times as to their position in this country.  I have been glad to put such reassurances on public record, even though they do not come under section 21.  Perhaps I should have waited for our deliberations on section 24 in that regard.</P>

      <P>This is very important because the Minister of State stated that section 21 will not apply to programme refugees.  It is for this reason that I am <Col N="1225" /> questioning the provisions of the section.  Should not programme refugees come within the ambit of section 21 in terms of revocation?  I am not straying from the point when I state that section 21 gives the Minister the power to decide that the circumstances for granting refugee status no longer exist in the country of origin.  The Minister can, therefore, revoke the declaration.  The Minister cannot contradict this point because it is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>A &ldquo;programme refugee&rdquo; is not a recipient of such a declaration. A &ldquo;programme refugee&rdquo; enters the State by way of an order of the Government. This is arrived at following arrangements with the UNHCR which suggested that, in the event of civil war, strife or disturbance in a particular country, we should share the burden by accepting refugees who flee that country. I cannot see why the section should apply to the programme refugees. However, if the Senator's fear relates to somebody being deported from this country, Senators welcomed the earlier section in the Bill which prevented refoulement or deportation, except where people were given rights of access to the courts and so on.</P>
      <P>Section 21 deals with recipients of a declaration of refugee status which, under the seven or eight conditions laid out in the section, may be revoked.  I have said that is extremely unlikely and has not been used in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inappropriate to bring programme refugees into this section.  We can have a debate on programme refugees under section 24.  The Senator raised specifically the question of the Bosnian community in this country. I was anxious to put on record my public comments that that community and others are welcome to stay but we understand they might wish to go.  I simply wanted to offer reassurance on that point, but perhaps I should have left it <Col N="1226" /> to section 24.  I was worried that false concerns might be raised for that community, despite my public remarks.  I welcomed the opportunity to put those remarks on the record.  Section 21 deals with people who have got a declaration of refugee status under this Bill &mdash; in other words, individual asylum seekers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not satisfy me.  The Minister is being given wide ranging and sweeping powers under this section to annul a person's refugee status.  That does not apply in this section to programme refugees.  In other words, in so far as this is the section dealing with revocation, the checks and balances and appeals to the High Court will not be available to programme refugees. That is a form of discrimination. An individual refugee who gets a declaration of refugee status under this section may &mdash; not &ldquo;will&rdquo;&mdash; find themselves being sent back.  The Minister of State seems to have a better crystal ball than I.  Perhaps, she could tell us her thinking on burden sharing and the reality of Ireland taking refugees in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to this before and I thought I had made it clear. The distinction between programme refugees and asylum seekers is obviously not clear to Senator Mulcahy. Programme refugees, as defined in section 24, are those who are allowed to enter our country on the licence of the <Col N="1227" /> Government.  It is not a grant to an individual asylum seeker and, therefore, cannot be revoked.  This section deals with the revocation of the declaration of asylum status to an individual.  What has not been granted cannot be revoked. We should leave it at that.  Programme refugees are here on the licence of the Government.  That is clear and we have no difficulty with it.</P>

      <P>To discriminate between the balls of Senator Mulcahy and those of the Minister of State, crystal or otherwise, is beyond my intellectual powers. This is a very simple matter as I understand it, but perhaps I am just too simple-minded. Senator Gallagher has confirmed that programme refugees are not subject to the form of revocation envisaged in this section.  If they are not subject to this form of revocation, there is no question of them being in a position to require the machinery for an appeal. That seems reasonably simple to me; in fact, it is so simple that even I can understand it.</P>

      <P>We were talking about the Bosnians.  There were newspaper reports of men who escaped from Zepa and Srebrenica and who hid in caves in the area for the winter.  When they appeared they were very quickly given back by the IFOR forces to the Serbs. Could the Department &mdash; this will give the Minister of State something else to think about this evening &mdash; make representations regarding those men?  The Dayton agreement allows for 72 hours to elapse before people have to be given back.  These people seem to been returned to the Serbs with great haste, having escaped for a whole winter in the mountains.  It is very sad to see this happening. Knowing the great concern which the Tánaiste and the Minister of State have expressed regarding this matter over the last few months, I would be <Col N="1228" /> most grateful if she could inform me of the present situation.</P>

      <P>Section 21 lays down very strict guidelines for the Minister in the area of revocation of a declaration. They are not sweeping powers; they are controlled with very strict procedures. There are strict guidelines on revocation, there are strict procedures under subsection (3) and there is recourse to the High Court under subsection (5) if they are not satisfied.  These very strict guidelines and procedures ensure the Minister does not have sweeping powers Senator Mulcahy claimed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Two months ago I said in the House that BSE was the biggest crisis to have confronted the agricultural industry in Ireland since the Economic War and that it must be dealt with effectively and efficiently.  At the time it was suggested that I was overreacting. However, nothing has happened since to make me change my mind.  I am still convinced that our biggest and most important industry is in crisis and that the livelihood of many thousands of farm families, workers in the meat plants and suppliers to farming is at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day after the House of Commons statement that precipitated the BSE crisis, Seanad Éireann was treated to a <Col N="1230" /> rare gem of ministerial understatement when it was stated: &ldquo;The latest controversy is expected to cause difficulties for beef consumption in Britain&rdquo;.  It was also stated that the House of Commons announcement had &ldquo;generated a great deal of interest and a certain level of concern&rdquo;.  We were told that Bord Bia was &ldquo;formulating a strategy to counteract any negative impact on Irish beef&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is clear from these statements that the response of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry was complacent and predicated on the not uncommon attitude that the best approach to any crisis or abuse in the beef industry is to say nothing in the pious belief that the national interest is best served by ignoring reality.  The reality now is that total Irish livestock disposals are down by more than 100,000 head on this time last year. Across mainland Europe livestock numbers are building up and beef consumption has fallen by 30 to 40 per cent, with little signs of a recovery.  Important third country markets are closed to Irish beef and livestock and 90,000 tonnes of European beef have been taken into intervention.  Unless the Government and the EU can come to grips with this crisis and deal with it effectively, we face the real prospect of a total breakdown in our cattle trade when winter fatteners refuse to or, more probably, are unable to buy in cattle next autumn for finishing.</P>
    <P>These are the people who have borne the brunt of this catastrophe.  They already faced heavy losses even before the BSE crisis.  At factory prices down to 90p per lb. at present they have suffered losses of £150 to £200 per head. Even the whole of the EU Commission's £60 million proposed compensation package would scarcely make up their losses.  The £8 million &ldquo;fleximoney&rdquo; left over after allocations to special beef premiums and suckler premiums is no more than a nod in their direction and, as ever, heifer producers do not appear to exist at all as far as the EU is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> All of the compensation package should go to those who have been most severely hit &mdash; the winter fatteners &mdash; and the Minister must also secure a permanent increase in the ten month and 22 month suckler premiums.</P>
    <P>What will happen when those who were unable to pay off stocking loans and borrowings go back to the banks to restock next autumn?  This is a problem which demands the Minister's attention now.  The whole beef sector is now riven with uncertainty.  Farmers have no idea whether or not there will be an outlet for their animals or what kind of prices they will command.  They do not know if they will have a future in the cattle business, to say nothing of production being profitable.  The Minister has a responsibility to restore producer confidence as well as consumer confidence. Stability must be restored so that investment decisions can be made.</P>
    <P>When the Progressive Democrats were in Government the Oireachtas was recalled during the summer recess to give emergency consent to parts of the Companies Bill so as to ensure that the Goodman controlled plants could avail of examinership.  The legislation was introduced by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Desmond O'Malley, who could not be described as a fan of Mr. Goodman, to make sure that adequate slaughtering capacity would be available for the autumn glut of fat cattle.  In this much greater emergency similar decisive and effective measures are needed to restore confidence and stability to the entire livestock industry.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question in the Dáil last Thursday, 23 May 1996, the Minister said that effective market support measures had been put in place at EU level to overcome what at least he had now come to describe as a &ldquo;serious crisis&rdquo;.  If these measures are so &ldquo;effective&rdquo;, why is it that factory quotations for fat cattle have been sliding down to the 90p a pound level I have already described compared to the 105p a <Col N="1232" /> pound quotes which were being offered at the beginning of the winter?</P>
    <P>Now that the renderers have resolved their differences with the meat factories, which own them in many cases, does the Minister expect that the 4p a pound the dispute had allegedly cost will be restored by the factories?  What studies have been carried out on alternative safe methods of disposing of offal? Research could do much to help solve some of these problems and to provide the scientific answers to the causes and spread of BSE and to provide reassurance for consumers.  The BSE crisis has removed any lingering doubts about the supremacy of the consumer and that the consumer's demands, even if based on nothing more than perception and hearsay, must be met.</P>
    <P>To those accustomed to the culture of beef intervention it has taken some time for this reality to sink in, and it is a pity that the lesson has been such a painful one.  Unfortunately, our clean green image, of which we boast, and the assured safety of Irish beef count for nothing unless we can convince consumers at home and abroad that Irish beef is safe and good.  That is why Bord Bia must be given every support and encouragement to effectively market Irish beef.  Has Bord Bia been given the resources required to carry out this essential task?  Can the Minister specify the initiatives that have been taken by Bord Bia since the crisis began?  The radio advertisements were good; but were they just a case of another short-term response to create an illusion of ministerial activity rather than part of a coherent and meaningful sustained strategy to restore consumer confidence in Irish beef?</P>
    <P>I believe, as I am sure the Minister believes, that Irish beef is safe and nutritious; but our belief is irrelevant unless the consumer believes that too. We have got to the point where every crackpot can get air time and newspaper coverage for unfounded statements on the safety of food.  Surely, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry can find some experts of established <Col N="1233" /> scientific standing from the long litany of expensive consultants which it employs who can rebut extravagant claims?</P>
    <P>Given the huge drop in European consumption and the probability that it may be impossible to recover consumption fully, there is a strong case to be made for a European funded campaign throughout the EU to promote beef.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has finally recognised the need to have direct consumer representation on Bord Bia.  I moved an amendment to this effect on behalf of the Progressive Democrats when the Bord Bia Bill, 1994, was being enacted by Seanad Éireann.  Unfortunately, there was very little support for the idea at the time, and it is good to see that parties who then would not support the amendment have now been converted.</P>
    <P>As part of the overall research effort required to counter the crisis, there is a need for good up to date market information. We should have details of how Irish exports to Britain and continental markets have fared since the outbreak of the BSE crisis, and we should know by how much sales to our main European markets have fallen.  If we are to target markets effectively, this type of information is essential.</P>
    <P>Third countries account for half our beef and cattle exports.  If Ministers could travel around the world for St. Patrick's Day parades, it should have been possible for them to get their passports to defend a vital national interest and to fly to countries which had closed their markets to us.  Sending the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture Food and Forestry to the Middle East was a step in the right direction, but it was not enough.  Iran and Libya remain closed, and these markets alone are worth a combined total of between £140 million and £150 million a year to Ireland.  Only personal intervention at the very highest level will ensure that these markets are reopened.  On two occasions the Tánaiste indicated he would go to the region.  Instead, we have <Col N="1234" /> seen him travel on behalf of the Troika to South America and other places.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday Minister Yates stated in the Dáil that he proposed &ldquo;to visit Libya as soon as the necessary arrangements can be put in place.&rdquo;  What are the necessary arrangements?  I share his &ldquo;disappointment&rdquo; that the visit has not taken place.  He said it was important to ensure that the timing and circumstances were right.  What does this mean?  The right time for him to go was when the market was closed and large chunks of it lost to Australia.  Given the unprecedented number of Ministers in this Government, surely it should have been possible to find somebody to travel on Ireland's behalf.</P>
    <P>The arrival of an Iranian veterinary delegation in Ireland is welcome, but it seems this is going about things the wrong way round.  We should pay our Arab markets and customers the compliment of visiting them in their environment and of sending people of stature.</P>
    <P>The dominant priorities for the Minister must be, first, to provide adequate compensation for the producers who have lost most heavily from the BSE scare and, second, the reopening of Ireland's third country markets.  Consumers must also be reassured, and if that means maintaining a ban on British exports, that is what must be done irrespective of table thumping by the British.</P>
    <P>The magnitude of the BSE crisis is such that it has the potential to impact significantly on our prospects for economic growth.  The economic welfare of much more than farmers and beef factory workers is at stake.  That is why I call on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry this evening to produce a decisive and coherent strategy at home, within the EU and on third country markets to ensure Irish beef and cattle can continue to make the contribution to national welfare that has been so significant up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and second the motion.  There is a crisis of confidence <Col N="1235" /> among consumers about the safety of beef products and the implications for the Irish beef industry are huge unless there is a concerted campaign to counteract this.  Our present arrangements for the policing of our food industry do not inspire confidence.  The weekend press reported that there had been a collapse in the enforcement of food and hygiene regulations.  As a result, we do not apparently know if British beef is being imported into this country and sold to unsuspecting consumers.</P>
      <P>At a time when consumers right across Europe are only too well aware of the unsavoury reputation of British beef, it is remarkable that our much vaunted controls appear to be breaking down.  We have no coherent system for quality assurance in the food industry. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, through its veterinary inspectorate, has responsibility for ensuring quality control in the processing plants, a task it has discharged none too well in recent years.  The eight health boards, through their environmental health officers, are responsible for food quality and food hygiene at retail level in shops, restaurants and mobile stalls.  These two separate bureaucracies are engaged in very similar work but do not seem to have any linkages between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, due to an industrial dispute, there are serious problems in the implementation of the food hygiene regulations at retail level at present.  A spokesperson for the Eastern Health Board, quoted in <i>The Sunday Independent</i> of 26 May 1996, gave a worrying description of the way in which the regulations are currently being enforced.  The spokesperson outlined a situation in which there were up to 100 unlicensed food vans and stalls operating around the country, there was an unspecified number of other unsupervised outlets selling food and, in relation to BSE, beef and beef related products were no longer being sampled or checked.  Effectively, the public servants responsible for enforcing the basic <Col N="1236" /> hygiene regulations have been refusing to do so since the start of the year.  It is difficult in the circumstances to take seriously our commitment to quality assurance in the food sector.</P>
    <P>Quality assurance and customer assurance are the key to success for the Irish beef industry.  As long as market confidence can be maintained in the Irish product all doors will be open to it.  Unfortunately, the BSE crisis has highlighted once again our failings in this area.  We express great pride in the clean and green image which our beef enjoys, or which we think it enjoys, but this favourable image is useless and will rapidly disappear without proper verification standards.  We have an advantage but we are throwing it away because of our inability to convince international consumers of how good and safe is our product.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is the organisation responsible for policing the beef industry and it is fair to say its record in this area has left a lot to be desired.  Two months ago, at the time the BSE story was first breaking, there was the disturbing revelation that a senior veterinary officer in the Department was facing criminal proceedings over irregularities regarding the sale of Irish cattle tags and health certificates to cover British cattle. This was hardly likely to inspire confidence in our official control procedures. There have been several other instances in recent years which have cast the Department in an equally unfavourable light in its handling of the beef industry.</P>
    <P>It is time we looked at putting new arrangements in place for the policing of food production and the food processing industry which is of such vital national importance.  We must be able to show that our food industry is being properly and vigilantly policed.  We must ensure Ireland's reputation as a producer of natural and wholesome high quality meat is protected and verified. The Department too often sees itself as an agent of the producer and to a lesser extent, the processor.  We need more independence, transparency and <Col N="1237" /> credibility if our policing arrangements are to be taken seriously internationally. If our food inspection system commands international respect, our food exporters, including our beef exporters, will benefit in terms of increased sales. In the free market, post-intervention era, producers and processors must recognise that unless they are seen to put the interests of the consumer first their industry has no long-term future.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, in the interest of all those involved in the beef industry, including producers and processors, that a new system is put in place.  We need to create a single food inspectorate to handle all aspects of quality assurance and hygiene in the food processing industry.  This would be an independent executive agency combining the functions of the Department's veterinary inspectorate and the environmental health service of the health boards.  Producers and processors could be represented on the board of such an agency, but so also would people from the retail trade and consumer interests. If the consumer really is king in a market economy that should be reflected in the composition of the board of our national food inspection agency.</P>
    <P>This option need not involve any appreciable additional cost to the Exchequer but rather the deployment of existing resources in a more efficient and effective manner.  The new agency should be not just independent of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry but be seen to be so.  To this end, it should report to the Minister for Health or the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>The new agency would ensure that consumers at home were adequately protected.  It would also give assurance to foreign buyers in terms of quality, hygiene and product traceability, thereby ensuring that our food exporters enjoy a good reputation on foreign markets.  This will be all the more important as we move inexorably towards an era of free international trade in food products.  As we move into the next millennium the future of our <Col N="1238" /> beef export trade lies in supplying high value products to retail chains in Britain and continental Europe.  This is a demanding, quality conscious, commercial market, far different to the heavily subsidised third country markets which currently absorb half our beef and cattle exports.  We cannot hope to make major progress in commercial European markets unless we can demonstrate that we have reliable and dependable systems in place for ensuring the quality of our food products.  Otherwise British and continental consumers will not want to buy what we produce.</P>
    <P>We are the only European country sharing a land frontier with the United Kingdom and we have devoted considerable resources to sealing that Border to prevent the importaton of cattle and beef from Britain.  However, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry or his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, should clarify the position with regard to beef by-products, such as tallow and gelatin. The latter is a key ingredient in literally hundreds of confectionery products and other processed foods and in the Irish context most of these items are imported from Britain.  Sweets and biscuits containing British gelatin appear to be freely available on the Irish market, as I am sure the Government is aware.  Has there been any formal decision by the Irish authorities to ban these food products? Has that decision been rescinded? Perhaps the Minister could clarify the position on this important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the approach taken by Senator Dardis and Senator Honan to this debate because a great deal of negative talking and thinking has taken place since this issue arose.  The problems associated with BSE in Britain must not be permitted to drag the Irish international beef trade down with it, because that trade is essential to our economy and ensures a constant supply of highly nutritious food to consumers.  The present crisis highlights the vital need to differentiate <Col N="1239" /> between Irish and British beef. This must be done in a sustained and intelligent way.</P>
      <P>It never ceases to amaze me that those countries substantially involved in the beef trade &mdash; Ireland, the UK, countries of North and South America, Australia and New Zealand &mdash; do not join together to promote the virtue of red meat.  The proposer of the motion asked for more publicity and for greater efforts at EU level but that is inadequate. I suggest that the Minister ensure that the EU gets together with the other beef producing countries to influence the consumer, who is the decision maker as far as the beef industry is concerned.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of iron in red meat and, as we all know, problems related to iron deficiency are encountered worldwide, particularly among women and children. Therefore it makes sense for beef producing and exporting nations to join together to highlight not only the safety but the health enhancing properties of red meat, and beef in particular.</P>
      <P>This is also a good time to promote the concept of the island of Ireland for the food industry, especially the meat sector.  I have every sympathy for our fellow farmers in Northern Ireland who deserve to share in the image of our island as a source of quality healthy food.  Cattle do not carry political tags and out of the present crisis we must develop a positive programme which will see the meat and livestock sectors in all parts of Ireland benefiting in the future when the present excitement and negative publicity have passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from the application of EU control measures to the UK and not to Ireland that our situations are not comparable &mdash; this is recognised by the European Commission and other member states.  The UK has had over 160,000 BSE cases in a cattle population of 12 million; Ireland has had a mere 127 cases from a cattle population of 7 million and given the size of our national herd these are sporadic and isolated cases.  The first was confirmed in January <Col N="1240" /> 1989; 11 cases were animals imported from the UK and one was imported from mainland Europe. Investigations into other cases suggest a possible link with meat and bone meal imported from the UK.  Such imports, which took place only on a minuscule scale, were banned immediately, and rightly so.  The age of the cows affected ranged from four to eight years old.</P>
    <P>Beef cattle production in Ireland is based almost exclusively on a plentiful supply of grass and silage or hay with minimum use of manufactured feed. The feeding of meat and bone meal to animals has been prohibited, again rightly so.  Nonetheless we have taken stringent precautionary measures to restrict the small number of herds in which a case of BSE has occurred. The implementation of these measures has been facilitated by the cattle identity system and the arrangements already outlined to control our present disease status.</P>
    <P>The precautionary measures taken to isolate and eliminate the few BSE cases which have occurred include the following: the disease is notifiable under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1996; the entire herd in which BSE occurs is destroyed under official supervision and is thereby excluded from the food chain; and all local officials, veterinary staff and veterinary practitioners have been instructed as to control measures which should be taken when BSE is suspected.</P>
    <P>The importation of meat and bone meal from the UK has been banned. Prior to this ban a licensing system operated with minimal imports.  The importation of cattle, beef and beef products from the UK is prohibited in line with EU legislation and the ban is enforced rigorously.  The use of meat and bone meal in animal feedstuffs has been formally banned by ministerial order.  This has been the main source of BSE infection; I understand that 50 per cent of the cases can be attributed to the feeding of meat and bone meal.</P>
    <P>Export plants and approved ports are subject to stringent veterinary control. Post-mortem inspections are carried out <Col N="1241" /> by official veterinarians at slaughter-houses to eliminate the possibility of suspected BSE animals getting into the food chain.  The progeny of some affected cows have been purchased and are kept for research purposes at the Department's veterinary research laboratory where they are held in isolation from other animals.</P>
    <P>On the basis of these stringent control measures we can certify that beef and cattle exports from Ireland are derived from animals which have not presented suspected or confirmed signs of BSE and that the animals come from herds in which BSE has not been detected. The beef comes from animals which are slaughtered in approved premises under the permanent veterinary supervision of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. Each animal is examined live for signs of disease and the carcase and offal are subject to post-mortem examination by an official veterinarian. All exports of beef are accompanied by a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian certifying the whole-someness of the meat being exported.</P>
    <P>All live cattle exports are subject to a detailed examination by an official veterinarian at the port of dispatch.  This involves a clinical examination and a check on the identity of each animal by examining the official ear tag and card. Following inspection, a health certificate and a fitness to travel certificate are issued by the official veterinarian.</P>
    <P>These essential measures have been put into operation.  We have had a good deal of bad publicity and we should call on the UK to try to relax the situation. The UK Government is now trying to disrupt the business of the EU which does nothing but highlight its negative position.</P>
    <P>The consumer is the controlling factor.  Unless we can convince the consumers beef is safe they will not buy it. The Government must act quickly to counteract the bad publicity.  I urge the Minister to join the other beef producing countries and to promote the virtue of red meat.  Beef sales in America, Germany and France have fallen by 50 per <Col N="1242" /> cent.  That trend must be reversed if there is to be any future in the long term for beef producers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Dardis for proposing this motion.  The issue requires urgent attention.  Senator D'Arcy referred to the Government taking action on a world scale but it should concentrate on the home industry. I am glad Senator Dardis outlined the inactivity of the Government in ensuring the safety of our beef markets. I am pleased Senator D'Arcy agreed the Minister has not done enough.  The Minister's failure to go to Libya last week coincided with the loss of a contract for 140,000 head of cattle.</P>
      <P>The compensation package on offer from the EU will not help the Irish farmers worst affected. The Minister has admitted as much but no remedial action has yet been taken.  The 6,000 workers in the beef industry are becoming increasingly anxious about their future.  The Government blamed the last month's rise in unemployment on the problems in the beef industry. The job crisis in the beef factories is now in danger of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy brought about by the Minister's declaration that 3 million cattle will have to be slaughtered.</P>
      <P>Confidence in the beef sector is very low and there is mounting anger at the Government's approach to the largest industry in the country.  The Government must get the message that it must act now.  As Senator Dardis said, the Minister should have visited other countries. The Fianna Fail spokesman on agriculture, Deputy Cowen, visited Iran accompanied by two Fianna Fáil Deputies to assure the Iranian Government that Irish beef is safe.  The Government should follow their lead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems in the cattle and beef trade could have repercussions in other sectors.  This is an indication of the long standing need for a national food plan. I support Senator Honan's reference to the creation of an agency independent of the Department. The reform of the CAP and GATT have led to less access <Col N="1243" /> to intervention, lower volumes of product eligible for export refunds and lower rates of export refunds.  These factors meant increased products with lower assistance towards disposal.  In addition, countries such as Australia began to get a foothold in traditional markets for Irish cattle.</P>
    <P>The BSE scare caused a sharp downturn in consumption.  The twin problems of increased production and decreased consumption have led to a market crisis which has the appearance of being long term.  The loss suffered from the crisis will be all the worse if Ireland does not put in place practices to regain consumer confidence.  The downturn in beef consumption is due to the BSE scare and the consequent image of our beef being unsafe.  However, that image can be corrected over time.</P>
    <P>There is a real danger the European beef industry will suffer permanent damage unless concerted action is taken. However, it would be wrong for Ireland to wait for a European programme of action. Ireland should take the initiative and establish its own programme while at the same time pushing for a European programme of action.</P>
    <P>It is likely that recovery will mean that trade in beef will be at prices far lower than experienced in recent years. The main factors in determining levels of profitability will be volume sold and efficiency of operations.  The volume sold will depend largely on consumer confidence.  Hence, the absolute necessity to tackle that aspect immediately. The longer the delay the more permanent the damage and the longer it will take to rectify it.</P>
    <P>The guarantee of safety is the most essential element in restoring consumer confidence.  Consumers must be provided with cast iron assurances of the absence of undesirable practices and substances in every step of the food chain.  Assurances are useless unless backed by independent certification and that is where the agency Senator Honan mentioned would operate.  The Irish food industry should establish an <Col N="1244" /> inspectorate to certify all aspects of production, processing and storage.  The standards to be certified should be agreed between the producers, processors and consumer representatives. Thus the standards could be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure the highest standards of excellence.</P>
    <P>In the dairy industry the producers and the processors co-operated in a programme to ensure quality. They worked together to produce quality products; if producers used illegal substances, such as antibiotics, they were fined and a higher price was paid for premium milk. The dairy products can also be traced. One can buy butter or milk in a shop knowing its origin.  Such a system should be introduced in the beef industry to ensure the product will have the image it deserves.  Even the best food in the world needs promotion.</P>
    <P>Use should also be made of the standards applied which should always be higher than those of the EU and other competing countries.  Our island and green status should be portrayed as a unique advantage.  The protection of the environment in a manner which ensures that no pollutant enters any aspect of the food chain is vital in the portrayal of the green image of our food.  Promotion of food and tourism should be complementary.  The best possible environment is an essential ingredient for both industries and, accordingly, joint packages should be arranged.</P>
    <P>National events which attract and receive international media coverage including, the All-Ireland Hurling Final, in which Limerick will compete this year, the All-Ireland Football Final, the Five Nations Rugby Championship, the Eurovision Song Contest, which will be staged in Limerick, horse racing, etc., should be used to promote the image of the country as the world best food producing island.  There are various ways in which the tourism and the food industries can complement each other.  A national plan must be implemented to ensure that beef is produced and promoted in such a way as to restore consumer <Col N="1245" /> confidence here and throughout the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak about the problems facing the beef industry because of the BSE scare and other factors. At the weekend I met farmers who were disgusted at the carry on in the Dáil last week when the beef industry, which is worth about £1.7 billion per year, is in crisis.  Some Members of the Dáil seem to be more concerned about a mistake in relation to sending a republican prisoner to Northern Ireland.  The farmers to whom I spoke thought the priorities of Dáil Members were wrong and that they should be discussing the crisis in the beef industry.</P>
      <P>The problems in the beef industry started when the GATT agreement was concluded in 1993 and when the CAP was reformed. Under that agreement the volume of subsidised beef exports from the EU was reduced by 21 per cent while, at the same time, subsidies were to be reduced by 36 per cent over the period from July 1995 to the year 2,000. At the same time the GATT restrictions came into play, the CAP was reformed to dovetail into the new situation and a system of direct payments was introduced for farmers.  A subsidy of approximately £200 per steer is now available and area aid stands at well over £100 per acre of barley, etc.  The thinking behind this appears to be quite sound in that more beef could be produced at a price which the consumer could afford to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of a number of factors outside the control of farmers and the Government, things did not work out according to plan, that is, the price of feed inputs remained very high as did the price of suckler calves and stores. GATT came into play and the EU Commission cut beef export refunds by 12p per pound and £8.50 per hundred-weight live weight.  It is clear from that that winter fatteners had the worst of both worlds.  This action took place at the worst possible time for the fatteners; <Col N="1246" /> it appeared it was designed to put them out of business.</P>
    <P>When the announcement on BSE was made in the UK on 20 March beef markets collapsed in the EU as a whole leaving winter finishers high and dry. According to Teagasc figures, farmers lost £71 per head on sales between January and mid-March and a loss of £138 per head is expected on sales between mid-March and June.  Producers of factory type young bulls and heifers are also losing heavily.</P>
    <P>The IFA's request that winter finishers should be compensated for the loss they suffered through no fault of their own is valid.  While I know there is no mechanism to help the producers of factory type young bulls and heifers, they too should be compensated because they were caught in a situation which was beyond their control and not of their making.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at the IFA's proposals on the deseasonalisation premium. As a result of the BSE crisis there was a significant fall off in steer slaughterings at the beef export plants from 25 March.  The EU deseasonalisation premium was reduced from £60 per head to £45 per head on 15 April and reduced further to £30 per head on 29 April.  In view of the fact that animals could not be sold because of the BSE crisis, the IFA demands that a full level deseasonalisation premium of £60 per head be paid on all eligible steers slaughtered up to 9 June.  The IFA claims this proposal is budget neutral for the EU Commission and it is something worth following up.  It should not be forgotten that because we export 70 per cent of our steer beef to world markets, Irish cattle prices are more sensitive to cuts in export refunds than those in any other EU member state.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the consequences of GATT, the BSE scare and the way the beef industry is handled, it is not hard to see we have a real crisis on our hands which will not be resolved until consumer confidence in the industry is restored.  In that context, we should look at the way the farmer co-operatives <Col N="1247" /> looked after and managed the dairy industry in the interests of farmers, consumers and the country.  They deserve great credit.  Thank God they rather than other people were in charge.  The dairy industry diversified, raised standards and cut out bad practices.  When people buy a dairy product they can be confident they are buying a good one.  I am afraid the beef industry did the opposite.</P>
    <P>We should do everything possible to restore confidence in the beef industry. While there are disadvantages in the industry, there are also many advantages in that we produce beef mostly from grass and cereals.  We should decide to have a good beef industry and spare no expense in pursuing that objective. We should also make a decision on meat and bone meal.  We should burn it and use the ash.  Perhaps we should explore ways of using meat and bone meal in the ESB power station under construction.  It is in the interests of farmers, consumers, factory workers and the nation that no effort is spared to put the beef industry back on the rails.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the beef industry.  When I spoke about the industry on a previous occasion I raised a number of issues which I would like to tie into this debate on BSE.  This morning we had a discussion with representatives from the Norwegian Parliament.  In response to a question I put about why Norway did not feel ready to join the EU, they said that their agriculture and fishing industries would suffer if they were part of the EU.  I do not subscribe to that view but it is interesting that they should hold such a view.  An issue which we need to address is how our industry is surviving in the EU and under pressures like the BSE scare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the motion.  The industry needs much support at this time, but the type of support it has received to date is wrong.  Other Members will not accept it, but the export subsidy, which is not available to Norwegian farmers, is playing <Col N="1248" /> a part in destroying the Irish industry. I will develop this point because people representing farming interests disagree.  I am not farmer bashing; the agri industry deserves all the support it receives.</P>
    <P>A farmer who buys cattle in the spring or summer to fatten them and sell them after the new year and who depends for part of his profit on the export subsidy is being ripped off from the day he buys the cattle.  The farmer is only interested in the margin between the buying price, the cost of fattening the animals and the selling price.  People recognise the export subsidy will be available to the farmer when it comes to selling the animals and therefore it is discounted when the animals are bought.</P>
    <P>A long-term approach to getting rid of the export subsidy would be in the best interests of farmers because they would buy cattle cheaper and, on a proportionate and percentage basis, their margin, based on a lower buying price, would in effect give them a larger profit and also greater flexibility.  I do not expect great support for this viewpoint but it should be suggested and considered. Farmers have been misled on this issue and it should be seriously examined.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful that the agriculture community has been bombarded by incorrect and inaccurate media reports based on unsubstantiated and supposedly academic views on BSE.  There was another example of this last night when a supposedly learned professor said that the land on which BSE infected cattle grazed should not be used for a certain number of years.  This type of nonsense should be knocked straight on the head. It creates a scare among people buying beef and the rug should be pulled from under it.</P>
    <P>The farming community needs support at this time more than it has ever needed it in the past.  This involves giving the public confidence.  The odds against beef, including UK beef, being unsafe should be made clear to people. The idea that it is unsafe is extraordinary. <Col N="1249" /> I was in Belfast recently and I ordered a steak.  The man serving me in the restaurant said I was the first southerner to order a steak there in the last three months.  I had not thought of BSE when I ordered the steak &mdash; I was not making an issue of it either way &mdash; but this demonstrates the impact of the current problem.</P>
    <P>It is also important that Irish people understand the level of risk or non risk posed by UK beef.  It is too parochial, and it will rebound on us in the future, to view this matter just as an Irish problem. It must be looked at from the Irish, UK and European points of view.  We must support the Irish beef industry at this time and the way to do this is to explain to people that our beef is safe. This should be done in the most public way possible.</P>
    <P>This is a highly political issue and there is a tendency on this side of the House for speakers to blame Ministers, Governments and Taoisigh for not travelling the world and selling the message. However, from an independent stance, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has gone out of his way to try to sell the viewpoint of the Irish farmer in the Middle East, Near East and Europe.  He has held a firm line and I compliment the Department on the line it has taken at veterinary meetings at European level.  It has tried to give some element of understanding of the UK point of view, which is important in a variety of ways.  It is too easy at this stage to take a Brit. bashing approach and bury the UK industry.  Its position also needs to be understood.</P>
    <P>It would be worthwhile if the Minister made clear in his response the reaction of the IFA to a previous Government's decision that the whole herd should be slaughtered if a BSE case was discovered. The farming community should be reminded that it did not enthusiastically support the progressive and visionary position taken by the Government at that time.</P>
    <P>I wish to link this matter to other aspects of the food chain.  I raised this <Col N="1250" /> matter earlier today and I will refer to it when the House is discussing the An Bord Bia Bill.  The issue of consumer confidence, which is what this matter is all about, is huge.  There have been a number of occasions over the last three weeks when this aspect should have been carefully considered.  There was a debate in the past two weeks about the danger or non risk of salt in the food chain.  However, much of the evidence is presented by people with a vested interest in the food processing industry.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether salt is dangerous; I just know what I read.  However, as a consumer I should be told the truth and I should be in a position to insist that I hear it from the Department and the Minister.  The same point applies to the current debate on baby food and whether certain brands are dangerous in terms of their ingredients and their reactions. The Department should look beyond BSE and consider consumers' confidence in the food they are eating. It is a wider issue and we should insist that the British authorities divulge all the available information to the Department so the Minister can make it clear to consumers what is safe and unsafe.</P>
    <P>I support the motion and I congratulate Senator Dardis for tabling it. People might not agree with all my points, but the industry needs support at this time.  It is in all our interests, whether from trade union, consumer or agriculture points of view, to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I congratulate the Progressive Democrats' for tabling the motion.  It is important the House has an opportunity to discuss the matter.  The Leader of the House said the Government intended providing time for a debate, but we must thank the Progressive Democrats for ensuring the discussion took place at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt the current crisis is one of the worst to hit the agricultural community in many decades.  It is also one of the worst to hit the economy and it will have serious implications in that regard.  We must do everything to <Col N="1251" /> ensure the situation is improved.  The crisis must not be allowed to destroy the beef industry, the livelihoods of many farmers and a vital part of the economy.</P>
    <P>Britain's over reaction to the situation has caused a problem which is totally out of proportion to the true position and the severity of the crisis.  We must endeavour to do everything possible to counteract this aspect, but one of the difficulties in this regard is the movement in Europe towards the consumption of beef produced in their own countries. It is difficult for another country to secure a footing in that market but we must try to identify Irish beef as prime quality meat which is disease free, produced in a natural environment under strict control systems and subject to strict monitoring throughout the process and identifiable back to the producer.</P>
    <P>We must ensure our marketing is aimed in this direction.  In the past Irish beef was badly marketed. Throughout the decades individual producers did not ensure added value was applied to beef or that there was a shelf rather than an interim product.  Too much of our beef went out on carcass and was not often identified as Irish beef when being processed further.  We failed over the years to create a strong image of the quality of our beef.  It must be important that we do everything in our power to do so.  I would support Senator Dardis in his statement that all beef exporting agents must ensure that they are part of it, that there is a co-ordination.  We must recognise that negative publicity will continue for some time and it is going to be difficult as a small nation to counteract it.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator D'Arcy that all exporting countries throughout the world must get together, because it is a world-wide problem and we must bring back support.  I talk to people.  They are concerned, even though we have regained up to 90 per cent of our market in Ireland.  They still discuss, and have <Col N="1252" /> fears about, the consumption of beef in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure there is no cross-Border underground trade in cattle. This would be a worry.  The Minister for Justice and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry have made strong moves in this area, but no stone must be left unturned to ensure there is no cross-Border transfer of cattle.  If this were to happen, even on a small scale, it could have disastrous effects on the work we are doing to regain confidence in our beef.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, who has endeavoured to do everything he could within the context of the EU to improve the situation.  At an early stage he was successful in efforts to introduce effective market support systems.  He ensured compensation to the producers who had lost income during that time. The emergency arrangements were quickly put into effect, including the lifting of ceilings on carcase weight and various other measures.  The Minister has been effective and must continue to work towards ensuring all the force of the EU is brought to bear in assisting Irish farmers at this crucial time.</P>
    <P>There is concern out there about the future drop in cattle prices.  We cannot forecast what will happen, but if cattle prices drop further there is going to be a severe income crisis for many farmers and it will also be serious for consumers. Beef cattle are not exactly the best producers of income for a farmer in comparison to the dairy sector.  We must recognise that a careful approach was taken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, since BSE was identified in Britain, to ensure our herd and good name were protected. The various measures which came in over a period of years going back to the original identification, including the slaughtering of animals, have ensured we did not go down the road that Britain did.  We should also recognise that the renderers and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry did not fall into the trap of easy cost savings <Col N="1253" /> by reducing the temperature at which the rendering was completed.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up one point raised by Senator O'Toole which is important.  We should recognise the UK point of view.  We should be understanding of their situation.  I was glad to see that the Minister supported Britain in its recent bid to improve its situation.  We are all partners in Europe.  It is easy to be populist in how we react against Britain within the European scene, but it is important we do not go overboard on this.  We should be sensitive and supportive to the British view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>One man's meat is another man's poison.  This affair developed from the manhandling of the BSE scare in Britain.  That is of vital importance because as late as today I was informed that in Germany there are signs up saying &ldquo;no Irish, no Northern Irish and no British beef on sale in this supermarket.&rdquo;  The Minister and his officials will have to take this up at a high level within the EU.  While this pertains within the EU we have no hope of dealing with the falling cattle prices and the closing of markets throughout the EU and the rest of the world.  Something must be done at EU level to ensure EU markets are open to Irish beef.</P>
      <P>Two things must be done.  There must be a long term marketing strategy and we must assure we have standards in place that can guarantee the safety of Irish beef.  In the meantime I make a strong plea to the Minister of State to go back to his Government colleagues and make sure a package is put in place. This should include cheap interest loans, or a mechanism through the Department of Finance and the lending institutions to override the problems we face with farmers who have stocking loans and cannot dispose of their stock at present market prices.  If we do not do this we will have a crisis in that farmers and their families throughout the country will go to the wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the veil of public relations is lifted from the Minister he will realise <Col N="1254" /> he has been inactive in this instance.  We can talk about marketing and long term strategy, but in the short term a package has to be put in place to alleviate the burden being placed on thousands of beef fatteners here.  People are bringing their cattle back from mart.  Farmers are being informed their cattle cannot be slaughtered because there is no market for them.  Farmers are in dire financial straits.  Incomes are dropping rapidly and they could lose their livelihoods.</P>
    <P>Minister Ivan Yates has done a lot in regard to public relations.  Everyday we see statements from the Minister.  But his practical approach in trying to market Irish beef across the world, particularly in Iran, Libya and other Third World countries, is disappointing.  The Iranian or Libyan markets are not accessible for Irish beef.  For Senators opposite to talk about a global approach to the red meat trade is impractical. Australia and Argentina are laughing at the failure of this Government and the EU to come to terms with this crisis. While Irish beef is banned, Australia, Argentina and other beef exporting countries are soaking up those markets. If they are not open soon to Irish beef I fear for the long term viability of the beef industry.  Boats presently anchored were booked to take cattle to Libya and Egypt; but because of the current difficulties there is no guarantee the animals will be paid for when they arrive.  While we would like to think that the Minister or the Government have done something, they have failed.  Irish beef is not acceptable within the EU&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and if we cannot convince our European counterparts we have no hope of convincing Third World markets and those farther afield because they always consider Ireland to be a part of Britain.  This problem must be resolved immediately. Third World countries, for what-ever reason, immediately lump us with the United Kingdom.  We have failed <Col N="1255" /> miserably to point out that we put in place definite procedures when BSE was first identified as a threat to beef herds and that we took stringent measures to ensure it would not escalate and wipe out the entire industry, as has happened in Britain.</P>
      <P>In the last few weeks the IFA has spoken to various political parties and I am sure the Minister is in regular contact with it.  However, I am disappointed with the approach taken by the IFA and the Government in the handling of this affair.  If we had a crisis of this magnitude at any other time, I am confident Molesworth Street would be black with people protesting about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some constructive proposals.  First, we must alleviate the income crisis currently facing farmers. I urge the Minister for Finance to provide funds through the various lending institutions to help farmers with the credit problems they will soon face.  We will not be able to open up markets in time to ensure their products are sold. Second, we should meet at the highest level the Germans and other nations, who are obviously biased against our beef if they allow their supermarkets to conduct this unfair trading.  We should tell them that this must be rectified immediately.  Finally, the Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs should travel to the markets currently closed to our beef and point out to them that it is safe, that in the past we put in place <Col N="1256" /> procedures that ensure BSE is not a problem and that, therefore, there is no reason for closing those markets to our beef.</P>
      <P>Markets are being closed to Irish produce.  Neither the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry have done enough in their own personal capacity to ensure that markets are reopened to our beef producers.  The Minister might achieve something at the end of the day if he took these ideas on board.</P>

      <P>Consumer confidence is central to the ongoing success and expansion of the beef industry which, together with the wider food industry, is one of the main pillars of the Irish economy, providing both direct and indirect employment and playing a central role in our export economy.  Rumours of angel dust, the shenanigans revealed during the Beef Tribunal and the recent British BSE scare have all combined to undermine consumer confidence in Irish beef.  Irish beef is one of the best products on the market today.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelleher referred to boats being held up in Cork harbour.  I have been advised by a producer that these boats have been there for some time. While I was given a different reason to that put forward by Senator Kelleher, it is still a fact and some producers are paying excessive interest rates.  I ask the Minister to let us know at a later date the cause of this problem.  At least two producers brought it to my notice.  I did not raise the matter because I thought it might have been resolved by now but this does not seem to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is undoubtedly a handful of unscrupulous individuals in the production and processing sectors who willingly place profit above consumer safety.  While they exist, they are in the minority.  I could not put a dossier together on the complaints one might receive, but underhand dealings do exist.  Tags could be switched, for example.  I cannot supply positive proof but there is no smoke without fire.  I have no doubt they will be weeded out <Col N="1257" /> and I want to see this happen.  It is in the interests of the beef industry as a whole for all those involved in it to unite with the Government in ensuring that rogue operators are not allowed to sully the reputation of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>The response to the current BSE scare by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has been both rigorous and principled.  The Minister's assurance that in future meat from all herds where BSE has been identified will be destroyed is continuing evidence of the Government's determination to ensure that the high reputation of our beef is maintained.  In the long term there is a need to establish a more distinctive Irish identity for our beef &mdash; other speakers referred to this &mdash; and I look forward to further progress in this regard.  We have no evidence that progress has been made despite the fact that the issue has been raised on previous occasions.  This will go a long way towards allaying consumer fears, especially in the export market, and avoiding confusion of the Irish product with products sourced elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Our beef industry is being asked to pick up the tab for UK mismanagement, especially during the 1980s when the Tories promoted wholesale deregulation with a missionary zeal.  In this regard I hope that Ireland, together with our EU partners, will call the Tory bluff in regard to its bizarre threat to block all EU business until the ban on British beef is lifted.</P>
    <P>The interim EU decision to maintain the ban on British beef until appropriate measures are put in place was taken in the best interests of farmers and consumers throughout the EU, who have been hit hard by an EU wide crisis of confidence in beef following the BSE scare, which originated in the UK.  This is not the first time the UK has assumed a lone ranger role in the EU.  Attempts to block State aid packages for Aer Lingus and Irish Steel are some of the most recent examples of UK intransigence.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the EU to call the Tory bluff.  In reality there will be <Col N="1258" /> few debates during the Intergovernmental Conference which are likely to be affected by a UK veto.  I hope that EU Agriculture Ministers will not allow themselves to be influenced by Tory bluster during the Council meeting in early June and that they will continue exerting pressure on the UK to put in place a scientific programme to deal with BSE in advance of the ban being lifted.  The long-term cohesion of the European Union will be severely threatened if EU member states cave in to the UK in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Our agriculture industry and entire economy faces a disastrous future if immediate action is not taken by the Minister and the Government to tackle the on going BSE crisis.  The entire affair is a disaster for our whole economy, which is highly dependent on a successful agricultural industry.  As a result of the BSE crisis, agricultural incomes have collapsed.  As beef prices continue to fall this week, beef procedures are losing huge amounts of money with no sign of any improvement in the market.  Cattle sales throughout the country in the past week are reporting disastrous prices with most cattle unsold.  In one case a mart had to close as no bids were being offered.  Factory quotes are low again this week.</P>
      <P>Live exports to third countries have fallen by 40 per cent in the first five months of 1996 &mdash; from 93,192 in 1995 to 55,572 in 1996.  Prices to farmers have dropped by £100 per head since the BSE crisis arose and it is anticipated they will drop by an equivalent amount again if urgent action is not taken by increasing export refunds.  There was the lack of foresight on the part of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in not supporting a drive to increase export refunds for live cattle to third countries during the spring season, resulting in Australia shipping 40,000 cattle to Egypt in the first five months in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland shipped 37,000 fewer cattle to Egypt in 1996 than in the same period of 1995.  Due to the BSE crisis Egyptian <Col N="1259" /> consumption of beef in the past month has dropped by 30 per cent.  Market price has fallen by 20 per cent along with a seasonality drop of 10 per cent. The Libyan market is closed to Irish cattle.  Market potential for the year 1996 was 50,000.  Funds were available in Libya to purchase that quantity of cattle.  The Irish Government should send a trade delegation, which includes the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and other Ministers, to Libya for trade negotiations.</P>
    <P>Irish beef is a product of unique quality and consumers should have no fear of buying our beef.  That is the message we must get to our markets.  The Government must urgently ensure the return of Irish beef to its former markets throughout the world.  Ireland acted promptly in all cases of BSE, quickly slaughtering the entire herd in which an outbreak occurred.  Since 1989 there have been only 124 cases of BSE in Ireland out of a population of seven million animals.  In Britain there have been 160,000 instances of BSE in a cattle population of 12 million.  Britain took no action and, as a result, all of Europe has suffered from this problem since 1979.</P>
    <P>The action of the British Government this week in disrupting European Union business is outrageous.  I urge the Government and the Minister to stand up to these shameful tactics.  They must not allow Britain, which has brought such hardship and financial ruin to our country, to blackmail the European Union.  Had Britain taken the same action as the Irish Government when the first instance of BSE emerged &mdash; the immediate slaughter of herds and the imposition of a ban on the use of all meat and bonemeal for cattle feed &mdash; we would not be in this situation today.</P>
    <P>Ireland is suffering more than any other area of Europe because the beef industry is such a large sector of our economy.  It is worth over £1.6 billion per annum, or 10 per cent of our GNP. I call on the Minister and the Taoiseach to fully compensate the loss incurred by <Col N="1260" /> Irish farmers due to the inaction of the European Union and Britain on this matter.  The evidence is that Irish beef is a quality product with disease free status.  That is accepted nationally and internationally.  The Government, An Bord Bia and our exporters must launch an aggressive campaign to promote Irish beef at home and abroad and to counteract the crisis of confidence among consumers about the safety of our beef product.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to convey our message to the Minister and the Taoiseach.  I hope we will get results and that our farming community will receive the Government's support.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to debate this motion and Senator Dardis and Senator Honan deserve our thanks for putting it before the House.</P>
      <P>No Member of the House would minimise the problem facing the Irish beef industry and the farming community. Everybody is aware of the severe drop in cattle prices that is causing considerable problems for farmers throughout the country.  Figures have been produced by the IFA, Teagasc and the Department to show the losses that have occurred.  In some cases losses were calculated at about £80 per head up to the end of March.  There has been a loss of approximately £150 per head since then.  Factory prices have seen a reduction from £1.12 per pound in May 1995 to about 90p to 92p per pound in 1996.  That illustrates the problem we are facing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish beef is unquestionably one of the finest and safest foods available and it is important to ensure that customers and consumers are aware of its excellence. An Bord Bia and the Department have succeeded in obtaining many new <Col N="1261" /> markets for Ireland and they have done much excellent work.  However, their efforts must be redoubled.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has been criticised for not doing enough and not visiting enough countries.  My recollection is that he was caught up in Brussels for long negotiations when the crisis arose and he was good at putting forward the Irish viewpoint. Few will argue that the Minister is an able, energetic and skilled negotiator. He has visited Spain, Italy and France.  He is in Russia today, where he opened an office on behalf of An Bord Bia last October.  It is hoped that this year 100,000 tonnes of Irish beef will be sold to Russia at a price of approximately £350 million.  Further visits are planned.</P>
    <P>This crisis was not of our making. Ninety nine per cent of the blame for the crisis rests with the Department of Agriculture in Britain and with the British Government.  I regret that I must criticise the British Government for obstructing the business of the European Union; I condemn its future plans to disrupt that business.  This will be a major mistake and will only succeed in highlighting the wrong images.  If somebody wishes to cover something up, they go on the defensive and people recognise there are problems.  The British should tackle these problems rather than attempting to cause disruption.</P>
    <P>Consumers will not be bullied into buying beef.  The only way to encourage the customer and restore confidence in Irish beef is to explain the nature of our product.  This has been a fair debate and Members have displayed goodwill in attempting to resolve this difficult problem. I wish the Minister and Minister of State every success in their task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

      <P>I thank Senator Enright for sharing time with me.  I also thank the Progressive Democrats for providing us with the opportunity to debate this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish cattle industry has entered a state of crisis in a very short time.  This was not the result of our own actions.  I <Col N="1262" /> firmly believe the BSE problem in Britain got out of hand following the identification of 160,000 cases of the disease. The authorities decided the only way to deal with the problem was to raise it on the European stage and obtain compensation for the removal of infected animals from the system. Unfortunately, they did not realise the consequences of their actions.</P>
    <P>The Irish media has played a disastrous role in exacerbating this situation. I agree with the point made by Senator Farrell on today's Order of Business that, every time this problem is discussed on television, RTE shows footage of a cow which is not of Irish origin. I take exception to the continuation of that publicity which is damaging many people.  When the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell, was recently en route to a Third World country, Ireland's 127th case of BSE was identified. Before he arrived in that country, Sky News issued a report that further cases of BSE had been discovered in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The media has a responsible role to play in ensuring that Ireland is given a fair crack of the whip with regard to its beef products.  The media has been completely irresponsible where the livelihoods of thousands of individual families can be affected.  I would welcome visits by members of the media to farms where these animals are produced.  They would discover that Irish farmers are not responsible for the situation that has developed.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Taoiseach has established a committee to look into the serious consequences of this affair on the Irish economy.  During his term of office as President of the European Union, it will be the only way to progress the argument that we require further help in this area.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope that heifer producers will be considered when the compensation is being paid.  I refute the argument that nothing has been done to deal with this problem which is the most serious to affect our major industry.  I <Col N="1263" /> would like to believe that, as politicians, we can help to rectify this problem.  I identified some of the issues with which we must deal and journalists describing these issues must do so in a particularly responsible way.</P>

      <P>I support the motion.  This is a very serious issue.  I support Senator Farrelly's criticism of the media.  It is very sad to see the national television station showing seven year old footage of an animal staggering around a farmyard. The Government, farmers' organisations and farmers themselves must then scramble to restore confidence in the quality of Irish beef at home and abroad.  This national sabotage occurs daily and Irish housewives are being scared away from buying quality Irish beef as a result.  Would RTE accept it if a rival television network used questionable footage to damage its image?  I recently met with representatives of the farmer's organisation and informed them that they should bring this matter to the attention of RTE.</P>
      <P>We are facing a crisis which could be as bad as the one that occurred 22 years ago when calves were abandoned at marts because it was not worth the owner's while to bring them home.  The price of calves has already dropped to between £20 and £30.  The price of beef, store cattle and calves have been badly affected by this crisis.  We have seen only the tip of the iceberg.  It does not bear thinking about the lengths to which average European farmers will be obliged to go to feed and educate their families, particularly if their bank mangers are breathing down their necks. Senator Kelleher made the point that banks should provide short-term loans until farmers can sell their cattle.  The situation must not be worsened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> Some shipping agencies are refusing to transport sheep and cattle from this country.  It is shocking that this problem exists and I am aware that do-gooders may have caused it. We face enough difficulties attempting to build up foreign markets without being unable to transport our products out of the country. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should do all in his power to restore our markets in Egypt, Libya and elsewhere.  No other country in Europe depends more on the export of beef and store cattle than Ireland.  The Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach must deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>What we are experiencing now is worse than the economic war between Britain and Ireland in the 1930s.  I appeal to the Government to deal with the matter urgently.  There is no point despatching senior civil servants or departmental secretaries to do so. This does not indicate enough seriousness and urgency on our part to rectify the situation.  I request that the Government invest more money in research and into the marketing of Irish beef.  Much research is required into the problem of mad cow disease.  We are facing a serious crisis and we should work together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal has been said by Members of the Oireachtas on this very serious problem.  The fact that a neighbouring country has 162,000 cases means we have to be realistic.  Our problem is our neighbour.  Our 100 mile border with Northen Ireland presents us with a difficult situation.  I listened this morning to those complaining about gardaí being transferred to the Border. However, we should ask what would happen if they were not transferred. Some farmers in England who had to have their cattle slaughtered were allowed to take them home for their own use.  There is no control of that situation. It is not too hard to land a container of beef in the North.  If our borders are not protected the number of <Col N="1265" /> cases here will soon be in line with those in Britain.</P>
      <P>I have a proposal to make, regardless of whether it is important to make one at this stage. We can make as many speeches as we like but the bottom line is restoring consumer confidence.  The one way to do that is to destroy every cow.  I have stated on numerous occasions that a cow has a life of eight to 12 years and is dosed four to six times a year for mastitis and so on.  When a cow reaches the age of eight or ten years she has done her service.  Dairy farmers and those who own cows might complain but there is a need to restore consumer confidence.</P>
      <P>There is no point in just destroying the aged animals as the consumer will not accept that.  Those who own cows should be compensated by the EU or the Government.  I listen to the comments of beef consumers every day and most are in the same situation as I am. I ask the Minister to think about this because drastic action must be taken to restore consumer confidence.  It is sometimes suggested here &mdash; and all the time in Britain &mdash; that the older animals must be destroyed.  That is not acceptable. There has to be clear action which everyone will understand.  It might be drastic, but such action has to be seen to be taken.  I ask the Minister and the Department to look at that proposal, which I make with the knowledge and consent of hundreds of small farmers who depend on cattle production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan) Jimmy Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senators Dardis and Honan on raising this matter. It is a very serious matter of crisis proportions and is unlikely to go away for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to respond to this motion under a number of headings.  First, I think it is important to place on record the position of Ireland in relation to BSE.  To date, Ireland has had a total of 127 cases of BSE since the first case was confirmed in 1989.  This incidence, which represents an average of 16 cases <Col N="1266" /> per year, must be viewed in the light of a cattle population of seven million animals. By comparison, the United Kingdom has had over 160,000 cases in a cattle population of about 12 million. Ireland is classified by the OIE as having a low incidence of BSE.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive system of control measures has been put in place in Ireland to ensure that consumers, both at home and abroad, can have confidence in Irish beef.  BSE is compulsorily notifiable. Monitoring, including both ante and post mortem inspection, is carried out at meat plants and any suspicious cases are referred for diagnosis. The use of meat and bone meal in ruminant rations has been banned since 1990. BSE confirmed animals are destroyed and buried or incinerated, with full compensation being paid by the State to the herd owner.  Entire herds in which BSE occurs are depopulated at full market value and the carcases of such animals are now rendered into meat and bone meal so there is no possibility they can enter either the human food or animal feed chain. The progeny of infected animals are traced and destroyed or otherwise held for research purposes.</P>
    <P>The current crisis in relation to BSE was triggered by the announcement by the British Health Secretray in the House of commons last March regarding possible links between BSE and its human equivalent, CJD.  Notwithstanding the tentative nature of this link, this statement had a significant effect on consumer confidence in the safety of beef, not only in the United Kingdom but in all EU member states, including Ireland, and in third countries. In this respect, the Government here acted quickly to reassure Irish consumers through the establishment of an experts advisory group composed of experts from the medical and veterinary professions, as well as representatives from various Departments, the grocery trade and consumer interests.  The group concluded that on the basis of all the medical, veterinary and scientific advice available to it, Irish beef and beef products <Col N="1267" /> were safe to eat and could be consumed with confidence by consumers.</P>
    <P>The developments also demanded a response at EU level. In the immediate aftermath, the Commission decided on 27 March 1996 to prohibit the export of all live bovine animals, semen, embryos and products containing bovine material from the United Kingdom to any other destination, with the exception of those containing bovine material which originated from animals slaughtered outside the UK.  Since the adoption of that decision, the World Health Organisation and various EU scientific committees have re-examined the situation and have concluded that products such as gelatine and tallow which have undergone certain manufacturing processes and bovine semen could, with safety, be excluded from the export prohibition. As the standing veterinary committee was unable at its meeting on 20 May to give a favourable opinion on a Commission proposal to this effect, the Commission has now submitted the proposed decision to the Council, which is likely to consider it at its meeting on 3-4 June. Ireland has supported this partial lifting of the EU ban on the export of products from the UK in line with the scientific advice to this effect.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the EU prohibition on 27 March, a huge Garda and customs surveillance operation has been in place along the Border to ensure animals or products are not illegally imported into the State in contravention of the prohibition.  This operation, which is undeniably necessary to ensure purchasers in markets overseas can continue to have confidence in Irish beef exports, has enabled Irish exporters to provide cast-iron gurantees as regards the origin of their exports.  However, some seizures have been made during the course of the Garda operation, and I know all in this House will join me in condemning without reservation the small minority who appear to be willing to put at risk our entire beef industry.</P>
    <P>As a major beef exporter, the Irish beef industry could not be insulated <Col N="1268" /> from the fallout of the BSE crisis.  As the House is aware, the industry exports approximately 85 per cent of all cattle and beef produced in the country to a range of destinations both inside and outside the EU.  One of the most immediate effects of the 20 March announcement was to raise serious concerns in the minds of consumers about the safety of beef and this led to a dramatic fall in beef consumption worldwide. It was evident from an early stage that this crisis was not going to be short lived and that it would creat major problems not just for the British beef industry but also for the European beef industry generally and especially in those member states such as Ireland with a heavy dependence on export markets.</P>
    <P>It was for that reason that all of the services available to the State were marshalled with a view to assisting the Irish beef industry to cope with the crisis and minimise its effects.  The Minister also directed his efforts to ensuring that the EU Commission, in the first instance, introduced effective market support arrangements to remove surplus beef from the market and, second, provided for compensation to be paid to producers who had suffered income losses as a result of the crisis.  Any reasonable observer would agree that the Minister has been extremely successful in his efforts in regard to these objectives.</P>
    <P>As far as effective market support arrangements are concerned, the EU Commission introduced emergency intervention measures early in April, subject to a ceiling of 50,000 tonnes on purchases into intervention under the two April tenders.  When it became evident that these measures were inadequate, Commissioner Fischler responded to the Minister's request for more effective arrangements by temporarily lifting the 340 kg. weight limit on carcasses which may be sold into intervention and extending the scope of intervention to include grade 04 steers.</P>
    <P>These adjustments significantly improved the effectiveness of the system to the extent that 40,000 tonnes of <Col N="1269" /> beef were removed from the European market under the second tender in April.  The emergency intervention arrangements were extended into May subject to the reintroduction of a weight limit of 420 kg. on eligible carcasses. However, offers into intervention under the first tender in May showed that the 50,000 tonne ceiling for the month was too low and the Commission increased the ceiling to 65,000 tonnes.  Approximately 40,000 tonnes was accepted into intervention under the first tender, leaving 25,000 tonnes available for the second tender, which will be adjudicated on at the meeting of the beef management committee on Friday, 31 May. This meeting of the management committee will also decide on the intervention arrangements for the month of June.</P>
    <P>These intervention measures have been extremely successful in helping to eliminate the backlog of cattle which had built up on farms in the immediate aftermath of the onset of the crisis and in removing surplus beef from the market. The scale and depth of the crisis across Europe is evidenced by the quantities of beef offered into intervention, especially in Germany.  Clearly, these emergency intervention measures prevented what would otherwise have been a total collapse in the European market, which would have had devastating consequences for the Irish beef sector. In this instance, intervention, for all of its faults, has been used very successfully to support the market.</P>
    <P>The 12 per cent increase in export refunds on cattle and beef on 1 May was very welcome, as indeed was the positive response of the Irish beef industry to the increase.  The volume of licences taken out in the days following the increase &mdash; 26,000 tonnes of beef and 5,000 head of live cattle &mdash; demonstrated a renewed confidence among Irish exporters in export possibilities on third country markets.  I hope that this confidence is justified and that trade with third countries will return to something approaching normal levels in the near future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> Of course, effective intervention support arrangements and increased export refunds are only two of the instruments available to the Commission to support producers' incomes.  I accept that, in spite of the intervention arrangements, cattle prices have fallen and producers have suffered substantial income losses as a result of the crisis.  Indeed, it was recognised from an early stage that market support systems on their own would be unable to maintain cattle prices at levels which would return reasonable incomes for producers.  This is highlighted by the fact that the Emergency Council on BSE on 1-3 April provided for the possibility of compensation being paid to producers.  The meeting of the Agriculture Council on 29-30 April confirmed that compensation would be available and the council on 20-21 May discussed informal Commission proposals for compensation.</P>
    <P>These proposals provided for increases in both the suckler cow and special beef premium at an overall cost of £540 million to the EU.  At that meeting, the Minister, along with a number of Ministers from other member states, called for better targeting of the compensation at those producers who had suffered most from the crisis &mdash; in our case the winter fatteners.  Commissioner Fischler has revised his proposals to take these views into account and I understand that they were formally adopted by the EU Commission this afternoon.</P>
    <P>In summary, the revised proposals provide for an increase of almost £21 in the suckler cow premium and approximately £17.50 in the special beef premium at an overall cost to FEOGA of approximately £440 million.  Overall, it should be worth approximately £52 million to Irish producers, which must be welcomed.  A further £96 million will be allocated between member states to provide compensation to producers whose income difficulties were not fully addressed by the general increases in the premiums.  Ireland would get approximately £8 million from the fund.</P>

      <Col N="1271" /> The revised compensation package is a significant improvement on the original proposals, specifically in that it provides for better targeting of the compensation. These proposals will, of course, be subject to negotiation in the EU Council of Ministers and will also require the opinion of the European Parliament.  The Minister will be seeking to ensure that the final decision more adequately reflects the scale of losses incurred by farmers and that it is framed in a way that best suits Irish conditions.</P>
    <P>All the evidence would suggest that this crisis is going to be more severe than any other crisis experienced by the beef sector in the recent past.  While it may be too early yet to attempt to forecast how long it will last or how serious will be its effects, it is becoming increasingly evident that it will have a permanent and negative impact on beef consumption on our major markets.  The Minister has been exerting pressure on the EU Commission to implement an enhanced beef promotion scheme to counter the inevitable negative publicity associated with BSE.  I hope that the Commission will respond positively to this request.</P>
    <P>However, we must consider the prospect that consumption will not return to a level which will enable the EU to live within the GATT ceiling on subsidised exports and that measures may be required at European level to restore balance to the beef market by reforming the beef regime.  A debate on this issue is already underway, with some member states urging reform sooner rather than later.  At this stage it would appear that some type of reform is inevitable and our objective will be to ensure in so far as we can that the premium arrangements continue to promote extensive production and that our share of the payments under the premium system is not reduced.</P>
    <P>Turning more specifically to the market situation for Irish beef and beef products, I am pleased to note that following a swift and effective campaign by <Col N="1272" /> An Bord Bia, domestic consumption has returned to up to 90 per cent of pre 20 March levels, which is significant. Consumption in Europe, however, continues to be depressed and some markets are operating at 30 per cent to 50 per cent below pre crisis levels.  In addition, many European and third country consumers are eating only nationally produced beef and so the market for Irish beef continues to be very difficult.</P>
    <P>However, the Department and An Bord Bia continue to work assiduously to restore consumer confidence in Irish beef.  Briefing documents outlining Irish beef and animal health controls and consumer information leaflets have been distributed widely.  In addition, consumer advertising and promotion compaigns have taken place in targeted countries.  I participated in a very successful campaign in Sweden while the Minister participated in campaigns in Italy and Spain and he has today completed a visit to Russia to promote Irish beef.  The timing of such campaigns is crucial and further campaigns will be undertaken when market circumstances are favourable.</P>
    <P>While only a small number of third countries imposed restriction on European beef products, this included some very important outlets for Irish beef, such as Iran and Libya, which still remain closed.  I am pleased to report that Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon and South Africa have lifted the restrictions on European beef and the reopening of all markets is a priority goal.</P>
    <P>I stress that the issues raised by the recent BSE developments are mainly technical and are not amenable to instant political solutions.  The Department, the diplomatic service and An Bord Bia have gone to great lengths to reassure the relevant authorities of the safety of Irish beef and beef products. High level delegations have visited Egypt and Iran, and a senior veterinary official has visited a number of Gulf states to discuss the technical issues raised by these countries.  Political interventions <Col N="1273" /> have also been made where appropriate.  As Senators will be aware, the Egyptian market reopened following the direct intervention of the Taoiseach, while ministerial contacts were influential in the reopening of the Lebanese market.  The Minister proposes to visit Libya as soon as the necessary arrangements have been put in place. While he is disappointed that the visit has not taken place to date, it is important to ensure that the timing and circumstances are right so that the optimum outcome is achieved.  Iran has agreed to send a veterinary delegation to Ireland and arrangements are being made to agree an early date for the visit.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the announcement made yesterday that the livestock slaughterers and renderers have reached agreement on the commercial arrangements to be put in place for the continued collection and treatment of offal.  The role of the Government in putting in place, as an emergency measure, a temporary scheme of direct financial assistance to the Irish rendering industry was intended to give all parties concerned sufficient time, and the chance, to reach agreement on those commercial arrangements.  The scheme has ended and the bulk of payments under it have been made.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the problems unleashed by the BSE crisis are farreaching and complex.  However, I think all objective observers will accept that the Government has responded swiftly and decisively and that significant progress has been made on all fronts.  The restoration of intervention has supported the market while a compensation package is under discussion which the Minister is determined will be sufficient and will target that section of the industry most affected by the crisis.  The difficulties in the rendering industry have been resolved and some markets which had restricted European beef must be reopened.  While serious problems remain and there is much work to be done, I think the House can be satisfied that the Government has acted in a concerted <Col N="1274" /> manner in the current crisis to safeguard the beef industry.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with a number of the points raised by Senators.  Senator Dardis referred to the resolution of the dispute between the livestock slaughtering plants and the renderers.  I understand that all the slaughtering plants and renderers are now open, and contracts have been agreed between those plants and the renderers reflecting the commercial realities arising from the decreased value of the &ldquo;fifth&rdquo; quarter due to BSE developments.  Details of those contracts are not available yet but no doubt producers will be quick to react if any undue financial burden arising from the contracts falls directly on them.</P>
    <P>With regard to possible alternative uses for meat and bonemeal, whereas the rendering industry sees itself as continuing to have a commercial future, I can confirm that technical discussions are ongoing on possible alternative uses. These discussions involve both the ESB, Bord na Mona and other Departments.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher referred to the role of the lending institutions.  I can confirm that the Minister, Deputy Yates, has already met with those institutions and arrangements are in place to review the problems faced by farmers, and there will be further such discussions.</P>
    <P>If I did not respond to what Senator Honan said, it would be unfair on officials in my Department.  Her general comments were both unfortunate and misplaced.  The misdemeanours of a single veterinary officer should not be an excuse to tarnish the reputation of the remaining staff who do a good job in difficult circumstances.  I know from my dealings with them that they discharge their responsibilities in a professional manner.</P>
    <P>It is also not true to say that the Department is solely concerned with protecting the interests of processors and producers.  Clearly, the health of the consumer is a major concern of the Department.  In fact, this is the ultimate objective of the veterinary health regulations enforced by my Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> I thank Senator Honan and Senator Dardis for raising this important motion this evening.  I agree with a number of speakers that, at this stage, it is time for national unity and a national response. All parties must support each other and come forward with suggestions, as Senator Dardis did this evening.  It is an issue which we must all take on together, and I am confident that the Government will take the required actions to minimise the devastating effects which this crisis could have on the beef industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your flexibility on this matter.  I know we started a little late, so I will be brief.  I thank the Senators who have contributed and I am pleased that the motion is unopposed because it is of the utmost gravity.</P>
      <P>I want to say on behalf of Senator Honan that her reflection on an official in the Department is valid; there have been other instances which I could quote.  It is not a reflection on the totality of the civil servants in the Department but deficiencies have been found in the way the industry has been monitored and somebody, somewhere, must bear the responsibility for that, whether that be at a political or Civil Service level.</P>
      <P>It must also be said that this is an issue the spin doctors, the programme managers and photo opportunities will do nothing to solve.  We are down to the real nitty-gritty of <i>realpolitik</i> here, both at European and other levels, and that is what must be done.  We must acknowledge that in the eyes of many consumers, even those nearest to the channel, Irish beef is British beef.  It will take a major promotional campaign to counter that belief.  In comparison to the money spent by multinationals, such as Nestle and Unilever, the amount the State spends on promotion is minimal.  I suppose it derives from the beef intervention psychology which grew up in this country over many years with which we are only gradually coming to terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> Border controls were mentioned.  It is important that there should be such controls.  I note the Minister, in a reply to a question in the Dail, mentioned that there had been 33 seizures and that the animals had been destroyed or a notice of destruction had been served in 19 of these cases.  However, there was a worrying addition, which was that prosecutions for such illegal trade are hampered by the difficulty in determining the actual importer of the animals in many cases or by the fact that the importer resides outside the jurisdiction. Are we going down the same road here as with the growth promoters?  If we are, it is very worrying.  If there is a loophole it needs to be closed.</P>
    <P>I sometimes think we are fast getting to the point where eating is bad for one's health.  Unfortunately, many of our concerns derive from a situation where we have food in plenty and at a reasonable price.  It is ironic that, at a time when we are commemorating the Famine, we find ourselves in such a position because food is so plentiful that minor deficiencies in it, and even major ones, become so important.  That does not mean these deficiencies are not real, that the consumer does not make the decisions and that we must not market our products; of course we must.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my appeal to the Minister to ensure that measures are introduced speedily, and I am encouraged by what he said:</P>
    <P>All the evidence would suggest that this crisis is going to be more severe than any other crisis experienced by the beef sector in the recent past. While it may be too early yet to attempt to forecast how long it will last or how serious will be its effects, it is becoming increasingly evident that it will have a permanent and negative impact on beef consumption on our major markets.</P>
    <P>That is an important and long overdue statement and I welcome it.  It has been a reasoned debate and I am pleased the motion is unopposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to raise this matter and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, for coming here to reply.</P>
      <P>There is a serious problem in Raphoe, County Donegal.  Back in 1976, negotiations started with the Department of Education to provide PE facilities adjoining Raphoe vocational school. The local parents and community groups contributed almost £100,000 towards this hall and £45,000 towards the purchase of two playing fields.  I know of no other community or parents groups which have contributed to the same extent and it is for this reason I feel compelled to ask the Minister to take on board this strong case for funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have had numerous negotiations with the Department but without any success.  In 1986, an extension to the school was opened by the then Minister of State, Mr. Dónal Creed, who agreed to undertake the provision of funding for the PE hall &mdash; the only thing which prevented him announcing it on the day was that the bill of quantities was not in order.  There is a long history of disappointments.  It appeared the Department was not going to proceed with the hall or help with its provision, so the local group had plans drawn up at no cost and obtained planning permission. In 1994 work on the hall was started and on 10 August that year the group received a £20,000 grant from the national lottery, which is the only funding <Col N="1278" /> the community and parents groups received for building their magnificent hall.  I compliment the <i>Donegal People's Press</i> for its full page article about the hall on 10 April, which I will supply to the Minister and any other interested parties.</P>
    <P>This is a case of sheer neglect by the Department of Education.  Many people have described its lack of interest and input into the PE hall as another example of its attitude towards vocational education.  I find that hard to accept.  I attended the official opening of an extension to St. Columba's College in Stranorlar, at which the school's energetic principal thanked the Department for its assistance towards the provision of a PE hall there.  Less than a mile away from Raphoe vocational school, the Royal and Prior School has a gym and PE hall.  It is hard for the public representatives for that part of Donegal, which includes Raphoe, to tell the local people that we have been unsuccessful in persuading the Department of Education to contribute towards the PR hall for the Raphoe vocational school.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State will take this motion seriously.  I ask him to look at the file and make an honest and fair assessment of the case which has been made down the years.  If he can exonerate the Department in this regard, I will accept that; but I do not believe he can, because the Department totally ignored this matter.  I am most anxious not to politicise my contribution, but before the Donegal North-East by-election, the Minister for Education visited a school in Milford.  An excuse was made that she was not too well, and I am sorry if that was the case.  However, one can only suspect her motives, because I am concerned that she did not consider it worth her while to stop at Raphoe vocational school, about which her Department has a thick file.  It is extra-ordinary. Taking into account the neglect of the Department and the Minister's attitude to the contribution and <Col N="1279" /> input made by the parents of Raphoe, one must wonder whether she is fit to be Minister.  I told her previously in this House that people perceive her as being solely concerned with education in Dublin and that she does not know and is not interested in what is happening outside the capital.  Unfortunately, my greatest fear has been realised.</P>
    <P>I wish to be positive &mdash; I did not come here to complain about the Minister, but given the history of Raphoe, I have to do so.  I make these points in the hope that the Minister of State will now recognise the neglect and ensure that some contribution is made by the Department.  It will take £100,000 to finish the PE hall, which is built and roofed.  That is not a huge sum &mdash; one could spend almost that much on an architect, a consultant, a quantity surveyor, a site, planning permission and a planning fee.  The Minister of State has some grasp of the patience of the northern people, but the patience of the people of Raphoe who have contributed towards a PE hall has been exhausted. They are on a war footing and will continue to remind the Minister and the Department of their neglect in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter. However, despite his protestations to the contrary, he has politicised the issue. I regret some of the personal comments made about the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator has given me an opportunity to outline the current position regarding the provision of PE facilities at Raphoe vocational school and I would like to give some brief details of the background to this case.  In the early 1980s the Department of Education was considering the provision of a PE hall in Raphoe, provided it would serve the needs of the Royal and Prior School, the vocational school and the local community. <Col N="1280" /> In the absence of local agreement regarding the siting of a single facility to meet these needs, the Department had to consider alternative suggestions regarding how best they might be served, bearing in mind that it was not possible to provide PE halls at all second level schools.</P>
    <P>Since the Department of Education had approved the provision of 1875 square metres in permanent accommodation to bring the capacity of Raphoe vocational school to 425 places, it was considered that an extension to the general purpose area would provide modest PE facilities with changing rooms and showers.  The vocational education committee proposed that the PE hall be constructed as a separate building.  Subsequently, in 1982 construction on the extension, excluding PE facilities, commenced.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committee initiated architectural planning of a separate hall without the Department's approval and processed it to the stage where formal presentation of its outline design proposals to the Department was completed in January 1984.  In view of the particular circumstances of this case and the promise of a local contribution towards the project, the proposals were examined and found acceptable to the Department of Education.  Architectural planning of the project proceeded. There followed protracted correspondence with the vocational education committee to bring the cost of the project within cost limits.  These difficulties were resolved towards the end of 1986. However, because of the financial situation it was not possible to proceed further with the project.</P>
    <P>Given the limited resources available, the priority as far as the second level capital programme of the Department of Education is concerned continues to be the provision of essential classroom accommodation.  However, under the Department's recreational facilities scheme, funding to the amount of <Col N="1281" /> £20,000 was approved in 1994 for the construction of a community hall on the site of Raphoe vocational school.</P>
    <P>The present policy of the Department is to provide PE facilities in all major extensions or in new school developments and on a phased basis at all second level schools where such facilities are not already available.  The Department has before it at present a large number of applications for second level school building projects involving the provision of urgently needed classroom accommodation in addition to a large number of applications for sports halls.  The capital allocation to the Department is not adequate to meet all these demands and, as I have already stated, the available financial resources must be reserved for the provision of essential classroom accommodation.</P>
    <P>I have known the Senator for a long time and I am sorry, if only for old time's sake, I have not been able to give him a better answer.  I have a similar problem in my own constituency.</P>

      <P>If it had been necessary to invent a character to epitomise an independent inspector of prisons it would have been difficult to do better than the recently retired UK Inspector of Prisons, Judge Tumin.  His concern for the prisoners, the prison staff and for the need for imprisonment in present day society, combined with his obvious independence from the system, made one feel that no matter what the inadequacies of the British Home Secretary or what political pressure he or she might be under, the inspector would speak his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> Following the establishment of the State the administration of the prisons was transferred to the Department of Justice.  Many, including the members of the Whitaker committee, feel this has had a detrimental effect on the management of prisons.  The Whitaker report, as the Minister of State knows, urged the establishment of a separate prisons board.  There was a prisons board established in 1878 but it was abolished 1928. A prisons board would help depoliticise the management of the prisons.  I do not have to spell out how political the whole issue of prisoners has become.  A board with a director who would report on the management and administration of the prisons directly to the Minister would be preferable to the present arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Whitaker report also recommended the appointment of an independent inspector of prisons, who would be of equivalent status to the director of the prison board and would report directly to the Minister through the Secretary of the Department of Justice. Recommendation 14.12 of the report states:</P>
    <P>The Inspector should be empowered to inspect all aspects of the work of the prison service, including the treatment of prisoners and conditions in prisons.  Ad hoc inspections at the request of the Minister should be provided for.  Each year the Inspector should make a report to the Minister and, subject to any omissions necessary on security grounds, the report should be published in full.</P>
    <P>Most people have agreed with this.  At present each prison has a visiting committee and all prisoners have a right to appear before the committee.  However, in view of the furore over the most recent Mountjoy Prison visiting committee's report, it is easy to see how these reports become politicised.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan</i> considers the appointment of an inspector of prisons. Recommendation <Col N="1283" /> 6.10 of the report states &ldquo;The Inspector would be empowered to inspect all aspects of the work of the prisons, including the treatment of offenders and conditions in prisons&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the past the Department of Justice had taken the view that since we have fewer than 20 penal institutions in this country and there is constant interaction between Department officials and prison staff, regular visits to prisons by officials, contact with voluntary groups and so forth, an inspector is not needed. However, others would consider that the closeness of contact makes an inspector vital.  The Department has reconsidered recently and agreed in principle that an independent person should be appointed with sufficient authority and access to institutions, offenders, staff and management of the prisons.  The report goes on to say that while the position should be statute based, there is no need to defer such an appointment pending the introduction of an appropriate statute.  Indeed, an inspector has been promised by 1999.  I am concerned about the status of the management of offenders document and whether its recommendations still stand.</P>
    <P>Having read the 1995 annual report of the Mountjoy Prison visiting committee, it is hard to see why there was much excitement about it &mdash; it is the same as the previous four or five reports, if perhaps only a little worse.  There were more details of the medical service, or the considered lack of it, and these were more explicit.  The value for money of this service was also questioned.  Would it have received such publicity were it not for the coincidence that a girl hanged herself in Mountjoy women's prison &mdash; a middle class girl who was not the typical stereotype of a Mountjoy inmate?  Was it this coincidence which resulted in so much attention being given to the report, because past reports <Col N="1284" /> which were similar have received little attention?</P>
    <P>A distance between the Department of Justice and the prisons is essential for their management to appear independent. The total separation of the administration of the prisons from the Department of Justice has been long urged, as has the establishment of a prisons board.  There is a feeling that everything must be shipshape before a prisons board can be established, which I do not understand.  I have not heard the same reservations expressed about the establishment of an inspector of prisons as were made when we were considering the appointment of an inspector of mental institutions.  A first move in trying to rationalise the situation as regards the management of our prisons would be the appointment of an inspector.  I hope the Minister for Justice, who I realise is very busy, knows of this debate and will be encouraged to make this appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Henry's call for the appointment of an independent inspector of prisons.  I would like to outline why this is very important to women prisoners who represent a small portion of the total prison population. The main women's prison is attached to Mountjoy Prison for men.  The Second Commission on the Status of Women made searching recommendations in relation to women prisoners.  I appreciate the Minister for Justice would be more than sympathetic to implementing the recommendations, one of which was the provision of an open prison for women, however, I accept that is not possible because of the deferment of the building of the new prison and women's prison beyond this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report on radio this morning highlighted the difficulties facing women in prison, particularly those who are separated from children.  When some of the files of former women prisoners were examined it was found that they had <Col N="1285" /> since died.  Women in prison tend to come from backgrounds of poverty and low educational attainment and have social problems, notably in relation to drugs.  If an independent inspector of prisons was appointed, these issues would be highlighted to a greater extent and they might be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of Women recommended that a halfway house and follow up services after release for women prisoners be put in place.  When I visited the prison as a member of the commission I heard that some of the women leaving Mountjoy have so little support on the outside that they are anxious to go back to prison where they feel safe, are fed and have a place to sleep.  They have support in prison which they do not have on the outside. That is a terrible indictment of society.</P>
    <P>Because it costs so much to keep women in prison, we should look at ways to support them when they come out.  By providing follow up services, we could ensure that they would not reoffend and return to prison.  Women officers who had been in the prison for a number of years said it was frightening to see the children of women who had been in prison when they first started in the service now entering.  It is a vicious circle.  We are only talking about a small number of people &mdash; the present women prison population is approximately 42.  I urge the Minister to accede to Senator Henry's request immediately and to address the issues I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome opportunity to discuss this issue and I thank the Senators for raising it. The appointment of an inspector of prisons would be a relatively small development.  The Minister for Justice has prioritised reforms of the prison system and has decided to tackle as a matter of preference such questions as prison accommodation, drugs in prison, <Col N="1286" /> mentioned by Senator Honan, etc., and has successfully addressed these issues.</P>
      <P>The idea of an inspector of prisons is not new.  A similar post has been in place in other countries for many years. In 1985 the Whitaker committee, which submitted a comprehensive report on the penal system, recommended the appointment of an independent inspector of prisons.  The idea was that such an inspector would report, through the secretary of the Department of Justice, to the Minister for Justice.  The inspector would have extensive powers to examine all aspects of the work of the prison service, including the treatment of prisoners and conditions in prisons.</P>
      <P>In the following years the view was taken in the Department that there were more pressing issues to be addressed and that, because of the small size of our prison system, there was less urgency to consider such an appointment. The pressing needs, it should be said, were very often the need to implement more important recommendations made in the Whitaker report.  In the meantime, the Department looked at inspection systems in neighbouring jurisdictions and in 1994 the Department, in its five year plan for the management of offenders, accepted that, notwithstanding the existence of other supervisory or control arrangements, it was right in principle that an independent person should be appointed as inspector of prisons with an appropriate level of authority and with the necessary access to institutions, offenders, staff and management alike to perform his or her task as envisaged by the Whitaker committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has endorsed the five year plan.  The Whitaker committee, however, made its recommendation in the context of a review of management structures for the prison service.  This is clearly the context in which any such appointment should be made.  As this House will be aware, there is a commitment in <i>A Government</i><Col N="1287" /><i>of Renewal</i> that the question of establishing a prisons board to manage the day to day running of the prisons would be examined.  The question of establishing a prisons board is currently under active examination by officials of the Department of Justice in consultation with their counterparts in the Department of Finance.  When those consultations reach the appropriate <Col N="1288" /> stage the matter will be considered by the Minister for Justice and, if necessary, brought to Government.  It is in this context that the question of the appointment of an inspector of prisons will be considered.</P>
