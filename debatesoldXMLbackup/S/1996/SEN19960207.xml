      <P>I have notice from Senator Cotter that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to examine the possibility of increasing the grant aided financial assistance which is made available to post-graduate students involved in research programmes in the various higher education colleges and universities.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to ensure that the health and safety regulations are enforced in places of public entertainment, particularly the provision of basic sanitary services.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Honan on the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Health when he proposes to introduce the child abuse register as recommended in the report on the Kilkenny incest case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave on the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that Dún Laoghaire/ Rathdown County Council retains its vocational education committee committee in light of the new boundaries.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely on the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to ensure balance in the coverage by RTE of race meetings; for example the non-coverage of Limerick races at Christmas despite the cancellation of Leopardstown races.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Daly on the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Energy if he will ensure that completion of the fourth phase works at Moneypoint power station will be considered in conjunction with other proposals by the ESB for the further provision of generation capacity.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senator Cotter, Senator Henry, Senator Honan and Senator Cosgrave as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Cotter's and Senator Henry's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I had to rule the matters raised by Senator Daly and Senator Kiely as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1 and 2.  We will take item <Col N="219" /> 1 until 6 p.m. and given it is a major item of legislation each speaker may have 30 minutes.  Item 2 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. with ten minutes per speaker and the Minister will conclude the debate not later than 7.45 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the arrangements for items 1 and 2.  Many of my colleagues have been fully briefed by their county managers on the Waste Management Bill and will appreciate the chance to participate on Second Stage and they will also want to speak on different aspects of agriculture.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Mitchell report and the report of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation have been made public, will the Leader arrange for the Tánaiste to come to the House to bring us up to date on developments in relation to Northern Ireland?  It has been some time since we had a chance to discuss the issue.  I am aware of the Leader's views in relation to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs but the House should have the opportunity to discuss the matter and to hear from the Tánaiste at first hand.</P>
      <P>I wish to commend and support the Government's efforts in relation to Sellafield.  I ask the Leader to convey our support to the Government in its efforts to ensure that all information relating to recent incidents at Sellafield is made public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise with the Leader a report published during the week about the number of people dropping out of school with no qualifications &mdash; 4,000 or more per year &mdash; and to relate that to the continuing debate on the issue and the Taoiseach's conviction that there is a clear connection between unemployment, poverty and crime.  Will the Government consider making that connection and note that it is the same group of people who do not obtain qualifications, become drop-outs in society, become involved in crime and make up the prison population?  I am not asking for a new debate on crime; <Col N="220" /> the issue might be addressed in a debate at an early date on the White Paper on education.</P>
      <P>As soon as this report was published there was a row about whether the statistics were correct.  There has been a debate of late about the number of people at work and out of work and whether the unemployment or the employment figures are the correct measure.  We are going from pillar to post and nobody knows how many people are working and how many are not.  We need a debate to have explained how calculations are made as to the numbers at work and out of work so that we can make fair comparisons. One is drawn to the conclusion that Governments are hiding behind inaccuracies in figures, whether deliberately or otherwise.  We need to have a debate as to how calculations of statistics are made on everything from national growth in the economy to unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's point about statistics.  We are at a point where we really do not know if we can rely on any figures.  Perhaps the debate needs to be extended to the Central Statistics Office.  Whether in Government or in Opposition we can all find figures to suit the case we wish to make.  The authenticity of some of the statistics is questionable and the matter should be looked at.</P>
      <P>Last night in Tipperary there was another murder in a rural area.  The last time we talked about this issue was during the Private Members' motion on crime.  The Leader acknowledged that it would be impossible for everyone to speak at that time and I thank him for allowing extra time on that occasion.  He accepted that it was a subject to which we should return, and not necessarily during Private Members' time.  Could he make time available soon to debate the whole area of criminal justice &mdash; the bail laws, the right to silence and so on &mdash; in more detail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I have not always <Col N="221" /> supported that call as, due to the delicacy of the situation, I thought that it was better to leave the matter alone. However, now that we have the report of the drafting committee of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and given the current stage of development, it would be useful if the House were to debate the issue because we have a good record of positive contributions on the matter.  I ask the Leader to make time available for statements on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  However, we should focus a great deal of attention on the Mitchell report because public debate was sidetracked into the whole question of an assembly following its publication.  There is a need for greater focus on the Mitchell report itself and it would be useful for this House to take that role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister for Education brief this House about her Department's error?  Parents are greatly concerned about the fact that last year some students, whose career paths depended on the points they achieved in their leaving certificate, were not given full credit in the art and design examination. I have great regard for how the Department of Education does its work; I corrected leaving certificate examination papers and I know that it is meticulous.  However, somewhere along the line something went amiss and the Minister must play a role in putting it right.</P>
      <P>The Minister has undermined public confidence by not being upfront about this.  We, as public representatives, have a duty to tell the public that all examinations will be corrected.  The Minister is pussyfooting around this; she should have made this information public last term.  Will the Leader request the Minister to brief this House on the correction of examinations, rechecks and that error, particularly for the information of students taking examinations next summer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> In relation to early school leavers, I agree with other speakers that the Youthreach group is not picking up those young people who drop out of school early.  Why is that group not making that transition?  Public funds were allocated to Youthreach.  Will the Leader give that issue precedence in his discussion with the Minister?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the distinguished former manager of the Irish football team, Mr. Jack Charlton, is to be conferred with honorary Irish citizenship. I accept the importance of sport in building a national feeling of self esteem and so on.  However, I asked on many occasions for this great honour to be awarded to Raoul Wallenberg.  I raised this matter on three occasions in three major debates.  I represented this House in Budapest at the Interparliamentary Union and raised the issue there.  On each occasion I raised the matter in this House I was informed that it might involve constitutional difficulties. I provided the relevant Ministers with precedents from the United States and Canada, countries which have both managed to grant Mr. Wallenberg honorary citizenship and overcame the difficulty that he might be dead.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader inquire if the Government is prepared to accept such a proposal, at this time, in light of the fact that they found it easy to confer honorary citizenship on Jack Charlton? I do not intend to criticise Mr. Charlton, but I wonder what this says about our priorities as a nation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>We are continually bleating about our Christian values.  Raoul Wallenberg lived in a very difficult period of European history, yet he managed to sustain such values.  He has been ignored by this country and every other country in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Christmas the House requested that the Minister responsible for Irish Steel appear before <Col N="223" /> us to explain the final agreement that was reached in this matter.  That has not been done.  I believe that this House and the Lower House should be informed about the contents of that agreement.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that we have not discussed VHI costs in great detail.  We are permitting the VHI to continue to increase charges for health care.  That matter should be discussed in this House.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole that there should be a general debate on employment.  We should not be afraid to discuss the cost of easy jobs or false jobs.  We should consider the best way to create real jobs in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I reflect the views of Members in expressing total horror at, and rejection of, the people who violated a home in County Tipperary last night.  They murdered the late Danny Fanning in his own kitchen. Mr. Fanning represented all that is best in the values of rural Ireland, an open house and hearth and a friendly family. It is horrific to think that this pattern of crime is continuing throughout the country.  Mr. Fanning was related to a distinguished former Member of the Oireachtas, the late Deputy John Fanning. I hope that an opportunity can be found to further review the consensus reached by this House in support of the Minister for Justice's actions on crime. It is essential that those necessary actions be taken as quickly as possible. We must ensure that people who are characterised by hard work, goodwill, family values and friendship toward the community feel safe in their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the request for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I state this again in a sense of solidarity regarding what this and the previous Government have achieved.  Such a debate will enable Members to express total repudiation of the offensive remarks of Deputy John Taylor towards the Tánaiste.  It is not the first time Mr. Taylor has expressed offensive remarks in respect of this part of the island.  In December 1993 he <Col N="224" /> stated in <i>The Irish Times</i> that if there were a united Ireland &mdash; he also stated that we in the Republic were determined to bring this about by way of taking over the North &mdash; it would become apparent that &ldquo;the Protestants of Northern Ireland, just as the Protestants of the Republic, had to get out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to know that.  Let us hope that this House continues to hear from the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>According to Senator O'Kennedy, &ldquo;Deputy&rdquo; Taylor is a member of the other House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that our Protestant colleagues, who we hold in great esteem&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;be afforded the opportunity to comment upon statements by Mr. Taylor that Protestants would have to &ldquo;get out&rdquo; of Northern Ireland if the Irish Government became involved in its affairs.  I want to assure the decent respectable people of Northern Ireland, be they Protestant, Catholic or whatever, that all we seek is common cause and purpose.  With regard to the notion which this gentleman, who recently deliberately offended the Tánaiste, has been trying to put out, it would help if we could express that common purpose here.  In that sense, I ask the Leader for the opportunity to have a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns voiced by Senator O'Toole on the recent report on the incomplete education of a substantial portion of Irish children.  Education is not just a passport to a job; it is also the passport to <Col N="225" /> full citizenship of this State.  Despite the great advances which have been made in education over the years by various Ministers, of whom the most effective were women, we cannot allow that situation to continue any longer.  I support the call for a debate so that we can make the linkage between a proper education, a preparation for life and the resources which need to be devoted to that particular area.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde should wax slightly less indignantly and stop this charade of pretending that any Minister in any Department can be responsible for every operational matter; sometimes thousands of staff may be involved. That is a nonsense and the quicker the highly paid people who make those decisions take responsibility for them, the better this country will be governed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate a request Senator Wright made last Thursday, and to which the Leader responded, for an imminent debate on broadcasting.  I want to reiterate that request as a matter of urgency, primarily because of current events, specifically, the Independent Radio and Television Commission hearings last week, which indicate that a decision on granting a new national radio licence is imminent; the question of TV3; the comments which were widely reported over the weekend as to the shape, format and operating procedures of Teilifís na Gaeilge, which will involve taxpayers' money; and the vote last night in the British House of Lords which overwhelmingly defeated the Government on the important and relevant question to this island of the listed important events which have been negotiated and are now owned, effectively, by satellite television.  Due to these various points and in the absence of a further discussion paper, which was originally promised following the publication of the Green Paper and which is not now going to see the light of day, from the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, I do not think this House will <Col N="226" /> have any further opportunity to discuss broadcasting issues which impinge on a significant proportion of the population in advance of the Minister's legislative proposals.  That is unfair.</P>

      <P>A question to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dangerous and, as it is in this forum that many of these debates take place, I do not believe this House should stand by without having an input into the future shape of Irish broadcasting and the impact it will have on public service broadcasting.  I appeal to the Leader to prioritise Government time for a debate on broadcasting and name a date for such a debate.  Otherwise, I will reluctantly have to get to my feet on every Order of Business until such a date is granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Dardis and Senator O'Kennedy in requesting a further debate on crime. As was correctly pointed out, we had an excellent and helpful debate last week in which there was general agreement on many of the different approaches and policies.</P>
      <P>It is important that we have a debate in which people can outline different points of view so that we can come up with some positive motion which would be of benefit to the Minister, the Government and many people who are concerned about the situation.</P>
      <P>I also call on the Leader for a debate on energy.  There are many changes occurring with regard to energy, energy sources, etc.  This issue affects my constituency to a larger extent because of the presence of the ESB and Bord na Móna.  Senator Daly tried to raise the matter but it was ruled out of order due to lack of ministerial involvement. However, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications would have many interesting views that we would like to hear and he would have the opportunity of hearing people with different viewpoints which are also relevant to developments in energy.  I would appreciate an early debate on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ormonde's request for the Minister for Education to come to the House to discuss the problem with examination papers. I also congratulate the teachers and parents in the Ursuline Convent.  Sligo. The Ursuline Convent has always upheld high moral and educational standards and I am sure that motivated them to see this matter through to the end.  I have been told that the Minister was informed verbally on 3 November last year about this matter.  I ask her to either contradict or admit that, from that date until now, this matter was left stewing and that there was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no cover-up then.  If the matter had been brought to a head at that time, those children would not be in the position in which they find themselves today.  It is very important that the Minister come to the House and answer questions.  I am sure parents throughout Ireland will be eternally grateful to the Ursuline Convent, Sligo, for highlighting this problem.  I ask the Minister to set up a private commission to re-examine papers where questions arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>People should be entitled to such a system.</P>
      <P>I read in the newspapers during the week that burglar alarm firms surveyed premises, passed on the maps of those premises to other parties and the premises were later burgled.  If this is true it is no wonder we have such a large number of burglaries.  People are getting into premises on the pretence of wiring them up for alarm systems but instead pass on that vital information.  This is a serious matter; crime is out of hand in this country.</P>
      <P>With regard to the poor man who was shot last night, it is time the Government took off the gloves and came to grips with crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Farrell.  This is an emotional issue in rural Ireland.  A Member on the Government side has sought ideas for the Minister for Justice.  I offered three ideas the last time she was in the House. I call on the Minister to re-open all the <Col N="229" /> Garda stations in rural areas on a fulltime basis, as they are in the cities.</P>

      <P>The Minister appears to be open to change and I admire her as a Minister.  The re-opening of the Garda stations is urgently needed; that single suggestion from this House would lay to rest many of the fears of decent people throughout rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Does the Leader intend to have a debate on broadcasting this month?  It has been on the Order Paper for the last few months and such a debate in the near future would be timely.  I also asked the Leader to do something about pirating.  Since I raised the matter there has been a great deal of coverage of it in the media.  The problem is under-estimated by the Government and I ask the Leader to put aside three hours to discuss the matter.  If the Minister wants the detailed information I have, I will be delighted to give it to her immediately. There should be an urgent debate on this issue because many jobs are being lost.</P>

    <P>I support Senator Enright's request about finding a mechanism whereby we can discuss the ESB, which is currently running into difficulties.  Last week I endeavoured to raise this on the Adjournment.  Although such attempts have been ruled out of order, the Minister has responsibility to sanction some of the agreements reached between the ESB and its staff.  The Government must sanction price increases for the company in connection with this package. The Minister has responsibility for <Col N="230" /> the Government's input into a decision on generating capacity.  Any plans dealing with energy generation which may be drafted by the ESB will have to be approved by the Minister.  We cannot raise this matter on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility but the Minister is up to his neck in this issue and he cannot evade his responsibility.</P>

      <P>I made a small error when announcing the Order of Business. I was unaware that when the debate on agriculture concluded last Thursday Senator O'Brien was in possession and he was told he had 18 minutes left to speak.  I propose that, even though other Members may speak for ten minutes, Senator O'Brien should not be deprived of the time allocated to him last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point raised by the Leader of the Opposition is reasonable.  There is a growing consensus that there should be a debate on Northern Ireland.  The emphasis of such a debate should be, as Senator O'Sullivan and others suggested, on the reports of the Mitchell commission and the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  A debate on Northern <Col N="231" /> Ireland would be helpful and I will endeavour to arrange one at an early stage.</P>
    <P>I support the point made by Senator Wright on Sellafield.  Senator O'Toole raised the question of the report on school drop outs and unemployment. This issue could be discussed during Private Members' Business and I will try to make time available for this later in the session.  It is my recollection that we had a debate last session on the differences between the live register and the unemployment survey.  I may be wrong but I will check this out.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis and Senator O'Kennedy mentioned the horrific murder in Tipperary yesterday.  All of us would like to support the eloquent words of Senator O'Kennedy and express our deepest sympathy to the decent good people who have suffered a great loss.  I hope this problem can be brought under control and that the perpetrators of that foul, cowardly and horrific deed last night will be brought to justice.  Senator Dardis raised the question of a debate on crime.  There is a need to come back to that subject as soon as possible.  Many Members did not have an opportunity to speak on this last week and some of those who spoke have other things to say.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde and Senator Farrell raised the question of the errors made in correcting the art papers of some leaving certificate students.  The most reasonable thing to do would be to allow the report into what happened to take its course.  We all agree that this should not have occurred and should not happen again.  However, in the nature of life such mistakes can be made. When the report is published, I will be happy to make time available for a discussion on it but, in the meantime, we should await the facts.  I will also take up Senator Ormonde's point on Youthreach.</P>

      <Col N="232" /> Senator Norris asked about Raoul Wallenberg.  I was not on this side of the House when the Senator raised the question of giving honorary Irish citizenship to him.  I am not sure of the procedures involved.  Perhaps I can discuss this matter with him later or maybe he could put it down as a Private Members' motion to see if the strength of feeling and opinion which he thinks exists is there.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan raised the question of Irish Steel.  A Bill will be published on Irish Steel in the next few weeks which will give us a full idea of how to meet the needs of what was resolved and also give us an opportunity to have a full debate on the matter.  The Senator also asked about the VHI.  The VHI Bill finished in the Dáil this morning.  We will have it here shortly and he will then have an opportunity to contribute on it.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney and Senator Cassidy asked about broadcasting issues.  There will be a debate on that matter in the next couple of weeks.  I have spoken to the Minister about that and he will be happy to attend.</P>

    <Title>Waste Management Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Waste Management Bill, 1995, was originally published in May 1995, together with a general policy statement and guide to the Bill.  Presentation of the Bill fulfilled a specific programme in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to bring forward framework legislation on the issue of waste.  The Bill has received detailed consideration by Dáil Éireann including extensive consultation with interested parties by the Dáil Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  The Bill was passed by the Dáil on 15 December 1995 with the revised short title the &ldquo;Waste Management Bill, 1995&rdquo;, which more accurately reflects its broad scope.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debates in Dáil Éireann, I tried to be positive and receptive to the various amendments put forward.  The Bill as presented to this House incorporates a significant number of amendments which I accepted, or initiated myself, in the Dáil.  I want to signify to the House that I am willing to adopt a similar approach here.</P>
      <P>The essential purposes of the measures which are provided for in the Bill are: to prevent and reduce waste production; to encourage and assist the recycling and recovery of waste and to apply strict control on the collection, movement and disposal of waste to reduce the risk to, and the impact on, the environment from these activities.</P>
      <P>The Waste Management Bill now before this House will provide a comprehensive and yet flexible framework for legislative support for these policies well into the next century.  I look forward to a positive and constructive debate here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent decades we have witnessed a profound change in our attitudes to the environment.  Economic growth and development remain important goals, <Col N="234" /> but we now appreciate more fully that proper care must be taken of our environmental resources on which economic activity and, indeed, human survival ultimately are based.  Sustainable development requires that, in pursuing economic development to meet the needs of the present generation, we do not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their needs in turn. Environmental protection and economic development must be mutually consistent and supportive.  However, it can be difficult to give practical expression to this simple concept.  This is particularly true in relation to waste management.</P>
    <P>AGENDA 21, the most important product of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, stated that&mdash;</P>
    <P>human health and environmental quality are being continually degraded by the increasing amount of waste being produced, despite increasing efforts to prevent waste accumulation and to promote recycling.</P>
    <P>The statistics underlying these comments are convincing.  The OECD area, comprising the world's most developed countries, generated some 9 billion tonnes of waste in 1990, including more than 300 million tonnes of hazardous waste.  The European Union Fifth Environment Action Programme notes, as a disquieting trend, that despite increased efforts at waste prevention and recycling, waste production in the Community increased by 13 per cent between 1987 and 1992.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we now generate annually an estimated 9 million tonnes of municipal and industrial waste in addition to even larger quantities of agricultural and other wastes.  Municipal waste from the domestic and commercial sectors amounts to some 1.7 million tonnes and there are substantial costs associated with the safe management of these wastes.  In 1994, expenditure on waste management by local authorities alone exceeded £65 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> This pattern of waste generation is creating demands which are beyond the carrying capacity of the environment to sustain.  However, waste is one of the most complex and problematic areas of present day environmental management. Waste issues are inextricably linked with consumption, lifestyle, economic activity and industrial policy.  The solution requires acceptance of the principle of shared responsibility for the environment by everyone in the community. It will also require radical changes to current waste management practices and adjustments for all of us in our lifestyles.</P>
    <P>European Union legislation and policy now represents a major input to the approach to waste management in all European member states.  Almost all waste comes within the scope of the important Framework Directive on Waste which was updated in 1991. There are several EU directives in relation to specific aspects of waste, such as incineration, waste oils, batteries, PCBs, packaging, imports and exports of waste.  Draft directives are also under consideration in relation to landfill of waste and end-of-life vehicles.</P>
    <P>The European Union involvement in waste issues is driven by the need to provide a high level of protection for the environment and also to maintain a level playing field for industry and business. It is motivated by the transboundary nature of many waste issues and by the need to ensure an integrated and adequate network of waste management facilities right across the European Union.  Few countries are completely self-sufficient in this regard: it can be necessary to rely on specialised facilities located elsewhere in the EU for disposal and recycling of certain wastes.</P>
    <P>EU waste policy is based on a well known hierarchy of principles: these give first preference to prevention and minimisation of waste, then to their reuse and recovery, and finally to the environmentally sound disposal of wastes which cannot otherwise be dealt with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> Ireland too is experiencing many changes of attitude and practice in reaction to waste management.  The public has become rightly more sensitive to the environmental aspects of waste management and disposal.  This is leading to increased public support for waste prevention and recycling in addition to insistence on higher standards of waste disposal.</P>
    <P>Major changes on the ground are visible compared to recent years.  More than 400 collection points for recyclable materials have been established around the country.  New landfills have been provided which embody sophisticated leachate and gas control systems.  The price of waste disposal is rising substantially as a result of the implementation of higher standards.  These higher costs in themselves provide an incentive to prevent and recycle waste.  There is a growing involvement of the private sector in Irish waste operations.</P>
    <P>The national strategy, &ldquo;Recycling for Ireland&rdquo;, has placed the promotion of recycling high on the Government's agenda.  The focus of this strategy is on the commercial and domestic waste streams.  It sets an overall target of diverting 20 per cent of this waste from landfill to recycling within five years, compared to the current diversion rate of only 8 per cent.  In line with the concept of producer responsibility, an industry task force was formed to respond to this strategy and to develop a mechanism whereby industry can deliver on the national recycling targets set by the Government.  The result was the launch last week of the REPAK initiative which commits Irish business and industry to a proactive and organised role in promoting recycling of packing wastes.</P>
    <P>A range of other measures and instruments is being developed to promote a more sustainable approach to waste management in Ireland.  These include the application of integrated pollution control licensing under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, for certain waste activities; development by the agency of criteria and procedures <Col N="237" /> for the selection, management, operation, closure and aftercare of landfill sites by local authorities; provision of EU co-financing, under the operational programme for environmental services 1994-99 of approximately £30 million to assist better waste planning and the provision of waste recovery and hazardous waste management facilities; a study by the Economic and Social Research Institute on economic elements of a strategy for optimal solid waste management in Ireland and for the use of economic instruments for environmental purposes, which was published in November 1995 and a major project on waste statistics which is being carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>All these responses show that many changes have already taken place in Ireland in favour of more progressive and sustainable approaches to waste management.  The Waste Management Bill is a new and major contribution to this process.  It is a framework proposal which will provide the necessary enabling and regulatory powers to apply and adapt policy measures in the face of changing environmental, economic. technical and administrative conditions. With the enactment of the Bill, Ireland's framework of environmental legislation will be substantially complete.</P>
    <P>Fundamental principles are clearly established in the Bill.  Many of the specific measures and obligations for which provision is made, together with many detailed technical standards and administrative procedures, will remain to be applied by way of secondary legislation, which will follow as a matter of priority after the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>The main objectives of the Bill are a more effective organisation of public authority functions in relation to waste management, involving new or redefined roles for the Minister for the Environment, the Environmental Protection Agency and local authorities; a range of measures which can be applied as necessary to improve our performance in relation to prevention, minimisation and recovery of wastes and a comprehensive <Col N="238" /> statutory framework for the applications of higher environmental standards in response to EU and national waste management requirements. I will first outline the Bill's structure and then describe some of its more important features.  I will be glad to respond at the conclusion of Second Stage to any points or queries Senators raise.</P>
    <P>The Bill is broadly structured in seven parts.  Part I contains standard provisions dealing with such matters as interpretation, regulations, offences, penalties and other general matters. There are also provisions regarding information, monitoring and inspection and the powers of authorised officers. Part II deals with waste management planning and provides for the making of a national hazardous waste management plan by the Environmental Protection Agency and for improved and systematic arrangements for local authority waste management plans.</P>
    <P>Part III provides a framework for wide ranging measures in support of waste prevention, minimisation and recovery.  Part IV provides for basic obligations on all holders of waste, including householders, to prevent environmental pollution and for the control of waste collection and the movement of waste internally and internationally. Part V provides for the establishment of an integrated licensing system to be operated by the Environmental Protection Agency in respect of major waste recovery and disposal activities and for alternative controls in respect of other lower risk activities.</P>
    <P>Part VI contains provisions allowing various measures to be taken to prevent or mitigate environmental pollution caused by waste, similar to equivalent provisions under air and water pollution legislation.  Part VII contains miscellaneous provisions and deals in particular with policy directions in relation to waste planning, licensing and the movement of waste, the authorisation of waste disposal under other enactments and powers to give effect to further EU obligations on waste.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> The First and Second Schedules specify categories of waste and hazardous waste.  The Third and Fourth Schedules specify waste recovery and disposal activities which are licensable, while the Fifth Schedule deals with repeals and revocations.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Bill as defined in Part I is very broad.  The Bill relates to all types of waste other than the specific wastes and waste activities excluded by section 3, which are already covered by existing legislation.  These exclusions relate principally to sewage and sewage effluent, radioactive wastes and dumping at sea, all of which are controlled under statutory codes already in force.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not extend to the reform and updating of the law on litter, which is at present contained in the Litter Act, 1982.  I am committed to this as a separate legislative proposal which I hope to publish within a matter of months.  I will return to the House with my proposals on litter in 1996.  Litter is different from a generality of waste &mdash; for example, it is difficult to ascribe ownership to it and it does not present the characteristics of toxicity associated with solid wastes which the Bill will control. It is generally dealt with separately from solid waste.  However, it is my intention on Committee Stage to bring forward amendments to the Waste Management Bill to replace and incorporate in waste legislation certain provisions of the Litter Act dealing with abandoned vehicles.  This issue is important enough to bring to the House immediately rather than wait for the litter Bill which will follow later this year.</P>
    <P>Part II provides for a more rigorous waste planning system involving, for the first time, a formal procedure for public consultation and input.  The present position is that county councils and county borough corporations are required to prepare waste management plans, in respect of both non-hazardous and &ldquo;special&rdquo; wastes.  The Bill provides that the Environmental Protection Agency will be required to prepare a national hazardous waste management <Col N="240" /> plan.  Other public authorities having a function in relation to hazardous waste will be required to have due regard to provisions contained in the national plan.  The agency will be empowered to issue specific recommendations to individual local authorities arising from this plan.</P>
    <P>County councils and county borough corporations will continue to prepare detailed waste management plans, either individually or jointly, to be reviewed every five years.  These plans will deal primarily with non-hazardous wastes.  A formal procedure for public consultation is being introduced to provide for public input before the preparation of a plan commences and again when a draft plan is available.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifies certain matters to be dealt with in waste and hazardous waste management plans.  Specifically, all waste management plans will be required to focus closely on the scope for waste prevention and waste recovery, including recycling.  The Minister will have power to specify in detail the form and content of local authority plans, to require local authorities to co-ordinate their plans or to make joint plans, and to require that a local authority plan may be varied.  These proposals are intended to significantly strengthen the function of planning for waste management.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains various innovative provisions aimed at minimising the production of waste and maximising the recovery of such waste as cannot be avoided.  Section 28 especially deals with waste prevention and represents the significant &ldquo;front-end&rdquo; approach to secure the avoidance of waste.  For the first time, there will be a general obligation on persons engaged in any agricultural, commercial or industrial activity to have regard to the need to minimise waste.</P>
    <P>The section provides for support programmes in respect of research and development projects and for the imposition of a range of possible regulatory measures.  These may include requirements on service, commercial or <Col N="241" /> industrial activity to carry out waste audits and waste reduction programmes, requirements on the producers to carry out life cycle assessments of the environmental impacts of their products and stringent controls upon the import, production or use of problematic substances or products.  They may also include the publication of reports by businesses as to the plans they have and the steps they have taken to comply with all these regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides for a range of measures to promote the recovery of waste, including important reserve powers for the Minister for the Environment. For example, the Minister will be empowered to introduce mandatory deposit and refund schemes, take-back requirements to be operated by producers or consumers and charges by retailers for products or packaging. Section 29 also provides for a scheme of recycling credits to be operated by local authorities.</P>
    <P>These powers would enable the Government and relevant environmental authorities to secure our national waste recycling objectives using a traditional command and control approach. However, the Government has decided not to adopt this approach in the first instance.  Instead, industry is being entrusted with responsibility to meet specific objectives on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of the new organisation, launched last week, REPAK, which will be run and financed by industry to co-ordinate and finance the collection and recycling of packaging waste.  Such voluntary, industry led recycling schemes have already achieved good results in other EU and OECD countries, and this voluntary arrangement between Government and industry may be the forerunner of other co-operative measures for the benefit of the environment.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that I am prepared to deploy all appropriate powers that will be available to me under the Bill in order to support the operation of voluntary schemes.  I will not accept a situation where an unfair burden <Col N="242" /> is carried by progressive businesses which participate voluntarily and responsibly in arrangements such as REPAK.  There will be no free rides for those companies who choose to be environmentally less sensitive.</P>
    <P>Fears were expressed in the other House on my approach on this issue, where I would, in the first instance, seek voluntary compliance.  The initial response from IBEC and the launch of REPAK has given me great heart and underscores the correctness of the approach to harness voluntary goodwill and support in the first instance. However, ultimately, I am seeking from the House a range of specific powers in the Bill to ensure that the targets are reached, if not by voluntary measures, then by enacting the statutory provision I am seeking.</P>
    <P>I expect public authorities to lead by example in relation to pursuing sustainable activity and demonstrating best environmental management practice through good housekeeping and environmentally sensitive procurement policies.  Sections 30 and 31 make appropriate provision in this regard.  Among other things, they require the Minister for the Environment to promulgate a comprehensive programme for the prevention, minimisation and recovery of waste by public authorities in carrying out their operations.</P>
    <P>Part IV relates to the holding, collection and movement of waste.  This Part contains some of the basic statutory provisions for environmental protection against irresponsible handling or disposal of waste.  Section 32 expressly prohibits any person from holding, recovering, transporting or disposing of waste in a manner which may cause environmental pollution.  It prohibits a person holding waste from handing the waste over to a person who is not properly authorised to deal with such waste.</P>
    <P>Part IV also clarifies and expands the role of local authorities in relation to waste collection.  In general, local authorities will be required to ensure that there is an adequate household waste collection service within their functional <Col N="243" /> area and, if necessary, to provide or arrange for the provision of necessary services.  Local authorities will be empowered to provide collection services for non-household wastes at their own discretion.  Waste collection services are increasingly being provided by commercial operators.  In order to ensure that these operations are carried out in an environmentally sound manner, the Bill provides that commercial collectors of waste will require a permit from the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will also be empowered to make bye-laws controlling the presentation of waste for collection within their areas.  Bye-laws could be used, for example, to regulate the time and manner for leaving out waste for collection.  We all see people leaving out plastic bags for collection days in advance.  They will have the power to make bye-laws to reduce litter and to facilitate the segregation and separation of recyclable wastes.  The Bill provides wide powers for the Environmental Protection Agency and major local authorities to control the movement of individual waste consignments within the country and internationally.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill relates to the provision and licensing of waste recovery and disposal facilities.  The major local authorities will have a statutory duty to ensure that there are adequate facilities for the recovery or disposal of domestic wastes arising in their areas, and will be empowered to provide any other infrastructure considered necessary for good waste management.</P>
    <P>A major organisational reform proposed in the Bill is that the Environmental Protection Agency will be made responsible for the licensing of all significant waste recovery and disposal facilities.  The present position is that county councils and county borough corporations are responsible for the planning, organisation, authorisation and supervision of waste operations in their functional areas.  These local authorities are, therefore, in the invidious position of being both poacher and <Col N="244" /> gamekeeper in relation to waste disposal. This situation does not foster public confidence in local authority landfills, some of which are known to be operating below acceptable standards.  It is more appropriate that waste disposal and recovery operations be licensed by a competent third party; the Environmental Protection Agency is the appropriate body, having the necessary expertise to fulfil this important regulatory role.</P>
    <P>Before granting a waste licence, the agency must be satisfied, among other things, that the best available technology not entailing excessive costs &mdash; BATNEEC &mdash; will be used to prevent, limit or reduce emissions from the activities concerned, that such emissions will comply with any relevant environmental standards and that the activity will not cause environmental pollution. The enforcement of waste licence conditions will be a matter for the agency.</P>
    <P>The agency will continue to operate the integrated pollution control licensing system established under the 1992 Act, where applicable, to control waste disposal activities.  Those activities, which are already licensable under the 1992 Act, will not require a licence under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill's provisions for public consultation and the making of objections in relation to licensing decisions are similar to those applying at present in relation to licences granted by the agency under the 1992 Act and reflect the need for meaningful public participation while also facilitating the speedy processing of licence applications.</P>
    <P>The recovery of sludges and natural, non-hazardous agricultural wastes will not need a waste licence.  The Minister for the Environment will have power under section 39 to exempt other specified waste activities from waste licensing and to apply other appropriate controls. For all these wastes, the Bill provides for the possibility of alternative regulatory controls to be implemented by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the licensing regime provided for under this Bill will <Col N="245" /> be rigorous and effective and will enable us to fully apply existing and prospective EU standards and requirements in relation to waste recovery and disposal in a manner which also engenders public confidence.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will be responsible for the day to day supervision of waste activities generally within their functional areas.  Offences under the Bill will carry maximum penalties of fines up to £1,500 and/or imprisonment for six months on summary conviction and of fines up to £10 million and/or imprisonment for ten years on conviction on indictment.  These penalties reflect the potential threat posed by improper waste management and are of an appropriate magnitude to act as a deterrent to would be polluters.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill contains a range of provisions for various purposes.  I refer in particular to section 64 which covers the provision of information in relation to the mass balance of substances used, consumed and released into the environment by particular processes.  The mass balance approach which is provided for in this section will ensure that a comprehensive range of information may be obtained to facilitate the preparation of a national toxics emissions inventory by the Environmental Protection Agency.  This is intended to improve the quantity and quality of information available to the public and to facilitate and encourage the progressive reduction of certain hazardous wastes.  There is a commitment in this regard in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    <P>A requirement on companies to report on their waste production for the purposes of a toxics release inventory has been shown in the United States and some other countries as a most effective means to promote waste reduction.  It has gained widespread support, including support from the companies, many of which were initially surprised at the magnitude of their releases into the environment and the potential for cost savings by reducing waste at source.  I had interesting discussions with major companies on this matter <Col N="246" /> and I detected a strong willingness to become involved in the analysis of their waste production at source.  There is a significant body of international opinion that reductions of toxic waste at source can best be achieved through a combination of legislative requirements to secure good quality data on problematic substances and voluntary measures targeted at these substances and wastes.</P>
    <P>The Waste Management Bill will have economic and financial implications for industrial, commercial, agricultural and consumer interests as well as public authorities.  Increased costs will arise as a consequence of more stringent regulatory standards for waste treatment and disposal as well as recycling obligations which we will impose.  The Bill will, therefore, impact financially on all of us, whether as taxpayers or consumers.  This is necessary so as to bring fuller pricing transparency to the impact of various consumer goods on the environment.  There is now widespread acceptance that the throw away society is not sustainable.  I am confident that Irish householders, consumers and businesses will accept their responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>We need a major conversion of public attitudes and behaviour towards the need for waste prevention.  We need also a significant increase in recycling performance, accompanies and supported by an expansion in and improvement of waste management facilities. Finally, there is scope for significant development of the private waste sector and for a more systematic application of the principles of shared responsibility, producer responsibility and that the polluter pays.  The Waste Management Bill is comprehensive and in many respects radical legislation which I believe will support all the objectives I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Globally each year 5.2 million people, including 4 million children, die from disease caused by the improper disposal of sewage and solid waste.  It has been estimated that the amount and <Col N="247" /> variety of waste could increase four or five fold by 2025 and waste disposal costs will double and treble by the end of the decade.  Against this background, it is time we put our legislative house in order and this Bill is a start.</P>
      <P>There has been widespread concern about waste and pollution in Ireland but little if any code of law on waste generally has been put in place.  Ireland has been much in arrears in the implementation of EU directives and not much progress has been made in advancing legislation to meet the current problems or face up to the challenges waste will present in the future.  The Public Health Acts of the last century and legislation to deal with specific problems are the only legislative arrangements in place. The time is, therefore, long overdue for a major overhaul of our legislation and this measure, complex though it is, is a vitally urgent and necessary start in that process.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a poor record in this area. Most waste is handled by local authorities and many dumps were carelessly located, badly managed and caused local distress and upset.  This poor record has had the result that waste disposal sites are feared and opposed by every community.  Problems are increasing at an alarming rate and speedy action is required to deal with them. Changing this poor record so that people can be positive rather than negative in matters of waste disposal and control is a huge problem and I am not certain the proposals before us will tackle that issue.  I fear that rather than resolving some of the matters, the legislation may complicate things.  Having studied it carefully, I feel the Bill is a recipe for continuing chaos and indecision on our problems.  Even the approach of the legislation is disconcerting. One reaches Part VI or VII of the Bill before it discusses issues relating to Part I.  This creates a recipe for confusion and there should be more direction in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will raise questions on various sections of the Bill &mdash; I will not query <Col N="248" /> every section but there is need for clarification which, if forthcoming, will mean it will not be necessary to table further amendments.  I am conscious of the number of amendments and changes made to the legislation since it was published and I thank the Minister for his assurance that he will be forthcoming in dealing with some of the amendments we wish to put forward.</P>
    <P>Section 3 excludes certain matters covered by various Acts, such as the Dumping at Sea Act, the Air Pollution Act and the Radiological Protection Act.  This is desirable because, in an area which is so complex, it is better to deal with specific issues with specific legislation than covering many issues in one Bill.</P>
    <P>I have some difficulty with the Bill before us because it endeavours to do too many things.  The result will be confusion about what is intended and the fear that important issues which need to be tackled quickly may not be covered. I suggest that in the interest of providing a comprehensive, clearly defined national policy, it is desirable to put in place a new pollution consolidation Act which would examine the various Acts and endeavour to consolidate the best of the current legislation with new proposals.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister of State were urged to look at what happened in the health and safety area in the 1980s.  At that time we had various Acts dealing with health and safety issues, from the Factories Act, 1955, to legislation in the early 1980s, but despite there being, or because there were, so many, they were not effective in minimising accidents and deaths at work.  A commission was established under Mr. Justice Barrington, which looked carefully at the body of legislation dealing with industrial measures and recommended a strategy which resulted in the progressive legislation to set up the Health and Safety Agency.  It is necessary to do something similar in this area and I suggest that, as soon as this Bill is passed, the Minister should adopt that approach and set up a task force or <Col N="249" /> body under a responsible chairperson who would look carefully at the legislation dealing with pollution, waste management and control and set down a way in which we can establish a national policy to deal effectively with the overall problems, so that people can see we are serious about the matter.</P>
    <P>There are many sections in the Bill in which the Minister seeks power to make regulations and some sections provide that he may make three sets of regulations. This indicates that the Department of the Environment and the other Departments involved are not clear what to do on some of these issues.  It could take two to three years to finalise some of these regulations and anyone with experience in this House will be aware that regulations proposed under past legislation took many years to be prepared and brought into operation. Whether this is because there is a clear view in Departments as to which way we should go, they need more time or the Bill has been rushed in order to take action to deal with the present crisis, I am not sure.</P>
    <P>The matters which it is proposed to regulate should be in the Bill because it would be easier to understand and implement if that was the case. Members will have seen the number and variety of regulations involved.  The Minister is in part endeavouring to regulate himself, although I do not know if he will succeed.</P>
    <P>Section 5 which deals with interpretations contains six pages of explanations. I have not seen its equivalent in a Bill for some time.  It is a cumbersome approach and the likelihood is that it may lead to oversights and omissions which could result in escape routes being provided to enable undesirable waste practices to be followed.  The Minister should have avoided this method of legislation which may be found to be flawed in many respects and inoperable.</P>
    <P>Section 6 repeals and revokes legislation which is being superseded by the provisions of this Bill.  I do not have the time or the expertise to examine all the <Col N="250" /> repeals but it would appear unwise when new legislation is not tried and tested to repeal existing legislation which may have stood the test of time and been effective to some degree.  Is it proposed to repeal some of the fisheries legislation dealing with waste and pollution? Fisheries have been severely damaged in the past by pollution and waste disposal in rivers and estuaries.  In bringing in new legislation which may well be challenged or found to be ineffective, it would appear unwise to repeal legislation already on the Statute Book which may have been used to bring successful prosecutions.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the need to repeal a lot of the legislation.  Will the Minister indicate if there are key provisions to be repealed which have been used successfully, in particular by fisheries authorities, in matters of pollution offences?  What is provided for in this Bill may not be as strong as the existing provisions which may be repealed.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the Minister to make regulations.  The regulations provided for in subsection (2) seem confusing and I am not sure as to the intention or the result of the enactment of section 7(2).</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for penalties for offences: fines of up to £1,500 on summary conviction and up to £10 million on indictment.  Are the fines for the same offences or for offences of different types?  Perhaps fines of such magnitude are needed and, if so, I support the principle fully.  However, if a figure, such as £10 million, has been picked out of the sky it brings legislation into disrepute and may result in people not taking us seriously.  Perhaps the Minister will explain that point when replying.</P>
    <P>With regard to penalties imposed for breaches of the pollution laws provision is made to have the fines paid to the local authorities.  Between what is to be repealed and what is to be added, it is difficult to work out what the Minister is trying to achieve, but I recommend that this power be extended.  There was a provision whereby fines for fisheries offences were paid to the fisheries board <Col N="251" /> for the area where the damage was done.  The Minister will be aware there have been serious problems in the past in relation to fish kills.  Substantial changes in legislation in that regard were made in the 1987-88 period.  I am not certain the provision will remain after this Bill is passed whereby part of the fine or the full fine is paid to the fishery board for the area in which the fish kill occurred rather than to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Over the years many local authorities were themselves convicted of causing serious pollution and serious damage to inland fisheries.  I agree with the Minister that the polluter should pay and if a local authority creates pollution and causes fish kills it should pay the penalty. I would like the Minister to insert a new section ensuring that where damages have been done to fisheries fines would be paid to the fisheries boards rather than to the local authority or in some cases divided between them.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 14 will the Minister clarify whether authorised officers will be covered effectively to gain access to premises or lands where there is a likelihood of pollution taking place and damage being done?  Some of them have been accused of trespassing and prevented from gaining access to trouble spots in the past.  I am not sure the necessary powers for authorised officers to enter lands or premises in connection with pollution problems are covered in section 14.</P>
    <P>Section 15 gives authorised officers powers to inspect premises but it should be extended to give the authority or agency power where there is sufficient evidence to close down immediately premises which may be causing pollution or will be likely to cause pollution. The section is comprehensive, long and detailed but seems to be inadequate on the specific point of having a decision as to whether a plant should be closed.</P>
    <P>The legislation seems to provide &ldquo;something for everyone in the audience&rdquo;<Col N="252" />&mdash; consumers, industry, local authorities, agencies, Ministers and courts were all involved.  Everybody seems to have responsibility but the buck does not seem to stop anywhere specific.  Section 19 provides the power to establish registers by the agency and the local authority.  It appears there will be a number of registers &mdash; the agency will have a register and the authority will have a register in each of their areas.  However, there will be a third set of registers for joint authorities.  I see the wisdom of more co-operation between the authorities and I welcome some of the provisions in the legislation whereby two or more authorities can get together.  This is the kernel of the problem in many areas.</P>
    <P>For example, in the mid-west region, Limerick city is bordered by Clare, North Tipperary and Limerick.  There are three authorities with three sets of sanitary service engineers, plans and planning authorities but no co-ordination between the three on the approach to be adopted on big issues, such as services for Limerick city.  Consultancy work has been undertaken on that matter for the past four or five years.  Responsibility for Limerick city is divided between Limerick Corporation, Limerick County Council and Clare County Council.  The city has a number of serious pollution problems.  There are also deep rooted planning problems about the future expansion and development of the city due to the lack of a clear, overall policy between the agencies.</P>
    <P>Under this section there will be three sets of registers.  That is a problem which will lead to further confusion and disagreement between the agencies and the authorities as to who has the jurisdiction and who is responsible and carries the can.  In the broader view it might be more desirable to have just one agency &mdash; perhaps not the Environmental Protection Agency but a national waste disposal authority &mdash; with a plan which would be available to the agency and the various authorities.  I recognise, of course, that certain areas would have <Col N="253" /> individual problems but that could be catered for.  This problem about functions and responsibilities also arises in section 21.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 19(5), I disagree that the register should not have to be produced where necessary.  Under the subsection, extracts from the register may be given rather than having to produce the register itself.  Where the greatest co-operation is sought with communities and other interested parties, the fullest disclosure of information is the best practice to adopt rather than being selective about what people have access to.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 and 20, under which the agency, authorities and joint authorities have responsibility, is a recipe for people to wrangle and pass the buck.  At the end of the day, it will come back to the Minister's desk.  At that stage, he might examine it to see if it can be improved.</P>
    <P>Section 22, which deals with the preparation of waste management plans, is one of the key sections in the Bill.  As far as I can see, there is no time frame for the production of the first plan. However, there is a time frame for having a second look at the plan.  Without a time limit, a plan need not be put in place for the next five years.  I read the Bill fairly carefully and I would like the Minister to show me where it states a time limit for the production of the plan. I am inclined to table an amendment to this section that any such plan should be produced or published within one year of the Bill being enacted.  I ask for the Minister's guidance.</P>
    <P>That plan is one of the key planks of this legislation.  However, I do not see any procedures put in place for people to comment on or raise objections to aspects of the plan.  In another section of the Bill there are several clearly defined subsections dealing with the handling of objections to the agency and its plans. However, I do not see any arrangements for people with genuine grievances to have an opportunity to comment on or suggest changes to the published plan.  A time limit could be <Col N="254" /> put on the examination of such representations. Such a provision is essential in the Bill because these plans will need a great deal of local community support if they are to be successful.  At present, there is no great support for waste management proposals &mdash; in fact, the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>Public confidence must be restored and people must have an input into these plans.  I strongly suggest that a mechanism be put in place so that people could effectively put genuine grievances or opinions on the hazardous and general waste plans to those preparing the plans.  Under section 24, the Minister has very strong powers and can, essentially, scrap any plan.  I would not like to be the Minister in a situation where all sorts of pressures could be brought to bear on him to scrap a plan if a genuine local concern was not taken into account when the plan was being prepared.  Some provision must be inserted to allow people to express genuine grievances &mdash; and I am not referring to the kind of grievances which arose over Mullaghmore &mdash; in regard to these plans.</P>
    <P>I agree with some speakers in the other House that section 28, which deals with waste prevention, is the most important section in the Bill.  That section is weak and indecisive and needs to be strengthened.  It lacks the vigour which will be needed to bring this Bill to life.  If this Bill is to achieve the aims and objectives of the Minister and his Department, the section dealing with the prevention of waste needs great attention as it is the weakest section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In his contribution this afternoon, the Minister mentioned the financial provisions and implications but he carefully avoided giving any figures.  The major inadequacy in this legislation is that no indication is given of the level of Government financial commitment which will underpin it.  Over the years, we have debated several Bills, such as the IDA legislation, into which specific financial commitments and provisions were written.  There is a necessity to <Col N="255" /> write into this Bill a specific amount, even if it is only £25 million or £50 million, to underline the Minister's commitment. There are reliable estimates that the cost of implementing these measures will be in the region of £250 million.  I will not enter into forecasting possible figures.  We tried to avoid doing so in relation to Foynes Harbour where the figure forecast was £1.5 billion. There was such a huge variation in the figures for Foynes that people wondered whether the entire exercise was a gimmick.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wishes to gain public confidence in implementing this legislation, it is vitally important that he provide a section to deal with funding.  The Bill refers to funding but makes no financial commitment.  I cannot table amendments in this regard because they would be ruled out of order.  I ask the Minister to include a figure for funding, similar to that provided in the IDA legislation.  The Minister could return to the House at a future date for the purpose of placing financial limits on the provisions of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Most of the other sections are self-explanatory. Section 34 deals with waste collection permits and is comprehensive in this regard.  However, it could be improved by providing for a certificate of fitness for premises to be obtained through the District Court.  Objections could, therefore, be raised in the courts while an application for such a certificate is under consideration.  Provision should also be made in the section for an inspectorate.</P>
    <P>Sections 42 to 50 set down the procedure for dealing with objections and how objections to waste permits and licences can be raised.  That type of mechanism is necessary to deal with issues such as the preparation of hazardous waste management plans.  Overall, the Minister has endeavoured, where no precedents existed, to introduce quite a complicated and complex piece of legislation; in so far as it might be improved, I support it.  I strongly urge that the <Col N="256" /> Minister consider having this area of legislation investigated by a specialist team.  This might take a year but it would be time well spent.  I believe the recommendations of that team would have consequences that will see us safely into the next millennium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope there is no connection between my first contribution to the business of this House and an in-depth discussion of waste.  If someone had informed me a year ago that I would be speaking to the Seanad for the first time on the Waste Bill, I would have said they had two heads.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Waste Management Bill and congratulate the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, on his contribution.  I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, and congratulate her on the work she is doing in relation to housing and urban renewal.  I am aware that this work is progressing with great speed in her Department.</P>
      <P>The Waste Management Bill, which was passed by the Dáil last year, represents an important first step by this Legislature to tackle the mounting problem of waste.  I believe this legislation has support from all sides of the House.  The Bill is long overdue and, when enacted, will provide a co-ordinated plan to tackle the waste problem. There can be little doubt that the ever increasing level of waste produced by a modern industrial society is causing considerable strain on our environment.  If we do not act quickly, future generations will suffer greatly from our inertia in this area.  Choking up spaces and landfill sites with waste is simply untenable. The introduction of this Bill will begin to deal with a problem which needs to be arrested quickly in an effective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest figures on waste in Ireland tell a simple but sad story.  As a society we produce in the region of 1.7 million tonnes of waste per year.  Sadly, a mere 124,000 tonnes of that waste is recycled. The present recycling rate of 7.4 per cent needs to be dramatically increased <Col N="257" /> in the near future if we are to begin to alter the patterns of waste.  The Minister's target to achieve a recycling rate of 20 per cent within five years, while criticised in some quarters as minimalist, is achievable and realistic.  If, within five years, we could show that law enacted by the Oireachtas led to an increased recycling rate from 7.4 per cent to 20 per cent, then that legislation could be correctly described as a valuable tool in the fight against waste.  The stated objective of 20 per cent by 2001 can be achieved as a result of this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that prevention is preferable to a cure but that will not happen immediately.  Every effort must be made to reuse and recycle and the entire focus of the Bill is to achieve that end.  Central to increasing recycling rates, thereby reducing our dependency on landfill sites, must be a programme of education through public awareness.  Preventing waste involves all aspects of society.  The responsibility lies with everyone.  By their actions, domestic and industrial consumers create Ireland's 1.7 million tonnes of waste per annum.  The passage of law alone will not alter the chronic problem of waste but it can co-ordinate the service and create the incentives required to change present patterns of activity.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of personal choice and responsibility.  When consumers realise that 66 per cent of the entire waste produced in Ireland can be recycled and reused, we will see that radical yearly increases in the recycling rate can be achieved within a short period.  When one considers that waste connected to packaging comprises 400,000 &mdash; 25 per cent &mdash; of all domestic and commercial waste generated in Ireland, it becomes apparent that consumers can make a dramatic impact on waste reduction by simply reusing one of the millions of plastic bags in existence.  However, that is a matter of personal choice.  At present, people are not making the correct choice.</P>
    <P>The same argument exists in terms of paper and the excessive waste of that <Col N="258" /> commodity in our society.  It takes 17 trees to make one tonne of paper.  On current figures, we waste close to 380,000 tonnes of paper per annum. This means that 6.5 million trees are wasted in Ireland annually.  The scandal of paper waste is compounded when we consider that all paper is recyclable and reusable.</P>
    <P>The same argument exists in the case of glass which can also be recycled effectively.  For every tonne of wasted glass, 135 litres of oil can be replaced. Aluminium cans are also recyclable at only 5 per cent of the amount of energy required to produce a can from raw material.  Every commodity, such as plastic bags, paper, glass and aluminium materials, can be recycled quickly if people only took the trouble to separate their rubbish.  Where people are making that effort, the opportunity must exist for proper depositing of materials for recycling.</P>
    <P>The network of bottle banks are, in my view, thinly spread throughout our community.  Access to depositing sites in this city would seem to depend more upon one's postal address and consumers living at Dublin postal addresses in their late teens and early twenties would seem to have less opportunity to deposit domestic waste for recycling purposes through bottle banks, etc. than those living at other postal addresses in this city.  If people are going to make the effort, depositing sites for recycling need to be readily available.  While I recognise the success of Rehab and Kerbside, we need to increase the availability of these services to the domestic consumer on a much more effective and elaborate basis.  In fact, as more recycling opportunities occur, they will lead to better economies of scale; and this is evident, in particular, in the south-west of the city if one looks at the Kerbside example.</P>
    <P>One of the principal features of this Bill is the public support which I believe it attracts innately.  Indeed, as is the case in many aspects of environmental policy, it was public demand which first started the campaign to recycle some <Col N="259" /> years ago.  It is a case where the public were ahead of the politicians ten or 15 years ago in their call to increase recycling activities.  This Bill is in response to that public demand for legislation in this area and, when enacted, it will constitute one of the most comprehensive bodies of law surrounding waste management and prevention in Europe.</P>
    <P>Popular support for preventing and recycling waste is important.  It was in many respects the same support which produced the consumer pressure which led to 90 per cent of aerosol canisters now being free of CFC gases and other ozone damaging substances.  It was the same support which produced worldwide pressure on Shell to prevent the dumping of the Brent Spar at sea. Indeed, it could be argued that the international condemnation of France following nuclear tests at Mururoa came about directly as a result of public demand and pressure.  The same could be said in relation to Sellafield, where a popular movement of people demanded a change of policy from the British Government.</P>
    <P>There is now a genuine realisation that tampering with our environment will not only create huge problems for today's world but could bring irreparable damage to future generations.  The demand to reduce all forms of waste, to streamline the response of Government and agencies and to embark seriously on a campaign of reuse and recycle has come in the main from the public and, in particular, young people.  The publication and successful enactment of this Waste Management Bill will be a testimony to people power.</P>
    <P>Another feature of this Bill is the increasing powers that are now being devolved to local authorities.  The Waste Management Bill is a piece of legislation which constitutes an active devolution of power to a level of authority where real progress can be made in relation to waste production.  Dublin Departments of State and their agencies who monitor this problem can put in place a body of <Col N="260" /> law to deal with the problem, but it requires a hands-on approach from local authorities to ensure the policy is being implemented successfully.  I welcome the increased powers for county councils and corporations which will put a huge onus on them, along with the Environmental Protection Agency, to deliver results.</P>
    <P>Increasing powers at local level brings with it responsibilities.  I hope this is matched by the ability of a local authority to enforce new law and that rests on central Government freeing up resources for local government.  I await eagerly the report of the Local Government Commission and, in particular, its recommendations with regard to local government funding because both issues &mdash; increasing regulatory powers and the ability to enforce those powers &mdash; are related to the present debate on local government reform.  I am conscious of the fact that all parties in both Houses favour the reform of local government and would encourage the Minister and Minister of State at the Department to speed that process up so that this House can have a chance to discuss that reform package in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill to require local authorities to produce a waste management plan is particularly welcome. Local and central government requires a clear plan in order to achieve the levels of waste reduction targeted. Senator Daly stated that the public were not involved in this process, but from my understanding and reading of the Bill there is a specific reference to public participation.  With an increased and better planning process, I suspect many of the controversies we have seen in the past could be abated at a stage which involves the public.</P>
    <P>I note the Bill encourages a number of local authorities to work together on specific aspects of waste management. This is also welcome as frequently the problem of siting landfill spaces requires the co-ordination of a number of local authorities working at a regional level. Local authorities will soon have the power to make by-laws requiring those <Col N="261" /> holding waste to present such waste in a manner specified in the by-law, and this is a welcome move also.</P>
    <P>In particular, I am glad to see that a court imposing a fine on waste defaulters has now the power to make that fine payable to the local authority in whose functional area the default has taken place.  I hope county managers and officials see this as a revenue generating exercise.</P>
    <P>From the above comments Members can see that I believe this Bill has some important new powers for local authorities but I would stress that for the proper monitoring and enforcement measures to be successful additional income must come from central to local government.  Financial support from the European Union in terms of developing recycling infrastructure and helping local authorities to develop strategies for waste recovery can assist greatly this arm of local government enforcement.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined the important features of people power and a real devolution of power which is central to the Bill but there is another feature which is worth dwelling on.  Principally, this Bill will bring Ireland into line with Europe-wide standards in this area.  The problem, as I said at the outset, is an international one and should be treated as such.  The occasion of Ireland's Presidency of the EU later this year provides the Government with an opportunity to underline the problem throughout Europe and to concentrate the minds of all EU states on achieving our common objectives.</P>
    <P>The recent decision by An Bord Pleanála to turn down the proposed dump at Mulhuddart, County Dublin, has highlighted the problem of finding suitable locations for such sites.  One might ask &ldquo;Can any suitable site be found for refuse dumping?&rdquo; Unfortunately, despite the slow progress of our recycling programme, landfill sites will still continue to play a major part in waste management in the years ahead. The Bill before the House today makes exacting requirements on operators and local authorities to enforce the highest <Col N="262" /> possible standards in waste disposal. These, added to the technology that now surrounds major landfill sites, may help to alleviate some fears among local communities concerning the siting of dumps, but in my view the only way to proceed with future sites is to enhance the planning stage by maximising the level of public participation in that process. Frankly, it is unseemly that all decisions about future landfill sites should be determined by the courts.  It is possibly a result of the poor planning which has gone on in this area for far too long.  I hope the waste management and planning processes as proposed in this Bill will go some way towards defusing the problem in years to come.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent announcement by IBEC that a voluntary initiative, called REPAK, will soon be established to help and support industry in recycling packaging waste.  Producers, manufacturers and retailers have, in one sense, a greater responsibility than the domestic consumer, first, to show a lead in recycling and, second, to achieve targets quickly in terms of waste management policy.  A recovery rate of 25 per cent by the year 2001 should be achieved by Irish industry before the five year date. I welcome the comments by the Minister that mandatory measures will apply where such recovery rates are not achieved.  This could be called the ministerial carrot and stick approach, which, I am sure, will achieve its desired effects on all concerned.</P>
    <P>There can be little doubt that the recycling industry is a growing industry in Ireland.  The emergence of new firms in this area can help to create much needed employment while also helping the environment by reducing our dependency on traditional methods of waste disposal.  However, like all emerging industries, certain incentives are required.  I find it difficult to understand, therefore, why a recycling company pays the higher service industry rate of 38 per cent tax rather than the manufacturing rate of 10 per cent tax. Surely we could argue that the service provided by recyling rubbish, which is of <Col N="263" /> benefit to the economy and the environment, should be recognised by an incentive based tax code.  I would be grateful if the Minister could respond to that point.</P>
    <P>It is important that this legislation is passed by the Seanad.  I note that a number of amendments were passed on Committee Stage in the Dáil and I am sure we will facilitate the Minister and the debate in this Chamber by looking at all amendments proposed on Committee Stage.  The Waste Bill is a first step by the Government to prioritise the problem of waste and to start the process of changing public and commercial attitudes to the issue of waste prevention. Rampant consumerism has created many problems in our society.  The enactment of this Bill will begin to tip the balance in favour of the environment, albeit in a slow but targeted way.  We face a difficult task, but armed with this legislation real progress can be made to reduce waste mountains.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, and the speech by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin.  I also sincerely congratulate Senator Hayes on a maiden speech which was a delight to listen to not only for its content but the style in which it was delivered.  We look forward to many more such speeches.  It is delightful to see somebody of an age that is considerably less than the average age of the House start with such style; it holds out great hope for the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes referred to people power &mdash; and I was excited to hear the early reference to that subject &mdash; and the achievement of the abolition of CFCs, which came about because the public refused to accept them.  That is an important point because, as the Senator said, the public was ahead of the politicians in this regard.  That is something <Col N="264" /> we must take into account in looking at this Bill.  If the Bill is to work, it will do so because it has public support.  The onus is on this House, as it was on the other House, to examine the Bill critically with the aim of improving it, making it acceptable and ensuring that it will achieve what it sets out to achieve.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken the first steps in that direction, and has done so effectively, both in the manner in which he presented the Bill in the Dáil, where he accepted amendments to it, and in his intention, which he stated in the House today, to return with the Bill to the other House.  The fact that he intends to go back to the other House means it will be easier for him to accept amendments from this House.  We should examine the Bill carefully, critically and enthusiastically in order to improve it.</P>
    <P>Most of what I wish to say about this Bill touches, in one way or another, on competitiveness &mdash; our ability to compete as a nation and the ability of each company in Ireland to compete fairly with each other.  Compliance with the Bill when it becomes law will add to the costs of Irish industry; there is no dispute about that and the Minister recognised that fact in his speech.  When there is an increase in costs the usual end result is that our competitiveness is weakened.  That is the worrying aspect about the way we have, over a number of years, systematically increased the cost of employing people.  In this case, however, I do not foresee that result although there might be problem cases.</P>
    <P>Putting in place an effective waste management policy would, if it were successful, make this country more rather than less competitive.  Take, for example, the challenge of attracting foreign investment which is so crucial to our future growth.  We do not want to lure into Ireland companies which are looking for a haven that has a lax attitude to the environment.  Such companies can find plenty of locations in eastern Europe and in the third world.  They have cost structures that we could never compete with anyway.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> The companies we are trying to attract are the responsible companies, not the cowboys.  One of the things responsible companies seek when they are considering an industrial location is a strong and effective waste management regime.  They want rules that are clear, transparent and fairly applied. They want certainty and they want to know where they stand.  Responsible companies do not have a problem with a country that sets a high standard and priority in protecting the environment. They know that in the long run such a priority is good business for them as well.</P>
    <P>Up to now Ireland has been behind the curve in these matters; we have had no systematic policy on waste management. Instead we have had massive uncertainty.  Investors locating in this country have often been faced with running battles with objectors which have carried on for years and, in some cases, the potential investor has given up and gone elsewhere.  This has happened not because we were too strict but because our approach was too hit and miss.  We are behind European Union norms on this issue and we are certainly behind American practice.  That position cannot be sustained in the long run because any slight cost advantage we might have in the absence of proper waste management is only temporary.  In the long run it would carry a very high price.</P>
    <P>Whether companies are Irish or foreign owned, in terms of waste management compliance they will only be catching up on their counterparts in the rest of Europe and the United States. We are not going out on a limb by putting in place a waste management policy. On the contrary, we are merely accepting the rules that are already applied by most of those countries with whom we deal.  If anything, we should be ahead of the pack because of the critical importance of tourism to our job creation possibilities.</P>
    <P>People tend not to appreciate how important the environment is to tourism until it is too late.  When Bord Fáilte asks visitors to outline the problems <Col N="266" /> they encounter in Ireland, litter and indiscriminate dumping always come close to the top of the list.  Our attitude to litter is symptomatic of our attitude to waste in general.  It is not something in our culture we have seriously addressed as yet and, from that point of view, I was delighted to hear the Minister promise that he will introduce the Litter Bill later this year.  Now is the time to begin to do something.  The question is, how?  That is our business today.  I welcome this Bill and what I understand its intentions to be.  I hope that in the course of its passage through the House we can, in co-operation with the Minister, improve the Bill.  By saying &ldquo;improve the Bill&rdquo; I do not mean that we should water it down in any way but make it more effective in what it is trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>I have a number of queries about the Bill.  The Bill gives local authorities a great deal of attention and power.  That is wise.  There is also a provision which was added by the Dáil &mdash; which is what I mean by improving the Bill &mdash; for a consultation process.  However, I do not see any provision for an appeal process. The lack of an appeal process is an example of the type of thing we should look out for in order to see if we can improve the Bill during its passage through the House.  However, that is a matter for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to focus on another aspect of competitiveness, from the perspective of my experience in this matter.  Manufacturing industry is one source of waste, the distribution chain is another.  In many ways, the waste created along the distribution chain is more visible because it is around us and we see it every day.  A good deal of what goes into our dustbins and ends up in landfills consists of packaging.  The Minister said he is aiming over five years to reduce by 20 per cent the household waste which goes into landfills.  I believe this is achievable in less than five years if we obtain public enthusiasm for this goal.  Responsible companies have always been concerned about this issue. For almost as long as I have been in <Col N="267" /> business, our company has taken initiatives on recycling.  However, one company taking such an initiative is not enough.  The Minister should ensure that we do not have freeloaders.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, because we listened carefully to our customers, we tried to reduce the amount of plastic bags we issued by charging a penny for each one. We contacted our competitors to ask them if they would do the same from the following Monday.  They were unsure and asked if they did so would their competitors do the same.  For one week we charged for plastic bags; this was a little gesture in the right direction. However, customers found this hard to take.  Some customers who spent £50 or £60 in our supermarkets and were asked to pay another 6p for plastic bags said they would never shop with us again if they had to pay this extra amount.  At the end of the week we again contacted our competitors but nothing happened. It is impossible to expect enthusiasm and people power on their own to work without some form of cohesion behind them.</P>
    <P>I am a founder member of Kerbside, which is a pilot project in Dublin.  We found that what we can do is constrained by what other people in the business are prepared to do.  Recycling initiatives cost money; in the case of Kerbside a great deal of money.  Kerbside does not pay for itself; if recycling paid for itself it would have been done many years ago.  A company would not get far in recycling initiatives before it would find its costs getting out of line with those of its competition.  It cannot do this and stay in business.  Those who support Kerbside need to make sure that everybody else shares these costs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recognition in the Bill &mdash; and the debate on it over the past year &mdash; that freeloaders, to use the Minister's words, exist; they not only exist but hold back progress.  They tend to dictate the pace at which we can move forward.</P>
    <P>In making progress there is room for both the carrot and the stick.  I hope the <Col N="268" /> stick will remain a distant threat in the background but I recognise it has to be there.  The most effective waste management regime will run itself because policing powers will rarely be exercised. This Bill should have a strong stick; the sword of Damocles should be held over our heads and come down on us if we do not behave.  This is a good system and will encourage us to work because we do not want that sword to fall on us.</P>
    <P>I have a number of concerns which will probably be raised on Committee Stage.  I fear that unless we thoroughly consider this Bill it will not attract the necessary support.  I received a letter yesterday which reflects confusion about this problem and attempts to deal with it in such a way that we end up with three times the necessary costs.  The burden of costs is eventually imposed on the final customer.  This letter was from a worthy charity which believes it can set up an operation for the collection of waste newspapers.  It asked if we would allow them have a number of units in our supermarkets for people to deposit such waste paper.  However, we already have seven other containers in our car parks for the deposit and collection of brown, green and clear bottles, aluminium, clothing and other items.</P>
    <P>This is worthy and worthwhile but there is also Kerbside and collections by local authorities.  In many areas there are three alternative ways of achieving recycling.  Is this the correct way to proceed? Adding another recycling unit in every supermarket car park, particularly ones with limited car parking spaces, will add to costs.  I am not sure this is the way to face up to the difficulties of recycling.</P>
    <P>Section 29 (4) confers on local authorities the power to force every shop to provide a receptacle to take back any waste, not just waste created in that shop.  This is a powerful weapon to give a local authority.  How can we prevent local authorities from abusing this power because they may be tempted to do so at some stage?  We should examine this issue in more detail later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> We should create a framework with a carrot and a stick.  There should be a threat that if we as a nation do not behave there will be a cost.  We should scrutinise the Bill in this light.  We should bear in mind that we cannot solve all problems merely by passing Bills.  Legislation must be practical and capable of working on the ground.  I sense some wishful thinking and pious aspirations in some aspects of the Bill. Things which look good on paper and with which we all agree in principle may be difficult or impossible to apply.</P>
    <P>The power to demand that supermarkets should charge for plastic bags is an example.  This proposal is understandable and worthy of support but we must face up to the reality that a customer who spends £80 and is asked for another 8p for plastic bags may refuse to pay and walk out of the supermarket. This power is unenforceable because a supermarket will charge such a customer 8p but will give him something else worth 8p in its place.  This objective is understandable but it will be difficult to enforce.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this power should not be included in the Bill as a threat but we should not assume that by passing legislation everything will fall into place.  In a competitive market people in business who are anxious to hold on to customers will take any steps they can to do so and it will be difficult to implement a law the aim of which is to enforce something which is not easily enforceable.</P>
    <P>I welcome an aspect of the Bill which deserves highlighting again and again. When it comes to waste everybody wants something to be done but always by someone else.  St. Augustine said &ldquo;make me pure but not yet&rdquo;.  We must educate citizens and ourselves so that we understand what we are talking about.</P>
    <P>I regularly raise the issue of plastic bags at meetings with customers.  They also raise this matter and ask why supermarkets give away so many plastic bags. We do so because customers want them. Some customers are alert to the situation, <Col N="270" /> refuse to accept plastic bags and bring back the same unit over and over again.  People asked if we could avoid plastic bags so, a few years ago we gave a large order for paper bags.  They cost 6p a bag, which is much more than the cost of a plastic bag, so we decided to charge 2p per bag.  However, only four out of every hundred customers were willing to pay for it, yet many customers say something should be done about plastic bags.  Since we had ordered many paper bags and had to get rid of them, we decided to give them free of charge. The number using them then went up to 15 out of every hundred people.  While the other 85 per hundred said that something should be done about those nasty plastic bags, they did not want to be involved, which brings me back to St. Augustine.  The way around that is by educating and convincing the public about what to do and we can manage to do that if we work hard.</P>
    <P>Another area of education is in pointing out the difference between recycling and reusing.  A number of customers tell me they recycle their plastic bags by using them as a lining for their bins when they put their rubbish into it.  That is not recycling.  That plastic bag still goes into the landfill &mdash; we cannot use the word &ldquo;dump&rdquo; anymore &mdash; is not biodegradable and stays there for a long time.  However, we can solve this problem once the community gets behind it. Everybody, from the manufacturer through the distribution chain down to the customer, has a responsibility and a part to play.  The real message we must get across is that we must adopt this change of attitude.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic about the recycling targets set by the Minister.  If we put our minds to it, we can achieve them within the timescale the Minister has in mind. It will require us to change our culture, attitudes and behaviour.  However, while we have to do a lot, it should not be impossible or even unduly difficult and we are taking steps in the right direction with this Bill.  There are important benefits for our country if we set ourselves to that task and even more <Col N="271" /> benefits if we succeed in achieving them.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House and urge it to give it serious attention as it goes through its various Stages.  It will be improved if we do so and I look forward to a satisfactory Bill at the end of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the arrival of the Bill and I commend the Minister for the manner in which he has taken it through the Dáil.  The Minister said he is prepared to adopt a similar approach to the passage of the Bill through this House as he did in the Dáil and this is also to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>If a young person got a big paper bag in a shop many years ago, they would not throw it away; instead he would bring it home and it was often useful for covering a book.  The shoe box also used to be a prized container that was kept. Much better care was taken of these items in the past than now.  We are living in the disposable and throwaway era.  Rubbish is rubbish and while sanitary infills and landfill sites are nice words, we are essentially saying the same thing.  The rubbish we build up must be disposed of but it is expensive to do this.</P>
      <P>The environment has loomed large in political debate in recent years.  It is appropriate we take action on this issue and this legislation makes a good start. For many years, we have concentrated on securing the economic growth necessary to provide decent living standards for all our people but until recently we paid little attention to how that growth affected our environment.  Consequently, the rise in public concern is both understandable and welcome.  As the Minister pointed out, economic development must be environmentally sustainable.  If it is not, it defeats its own purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Objections are made against economic growth projects by people who object to everything.  That culture must stop.  There will be no prosperity without economic growth and while objections <Col N="272" /> may be justifiable in some cases, they can be taken too far.</P>
    <P>The objectives of this Bill are to prevent and reduce waste production, to encourage and assist the recycling and recovery of waste and to apply strict control on the collection, movement and disposal of waste to reduce the risk to the environment.  These objectives are a direct response to the ongoing increase in waste which affects not only this country but the world at large.  Waste management must be seen in this context. If we are to keep the situation under control, action must be taken now.  In 1994, £65 million was spent, mainly by local authorities, on waste management and disposal.  This was in response to the production of 9 million tonnes of municipal and industrial waste and these figures do not take other forms of waste &mdash; for example, agricultural waste &mdash; into account.</P>
    <P>As environmental problems are worldwide it is necessary to devise appropriate responses on a supranational level.  The EU directive in this area dates back to 1991 and Ireland must do its duty under this directive.  As with crime where the best cure is prevention, so it is with waste management. Appropriately the EU directive puts the prevention of waste production at the top of its priorities.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council held a seminar on waste management strategy at the beginning of last year.  It was of tremendous interest to members of the council and the public and formed the basis for the plan by the local authority, together with Cork Corporation, to deal with the waste problem in Cork city and county.</P>
    <P>We are also aware of the growth of local initiatives which deal with waste control and recycling.  I want to refer to a campaign organised with schools called &ldquo;Canpaign&rdquo;.  Children are encouraged to collect and store cans which are then sent for recycling.  Every year we make a presentation to the schools that had the biggest collection of cans in our local authority area.  Representatives from the recycling group show the children the number of cans in <Col N="273" /> a cubic foot of recycled metal and great interest is taken.  Having a campaign like this makes them conscious of the value of protecting the environment by collecting and recycling cans.</P>
    <P>The number of submissions made by organisations around the country is a testament to the interest in waste control and recycling.  The Minister has estimated there are currently up to 400 recycling collection points around the country.  This is a welcome development and that number will undoubtedly continue to increase.  The Government and its predecessor have also acted.  The REPAK initiative, in conjunction with IBEC announced by the Minister last week, rightfully seeks to involve the business community in waste management. After all, that community produces the biggest volume of waste. In our scattered rural areas, the collection of waste can be very expensive and cause problems.</P>
    <P>The national recycling strategy, <i>Recycling in Ireland,</i> sets an ambitious programme to increase the amount of waste being recycled, from the current figure of 8 per cent to 20 per cent.  The aim of this proposal is to divert waste away from landfill sites to recycling. Nobody in this House will underestimate the importance of this task, given growing public discontent at the location of landfill sites.  Every Senator here and every member of a local authority will be aware that if there is even a suggestion of a dump coming into an area, there is immediate bedlam in the area and thousands of objections are immediately lodged.  If a county council official is seen looking in over a fence and there is a suspicion that a dump might be located in that place, there are objections.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn mentioned the idea that &ldquo;it must be done but it is not my responsibility&rdquo; a few minutes ago.  We all produce waste and this waste must be disposed of.  Whether we like it or not we must have landfill sites and they must be located locally.  Each major centre of population should have its own <Col N="274" /> dump.  The cost of transport means there is no point dumping waste too far away.  Fears could be allayed by proper planning and development of a site and by showing the public at an early stage what would be involved.  There is huge cost involved.  Sometimes local authorities consider buying a farm and very often landowners in farms adjacent to the land bought have to be compensated for the damage the dump might do them.  We have to bear in mind that for the present and future, however much recycling, recovery and collection goes on, some waste will have to be disposed of in landfill sites.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House is intended to complement and further develop measures already in place.  It sets the foundation for a complete programme of waste management in this State.  No doubt new requirements will arise with the passage of time.  I am pleased to note that the Minister recognises this and has committed himself to introducing secondary legislation as required.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal contained in Part II of the Bill to introduce a waste management plan under the auspices of the Environmental Protection Agency. This plan would focus its attention on waste prevention and recovery and will operate in conjunction with plans developed by local authorities.  The strengthening of the powers of the agency to intervene in the existing system of local authority plans should solve the problem of different standards applying in various parts of the country. Waste management costs money and it is essential if the plan is to be a success that everybody is forced to operate under the same rules.</P>
    <P>Section 28 deals with obligations on individuals to take account of waste prevention in their respective fields, be they commercial, agricultural or industrial. I am pleased that the section also provides for support programmes and the issuing of regulations.  If the legislation is to be a success it is essential that those involved are aware of their obligations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> Section 29 is particularly interesting. While the section allows the Minister to introduce obligations relating to the recovery of waste, the Minister has decided not to go down this road as yet. The REPAK scheme puts this particular aspect of waste recovery in the hands of the individual participants themselves. It is an interesting experiment and I hope it will be successful.  The Minister has referred to the success of similar schemes elsewhere.  If this turns out to be the case in this country we may find it possible to increase the targets set out in the programme this far.</P>
    <P>With the disposal of waste in other countries many people are now becoming conscious of the fact that a common dustbin is no longer enough.  It is important to have a few containers for different items.  If these can be segregated, very often some waste can be used in the garden, more can be burned, some can be recycled and then there will be some pure waste that might have to be disposed of in a landfill.  If that idea can be developed, it will be of great help for the future.</P>
    <P>There has sometimes been a tradition in this country to exclude public bodies from the obligations imposed on the rest of us.  That trend has been reversed in recent years and is rightly contained in this Bill.  Public bodies like local authorities are prime actors in our economy and if the aims of the Bill are to be achieved, they not only have to be included but must also set example for others.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the problem that arises in our towns relating to litter. When visiting foreign countries, I have seen some villages &mdash; I refer mainly to the Lake District in Cumbria in the North of England &mdash; where you would not find even a match stick thrown on the ground.  People are very conscious that cleanliness helps tourism.  The tidy towns idea was very good but people here are beginning to get careless about it.  If local people are only tidying up the town before the inspectors come around the scheme is not achieving its object.  A <Col N="276" /> consciousness of tidiness has to be encouraged.  Litter looks bad and is bad and there is no need for it.</P>
    <P>Abandoned vehicles are another eyesore in the countryside.  I know there were many legal problems in the past with picking up these abandoned vehicles, but they are ugly and dangerous. They are extremely dangerous when there are children near at hand. Sometimes batteries are left in abandoned vehicles and if a child tries to start the car it can lead to injury or death.  Therefore, a policy on abandoned vehicles is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains safeguards in respect of waste collection and transport. These are essential if the Bill is to be a success.  I cannot finish without thanking the people who operate the refuse collection service.  They do a tremendous job.  The vast majority of them are more than helpful to the public, they help in every way to clear up our waste.  It is not the cleanest of jobs but these people do a tremendous job and deserve compliments from this House.</P>
    <P>The Bill is far reaching and has major implications for our society.  It imposes obligations which may be unwelcome to some, as I am sure the Minister discovered when he was preparing the legislation, but realistically there is no alternative.  I am sure that even the most reluctant compliers will recognise this. The quality of life of our citizens depends on more than just economic growth.  A pleasant environment is central to that quality of life.  If we do not address this issue now, younger generations and those yet to come will not thank us for it.  The Minister has moved in the right direction.  I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is the first time he has been here in my presence.  I welcome the debate on this Bill although I do not welcome its contents.  I agree with Senator Calnan that everybody wants to dispose of their waste but nobody wants that waste near them. <Col N="277" /> People have to take on the challenge of waste disposal.  We did it without fear of contradiction in Kerry in 1994 when we put in a state of the art landfill site against huge objections.  We bit the bullet and did it.  The people paid for it afterwards without any assistance from central Government.  This is where the Bill fails and where I see many discrepancies, which I will outline in my contribution. It is disappointing the Minister will not go the extra mile and ensure measures regarding important issues are implemented.  We should all put our shoulders to the wheel and push in that regard.  Key issues, such as waste reduction and agricultural waste, are omitted in the Bill; they are sidestepped and ignored.</P>
      <P>The Minister has enormous powers regarding the list of duties which may be conferred by him on subsidiary agencies. The legislation will not last the test of time.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> in 1995 Dr. Van Veenen said the Bill focused almost entirely on managing waste.  He said it was much more important to develop a waste prevention plan at every level and to consider land fill dumping a last resort.  This aspect is lacking in the Bill.</P>
      <P>A waste policy did not exist in Ireland previously.  The Bill provides a general framework from which we could start to address the increasingly serious problem of waste.  The legislation has many shortcomings.  The issues of the production and reduction of waste are completely ignored and agricultural waste is not deemed worthy of consideration. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry attended a debate in the House some time ago when a large number of problems in relation to agricultural waste were mentioned.  However, at that time the farm pollution grant was almost redundant.  In response to the motion put down by this side on 17 May 1995, the Minister said he intended to write to local authorities and fisheries boards seeking a more sensitive approach to farmers served with section 12 notices.  That statement totally contradicts the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> The House is discussing landfill sites and pollution, but the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry stated no money was available for farm pollution grants and local authorities would be asked to take a softly softly approach to seepages into streams and rivers, which lead to large fish kills and water pollution. These cases would be ignored for the time being and the House could proceed to deal with another piece of legislation which places the focus on other agencies.  Perhaps the Minister thinks somebody will emerge from the heavens and dispose of other pollutants and that no thought on the Government's part is required.  Meanwhile, the Minister for the Environment wants to proceed with a programme, costing approximately £1.2 billion, for treatment plants over a period of time.  The situation is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The disposal of waste poses a challenge. Ireland now generates approximately one third more domestic and commercial waste than ten years ago, but that rate of waste production cannot be sustained.  There is a simple choice; production can be curbed or the method of production can be changed. However, the Bill ignores this central issue.  The manner in which the legislation deals with hazardous waste is totally inadequate.  In 1990 Ireland produced approximately 66 tonnes of hazardous waste of which 21 per cent was exported for disposal abroad.  The Bill does not indicate how this waste will be dealt with in the future when other countries refuse to take it.  Ireland must take responsibility for its waste and face facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister also failed to address the background of escalating levels of waste and the important political issue of the location of the new super dumps. As I stated earlier, dumps are objectionable and nobody wants one in their area.  However, the Minister did not outline his intentions or procedures regarding how this matter will be resolved. Against the background of the escalating volumes of waste, I ask the Minister to specify how he intends to reach the <Col N="279" /> target of reducing the number of landfill sites by 20 per cent.  The Bill does not cover this aspect.</P>
    <P>The entire problem appears to fall on local authorities.  How will they find the resources to implement the Minister's proposals?  The Bill defines local authorities as county councils, corporations and county boroughs and states they shall prepare a comprehensive waste management plan.  Two or more can combine in a collective area and they must revise their efforts every five years.  The adoption of a plan will be a reserved function.  The Environmental Protection Agency will prepare a hazardous waste disposal plan for the State and each local authority will have regard to it in dealing with such waste originating in their area.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell me how the local authority in County Kerry will dispose of waste?  The same applies to the authorities in Counties Cork, Limerick and elsewhere.  It is one thing to make proposals, but a solution must be found. The purpose of legislators is to put legislation in place and state what action will be taken.  The Bill also states in section 33 that each major local authority, such as a county council or county borough, may collect or arrange for the collection of waste other than household waste within its functional area.  In addition, corporations and urban councils may collect or arrange collection of household waste.</P>
    <P>Commercial collectors will require a permit from the relevant local authority under section 43.  They are allowed a right of appeal under section 9 to the District Court in respect of a refusal to grant a permit previously granted.  The Bill includes exemptions &mdash; for example, a waste licence will not be required for the recovery of sludge from a facility operated for the treatment of water or water waste.  Other exemptions cover blood from poultry factories, agricultural waste and other waste which can be described as non hazardous. Undoubtedly, legal draftspersons and others had good reasons for these <Col N="280" /> exemptions.  The logic is readily accepted.  In respect of these areas, it is suggested that a review be considered, notwithstanding section 51(2).  In the past many problems arose regarding the disposal of this waste, including the strong possibility of damage to rivers, lakes and food chains.  At the same time, the Bill does not contain anything to protect those who control these facilities.</P>
    <P>I do a fair amount of river fishing in my spare time and I promote this type of fishing in my area.  However, over the past 15 years, there have been some massive fish kills in some of the best salmon rivers in the country.  Yet, at the same time, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has taken a softly softly approach to those who pollute, while the Minister has taken a different one in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Provisions will be made for the prosecution of persons, including directors, managers and secretaries, and the corporate bodies they represent.  Where an offence has been proven under section 9, a person found guilty of a summary offence will be liable to a fine not exceeding £1,500 and/or 12 months imprisonment.  On conviction on indictment a fine will not exceed £10 million and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.  Will county and city managers and county, town and urban councillors be subjected to a fine if there is a leak from one of these state of the art landfill sites?  Local authorities will be immune from claims or damages in respect of work carried out in a bona fide manner where the employee is acting on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Having regard to recent legislation, everyone concerned, including county managers, elected representatives and so on, must pay careful attention to this section.  I will ask Members of my party to table amendments to this section on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The ERSI research paper No. 26 of November 1995 estimated that in 1994 total local authority expenditure on solid waste management cost £65 million, <Col N="281" /> although they only had an income of £18.5 million.  Who will pay for the shortfall?  The Minister will know that there is always an outcry if there is a slight increase in water, scavenging or sewerage charges.  Kerry County Council introduced sewerage charges when it opened a landfill site and treatment plants &mdash; it was one of the few councils to do so.  If people want facilities and clean water, then they must pay for them.  Yet the Minister does not have the nerve to charge people for services.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that this will cost £250 million.  I would like to know from where this money will come? Will the people have to pay?  I would not like to see different laws apply.  If those in County Kerry must pay for water and sewerage charges, then so too must people in Cork city and in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>Muingnaminnane is a state of the art landfill site in County Kerry.  It conforms to the draft EU directive on landfills and recently received the Environmental Protection Agency's approval in respect of the environmental management and monitoring programme for its continuing operations.  This approval was required by the EU and is similar to the IPC licence which will be required of major industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The site was established to serve Tralee and its environs, but it now serves north Kerry &mdash; approximately 2,000 square kilometres with a population of 62,000.  We purchased the site from Coillte Teoranta at a reasonable price in a remote area on Stacks Mountain. It is well screened by trees and so on.  The facility was the subject of an environmental impact assessment.  After certification by the Minister, construction work was carried out in the winter of 1993 and the spring of 1994 at a cost of £1.57 million.  We were asked to provide the money for this site.  It is one thing to be asked to provide the money to construct the site, but we also had <Col N="282" /> consider running costs as regards seepage, waste cells and linings.  When a cell is full we must ensure that another is available.</P>
    <P>Some 40 per cent of householders do not pay charges.  If the collection and disposal of waste is to be self-financing, then charges are inevitable.  If the Minister wants state of the art landfill sites, he must say who will pay for them.  I am familiar with the cost of disposing of waste as Kerry County Council charges approximately £80 per household and subsidises private contractors.  To try to keep landfill sites in operation, we have taken money from the allocation for county roads and have had to introduce scavenging and sewerage charges.</P>
    <P>The cost of projects must be borne by the local authorities concerned, who can get loans to fund the work and then try to get part of it back from the Minister in the form of an initial grant.  A state of the art landfill site which conforms to new EU regulations will cost £6 million to £7 million, although we only paid £1.57 million in County Kerry three years ago.  It would take approximately two years to develop such a site.</P>
    <P>The money will have to be borrowed by the local authority, with the interest on the loan to be paid in the meantime until the authority strikes its Estimates at the end of the year.  Given the rates that are being struck at present, the amount involved could be anything from £700,000 to £1 million annually before it comes into operation.  No local authority could take on such repayments.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is committed to introducing proper legislation he should explain how it is to be funded.  He cannot simply say that we are going to clean up our act.  For example, many roads need attention, but our biggest problem is agricultural waste.  It is pointless introducing legislation to deal with new landfill sites and to perhaps obtain grants from the EU to bring us into line while at the same time our waterways, lakes and rivers are being polluted.</P>
    <P>If the Minister defers the Bill, obtains money from abroad and introduces proper <Col N="283" /> legislation, with polices on incineration, farm pollution grants etc., I will listen to what he has to say.  Regardless of the developments he outlined, there has been no mention of recycling, incineration and so on.  This is one of the drawbacks of the Bill.  The Minister must be aware that there is a high level of opposition to the Bill from environmental groups.  It is generated in the absence of proposals for modernised and better run facilities.  This prolongs the operation of older sites and sites that are to be made redundant.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister intend to finance the decommissioning of sites that have been in operation for the past ten to 15 years?  How does he propose to stop the seepage, which has been compounded over the years, into the waterways? How does he propose to reconstruct the land on which theses sites have been developed?  Until I receive answers to these points I will be putting down amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The situation regarding waste management has become a major issue for all local authorities.  As a member of a local authority for the past 16 years, I have seen the changes that have taken place and the increased demands placed on them.  The amount of waste has grown to enormous proportions.  For example, there has been a vast increase in domestic waste due to the emergence of the consumer society.</P>
      <P>Recycling is the most interesting, but also the most demanding response to dealing with this problem.  In latter years, for example, a number of small operators have become involved in the recycling of glass.  Unfortunately, they have received very little support, which Government and local authorities could provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of EU directives, the day of the local dump near a town or village, perhaps in a boggy area, is long over. While local authorities try to find alternative sites, there is always grave concern <Col N="284" /> and huge opposition by residents in a locality where a proposed landfill site is mooted.  This is understandable, because dumps were not properly managed in the past.  Everything went into them and massive problems arose with smells, bad water, birds carrying vermin across the countryside, flies and so on. Residents within a radius of a mile of one such dump had to keep the windows in their house closed for four months of the year because of flies.</P>
    <P>In the past, dumps arose in response to emergencies and lack of planning. The consumer society emerged in a short space of time and local authorities were not geared to cope with it.  It is only in latter years that the demand for a proper approach to this vast problem has emerged.  While local authorities had to take the blame, to a certain extent, for mismanagement, they were trying to operate a necessary service with sites which had evolved but which had not been properly planned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, because we will now have a planned approach in areas where hitherto there was no proper planning or monitoring and where no feasibility studies were undertaken. However, it is not easy to proceed.  The will is there and there is some, if not enough, funding; but this does not mean that the right sites will be easily found. It is important, therefore, that an overall approach is taken and that proper attitudes be adopted towards waste disposal.</P>
    <P>There is only one dump site in County Longford which deals with approximately one third of the county's waste.  Private collectors now operate in rural areas and in some cases they must travel to dump sites outside the county. That cannot be allowed to continue in the long term because each county is finding it difficult to deal with its own waste.  A joint landfill site for two or three counties has also been mentioned. However, distance and collection costs must be taken into consideration.  Regulations must be satisfied when planning new landfill sites.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> A major problem in rural areas is indiscriminate dumping.  This destroys the countryside and affects our tourism. The media report on such dumping, but certain people do not seem to be aware of the problem.  It is a disgraceful habit. People will not travel to a landfill site because it is too far away, they are lazy or it costs too much.  The Government and local authorities must provide proper waste disposal facilities.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to tell the Minister that Longford County Council, of which I am a member, is anxious to meet him to discuss the problems of finding a landfill site.  This is also a problem for many other counties.  We heard about Kerry which has provided a dump, but some counties do not have that.  Other counties tried to find sites, but their plans were thwarted by objections from residents and community groups.  Proper landfill sites may allay the fears of residents and environmentalists.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that 8 per cent of waste is currently being recycled but he hopes that will increase to 20 per cent. That would help to alleviate the amount of waste and it would also create a more balanced approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill but I must point out the difficulties facing local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming this Bill.  I always had great interest in the environment and in the activities of local authorities, particularly when I was chairman and vice-chairman of the General Council of County Councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been negligent and haphazard in our treatment of the countryside over the years.  Indiscriminate dumping is a blight on our landscape which we must eliminate.  It is unacceptable to dump household or farm waste on a lonely stretch of road.  I support any council or environmental group which attempts to stamp that out.  In some areas people dump animal carcases on the side of roads and in drains and rivers. Moving waste from a person's house does not solve the problem; it <Col N="286" /> only transfers it to another area.  This encourages people to dump litter there as well.</P>
    <P>Litter wardens have attempted, particularly in my county, to eliminate this problem not by fines but by educating the public.  The public must co-operate with local authorities whose dumps are available for the disposal of waste. Admission charges to dumps and dumps not being open at weekends or only at certain hours contribute to indiscriminate dumping.  During the past 15 years this problem has been mentioned at every tidy towns presentation.  I could write a speech on it for the person who presents the awards.  Indiscriminate dumping should be stopped.  It is a blight on the countryside which gave the wrong message to visitors from home and abroad, was unhygienic, dangerous to health, etc.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It has many fine provisions.  It concentrates to a great extent on the disposal of waste, a concept with which I disagree.  There must be a certain amount of disposal but there are many other measures which should be considered.  As the Minister said, waste prevention is possible to a far greater degree than is currently provided in Ireland.  I did research and obtained information on approaches to waste.  This was during my time on European bodies and as chairman of the General Council of County Councils. Other countries have come up with more ideas about the disposal and prevention of waste, because they had to. This country creates 9 million to 10 million tonnes of waste.  Germany now has a population of 80 million and it cannot pile all its waste into dumps as we do. The Germans have had to look for other ways of dealing with it and they have found them, through both prevention and recycling.  We must do this also.</P>
    <P>County council managers and engineers appear to support landfill sites; the Department must also because presumably it would not provide vast funding for them if it did not.  Local authority officials say the sites are lined and are divided into compartments but it seems <Col N="287" /> at variance with nature to do that to material which should in most cases return to a natural form.  Also, the landfill sites do not seem to work.  One site adjacent to but not within my local authority area has gas problems which have come to the attention of council officials and the public in recent times.  Landfill appears to be an unnatural practice.</P>
    <P>We have many problems but the Waste Management Bill should lean more towards waste prevention and recycling.  Less than 10 per cent of waste in Ireland is recycled, which is far less than in other European countries.  We have a great opportunity to recycle here because we do not have the volume or type of waste which occurs in those countries.  We are failing to recycle and prevent waste as we should.</P>
    <P>We have also failed to tackle emergencies &mdash; when one occurs we are totally bereft of ideas.  Everything has been left to local authority officials to resolve. This came home to me when there was a fire in a meat factory in my county some years ago.  The greatest mass grave ever in Ireland had to be dug at Creggah, near Strokestown.  There was major upheaval in the local community, who felt their lives were put in danger.  They presented reports which indicated problems that might occur in years to come.</P>
    <P>It was a traumatic time for everyone and I had sympathy for our then county manager, because he was left to paddle his own canoe.  He had to dispose of thousands of tonnes of burnt meat and no one provided him with a plan or facility; he simply became the officer with responsibility, as the Cathaoirleach and I remember.  The manager was an excellent person who took determined steps to remove the meat from its location beside a town and bury it in a grave.  Experts presented reports on what could and should be done months later, but that was not much help to the council and manager because we could not afford to leave the meat above ground until people decided the best thing to do.  We will not know for many years whether the right thing was done. I supported the county manager on the <Col N="288" /> basis that he had to act and no one else had a better, or any, solution &mdash; there were plenty afterwards but no one had a plan which stood up to scrutiny at the time of the accident.</P>
    <P>In years to come, people in north-east Roscommon may say the county council was wrong and should not have supported the county manager in his actions.  However, it was left up to him and there was no emergency plan.  It had never been thought about, although who would have thought a deep freeze full of thousands of tonnes of meat would go on fire?  Exactly how it happened is still a mystery but it did occur and there were no plans to indicate how to deal with this catastrophe.  That should not be the case again, given how the country is developing.  I fear for what might happen in other industries in the next few years unless we think out and put in place procedures and give the local authorities the means to implement them.  This does not mean emergency plans, because to a great extent local authorities have such plans and in many cases they are paper exercises. If they were put to the test I do not think they would stand up, but that is a matter for another day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The agriculture industry faces a major crisis as prices fall and the future becomes more uncertain each day.  Confidence in the beef sector in <Col N="289" /> particular is at a record low because prices are disastrous at present.  The continued viability of thousands of farmers is in doubt and I urge the Government to take urgent action on a number of fronts or the future for these families will be bleak.</P>
      <P>The pressure on beef prices is serious and I call on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, to ensure an increase in beef prices to a reasonable level.  A level of 98p per pound is not acceptable in the months of January and February because farmers may have bought cattle in October or November when prices were at £1.06 per pound.  Irish steer prices have fallen by 6.2 per cent since mid-November and this leaves beef producers' income at an unacceptable level.</P>
      <P>The outcome of last Friday's special beef management meeting was disappointing from an Irish point of view. The increases were disappointing for all sectors of the industry.  I urge the Minister and the Taoiseach through their good offices to immediately pressurise the Community to fully restore export refunds, which are critical to Irish beef producers, given that we account for 21 per cent of EU beef exports while we produce only 6.8 per cent of EU beef output.  This disastrous situation for beef producers can only be corrected by the Commission, which by its mismanagement has caused this crisis.  I urge the Minister and the Taoiseach to seek an immediate increase of 20 per cent in live cattle refunds to restore some competitiveness to the industry.</P>
      <P>It is only since the live trade has been sidelined that factories have had it all their own way on cattle prices.  Many of our export outlets are no longer viable at the current level of refunds &mdash; for example, Egypt, where Australia can deliver beef for £12 per 100 kilos. cheaper than the EU.  If we were to be squeezed out of this market the results would be severe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, who is now present, and the Minister <Col N="290" /> for Agriculture, Food and Forestry attended a meeting today with the IFA president and members of that organisation. They heard the genuine concerns about the current cattle price situation and the long-term effects on the industry. As we face the spring, the store cattle trade will suffer.  The Government must formulate a stronger campaign to promote Irish beef as a clean, safe quality product in Britain and on the Continent. We must reassure people that Irish beef is free from BSE, which has caused a decline in the consumption of Irish beef in the UK.</P>
    <P>The strength of the punt against sterling is causing great hardship in many sectors of the industry &mdash; beef, dairying and two sectors which form a large part of the economy of my county, mushrooms and poultry.  This Government has deserted them and I ask the Minister to take action immediately to assist the industry.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is in need of major investment but the recent budget has failed miserably to encourage any new investment. It is crazy that it is more tax efficient for a farmer to invest money in film making rather than in his farm business, where investment is the key to viability.  If our farms are not brought up to current standards thousands of producers will not be able to compete in the marketplace.  An example is the fact that 75 per cent of dairy farmers have failed the new EU milk hygiene controls. If they do not conform by 1999 they will be refused permission to sell milk and, to date, only a few hundred have completed the necessary improvements.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to re-open applications for the control of farm pollution schemes, which are vital to many farmers.  The Minister's closure of applications to these schemes was unacceptable and must be corrected urgently.  This year the Government has left the REPS scheme and the early retirement scheme for farmers totally underfunded.</P>
    <P>As we discuss the agriculture industry I ask the House to support a demand to <Col N="291" /> have extra milk quota made available for milk suppliers in the Border counties under 30,000 gallons.  Dairying accounts for one third of the gross agricultural output in the area on both sides of the Border.  The farm family population is in decline, with a loss to the economic and social life of the rural communities. In my county &mdash; County Monaghan &mdash; in the period 1984-92, 36 per cent of dairy farmers in the county gave up farming, due to the restrictive milk quotas, and there were few new entrants.  I urge the Government to support the campaign to the EU for a peace dividend.  Milk suppliers in the Border counties deserve a milk quota increase due to their suffering and the underdevelopment of the industry as a result of 25 years of violence.  This is a very practical measure to help communities in the Border areas.</P>
    <P>Our agriculture industry is facing a very difficult future.  As we enter a new year there is little joy in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan because of the disappointment of the severely handicapped areas, the continued high incidence of TB, poor beef prices, the sterling crisis and a community living in fear as a result of the recent crime wave. It does not give us any joy to speak here today of the problems in agriculture. However, the Government has to take on board the seriousness of the crisis over the last six months.  The IFA met over 100 TDs and Senators in Buswells Hotel today to tell us about the crisis. The Government must own up to its responsibility.  Nobody knows that better than you, Sir, as you come from County Roscommon.  I come from County Monaghan where the situation is also very serious.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, to convey to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry the seriousness of the cut in export refunds. The 7.5 per cent given last Friday was an insult to the industry.  We have to put pressure on the Commission to increase it to an acceptable level &mdash; by at least 20 or 25 per cent.</P>
    <Col N="292" />
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion on agriculture is most appropriate as it has always been an important industry, particularly in terms of exports to Britain, Europe and the Third World. Today, members of the IFA came to Dublin to lobby TDs and Senators.  That gave me an opportunity to meet farmers from Offaly and Laois who are concerned about the present beef crisis. You, Sir, are also a farmer and you saw the situation in the past where, in the absence of real competition, factory owners could regulate the market to suit themselves.  Cattle prices at factory gates were £1.05 and £1.10 to the pound some months ago.  The price has now dropped to 98p and 96p and there is a danger of it dropping even further.  Part of the reason for so many farmers coming here today is that there is no real competition since the reduction in the export refunds.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will continue to do everything he can in regard to export refunds.  The EU Commission imposed a severe cut in export refunds last September and the average drop in the price of bullocks was in the region of £75 to £80 per head.  This is a very serious matter particularly as it applies to winter fatteners which is an important sector of the beef industry. Farmers buy cattle and fatten them during the winter.  It is an intensive job which involves a great deal of work.  The EU Commission should fully restore export refunds for carcase beef and live cattle to the levels which applied in September 1995.  That is essential to maintain competition; without competition factories can name their own prices.  The losses incurred by farmers cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teagasc figures show that producers will need £1.05 to £1.06 per pound just to break even and up to £1.09 per pound to make a margin of £30 per head.  Teagasc is an independent body and its figures are normally regarded as accurate. There are about 460,000 steers and heifers to be sold by farmers this spring and <Col N="293" /> a loss of £70 per head would amount to over £32 million.</P>
    <P>Anything which would improve the lot of the people involved in this important industry has the support of all parties in this House.  In regard to bullocks, producers receive the ten month and the 22 month special beef premia and a slaughter premium as long as all the conditions are complied with.  There is no subsidy for heifers.  A number of heifer producers have asked me to seek a special premium for heifers as they are losing a great deal of money at present. This matter needs to be examined and it needs all party support.  I hope the Minister will raise this issue with the EU Commission; he will have the backing of this House.</P>
    <P>A number of farmers are refused grants, such as beef premia or headage payments, for one or two years because they made minor errors in their application forms.  I have been approached by people with genuine cases.  I raised this matter with the farming editor of the <i>Irish Independent,</i> Mr. Frank Mulrennan, two to three years ago.  He was very helpful and highlighted some of the injustices that had taken place.  Some farmers have since received back money due to them.</P>
    <P>In the past, when one contacted the Department of Social Welfare or the Revenue Commissioners about a problem their response was not as consumer-oriented as it is today.  If I contact the Revenue Commissioners about a constituent's problem they go out of their way to be helpful.  Inspectors from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry have a great responsibility when visiting farmers.  If there is a problem they should explain things to the farmer and try to ensure that the problem is resolved.  It is necessary that they do this rather than submitting a bad report on that farmer thereby ensuring that he loses his grants for one or two years.  That might be the difference between a farmer and his family surviving for one year and making a profit at the end of it.  A farmer who loses his grants is faced with a situation where he <Col N="294" /> must meet his commitments to the bank.  If he does not, his interest and repayments begin to mount up.  If the Minister does not listen to my appeals in this regard, I intend to take the matter further and I will continue to highlight it.  This is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>Ireland has an excellent record in relation to animal health; it is probably the best in Europe.  We must ensure that our disease free status is highlighted and also our excellent record of eradicating diseases.  Ireland has the finest product available and every effort should be made to publicise that fact.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am unhappy with the submission prepared by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry's predecessor about a particular appeal.  A group of organisations were involved with the entire appeals procedure.  I cannot understand why &mdash; in the submission to Brussels &mdash; some areas were left out.  I have with me a copy of the map of Camross parish and I do not understand why some of the areas were excluded.  Some areas at the top of a nearby mountain were excluded; they should have been included with the most severely handicapped areas.  I cannot understand the reasoning behind this.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan.  The arrangement of time for speakers' contributions is very unsatisfactory.  During the debate on this issue last week each speaker was afforded 20 minutes; today, the Leader of the House, by some sleight of hand, has limited time to ten minutes per speaker.  I protest.  There should be consistency; all speakers should be treated in the same way.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach will use his discretion to some advantage, as he did in the case of Senator Enright.  The Chair will be relieved to hear that I will not supply a list of the DEDs and townlands in County Kildare which were excluded from the severely disadvantaged and disadvantaged areas scheme. Last week the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, provided a wide ranging and comprehensive analysis of the industry.  We should thank him for that.  However, in the time available, I can only deal with some of the aspects of his analysis.</P>
      <P>The most urgent matter confronting agriculture is export refunds, to which Senator Enright alluded.  Since November there has been a 25 per cent decrease in export refunds.  Was this cynically devised by the Commission to bring market prices down to a level which, it was expected, would arise as a result of the MacSharry package of CAP reforms?  This is a reasonable question.  Was it a device to achieve a policy of lowering prices when part of the package agreed at the time was to give farmers compensation for the cuts that would arise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his speech last week the Minister stated that beef is our foremost priority.  It is our most important industry; it is the most important part of our agricultural production.  It is, of course, his priority; it is the priority of everyone involved in agriculture.  In a <Col N="296" /> succession of press releases during the past six months, the Minister has always given this issue priority.  He has also shown tremendous commitment to this. It is good that the Minister has his priorities and that level of commitment. The only question that arises is what does he do as a result of those priorities and commitments?  It is by that that he, his predecessors and successors, will be judged.</P>
    <P>The increases that Ireland received last week as a result of the meeting in Brussels were far less than required. They are not adequate.  The real inequity of what happened in respect of export refunds is that many farmers had cattle in their sheds during the winter period when these cuts took place.  They made an investment decision in good faith which was totally undermined by the unilateral decision of the beef management committee in Brussels.  The Minister must impress upon the Commission the unique circumstances which prevail in Ireland.  He must also impress upon it the unique degree to which, among all other member states, our economy is dependent upon agriculture. He must continually argue and stress that fact in his negotiations with people in Brussels.</P>
    <P>Cattle prices have decreased by about 6p per pound since last autumn. According to the IFA's analysis, that amounts to £50 per head on a 700 kilogram bullock.  That is very significant. Senator Enright is correct in stating that, if the market price, 97p or 98p per pound, is compared to what is required to break even, £1.06 per pound, farmers will face severe losses during the winter period.</P>
    <P>A total destabilisation of the market has taken place.  It can be argued that the factories have taken full advantage of that destabilisation.  They are not the people who caused it, however.  It was the beef management committee in Brussels.  In many circumstances, the factories are attempting to recover the losses they sustained as a result of the movement of sterling against the punt. That is to be expected in the reality of <Col N="297" /> trading life.  It is most unfortunate that this is then transferred back to the producer who sustains the burden of the losses incurred by the factories.</P>
    <P>In the 1994 farm management survey analysis, family farm income from beef was £87 per acre.  That is a very modest income.  If we consider the predicted loss, £50 per head, it is easy to see what will happen in terms of income per acre during the current year.  Farmers are facing a catastrophe.  I urge the Minister to do everything in his power to restore export refunds to the level they were at before the cuts were introduced.  Otherwise, the consequences for farmers and their families are very severe indeed. According to some calculations, the economy has already lost about £10 million as a result of this cut in export refunds and, over the entire wintering season, this will add up to £30 million.</P>
    <P>There is a huge inconsistency about aspects of European policy in this respect. At one level there is a deseasonalisation premium, which is designed to encourage people to put cattle into sheds and take them out in the spring to be slaughtered rather than to have them come on to an autumn market which is already oversaturated. At another level the benefit which it is hoped that premium will confer is taken away totally by the decision of a committee in Brussels.  I do not really understand the logic of their thinking. Apart from the restoration of the export refunds, there are other questions.  Will the 40 per cent qualifying trigger, which is used for the winter slaughter premium for September-October-November, be reduced?  What are the prospects for having that reduced to a lower level, as was indicated by the Minister in his speech?  Can that be done?  If so, when can it be done?</P>
    <P>I understand that the Irish Cattle Traders and Stockowners Association, a body which has been in existence for over 100 years, sought a meeting with the Minister some weeks ago.  Not only has Minister Yates refused to meet the association but he has not answered their request.  If that is true, I find it extraordinary and I want an explanation. <Col N="298" /> What is wrong with these people that they were forced to picket outside the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry yesterday?  Why is the Minister, from what I understand, not prepared to meet them?</P>
    <P>A question arises in respect of these farmers and it has to do with the fact that they do not produce their own calves.  They have never been included in the CAP reform package and they have no premium or quota rights under CAP reform.  They have asked the Minister to bring this problem to the top of his agenda and to make a special case for them at the European Commission in order to seek a lasting solution to the crisis with which they are faced.</P>

      <P>In his opening remarks last week the Minister said that 50 per cent of total net farm income comes from subsidies.  That is true and it is the reality.  It underlines for us the vulnerability of the farming sector to decisions made in Brussels.  To underline that point, 92 per cent of sheep farming incomes in 1994, according to Teagasc figures, came from direct income support. If that is the case it is fair to assume that more of their direct income came from direct income support in 1995.  In order to explain that matter, which relates to Minister Yates' constituency, the Wexford land producer group came up with figures, when we debated the sheep industry here earlier, to the effect that the net profit per ewe in 1995 was £11.40.  The subsidy was £21, so, in fact, part of the subsidy went towards funding the losses which were being sustained by the industry.  Something must be done about that vulnerability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that his first priority was a charter of farmers' rights; sheep were his top priority in the second half of 1995, beef is now his foremost priority and the reduction of EU <Col N="299" /> refunds and BSE is his highest priority. He has a lot of priorities and I hope is successful in working them all out in an order which I can comprehend.  He said that he was totally committed to maintaining and maximising the level of direct income support.  We would all subscribe and be committed to that, but I do not think we should regard small concessions that we extract from Brussels as a victory.</P>

      <P>We now have a TB forum, a horticultural forum and a poultry meat forum. The old story of &ldquo;a funny thing happened to me on the way to the forum&rdquo; seems to become particularly apposite in the case of Irish agriculture.</P>
      <P>I want to make a few brief points. There are matters which are in our own hands.  The whole matter of the funding of An Bord Bia so it can compete in the increasingly market-driven situation it faces is a priority.  On the whole question of Teagasc, Minister Deenihan made a point yesterday about the mushroom industry and the need to increase productivity, have better management and so on in response to the sterling crisis.  That applies right across the board and the only way it will happen is through good expert advice from Teagasc which is backed up by good research.  That must be a priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of the agricultural colleges and a specific question which I must raise with the Minister which has to do with the funding of the private agricultural and horticultural colleges.  I wrote to him about the matter and he replied on 25 January, saying that he was having the matter investigated. As a consequence of the lack of adequate staff, finance and facilities, the colleges were unable to run short courses for Teagasc in 1995.  These <Col N="300" /> courses were the 100 hour courses for the farm retirement scheme and courses to complete the requirements for installation aid.  A serious situation is facing these colleges.  They made a submission at the time of the Budget which was supported by Teagasc, but nothing seems to have emerged and I wonder what sort of assurances can be given to them as to their future.</P>
    <P>There is the question of sterling, which I could go into at some length, its consequences and the whole question of the enlargement of the EU and what we will do in terms of our Presidency of the EU over the latter six months of this year.  However, that is a debate for another day.</P>
    <P>It is most unfortunate that people had 20 minutes last week and those of us who speak this week have only ten minutes, but the Leader's expert sleight of hand managed to get that through the House earlier today without it being observed.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the debate.  Since, as was stated last week, Fine Gael feel agriculture is such an important issue, we are devoting our Private Members' time to it.</P>
      <P>I, too, want to refer to the spring cattle price situation.  I discussed the situation with members of the IFA from Limerick today and feel I should put their concerns and, indeed, the concerns of everybody, on the record of the House.  I know they are the concerns of the Minister too but it is important that we refer to it here.  The fact that cattle prices have fallen by 6 p per pound since last autumn, the equivalent of £50 per head on a 700 kilogram bullock, is a cause of concern.  I remember being involved in the meat industry in 1987 when prices were higher than they are at present.  At this time of year I remember them rising to £1.10 per pound; today they are at 98 p per pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> The main reason for the reduction in cattle prices and the uncertainty in the cattle trade is the severe cut in the export refunds imposed by the Commission since last September.  The Minister must endeavour to do everything he can to ensure the situation is reversed, because the Commission has cut export refunds for live cattle by up to £8.58 per hundredweight, the equivalent of £118 per animal.  In addition, the Commission has cut carcase beef refunds by 12 p per pound, the equivalent of £101 per animal. These figures take account of the refund increases made at the beef management committee on 2 February 1996. In order to compensate winter feeders for the additional costs of feeding and housing, cattle prices should be rising at this time of year.  Traditionally, cattle prices were usually higher from this time of the year until June, July or August because of the cycle in the supply of beef.</P>
    <P>Ireland's unique position should be recognised by the Commission when reexamining the situation.  Since we export 70 per cent of our steer beef to world markets, Irish cattle prices are much more sensitive to cuts in export refunds than prices in any other EU member state.  In other words, cuts in beef and live cattle export refunds have a greater impact in Ireland than in any other EU member state, not only because we export 70 per cent of our steer beef but because these exports have such an important role in the economy and as part of our gross national product.  The contribution of the beef sector to the Irish economy is higher than the contribution of beef sectors to the economies of any of our European partners.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that Irish exports have significant quantities of export refunds prefixed at the higher levels applying last autumn, the massive cuts introduced by the EU Commission have destabilised cattle prices in the market. In addition, because live exporters had only small volumes of refunds prefixed and are not active in the market, competition has now been removed and cattle prices have fallen to uneconomic levels. <Col N="302" /> We cannot over-emphasise the role the live exporter plays in ensuring that there is competition in the beef market.  Factories play a key role in our dead beef industry and they provide a great deal of employment.  They should be encouraged to develop the added value aspect of their product to ensure that the level of employment is maximised.  However, we must also ensure that the farmer gets a fair price for his produce.  It is important that the live export trade exists to ensure the presence of competition. We have often heard it said that &ldquo;it takes the live trade to bring the dead trade to life&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Selling feeders at 98p per pound, as is the case at present, means that producers are losing £65 per head, even taking account of the slaughter premium which is worth £60 per head.  Teagasc figures show that producers would need between £1.05 or £1.06 per pound just to break even and £1.09 to make margins of £30 per head over the 46,000 head of steers and heifers to be sold by farmers this spring.  A loss of £70 per head will amount to £32 million and that indicates the scale of the problem.  The price of 98p per pound is the same price as was paid eight or nine years ago, despite the inflation rate in the meantime. That price, in fact, is below the average price paid at this time of the year between eight and ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The IFA placed the solution to this problem before us at our meetings today.  We support its request that export refunds on carcase beef and live cattle be fully restored to the levels that applied last September.  Immediate action should be taken at the highest political and Commission level to ensure that refunds are restored at the EU beef management committee meeting on 16 February.  The balance between carcase beef and live cattle refunds should be restored, taking account of the £60 per head winter slaughter premium.  The 40 per cent September, October and November qualifying trigger for the winter slaughter premium should be reduced to 35 per cent in order to guarantee that <Col N="303" /> Ireland qualifies for the £60 per head premium in 1997.  In a way we are the victims of our success in this area.  We must now deal with a new situation; we need a change in the trigger mechanism to ensure that Ireland qualifies for the premium.  That is the issue of the moment and it is an important one.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the successes of the Minister, the Minister of State and the Government over the past year in the agriculture sector.  Incomes rose by between 6 per cent and 7 per cent last year at a time when inflation was 2.5 per cent.  Farm income is now over £2 billion for the first time since the foundation of the State.  We should also recognise that direct subsidies routed through the Department of Agriculture account for £776 million or 40 per cent of the total income.</P>
    <P>With regard to direct payments, every public representative would acknowledge the success of the Minister in obtaining a major concession whereby the 5,000 farmers who failed to submit or submitted late their area application forms will be paid on the basis of their 1994 aid applications, assuming their declared acreage did not change between 1994 and 1995.  This will mean £20 million extra in premia and headage payments.  That is a welcome success.  It is not a common success as the EU tends to be extremely bureaucratic in adhering to its rules and regulations.  It is good to see that the Minister was successful in achieving this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the charter of rights.  It has resulted in an immediate improvement in the level of services to farmers.  Since 1 September all offices are open to the public during normal working hours.  Too often we rang or called offices and found that although it was perhaps halfway through our working day, the offices were closed.  The staff, of course, worked a full day behind closed doors. This new development is very welcome. We also welcome the in-depth examination of all the Department's services that is currently underway.  The Minister <Col N="304" /> will shortly announce a reorganisation of the Department, including the establishment of executive units for particular services which will streamline those services and introduce more efficiencies. Introducing efficiencies at Department level is of vital importance because too often we see bureaucracy impeding the availability of services.  This is an important development and I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State in that regard.</P>

      <P>I join my colleagues in discussing this serious crisis in the cattle industry.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan.  I am disappointed that the other Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, has just left because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should hear me out; he might not be so pleased with what I will say.  It is not so many years ago since Deputy Joe Walsh was Minister of State for Agriculture, Food and Forestry &mdash; I am not condemning the current Minister, Deputy Yates, for not being present because I hope he is in Brussels doing serious work on behalf of Irish farmers &mdash; and I remember the then Senator Doyle saying to Deputy Walsh that he was wheeled into the Chamber because the Minister had not got the guts to come himself.  The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, has just wheeled out now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will take this matter very seriously because the beef industry is in trouble and if it is not fixed within the next few weeks the entire cattle trade, including the calf and store cattle trades, will collapse.  When uncertainty creeps in it takes a long time to restore confidence.  I also appeal to the Minister not to allow the bureaucrats in the Commission to hold out until the new arrangements come into effect in April.  If that happens there will be utter chaos and many farmers will have gone bankrupt, as has been stated by Senator Enright and Senator Dardis. <Col N="305" /> People bought cattle for winter fattening at very high prices.  In the best of times, with no cut in the support scheme, the margins were tight.  This problem is so urgent that I would expect even the Taoiseach to go to Brussels to support the Minister; it is a do or die situation.  We are in a particularly serious situation because of the vast amounts of cattle we export and the markets which could be lost if this matter is not sorted out urgently.  I hope the Minister is doing solid work because only a firm hand, and not press releases from Agriculture House, will solve the problem.  The Minister will have to lobby support because there are many people employed in this sector and many will be hurt if the problem is not tackled.</P>
    <P>There should be full restoration of export refunds by the European Commission to the level which applied last September.  We do not want hand outs but fair play.  There must be a restoration of confidence in the cattle and sheep trades.  I hope nobody in the Commission is trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the Minister or the Minister of State.  Once a little uncertainty enters the sheep or cattle industries, it develops into greater uncertainty, especially at this time of the year when people are expecting a return on their investment and hard work over the winter.  If this is allowed to continue until April there will be utter chaos and the calf and store trades will collapse. Even if the situation is sorted out in April there will be a backlog and we will not be over the effects of it for 12 months.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the Taoiseach to immediately make a strong case for Ireland because the situation is more serious than people realise.  If there is too much dithering about in these negotiations we will lose out on our markets outside the EU, which cost a great deal to develop, and others will win them from us.  I do not wish to be critical of the Minister but we have heard many promises from him in recent times about <Col N="306" /> rights for farmers but they are not being acted on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department issued many press releases but these are of little use no matter how many spin doctors are being paid for by the taxpayer. What matters is the price received by farmers for their cattle.  Last year the Minister was forced to do something for the sheep industry but he has not done much since then.  This problem has existed for some time and I am disappointed at the manner in which it is being tackled.  Living in hope is of little good to any farmer.</P>
      <P>Today politicians from all parties met the IFA, which, with the other farmer organisations, is taking the matter seriously.  It can see the crisis which will occur in this area and in the store cattle trade if the matter is not tackled.  There should be fewer press releases from Agriculture House and more action. Time is not on our side; we have only weeks to deal with this problem.  If we mess it up the effects will be felt for many years and we will regret that we did not deal with the problem more seriously when it first appeared some weeks ago.</P>
      <P>It is fine for bureaucrats in Brussels to make statements about balancing the books but Ireland is a special case.  The Minister and the Minister of State, both of whom come from the country, know how much people depend on a reasonable return from their investment of buying and feeding cattle.  It is poor consolation to read in <i>The Farmer's Journal</i> that the Minister attended certain meetings and that something may be done. He will have to hit the table at meetings and demand that action be taken immediately.  Otherwise, many people will be hurt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take our views into consideration.  As I said, it is fine to issue statements but there is a time bomb waiting to go off in the cattle industry.  I appeal to the Minister to act <Col N="307" /> as quickly as possible.  If necessary, the Taoiseach should support him in his efforts in Brussels.  If the problem is allowed to continue into April, when new arrangements will be introduced, a great deal of damage will be done and I am sure the Minister would not like to see this happen.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. It is appropriate that we have a debate on agriculture at this time.  There are many aspects of agriculture which worry the farming community and they have the knock on effect of putting the national economy in danger.  The effects on employment must be foremost in our minds.</P>
      <P>Senator Byrne talked about the problems being experienced in agriculture, particularly in beef farming.  Senators were lobbied by the IFA on the difficulties experienced by its members as a result of the reduction in export refunds.  This will have disturbing effects on the beef industry and cattle prices throughout the year.  Cattle farmers may have to go out of business.  This would be unfortunate for the country.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with the Minister's response to date and I do not think the IFA is either.  During the briefing session with the association today, it was apparent that it feels the Minister has not achieved the results it wanted and that he has allowed the opportunity to defend and promote the beef industry to slip from the political field.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on agriculture and I also welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I live in an area between marginal and reasonably good agricultural land. A wide variety of farming is carried out from Dersey Sound to the good land around Bandon and Kinsale.  However, I want to dwell on the poorer land <Col N="308" /> regions.  There are many mountain, bog and waste lands in that area.  Some of the valleys have reasonably good land in its lower regions but is of poorer quality higher up.  Consequently, farming there is not a prosperous activity.  The pensinular nature and remoteness of the area is also of no help to those living there.</P>
    <P>During the summer, the land is rugged and beautiful but in winter it is remote and farmers there are isolated.  The area is made up of small farms and many people have to eke out a living from them.  In the past, large families were reared on these farms but many of them were affected by the curse of emigration. Since there was only enough land for one to survive on, the rest had no other choice but to move out.  Consequently, they either migrated to the cities or left for foreign lands.</P>
    <P>Many of these farms are currently being amalgamated.  Some of them are being bought by Europeans &mdash; who find them a big attraction as they are located in a rugged and scenic area beside the sea &mdash; but this makes even poorer many in the locality who could do with that extra land to make a decent living. Many new age travellers have also occupied and renovated remote and formerly derelict dwellings and are becoming a great burden on our social welfare system.  They depend totally on unemployment assistance or health board payments to survive.  An examination of this issue must take place before severe problems occur with housing, health or other matters.  Indeed, I spoke about this before in this House.</P>
    <P>Many EU restrictions, such as milk quotas and others involving EU directives etc., will cause great problems to our agricultural suppliers in the near future.  If land is not being used, there will be no need for machinery from agricultural contractors either.  These knock-on effects will force both agricultural suppliers and contractors to lay off people and these jobs are valuable for farmers' sons.</P>
    <P>We will have to look at alternatives. Many small farmers in west Cork supplement <Col N="309" /> their income by fishing.  Various sectors of this industry, such as mussel fishing, are developing well and are of great importance.  Agri-tourism can also be of terrific value to farmers on low incomes.  Staying on an Irish farm in a quiet rural area is a great attraction for many Europeans but agri-tourism is not being marketed properly. If we can develop it to a proper level, there will be no decrease of services in rural areas.  If people stay on the land, the small country town or village and the cross roads shop will not suffer.  In the past, the services, schools, social centres and the local country pub were kept going by these people.</P>
    <P>I was glad I saw the IFA presentation calling for the restoration of the export refund.  Keeping agricultural prices at the highest possible level is of extreme importance and I call on the Minister to do his best at his meetings in Brussels to get this refund restored.  We need every penny we can get.</P>
    <P>We will no longer be the poor relation when the EU expands to take in many eastern European countries. There were already six well developed countries in the EU when we joined with Britain and Denmark in 1973 and we were the poorest.  As a result, we benefited from being a member.  While Greece, Spain and Portugal were net beneficiaries like ourselves, the three latest members, Austria, Finland and Sweden, have well developed economies and their financial demands on the EU are not great.  However, from now on mainly poorer countries will be joining and they will be demanding financial assistance.</P>
    <P>Our agriculture sector has done well from our membership of the EU.  In many cases, these payments are necessary to give a reasonable standard of living to people who could not survive otherwise.  Therefore, these payments are a necessity.  They cover a wide and varied area.  Cattle headage payments, beef cow and suckler cow payments, ewe premia, sheep, equine and goat headage payments, special beef payments and the slaughter and extensification <Col N="310" /> premia are partly funded by the EU and are of extreme importance to those living in rural areas where the quality of land is not great and it helps them to make ends meet.  However, will it be available in a few years time?  If not, it will be bad for those living in remote parts of Ireland with poor quality land who can only derive a proper income with these payments.  I do not want to spread an air of doom and gloom, but this situation could come about.  If the EU does not make these payments in the future, what will these people do?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak about the horticulture sector and the tomato sector in particular.  The tomato sector is in crisis.  This sector is highly labour intensive. After extensive lobbying over the last number of years we convinced the Department of Finance, the former Minister, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the present Minister, Deputy Quinn, to introduce tax incentives for the industry and they did so in last year's budget. However, tomato producers throughout the country now find their hands tied on several counts.</P>
      <P>The industry is dealing with four major problems, of which the Minister is well aware.  It has taken the industry between four and six months to get a meeting with the Minister.  I have told the growers that this is because their produce does not have four legs.  If these growers were producing beef they would have got a meeting with the Minister very quickly and action would have been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several factors make it impossible for our growers to compete in the market. The first relates to energy costs.  In 1988 the industry was asked to change from oil to natural gas.  The Department and the then Minister encouraged and supported this change.  At great cost the growers changed from oil to gas.  They were given commitments that gas prices would be kept at a level which would ensure their continuing competitiveness in the market.  Our top growers are now paying between 30p and 35 p per therm. <Col N="311" /> The Dutch are paying 20p to 25p per therm and our UK neighbours are paying about 15p per therm.  It is absolutely impossible for our growers to compete in this situation.</P>
    <P>Tomatoes are one of the few products which are not subject to control from Europe, so tomato growers from Mediterranean countries, Spain and the Canary Islands dump surplus produce on the Irish market on a regular basis. Growers also suffered this year in relation to the devaluation of various European currencies.  Irish growers are unfortunately tied into the Dutch market. The Dutch had to devalue their currency in relation to the peseta, so this year our growers had to sell their produce at less than cost price.</P>
    <P>When this crisis occurred during the summer other European Governments put together a package to help their national growers overcome the currency difficulties.  The IFA, as the Minister will be well aware, has put a proposal to the Minister based on last year's crop and price structure which would help the growers get over last year's difficulties and ensure that jobs in this labour intensive sector throughout the country, and in particular in my own constituency, are protected.  That package, as the Minister knows, amounts to a 50p subsidy per box on the 1995 crop.  Maintenance of over 300 jobs provided by the sector would cost the Government between £500,000 and £600,000.</P>
    <P>Given that in last year's budget the Government brought forward welcome tax incentives, which the growers availed of, it is difficult to believe that commitments that gas price structures would always be competitive were not honoured, especially when energy prices have had such a negative impact on competitiveness.  It is up to the Government to deal with energy prices and subsidies. No efforts have been made to control the level of imports in this sector. Everybody must compete, but how can the Irish growers survive when confronted with uncompetitive energy <Col N="312" /> prices and dumping of foreign produce on the Irish market?</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's commitment in this area and I ask him to ensure that the interests of this sector are represented at Cabinet level.  I know he realises the damage being done to the sector at the moment.  I am aware of the deputations and representations that have been made to him.  Some of the best growers in the Rush-Lusk area were unable to continue in business this year because of last year's crisis and the lack of Government commitment to help.</P>
    <P>When the currency difficulty arose in 1992 the then Fianna Fáil Government, after the same type of lobbying as is occurring at the moment, recognising the level of jobs provided by the industry, was able to come up with a devaluation package.  Less than two years ago flash floods occurred on the east coast and the Fianna Fáil led Government came up with a package to ensure that this industry continued.</P>
    <P>Not to give a Minister of State specific responsibility for horticulture was a retrograde step on the part of a Fianna Fáil led Government because every report that is on the Minister's desk has proven that every job creation target set has been met by that industry.  I cannot understand that there is never any comment about this from the Department.  I know the Minister of State has called for a forum, but there are many reports on his desk at the moment in relation to horticulture.  There is no need for another forum.</P>
    <P>I welcome the efforts made last year in relation to extending the tax breaks to the industry.  The growers are asking the Minister, as their representative in Government, to allow them compete on a level playing field &mdash; he would understand that &mdash; and to allow them to compete in foreign markets by helping them in relation to the price of natural gas. They were given a commitment when they changed from oil to gas that the price structure would allow them compete in the market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> The Minister should consider, under the review that is taking place in Europe at the moment, not allowing Mediterranean countries to dump surplus produce on the Irish market when it suits them, thereby ruining our price structure, where the supermarkets are trying to help.  I also ask the Minister to look at the IFA subsidy proposal.</P>
    <P>I have written to the Minister on several occasions &mdash; this is indicative of how horticulture is forgotten &mdash; in relation to the farm retirement scheme. The farm retirement scheme excludes horticulture because of the acreage involved and so forth, but the scheme must be examined with a view to allowing the horticulture sector to benefit. It would have the same beneficial effects it has had in other sectors of the industry.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has a commitment to the industry.  He must show it sooner rather than later.  The Minister understands the damage being done at the moment.  The tax breaks that he introduced last year are to no avail; because of the other difficulties no growers will be left to take advantage of them.  On behalf of all growers and the many jobs provided by the industry, I ask the Minister, for the sake of £500,000, to support the industry.  The Irish tomato can compete with any other produce throughout the world. All the growers want is a chance to compete on a level playing pitch.</P>

      <P>My interest this evening is in milk production and the redistribution of milk quotas.  It is alarming to think that the current superlevy is of the order of £25 million.  I have been listening for the last six months to complaints by farmers who want extra milk quotas.  They believe they have an entitlement and that extra milk quotas would help them to survive in farming. I have received reports that under the table arrangements are made regarding the redistribution of milk quotas.  This is a scandal and I call on the Minister to increase controls on the redistribution of milk quotas to ensure that those for <Col N="314" /> whom extra quotas are essential to their survival in farming will benefit.</P>
      <P>It is public knowledge that the Revenue Commissioners are currently investigating this matter in a wide area. While I welcome the fact that the current investigation will embrace the entire country, I ask the Minister to establish a system in the meantime whereby quota transfers are stamped by the Revenue Commissioners before they reach the Department.  When a local dairy has an extra milk quota to redistribute, it appears the current system merely requires that a form is signed and sent to the Department, where it is stamped.  This is the extent of the supervision of the redistribution of milk quotas.</P>
      <P>It is vital the Minister sets up the system I suggested and involve the Revenue Commissioners.  This will ensure justice and fair play for small farmers, who are being forced out of farming because they have insufficient production scope, and the current system is not being properly supervised.  The allegation is that payments are made to major milk suppliers through fertiliser and feed accounts for excess milk production. This is totally in breach of EU regulations and I am sure the Minister and his Department are aware of that point.  It is a bad state of affairs if it can happen in this little country which boasts so much about its agricultural system and method of production and redistribution.</P>
      <P>Payments for milk supplies can only be made through milk accounts with the suppliers' dairy.  This continuing breach of EU regulations poses a serious problem for the dairy industry, which claims to abide by the regulations.  The level of over production of milk is a matter of serious concern as the superlevy imposed is very high.  Perhaps it is time Ireland sought a review and considered whether it is entitled to an increased milk quota.  I welcome the ring fencing of milk quotas in disadvantaged areas and I ask the Minister to do everything possible to ensure it is applied rigidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> I am aware of a case where a wealthy Cork farmer, who was a prominent member of the IFA, was able to go to the west, buy a farm and bring home a new quota of 25,000 gallons.  This was in addition to the 100,000 gallon quota he held in Cork.  I do not have the figures &mdash; I am sure they are available &mdash; but I believe the number of farmers who depend for a living on milk production with quotas of less than 20,000 gallons is high.  I am making a case for these people.</P>
    <P>I attended a committee meeting this evening which received a report from An Bord Bia regarding its promotions and plans.  I compliment the board for its strategy and the progress it has made in marketing food products.  We must remember that, while Ireland's image is green and this benefits the food industry, the development of factory farmed produce could quickly change that image.  There is a tendency towards the same type of development in pig production. I received calls from parts of the country which are devastated because tight controls were not put in place early on.  I hope this will not recur on a widespread basis.</P>
    <P>Milk production is vitally important to the vast majority of farmers.  I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to ensure a fair and equitable system. A full investigation of under the table methods regarding the redistribution of milk quotas is required.  The Minister knows where I come from and the position is not difficult to identify.  Many people have complained that they have been let out of the system while others have been let in and the situation is not good enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on this issue I am breaking a self-imposed silence. I have not contributed on any agricultural matter in the Seanad since I laid down the responsibility of Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I did not feel it would be appropriate to speak on such matters and that my party's spokespersons in this House and the <Col N="316" /> other House should take on that responsibility.  I did not want to engage in any type of reflections or recriminations. However, I feel obliged to break my silence to address four points: the current state of cattle prices, particularly the application of export refunds; bovine spongiform encephalopathy, better known as BSE; disadvantaged areas and the significance of the food industry to the economy.</P>
      <P>Regarding export refunds, anybody with any experience of negotiations in Europe as a Minister for Agriculture and Food &mdash; I had more experience than any other person as I held that job for almost five years &mdash; knows it is most important to win the goodwill, on a personal and national basis, of all of one's colleagues at the table.  One must get to know them and understand their problems and <i>vice versa.</i> I am happy that, after almost five years in the job, I had their support and understanding.  I also supported and understood them on particular issues.  In addition, I also understood the Commission and its various services.</P>
      <P>One is dealing with CAP principles in relation to export refunds.  It is not a case of Ireland claiming something for itself but rather putting it forward in a proper presentation that a matter is covered by EU rules.  Matters established on the basis of EU regulations were called <i>acquis communautire</i> and one always made one's case on the basis of the application of EU rules and not as a special plea for Ireland.  I like to think I did that successfully over five years because when I left office the significance of our approach to diplomacy meant there was a value of almost £445 million on our export refunds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Export refunds are based on the CAP principle that an obligation is placed on the EU when the market value in the EU falls below world prices.  It is not because Ireland or an Irish Minister requested it but rather that the Minister understands the principles and communications behind it and calls on his colleagues and the Commission to endorse their commitments.  It is not <Col N="317" /> done with the poor mouth but on the basis of the fulfilment of commitments. When I left office the value of that to the Irish cattle industry was £445 million. I am sorry to note that it has been reduced by almost one third.  There has been a loss of over £100 million to the cattle industry as a consequence of what can only be described as ineffective negotiation in terms of the rules of the EU.  I never put on a poor mouth but I could always call on my colleagues to endorse their obligations.  I did not confront them; I made them realise their obligations and that of the Commission under the rules of the Community.  The loss of £100 million is being felt in every cattle unit at present.</P>
    <P>I attended a board meeting today at which a board member, who is a prominent breeder in the cattle business, was more concerned about the collapse of cattle prices than about the business of the board.  Every Deputy and Senator will be aware of this and it is time the Minister adopted a different approach to negotiations.  He must follow the precedent he inherited and not put on a poor mouth.  The Minister should point out that under the rules we are entitled to support from export refunds, support which we have not received.</P>
    <P>When the BSE issue first arose in Britain I immediately saw the risk to our industry.  I spent days and nights at the Council of Ministers and with the Commission pointing out that Ireland was in a unique position as an island country with a disease free status.  My colleagues in the Council of Ministers accepted that Ireland was not to be tainted in any way by association with the UK BSE problem.  They made statements to that effect but I knew it was not enough.</P>
    <P>I said to Government that the consequences of this to our industry in the future could be disastrous unless I could demonstrate at home and abroad that we were deadly serious about this.  The Government made what is now recognised as a significant decision to slaughter a herd even if only one animal was suspected of having BSE.  I could then <Col N="318" /> tell my colleagues in Europe that we were not affected and that we could trace the sources of BSE to pure bred cattle which had been brought into Ireland at a considerable cost.  Everyone, including Senator D'Arcy, an experienced agriculturalist, will know that we import pure-bred cattle.</P>
    <P>This Government has been too slow in advertising and on insisting that Irish beef is guaranteed quality and is not contaminated.  The notion of a scare in relation to Irish beef is sad and reprehensible. It was a bit late when we decided to do a promotion in Britain.  I will support anything which the Government may do to make a vigorous presentation. The Minister will be able to rely on the records in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry relating to the actions we took to isolate ourselves from that awful notion.</P>
    <P>I was happy that in my time 72 per cent of the country was designated as disadvantaged, including areas in Wexford and places which hitherto would not have been acknowledged as being disadvantaged. However, I always believed that we should go a step further if we could.  I set up a special appeals body and invited three people to serve on it &mdash; the current president of the IFA, Mr. John Donnelly, who represented small farmers in that organisation; the doyen of fighters for small farmers, Mr. Dan McCarthy; and that most respected figure, Seamus Sheehy.  I asked them to carry out as much research as possible on this extension and reclassification.  They set about that with a will and I compliment them in that regard.  We have seen the significance of this in terms of reclassification, but we still await the extension of the disadvantaged areas on the basis of their recommendations.  The significance of this achievement is that over 70 per cent is paid from Europe and over 100 per cent of the premia price is paid from Europe, and we want this to be maximised.</P>
    <P>I have always been convinced that our future lies with the food processing industry, which represents 22 per cent of total manufacturing employment.  I do <Col N="319" /> not need to say anything about the advantages &mdash; for example, our climate. When I was Minister there were two junior Ministers in the Department &mdash; Deputy Joe Walsh, who had responsibility for food, and Deputy Séamus Kirk, who had responsibility for horticulture. While I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, for his diligence and application, this Government has not focused on this huge priority where we can avail of added value from primary production opportunities. We have seen a huge decline of processed products in the United Kingdom.  Our industry is well equipped to avail of these advantages and to beat and compete with the best in the market. I cringed when I heard the Kerry Group had got out of the red meat processing industry, which was a most successful enterprise.</P>
    <P>We set up a market development fund to hedge against currency devaluation in Britain against our strong currency. I have not seen evidence of a strong and vigorous approach to that recently.  While I appreciate the contribution made by my Fine Gael colleagues when we set about doing what was long overdue in 1987, it is an irony that leftist elements in this Government are getting the benefit of the decision we took to bring down inflation and interest rates and that we are now paying a price for our success.  Our currency is so strong that we are not able to make an impact on British markets.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will reactivate the market development fund and inform his colleagues that with co-operatives like Avonmore Foods plc, the Kerry Group and Tipperary Co-op Creamery Limited, we have the best equipped units to compete with and beat anyone. They must not be penalised because of our success in establishing the base for a strong economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond to Senator O'Kennedy, who raised a number of <Col N="320" /> issues.  With regard to the market development fund, unfortunately we must refund the money given to those involved in mushrooms because they had a problem with competitiveness on the British market.  If I were to follow Senator Wright's proposals, the same thing would have happened.  We are barred from having such a fund and those involved in mushrooms who benefited from the scheme now face repaying it, which is an unfortunate reality.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator O'Kennedy's remarks on the Minister for Food, responsibility for food is shared between the Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Food, Deputy Yates, and myself.  The Minister is, effectively, the Minister for Food and he has given this area high priority.  He is holding one of the greatest food extravaganzas, Horizons, in the history of the State next June where he will bring buyers from around the world and representatives of agriculture to Dublin to see what we have achieved.  It will be an unprecedented show case for Irish food.  The Minister and I realise the benefit of food when we represent Ireland abroad. We published a strategy paper last year on how we want the food industry to go in the future.  We cannot be accused of inactivity.</P>
      <P>The Kerry Group got out of red meat because it was not happy with the profitability margin of 3 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the disadvantaged areas schemes and the appeals body, Senator O'Kennedy, when Minister, met with some of my constituents.  He treated them very nicely, but unfortunately they were not successful.  It was a pity he did not attend a public meeting to answer <Col N="321" /> questions regarding structuring because some of his colleagues attempted to infer that the Minister and I had total responsibility for this decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that and I am glad the Senator has put on record that he established the appeals board. We were successful on reclassification; one million acres were included. However, I wish everybody knew how the appeals board was set up, and of its independence.  It was ingenious of the Senator, when Minister, to include the farming organisations because they made the difficult decision as to who should be included.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright is aware that there has been a problem in the tomato industry for some time.  He represents a constituency that is very dependent on horticulture; the majority of tomato farmers in the country are based in his constituency. Irish production has declined from a peak of 28,000 tonnes in 1979 to an estimated 10,000 tonnes in 1995 and is now confined, for the most part, from May to October of each year.</P>
      <P>I have met representatives of this industry on four occasions.  I introduced them to the major retailers in the country to ensure that more produce would be taken.  We have also established a forum on horticulture &mdash; not my idea, but at the request of the industry and about which Senator Wright appears to be somewhat cynical.  In addition, we brought this sector under the BES and the seed capital scheme for the first time last year.  This was welcomed.  This proposal had been made previously but was not taken up.  The sector has also been included under the farm improvement scheme at 35 per cent, the only sector of agriculture to be so included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is pity Senator Wright is not here to listen to what I have to say on this issue.  Before our accession to the EU. <Col N="322" /> Ireland maintained a ban on imports of tomatoes during the Irish production season.  On accession to the EU, producers faced competition, especially from the Netherlands, although the ban was maintained on imports from the Spanish Canary Islands.  This ban was lifted following the introduction of the Single Market.  A number of factors, such as increased Spanish production and imports from Morocco &mdash; 130,000 tonnes &mdash; at a preferential entry price free of customs duties under a bilateral agreement are having the effect of depressing prices in the EU.</P>
    <P>The Dutch now have a major problem with tomatoes.  They have had a large number of casualties because the EU Commission decided to fund the industry in Spain.  As a result there is now a major supply from the Spanish market. In addition, the devaluation of the peseta last year made Spanish tomatoes more competitive.  As the Dutch guilder continues to be strong, a large number of Dutch farmers are going out of business. The present situation is worse for them than it is for us.</P>
    <P>The 1995 subsidy of 56p per six kg box of tomatoes has been requested; this would cost approximately £650,000. In response to representations made to me and following discussions with An Bord Glas, it came up with a fund of £100,000 in 1995 for the tomato industry, resulting in a subsidy of 13p per tray per grower.  We gave this money on condition that growers would improve the quality of their produce to make them more competitive so that the Irish consumer would choose the Irish rather than the imported tomato.  This makes a lot of sense.  It is the way Irish produce will have to go in the future.  The consumers will decide.  If the Irish product has reached the required quality they will buy it but if not, then they will choose to buy an imported product.</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge Senator O'Kennedy's input, when Minister, to horticulture.  This industry has improved <Col N="323" /> considerably over the past five to six years, especially in such areas as potatoes, mushrooms, the general presentation of cabbages and so on.  This has resulted from the investment of £11 million on refrigeration, grading, hygiene and presentation.  We now import only a small amount of ware potatoes and are now coming to terms with the import of seed potatoes by substituting for them.  At one time we imported 80 per cent of Dutch cabbage but now we are almost self-sufficient &mdash; to the extent of 93 per cent.</P>
    <P>We have improved a lot; this must be acknowledged.  However, we are going to be hit with hard competition, which we must face, because of the open market, cheaper produce and the strength of the pound.  The only way we can compete is if the Irish product is of such quality that it will command a premium price.  I agree with Senator O'Kennedy that it is important to promote the healthy status of our Irish herd throughout the world because it is one of our most important competitive advantages.  I take any opportunity I get when working with An Bord Bia to point out the fact that our herd is free from BSE and from several other diseases which inflict European herds.  We have a problem with TB and brucellosis, but it is small compared to other diseases, including foot and mouth disease, in other parts of Europe.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be here this evening to continue this debate <Col N="324" /> on agriculture.  Last week the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, gave a wide-ranging account of progress in the sectors and of the many initiatives which he and I have taken during the past year to facilitate the development of those sectors and to improve the quality of the Department's services to the farmers concerned.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Byrne's point, the charter of farmers' rights is working well and has been acknowledged by farmers throughout the country.  They are now being paid headage and premia payments months earlier than before, despite the number of schemes in operation. The system has become more efficient.  I am sure Senator O'Kennedy started that process when he was Minister for Agriculture.  Farmers and customers are satisfied with the charter and the compulsion to make early payments. The number of complaints in this area has been significantly reduced.</P>
      <P>In the future traditional farming activities must be extended in scope and diversity in order to sustain viable rural communities.  As Minister with responsibility for rural development, I propose to outline some of the initiatives, schemes and services designed to promote this goal.</P>
      <P>I want to say a few words on the critical issue of beef export refunds, the resolution of which has been a prime concern of ours in recent months and about which many Senators also expressed concern last week.  I have been extremely disappointed with the European Commission's management of the export refund system during this time, but I must outline the background to this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the GATT, a progressively declining ceiling has been placed on subsidised cattle and beef exports from the European Union to third countries. The ceiling for the current GATT year is 1.19 million tonnes and it will decline to just over 800,000 tonnes by the year 2000.  Compliance with this ceiling is <Col N="325" /> controlled on the basis of export licences issued rather than on the basis of physical exports in the course of the GATT year, which runs from 1 July to the following 30 June.</P>
    <P>In view of this, the European Commission monitors the level of export licences issued on a regular basis in order to ensure that the overall ceiling on subsidised exports is not breached. Over the past number of months the Commission has taken the view that the level of licences issued was excessive and they adopted a number of measures during that period in order to discourage exporters from taking out export licences too far in advance of physical export.  These measures included cuts in export refunds, a substantial increase in the rate of security for export licences and a shortening of the period of validity of the licences.</P>
    <P>As far as the cuts in export refunds are concerned, the Commission has gone too far and both the Minister and his officials have made this clear to Commissioner Fischler and the Commission services.  The Minister has also raised the issue in the Council of Ministers. The Commission's response has been to increase export refunds on two occasions in the past few months &mdash; by 14 per cent on 1 December and by between 5 per cent and 7.5 per cent last Friday.  The increase in the refunds last Friday was taken at a specially convened meeting of the beef management committee which the Minister requested&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in order to ensure that an early decision was taken on the issue.  It does not always discuss the beef issue, as the Senator should know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It discusses a number of issues.  In formulating its proposal to the beef management committee, the Commission also responded to our request for a bigger increase in refunds on male hindquarter cuts, which are of particular importance to Ireland.</P>
      <P>While these increases are not a full solution to the price difficulties being faced by producers, they represent substantial progress on an issue on which Ireland had little support initially.  In particular, these increases should give a significant psychological boost to beef and cattle producers at this sensitive time.  However, I do not see last Friday's increase as a total solution.  The Minister will continue to seek the restoration of refunds to levels which make Irish beef competitive on international markets and which will at the same time underpin cattle prices at a level which will give a reasonable return to producers. Cattle prices should remain relatively stable for the immediate future because beef exporters are currently operating from licences which were prefixed at the higher refund rates which prevailed up to mid November.  The supply of these high rate prefixations is generally adequate to cover normal exports until the end of February.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point strongly today at the IFA meeting in Buswells Hotel that our factories should also look at their operations.  It is well known that they are taking full advantage of what is happening at present.  I am sure Senator O'Kennedy accepts that.  Beef should not be bought at current prices if the factories are to be fair to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The payment of the deseasonalisation slaughter premium, which is worth up to £60 per steer slaughtered this spring, will be an important factor in maintaining returns to winter fatteners.  This, in conjunction with premium payments, which have increased by £250 million since the onset of the CAP reform agreement in 1992, should help to underpin the income situation of beef <Col N="327" /> producers.  Nonetheless, my objective will be to continue to seek a restoration of refunds to levels which will make Irish beef and cattle competitive on international markets and at the same time provide producers with a reasonable return on their investments and efforts.</P>

      <P>It was relevant to reply to some of the questions raised.</P>
      <P>The alternative enterprise scheme provides substantial support for the development of alternative, non-quota enterprises.  It is expected that 3,000 individual projects will be assisted over the period of application of the scheme, with approximately 900 in the current year.  Development of the sport horse and deer industries continues to be among the priorities in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of agri-tourism has been a feature of alternative enterprise development in recent years.  Last year I announced approval of £2.4 million in grant commitments, which represents an investment of approximately £7 million. The development of agri-tourism along with other diversification measures will continue to be one of the features of farm development in the future.  It is the <Col N="328" /> intention of my Department to assist these developments where possible.</P>
    <P>The Leader scheme has been successful and it has inspired great hope in rural Ireland.  Almost all the Leader groups are signed up and have started their programmes; there are about five more with whom we must sign contracts. The programme has been successful and has given rise to great hope in rural communities.</P>
    <P>The last Act dealing with the greyhound industry was passed in 1958.  I am now reviewing the legislation and hope to have a new Act in place by the end of 1996, with the co-operation of the industry and the ICC.  It is time we gave the industry a boost; it needs support. It is an important part of alternative farm enterprise which needs encouragement.  With the investment begun by the last Government and continued, I am happy to say, by this Administration, the improvement of facilities in Shelbourne Park, new legislation, a new, focused board, and recent developments in Thurles, of which I was reminded by the Senator&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a new dynamism should be given to the industry.  Control is always crucial and we will introduce a new controls board, independent of the main board.  That is crucial to the integrity of the industry.</P>
      <P>I have responsibility for horticulture, despite what Senator Wright may think, and I am pro-active in the area.  I have met more deputations from the industry than all the previous Ministers put together.  We have set up a horticultural forum at the request of the industry, not on my initiative.  I cannot see why the industry &mdash; or Senator Wright, seeing himself as its representative &mdash; is now criticising that forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Horticulture is a sector with great potential, both as a mainstream farm activity and as an alternative or supplement <Col N="329" /> to mainstream activities.  Last year our horticultural output was about £220 million, up 4 per cent on the previous year.  One area of particular promise is hardy nursery stock.  Irish people are becoming more conscious of their gardens and of green areas in towns and villages and there is now major demand for hardy nursery plants.</P>
    <P>There is also an export element which we could exploit.  Because of improvements in refrigeration, grading, presentation, etc., Irish horticultural products can compete with imports, so this is a great source of import substitution.  As I said earlier, we export potatoes to European markets, soft fruit to England and the mushroom industry has been a great success.  The only thing threatening this at present are currency difficulties. I hope that through better management procedures, quality control and other measures, the industry can survive. It will have to respond to currency difficulties because it looks likely that the Irish pound will remain strong against Sterling for some time. However, if it gets over the present problems, it can continue.</P>
    <P>REPS is also under my jurisdiction and I am happy to say the scheme has been extremely successful.  When I came into the Department about 500 applicants had been approved.  I accepted there had been a sluggish take off but I am delighted to say that following the Department's efforts, 11,000 farmers have now been approved under the scheme and over £38 million has been paid out, which has gone directly into rural communities.  It is one of the most positive schemes ever introduced here. Some £230 million must be spent before the end of 1997 and I hope it will all be taken up because it will enhance our image as a nation which embraces environmentally friendly farming.  That is important because it will send out a positive message.</P>
    <P>The scheme for early retirement from farming has also been successful.  It has released about 124,000 hectares to young trained farmers.  Senator O'Kennedy will agree it is important to give <Col N="330" /> young people every incentive to get into agriculture, because they will ensure its survival.  Both this scheme and the farm installation aid scheme are important incentives for older farmers to retire early and for young farmers to begin at the prime of their lives, not having to wait until they are almost at pension age themselves, before gaining control of the farm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also urge the Minister to work with that marvellous, vigorous organisation, Macra na Feirme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing so and I agree with the Senator that it is a positive, pro-active organisation which comes up with a large number of proposals every year.  I am working closely with them on leasing, an area where we can make much progress.  I am happy about the developments in this year's budget, whereby concessions were made on the taxation of income from leasing. Admittedly there were not enough but at least it is a step in the right direction. The level of land leasing in this country is far lower than in any other in Europe. It is now the main way land is transferred in Europe so we will have to concentrate on making it attractive for people to take out long-term leases, because it satisfies both the lessor and the lessee.</P>
      <P>The CSO's preliminary estimate of output, input and income in agriculture for 1995 was released today.  It shows that farm income increased to £2.107 billion in 1995, 7.7 per cent above the 1994 level.  Last year was the first year that incomes topped £2 billion.  Total direct subsidy payments to farmers were £747 million and levies came to £36 million, giving a net subsidy figure of £711 million, 11.4 per cent higher than in 1994.  In other words, 1995 was a record year for Irish agriculture and I am happy to say the outlook for 1996, apart from the beef industry, is generally optimistic. The dairy, sheep and pig sectors should be quite profitable this year.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for attending this evening.  Although I raised this matter with the Minister for Education, the Minister of State has a responsibility in this regard and I am glad he is present. I have been looking at his long-term objectives and I may find I am pushing an open door on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this matter because I discovered recently that post-graduate students involved in certain areas of research are paid a grant by Forbairt. The grants are at the same level today <Col N="332" /> as ten years ago &mdash; £1,000.  In many cases this would represent the sole income of such students.  When one considers they could get almost £3,500 on unemployment assistance there is a need to review the level of grants.  Many of our brightest post-graduates are leaving Ireland to pursue post-graduate research in order to avail of more financially rewarding opportunities in foreign universities.  As a result, the Irish economy loses.</P>
    <P>A friend of my family who has studied for the past four years for a primary degree at university and came out every year as the best student in his class, is studying this year at a university in Chicago.  He was offered a position there and given about $12,000 for maintenance. Given the situation in Chicago he may find it impossible to return to Ireland.  That is only one example from my own experience.  From talking to others I know that many of the brightest students do their research in the US, the UK or other European countries.  They leave because the opportunities are better abroad.  They get more support and the opportunities thereafter appear greater from a financial point of view.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is trying to create a modern economy here.  Last year he spent a substantial amount on the industrial side. He will agree it is rare that the university research student is discussed in the terms of his remit.  The Minister's first concern is to get industry moving to invest more in research and development and he has been successful in that regard.  While he is making grant aid available to a couple of hundred companies per year, the amount of expenditure coming from industry into research and development is increasing. However, the level is still unacceptable and we will have to keep working at it. The Minister of State is trying to create a situation where we are comparable to our competitors in Europe.  Unless we have good research and development <Col N="333" /> we will not get good added value, be able to protect jobs or be in a position to beat our competitors with new products.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is committed to trying to create an ethos which is innovative, which uses research and development to the fullest and which will make us world leaders eventually if we do it to the best of our ability.  However, if we are losing many of our best students to our foreign competitors the economy also loses.  I suggest the Minister of State examines the position with regard to the supports available to post-graduate students involved in research.</P>
    <P>Some people may be in a better position than others but there are students who have no source of income save the money they get from their parents and money they might earn from the university while doing their research.  Many students would get the grant of £1,000 and might make £1,000 from work they do in the university but that would be their total income.  They have to pay their fees out of that, which may be up to £1,500 a year.  Having spent four years at university to get a good degree and proceeding to do a masters or a doctorate, they are paupers.  It is easy for them to accept opportunities abroad and those who can avail of them jump at them.</P>
    <P>It is important to try to keep these students in the country, to create a reserve of expertise in Ireland and to let that be known.  It would make us a more attractive location for certain industries.  The amount of money involved would not be great &mdash; Forbairt grant aided about 160 students last year at a cost of £160,000.  If that amount were to be multiplied by three it would still be a small sum but students would at least have an amount close to what they could get on unemployment assistance.  By next September the Minister might be able to increase the grants to that level.</P>
    <P>Universities can also get research funding from various sources, such as <Col N="334" /> the Irish Cancer Society or the Irish Kidney Association.  However, the Minister of State has a direct input in this regard and I look forward to his response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cotter obviously knows a good deal about this subject. Although this matter was put to the Minister for Education and I am present almost by accident, it is a subject dear to my heart and one which I am currently examining in the context of the STIAC report.  On behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, who was due to be here this evening, I wish to say that there is an appreciation of the topic of research Senator Cotter has raised.</P>
      <P>The importance of research in higher education is underlined in the White Paper on education <i>Charting our Education Future.</i> In the White Paper it is stated that the universities are mainly concerned with the undergraduate and post-graduate degree level programmes together with basic and applied research.</P>
      <P>The role of universities as discoverers and disseminators of knowledge sets the context within which links emerge between research and teaching.  As Senator Cotter has said, the value of research also reaches into the spheres of technological development and international competitiveness.  The higher education sector is a major supplier to research efforts in Ireland.  In the period 1982-92, for example, expenditure on research in the higher education sector increased in real terms by over 200 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of funding the report of the National Education Convention stated that &ldquo;there would be a general welcome for the development of a more explicit national policy on the funding of research in third level education&rdquo;.  In relation to the block grant to the colleges <Col N="335" /> the report stated that &ldquo;the unified budget which forms the block grant to colleges would provide the basic level of research funding.  It is accepted that selectivity would arise in relation to additional funding for which academics would be encouraged to bid&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible, however, to divorce from research policy financial assistance to postgraduate students involved in research programmes.  In this context the White Paper provides that in moving towards a more explicit policy in relation to research, the Department will take into account the consultancy study in relation to university research and its funding which is being carried out under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority as well as the relevant recommendation made by Science Technology and Innovation Advisory Council &mdash; STIAC.</P>
    <P>A number of important principles will inform a research policy for the third level sector.  The unified teaching and research budget, which forms the block grant to colleges, will be continued; it will provide the basic level of research funding.  The role of research in course development and the advancement of knowledge in all disciplines will be recognised.  Any additional funding for research will be provided as a separate budget for which competitive bidding will be the norm, with independent assessment of research proposals by international peers.  Within the education sector most basic and strategic research will be predominantly in the universities, while the focus of the technological colleges will be on applied, regionally oriented research.  The role of research in technological development and international competitiveness will be recognised.  The need to develop centres of excellence involving co-operation between institutions and disciplines, particularly in expensive research areas, will be examined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> Within this framework each institution will develop and publish an explicit policy on its approach to research, including the broad balance between research and teaching commitments within disciplines.  The policy will also set out the key aims of research activity and the principal criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of research within the institutions.</P>
    <P>Funding is also provided for post-graduate students by the Office of Science and Technology through Forbairt, as Senator Cotter said.  It provides a grant of £1,000 a year for three academic years for PhD students.  At present approximately 170 students benefit under this scheme.  There is also a scheme whereby funding is provided for students with master's degrees undertaking research.  The funding is provided on a collaborative basis with funding from industry.  A sum of £3,500 per year is provided for two years, with 50 per cent provided by Forbairt and 50 per cent provided by industry.  Approximately 105 students are currently being funded under this scheme.</P>
    <P>As Senator Cotter said, my Office is directly concerned with this matter for all of the good reasons he advanced. There cannot be applied research and a functioning research and development sector &mdash; which is so important if we are to grow indigenous industry and encourage foreign companies to put down roots here &mdash; unless basic research teaching takes place in the universities and other third level institutions and unless the best students stay in Ireland rather than being sucked abroad by the blandishments to which Senator Cotter referred.</P>
    <P>I was able to persuade the Minister for Finance to make £4 million available in the budget for the implementation of some of the priority recommendations of the Tierney report.  I have not commented publicly on this yet but I can say, out of respect for this House and the fact that Senator Cotter raised the <Col N="337" /> matter, that it is my intention to increase the stipend before next September. I accept that it is ridiculous to expect PhD students to subsist on £1,000 per annum &mdash; they would receive more if they were FÁS trainees or drawing the dole.  I know that the situations are not analogous for other reasons, but there are pressures on students.  I intend to address that in the very near future. In addition, the programmes for advanced technology in the universities absorb a large number of PhD students who are paid a more respectable stipend for their work.</P>
    <P>I hope to be in a position in the very near future to do something significant in this area.  I do not doubt that it will not go as far as Senator Cotter or the body representing these students, which recently made a submission to me in this regard, would like.  However, I will significantly improve a situation which, as Senator Cotter said, has obtained for the best part of a decade.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  As someone who deals with students, I was glad to hear his response to Senator Cotter's question. The matter which I am raising this evening concerns students and other young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of illegal drugs in this country is a multifaceted problem and I wish to highlight one aspect which was recently brought to my attention.  During the last session of the Seanad I spoke about the immediate health dangers of the illegal but widely used drug Ecstasy, or <Col N="338" /> MDMA.  It is widely available and quite cheap to buy.  During the last few years there have been several deaths in this country which were related to Ecstasy use and many more young people have become seriously ill after taking it or other &ldquo;dance drugs&rdquo; at nightclubs or dance parties.</P>
    <P>Most of the deaths appear to be associated with the medical syndrome described as heat stroke.  This involves the development of very high body temperatures &mdash; over 40 degrees &mdash; dehydration, high pulse rate, low blood pressure and blood coagulation leading to kidney failure and death in quite a few of the cases.  Apart from the ingestion of the drug, several other factors are important in the development of heat stroke.  The young people are usually dancing energetically and the venues are crowded and hot.</P>
    <P>We know that taking these drugs is very dangerous but there are some precautions which can avoid really serious problems if people persist in this unwise activity.  Students' unions have put out some information about what one should do.  For example, avoiding alcohol and drinking plenty cold water is a help.  It is very difficult for those involved in running nightclubs and discos or raves to ensure that drugs do not enter the premises and people can take the drug before they get to the venue. However, it is quite easy to ensure a good supply of cold water on the premises.</P>
    <P>Imagine my amazement when I was told by young people who frequent these parties that the water in the taps of the hand basins in the lavatories are frequently turned off at the stopcock for the whole night.  This means that the dancers have to buy water at vastly inflated prices at the bar.  The bar does not make much money because the dancers do not want to buy alcohol, but they have paid an entrance fee.  From a purely public health point of view, it is entirely unacceptable that customers <Col N="339" /> are unable to wash their hands after using the lavatories.  It is much worse when the lives of those who have unwisely taken drugs are put even more at risk.</P>
    <P>From the public health point of view, who is in charge of enforcing legislation which ensures proper hygiene facilities in these venues?  I have approached several Departments about this.  The health and safety regulations appear to cover the rights of workers.  The Intoxicating Liquor Act covers bars and public houses.  The special restaurant licence standards of 1988 cover restaurants and other places where food is served. However, what covers venues which one night holds a rave and the next night a concert by Pavarotti?  It is not enough to say that it is up to the local authorities.  Are environmental health officers involved?  Who is supposed to ensure that the water keeps flowing?  I am not even insisting that it should be drinking water &mdash; because I know that they do not have to make that available &mdash; but just clean water so that these potentially lethal situations could be avoided.  Clean water used to be freely available at bars &mdash; and there was often ice in it &mdash; but those days appear to have gone.</P>
    <P>I suppose it would be too much to request that the employees of such venues be given some training in first aid, considering the large numbers of customers present on the premises. These venues are supposed to take care of their employees.  Would it be possible that they have people on the premises who could recognise that a patron was seriously ill or had taken drugs?  Emergency aid in such situations could be essential in preserving life.  For example, providing extra ventilation for someone who became ill in an overcrowded room would be of benefit.</P>
    <P>A great deal of money is made from the leisure activities of the young.  No matter how much we disapprove of it, <Col N="340" /> this sort of activity is taking place and drugs are being taken.  We must make all efforts to prevent the taking of illegal drugs.  The lethal side-effects of so doing should be publicised.  If deaths and serious illness can be reduced by the provision of clean water, it is essential that this be done.  Who is in charge of supplying water to hand basins?  Who has the power to ensure that the supply of water must be maintained?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am slightly ashamed to say that I am less surefooted on this subject. However, I have enough knowledge to state that the points raised by Senator Henry are extremely important and even critical.  They highlight the extent to which social practice has outpaced the law in Ireland.  I am also embarrassed to state that during the short time available to me to consider this matter, it was difficult to discover who holds the responsibility for it.  The buck is being passed between various Departments and public authorities.  We seem to be closing our eyes to the phenomenon that, as the Senator stated, is taking place in society.  Young people are being exposed to certain risks and yet it appears that there is no legislative framework in place to provide the guarantees sought by Senator Henry.</P>
      <P>In so far as the matter relates to my Department, it relates to the area of responsibility of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for Labour Affairs, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald. Unfortunately, she is unable to attend this evening and she asked me to reply on her behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to deal with the responsibilities of the Minister for Labour Affairs for occupational health and safety in all places where there are people at work and provide Senator Henry with the information available to me on the general position in relation to the safety <Col N="341" /> and health of the public in places of public entertainment.</P>
    <P>In relation to the responsibility of the Minister for Labour Affairs, the following is the position.  Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the Minister is responsible for the making of regulations in connection with the occupational safety and health of all workers.  The Act also established the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health &mdash; the Health and Safety Authority &mdash; the body responsible for enforcing these regulations.  In 1993 the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 1993, were passed into law. These regulations state that suitable and sufficient sanitary and washing facilities shall be made available for the use of employees.</P>
    <P>For places of work used for the first time after 31 December 1992, and places of work which undergo modifications, extensions or conversions after that date, section 12 of the Third Schedule to these regulations contains a comprehensive list of the sanitary and washing facilities that are required to be made available for employees.  These include, if appropriate, easily accessible and sufficiently large changing rooms, adequate and suitable shower rooms or, if showers are not required, adequate and suitable washbasins and an adequate number of lavatories and washbasins should also be provided.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Miscellaneous Welfare Provisions) Regulations, which were signed into law on 21 December 1995, provide that every employer must ensure that an adequate supply of drinking water is provided and maintained at suitable points conveniently accessible to all employed persons.  I am aware that this is not the precise point addressed by Senator Henry.  However, it seems that the employees concerned have the same rights of access to drinking water during concerts or performances <Col N="342" /> as they have at any other time during the day.  I presume that such access ought to be available to anyone.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that the above regulations cover the provision of basic sanitary services and drinking water for workers only.  While these health and safety regulations apply to places of public entertainment as places of work, they do not apply to the public.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the wellbeing of the public while in places of public entertainment, I am advised that the following is the position.  Under the Building Regulations, 1991 (S.I. No. 306 of 1991), which are the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, all buildings built since the beginning of 1992 and older buildings which have changed their use are required to have adequate sanitary and washing facilities.  These regulations are enforced by local authorities.  It appears that prior to 1992 there was no legal provision for buildings to have adequate sanitary services.  I understand that, apart from ensuring that buildings constructed since 1992 have adequate sanitary and washing facilities, there is no monitoring by any public body to ensure that these facilities are made available to the occupants or users of these buildings in the way, for example, that fire officers, who operate out of local authorities, monitor fire safety under the Dance Halls Act, 1935.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for Education has issued guidelines on safety in places of outdoor entertainment. These guidelines cover the provision of drinking water and sanitary services at places of outdoor entertainment. However, I am informed that the guidelines are voluntary.  I am not aware of any Department or agency which has a statutory obligation to ensure that adequate sanitary facilities are made available to the public.</P>
    <P>It appears that the Senator has identified an area which warrants further investigation.  Given the responsibilities <Col N="343" /> of the Minister for the Environment under the building regulations mentioned previously, it appears that he is the person best placed to advise the Senator in relation to her concerns. Accordingly, I have arranged that a <Col N="344" /> copy of her motion and my comments will be passed to him together with a request that he reply directly to her.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 February 1996.</P>
