      <P>I have notice from Senator Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that Dún LaoghaireRathdown County Council retains their vocational education committee in light of the new boundaries.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to sanction and provide funds for a public sewerage scheme in the villages of Ballintubber and Cloonfad in County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Maloney on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide funding to Letterkenny general hospital for an increase in nursing staff at the hospital which is at present inadequate.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Honan on the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> To ask the Minister for Health when he proposes to introduce the child abuse register as recommended in the report on the Kilkenny incest case.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cassidy on the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide funding as a matter of urgency for Castlepollard Vocational School, County Westmeath, to replace the existing outdated prefabricated structures.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Norris on the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to issue an invitation to the representatives of ISHOF to make a presentation to the Government regarding the possibility of establishing an international aquatic centre at Ringsend.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Cosgrave, Finneran, Maloney, Honan, Cassidy and Norris as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Cosgrave's and Senator Finneran's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <P>I seek clarification on the issue of funding &mdash; EU funding and Irish-American funding &mdash; for the Border regions, which has been raised on this <Col N="347" /> side of the House on several occasions. Does the Leader intend giving Government time to debate that issue because my party has two motions on the Order Paper at present and must decide whether to deal with the matter in Private Members' Time?  We hope the Leader would give more time to the issue as many of the Leader's colleagues, along with numerous Senators on this side of the House, wish to speak on this issue at present.  It has become an important issue and we feel it should be addressed.  If it is not dealt with in Government time, we will address it in Private Members' Time in a couple of weeks?</P>

      <P>First, I welcome yesterday's High Court decision to dismiss the challenge to the outcome of the divorce referendum.  Will the Leader urge the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, to introduce legislation as swiftly as possible and assure him of the support of the Progressive Democrats in doing so?</P>
      <P>As I was unsuccessful in having my matter taken on the Adjournment, will the Leader ask the Minister for Health to establish a child abuse register as a matter of urgency as it was recommended by the report on the Kilkenny incest case, which is almost three years old?  The urgency for such a register was highlighted last week by the horrific case involving a man sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for abusing his five month old child.  This was the second incident involving the man so it is a matter of the greatest urgency in order to protect further children from this kind of abuse.</P>

      <P>Senator Wright raised the question of the funding in the Border regions and asked me to make Government time available.  Clearly, I will not make Government time available for item 16, motion 24, which, as the Senator well knows, is a motion condemning the Government.  I do not think it is my job to make time available for that sort of motion, but if a different wording could be found where the issue could be discussed through statements, I would be happy to make time available. We can discuss that afterwards.  If the Senator wishes to go ahead with his condemnatory motion, time will not be made available and he can use his party's Private Members' Time.</P>
      <P>I note Senator Honan's comments on yesterday's High Court decision on divorce. While there is still the question of an appeal, I know the Minister has the legislation at an advanced stage of preparation. Certainly, it is his intention to bring the legislation before both Houses at the earliest possible moment.</P>
      <P>On the question of the child abuse register, I will pass on Senator Honan's observations to the Minister.  That legislation is also at a fairly advanced stage and should be published within the next couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>The Dáil has passed all Stages of both the VHI Bill and the Dumping at Sea Bill so I expect we will take those two Bills in the next couple of weeks.  I was asked yesterday about statements on broadcasting and I am confident that they will take place before the end of this month.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader for giving me time to present this Bill and the Minister for coming to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sex tourism is one part of the burgeoning international tourist business.  It usually involves those from well off western countries going to Third World countries and behaving in ways they might not at home.  Whether or not this is permissible or exploitative of the poor, the involvement of children in this sordid trade is particularly regrettable. The articles by Nuala Ó Faoláin, published recently in <i>The Irish Times</i>, gave the public in Ireland a small and in no way exaggerated picture of this activity in the Philippines.  As I said when I tried to introduce the banning of child sex tours in the Package Holidays and Travel Trade Bill last year, the sexual exploitation of children is repugnant to most Irish people.  I am glad to be able to present this Bill to the House as a practical expression of our determination <Col N="350" /> that it should not happen here or elsewhere.  Children everywhere must be protected from such activities.</P>
    <P>The Third World countries where this appalling activity is carried out are poor. They have rapidly increasing populations, often little family planning, economies which are or have been exploited by us and little to offer in some areas except holidays for tourists from abroad.  Little is to be gained from describing how children become involved in these &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; holidays. They are stolen, enticed and coerced into co-operating.  Drugs are frequently involved; sometimes children are sold by parents who are drug addicts.</P>
    <P>Reports by UNICEF, End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism &mdash; which initially dealt only with cases in the Far East but now operates worldwide &mdash; or PREDA make shameful reading.  As Senators will know from a recent television programme, PREDA is organised by Fr. Shay Cullen, an Irish priest who is supported by Trócaire in campaigning courageously against these activities in the Philippines.  That any adults would use children in such a manner is appalling.</P>
    <P>A global report by Jubilee Action, an organisation in Britain which campaigns against child sex tourism, carries a health warning which says that it contains material which may shock people. I can give a copy of the report to any Senators who may wish to read it.  The activities which have been publicised in Ireland involve the Philippines but this report shows that far from these facilities being available only in that country they are provided for tourists in many Third World countries.</P>
    <P>Officials in Third World countries are attempting to fight against the abuse of their children and have passed legislation to counteract these activities. Vested interests in some countries where democracy has less force than here make it imperative that we do all these countries suggest to help them.  Ms Ó Faoláin's articles were about the child sex trade in the Philippines but it is much the same in many other countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> Legislation has been introduced in the Philippines which describes paedophilia as a &ldquo;heinous crime&rdquo; and the death penalty can be invoked.  However, prosecutions of locals and tourists do not take place and loopholes are easily exploited.  Thailand, another country with serious problems, has established an Attorney General specifically to deal with the problem.  In Brazil there is such concern that the Government there has organised a conference on the subject in the spring.  Many other Third World countries are endeavouring to tackle this outrage, but there is great poverty and a sense of resignation to the problem among many of their citizens.  Even parents in dire circumstances have been known to collaborate with abuses.</P>
    <P>There are hopeful signs.  Tourism organisations, in general, are composed of reputable people who have no desire to profit from the flesh of little children. They have been in the forefront of those seeking international legislation to stop these activities.  The Universal Federation of Travel Agents Association has strongly condemned any form of tourism involving child abuse.  It has also supported ECPAT's campaign and has agreed to help that organisation to alert the public so that existing regulations are applied.  It has encouraged its national member bodies to support ECPAT and sends delegates to its conferences. The International Hotel Association has offered support and advised hotels to advertise that they do not condone child prostitution.</P>
    <P>The World Tourism Organisation, at its meeting in Sofia in 1985, urged states and individuals to prevent the possibility of using tourism to exploit minors for prostitution purposes.  At Madrid in 1994, it requested Governments to take action to identify and eliminate all forms of organised sex tourism.  At St. Vincent in Italy in April 1995, the WTO urged Governments to &ldquo;prosecute, sanction and hold liable under national law companies, agents, clubs, associations and other entities as well as individuals that promote sex tourism involving <Col N="352" /> children&rdquo;.  Many companies and trade unions involved in tourism promotion bodies have made similar pleas. The tourism trade does not want involvement in these vile practices and it feels those who are involved should be exposed and prosecuted.</P>
    <P>The support I have been given by such tourism bodies and the encouragement by the embassies of many of the countries whose children are involved has been most helpful, but it is to Muireann Ó'Briain, S.C that I must give most praise.  Not only did she help me in drafting the Bill but her investigations over the past few years on an international basis have been the catalyst for many parliamentarians across Europe to take action against this deplorable trade.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that people other than paedophiles are involved. Many whose moral code at home would not allow them in any way to molest children appear to feel that minors abroad can be treated differently. People who travel to poor countries sometimes change their behaviour and do things they would never do at home. They justify it on the basis that the young people need the money and that they have different and freer attitudes to sex.  Fear of contracting AIDS has made those who generally only have sex with adults seek younger partners, not realising that this can be as risky.  The HIV virus is blood borne and young and damaged tissues can be very infected if the child is HIV positive.  This is even more likely, of course, if drugs are already involved.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Declaration on Human Rights, which we ratified specifically in Article 19, states that member states:</P>
    <P>shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal <Col N="353" /> guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.  Such protective measures should, as appropriate, include effective procedures for the establishment of social programmes to provide necessary support for the child and for those who have the care of the child, as well as for other forms of prevention and for identification, reporting, referral, investigation, treatment and follow-up of instances of child maltreatment described heretofore, and, as appropriate, for judicial involvement.</P>
    <P>Article 34 states:</P>
    <P>State Parties undertake to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse.  For those purposes, States Parties shall in particular take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent:</P>
    <P>(a)  The inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity;</P>
    <P>(b)  The exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices;</P>
    <P>(c)  The exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.</P>
    <P>Article 35 states:</P>
    <P>States parties shall take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the abduction of, the sale of or traffic in children for any purpose or in any form.</P>
    <P>Article 33 is also important because children are often drugged before they are abused.  It states:</P>
    <P>States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislative, administrative, social and educational measures, to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances as defined in the relevant international treaties, <Col N="354" /> and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances.</P>
    <P>It is this abuse of children that my Bill addresses.</P>
    <P>The definition of child sexual abuse in the Bill is largely derived from the Law Reform Commission's Consultation Paper and Report on Child Sexual Abuse in which certain new offences were proposed.  The wording may be explicit but it is necessary.  No perpetrator of such crimes should be able to say they did not understand what they were doing was wrong because of ancient wordings.  Most legislation on these subjects in other jurisdictions have brought in up to date laws with clear descriptions.  To my horror, after the Brendan Smyth case, comments made by some people made it clear that they did not understand how damaging non-penetrative sex could be to young children, especially when a trusted person is involved.  Therefore, I am stressing the relevance of non-penetrative sexual activity in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no one answer to the problem of child sexual abuse either here or abroad.  This Bill is only part of the solution. Another part is the excellent Bill on extra territorial prosecution being brought forward by Deputy E. Ryan and Deputy O'Donoghue in the Lower House.  That Bill deals with offences committed abroad while my Bill deals with offences committed at home by those involved in the tourism business.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe, in Recommendation R(91) 11 of the Committee of Ministers, has recommended that all member states &ldquo;dissuade travel agencies from promoting sex tourism in any form, especially through publicity&rdquo;.  This Bill is a direct response.  It is straightforward and should be easy to enforce.  It is not necessary to find an individual involved in a sexual act with a child and there is no problem with transporting witnesses across the world; the legislation of other jurisdictions is not involved either.  I have suggested an upper age limit of 16 years for the <Col N="355" /> definition of a child, although the UN Convention on the Child defines them as any person under 18 years of age. The reason I inserted 16 years of age is that in some European countries, like the Netherlands, for example, one may legally engage in prostitution after 16 years of age and I am most anxious that this Bill should be as easily enforceable and have as few loopholes as possible.</P>
    <P>Other European countries, as well as Australia and New Zealand, have or are introducing similar legislation.  However, the British response has been somewhat different.  Lord Hylton in the House of Lords and Michael Alison, M.P. in the House of Commons have brought forward a Private Members' Bill regarding extra territorial legislation against sex offenders; but the British Government, despite strenuous pressure by Jubilee Action, has not accepted it.  It is instead proposing conspiracy combined with incitement legislation to track down those who organise sex tours.  That Government also feels the extra territorial Bill will be difficult to enforce.  It may be, but Sweden has recently succeeded in prosecuting one of its citizens.  Therefore, I support Deputy Ryan's and Deputy O'Donoghue's efforts.  Conspiracy legislation regarding sex tours, as put forward by the British Government, would be difficult to use in dealing with the promotion of sex tours involving children because it has been notoriously difficult to enforce anywhere.  A measure such as my straightforward Bill which only involves our own jurisdiction is much more likely to be enforceable.</P>
    <P>The deterrent effect of such legislation is also important.  Since this Bill addresses crimes within as well as outside the State, the Government could look on it as strengthening our pornography laws.  At present it is not an offence to produce or possess child pornography in this State but this would make both so.  When the Video Recordings Act was introduced in 1987, it may have been decided that nobody would make or possess such pornography. <Col N="356" /> There has been a loophole in that Act.  Laws against importation alone are not adequate in the technological age in which we live.  This legislation can be used against the promotion of child pornography on the Internet.  Electronic child pornography and computer generated child sex images would be illegal if made or possessed.</P>
    <P>The Government has been invited to take part in the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in Sweden in August of this year.  Acceptance of this Bill would show the Government's commitment to the plan of action which will be discussed at the congress, to which, I hope, a high level delegation will be sent.  The Swedish Government is to be commended for hosting this meeting and the Australian and New Zealand Governments are to be commended for being the first to take action in this area.  A man of Irish descent, Mr. Ron O'Grady, in New Zealand had the unique vision of involving many forces in this campaign. As well as activating many individuals at grassroot level to protect children in their own countries, he has involved Interpol, the tourist organisations, World Health Organisation, UNICEF, international labour organisations and Governments all over the world.</P>
    <P>The increase in international tourism has brought pleasure to tourists and employment to those involved in promoting holidays.  However, this sort of tourism is entirely unacceptable.  I visited the Falls in Pansanjam in the Philippines long before it became a haven for paedophiles, but even then, ten years ago, Caucasian men could be seen with very young girls in hotels in Manila. Recently I was told children are being &ldquo;imported&rdquo; into Western Europe for illicit sex.  By supporting my Bill the Minister and Government could show that in Ireland we will do all in our power to put an end to these activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the slight delay.  There was a division in the other House at 11 <Col N="357" /> o'clock and I could not get away immediately.  Senator Henry deserves to be congratulated for her work in bringing forward this Bill, which seeks to combat the organisation in Ireland of child sex tours abroad.  The Senator has a proud record in this House of compassionate support for victims of sexual violence and exploitation and this Bill is very much in keeping with that record. I am aware from my own experience, as Minister for Justice and before that as a Deputy, how difficult a task it is to define and refine ideas into the form of a Bill.  Very often what seems like a straightforward objective can be difficult to translate into precise legislative proposals.  It takes time, effort and commitment. I know, therefore, how much work Senator Henry must have put into the Bill and for that she ought to be commended by this House.</P>
      <P>I believe that Members on all sides of this House will support the objective of this Bill.  I share that objective and I will not oppose a Second Reading of the Bill.  It is difficult to imagine a more repulsive trade than that of organising the sexual exploitation of children and we in the Oireachtas must do everything possible to prevent Ireland taking part in what is a growing world phenomenon. Of course the natural inclination is to concentrate more on domestic issues and less on what is happening far away.  The temptation is to say that problems of this kind can be tackled where they occur and that we cannot do anything about it.  However true that may be in a general way, there are certain issues, and I believe this is one of them, where we must face up to a global responsibility in combating a global problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all familiar with the vulnerability of children and we can all too easily and painfully imagine the special vulnerability of children from impoverished families in less developed countries. I know I can because I have witnessed their suffering and impoverishment at first hand in a number of countries.  Economic pressure often leads parents to send their young <Col N="358" /> children to work in exploitative conditions. Sometimes they are far away from home and so are particularly at risk.  Extreme poverty leads to the break up of families, to population drift to the cities, and to a wide incidence of home-lessness. For many, childhood does not take place and instead there is a direct transition from infancy to premature adulthood.  Many children are used as cheap labour, some are forced into prostitution and become victims of sexual exploitation of the grossest kind, including exploitation by paedophile tourists.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that the phenomenon of paedophile tourism poses special problems in certain countries. Mass tourism means that most less developed countries are within the reach and the budget of many from the developed world.  The value of tourism to less developed countries, and in particular the value of foreign currency, can unfortunately militate against effective local action against tourists.  Local enforcement authorities are often reluctant to enforce laws against foreign tourists.  Furthermore, the relevant authorities may not have the resources that are required to enable them to operate effectively.  Another difficulty that has arisen is that even when an offence has been detected and pursued, the only sanctions that have been imposed in some cases are deportation and a fine, which can allow the offender to travel to another country to continue to abuse children.</P>
    <P>I understand that the issue of child sexual abuse is one that has been highlighted and is being pursued in many of the countries in question and I sincerely hope that the steps that are being taken in that regard will lead to the situation where all forms of exploitation of children for sexual purposes will be eliminated in those countries.  I am sure the House will appreciate that the solutions to the problems that arise in those countries lie essentially with those countries themselves and that there is a limit to what can be achieved by other states who wish to put an end to the evil trade of child sex tourism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> That being said, however, there is no doubt but that the international community has a role to play in eliminating child sex tourism and the problem has been recognised internationally as one that creates obligations for all states, especially where their own nationals are involved.  In response to the problem, a worldwide campaigning organisation, referred to by Senator Henry, has been set up to tackle the issue of child prostitution on a number of fronts.  This organisation, which is called &ldquo;End Child Prostitution in Asia&rdquo; (ECPAT), has offices in many countries and works closely with organisations such as UNICEF and Interpol and also with tourism agencies.  In addition to directing efforts towards the receiving countries where the offences take place, ECPAT has been lobbying the Governments of the major sending countries from which many of the offenders travel in order to avail of child prostitution.</P>
    <P>Senators may be aware that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland has ratified, places general obligations on states to take action both at national and international level to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse.  This obligation is not confined to child nationals of a particular state. Article 34 of the Convention refers to the protection of children from all forms of sexual abuse and requires states to take all appropriate national, bilateral, and multilateral measures to prevent the inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity and the exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in 1993 the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights stressed the need for states to address the problem of exploitation and abuse of children and to provide effective measures against harmful child labour, the sale of children, child prostitution and other forms of sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the Working Group <Col N="360" /> on Contemporary Forms of Slavery has adopted a programme for the prevention of the sale of children and child prostitution which called, <i>inter alia</i>, for sending and receiving countries to adopt measures to prevent sex tourism. Senator Henry's Bill is a response to that call.</P>
    <P>It is difficult, in the absence of clear evidence, to arrive at any conclusion on the extent to which Irish people take part in child sex tourism or the extent to which it is organised from Ireland. Nevertheless, however much we might not want to believe it, there is no reason to suppose that Ireland is immune from evil of this kind.  If it is happening here we have a responsibility to do whatever we can to stop it.  In any event, it is right that our law should contain a deterrent against such behaviour.</P>
    <P>This Bill is one such measure.  It is complemented, as the House will be aware, by the Private Members' Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1995, which is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the other House, another Bill which I did not oppose.  That Bill seeks to make it an offence for an Irish citizen or resident to do any act abroad which, if done in Ireland, would constitute a sexual offence against a child.  It is of course rare for Irish criminal law to be given extra territorial effect, but there are circumstances where it is appropriate.</P>
    <P>This does mean, however, that we have the unusual situation of having two Bills before the Dáil and the Seanad dealing with closely related issues, with in some respects overlapping and in other respects divergent provisions. Clearly this is something we, as legislators, have to resolve so that the best possible measure is enacted.  I think we would all agree that we should adopt the best ideas from both sets of proposals so that in an inherently difficult area of law we do our very best to make the proposed law as effective as possible. I say that from an objective point of view as I have no proprietorial interest in either Bill.  I am anxious, as is every Member of the House and none more so than Senator Henry, to pool <Col N="361" /> our ideas on these issues so that we emerge at the end of the process with the best possible result.  With that in mind, I will turn to the provisions of the Bill and comment on their detail.</P>
    <P>Section 2 contains a detailed definition of child sexual abuse.  The first two subparagraphs of the definition draw inspiration from the definition of the offence of rape under section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, although they are cast in wider terms and crucially are not premised, as is rape under section 4, on a sexual assault.  This would lead to results which Senator Henry did not for a moment intend.</P>
    <P>In criminalising penetration of the mouth of a child by any part of the body of another person, the Bill provides that parents putting a finger in the mouth of a child to check for teething commit child abuse.  In not making any exception for legitimate medical examination, the Bill provides that a doctor who carries out an intimate examination of a child commits child abuse.  Other examples could be imagined, but the difficulty is clear.  Furthermore, curing these defects might not necessarily be straightforward as the definition of child abuse is self contained and detached from national law on sexual offences. An inserted reference to sexual assault would mean nothing outside the context of national law.  This raises a wider point about the relationship between this Bill and national law to which I will return later.</P>
    <P>Subparagraphs (iii) to (vi) of the definition of child abuse are taken from a definition proposed by the Law Reform Commission in its 1990 report on child sexual abuse, which in turn derives from a proposal of a Western Australian task force in 1987.  Some particular points occur to me in relation to this definition but I will first make a general observation.  As the House is aware, there is no one offence in Irish law of child sexual abuse but rather a variety of general sexual offences which together protect children from sexual abuse.  For example, there is rape, rape <Col N="362" /> under section 4, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, sexual intercourse with a girl under 17 years, anal intercourse with a boy or girl under 17 years, gross indecency by a man with a boy under 17 years and intercourse with a person who is mentally impaired.</P>
    <P>In addition, consent is no defence to a charge of sexual assault on a boy or girl under 15 years.  These offences and the jurisprudence which has developed around them provide the basis for the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill in the other House.  It seeks to criminalise acts done abroad which in Ireland would constitute a sexual offence under current Irish law.  However, the Bill before the Seanad is consciously independent of current Irish law on sexual offences and seeks to start afresh by creating a new comprehensive offence of child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>It is clearly less than ideal to have such a divergent approach in two Bills which deal with broadly the same subject matter and which are so closely related that their provisions overlap to a degree.  On the one hand the new offence in this Bill of organising sex tours would relate to a new offence of child sexual abuse, while, on the other, the new extra territorial sexual offences in the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill would relate to existing offences of child sexual abuse.  There must be consistency in our laws on sexual offences, not only as between the two Bills, but between them and national law.</P>
    <P>If it is thought that the proposed definition of child abuse in this Bill would provide better protection for children than existing offences &mdash; I will comment on the detail of the definition in a moment &mdash; the unavoidable conclusion must be that the definition should form part of the basis of national law on child sexual abuse rather be limited to an offence of organising sex tours abroad or to extra territorial offences against children.  The point at issue is whether we should change the substance of the existing laws on child sexual abuse.  This is a question which goes far beyond the scope of this Bill, <Col N="363" /> but I have no difficulty with examining the idea with an open mind as part of the general review of the law on sexual offences.  As the House is aware, I am at present preparing a discussion paper on sexual offences and this could be one of the issues examined in that context.</P>
    <P>Having made those general remarks, I will return to the detail of subparagraphs (iii) to (vi) of the definition.  As I said, I genuinely have an open mind on whether this approach could work as a substitute for existing offences of child sexual abuse and the points I will make on the detail of the definition are by way of indicating areas which would require careful consideration rather than an indication of opposition to the concept.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (v) of the definition deals with the exposure of the sexual organs or any other sexual act performed in the presence of a child for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification of the older person or as an expression of aggression, threat or intimidation towards the child.  I am concerned about what appears to be a subjective element based on whether an adult has one of these specific purposes in mind.  It might be considered that any act of child sexual abuse would involve one of these purposes and I am sure that is the case in reality.  However, we should think carefully before including such subjective elements in the definition of an offence and requiring the prosecution to prove each such element beyond a reasonable doubt.</P>
    <P>Will such an offence cope with a person who claims, for example, to hold the utterly perverted view that children like and benefit from sexual relations and that his intention was to give pleasure to the child?  Will it cope with a person who, however distasteful it may sound, claims to have been motivated, not by aggression, but by love?  Is there a risk that a depraved person could escape justice by raising a reasonable doubt on any of these or other similar points?  No court would have any time for the morality of any such argument.  However, <Col N="364" /> the issue would not be morality but the intention or belief of the accused.</P>
    <P>The recommendation of the Law Reform Commission, in putting forward its proposal for a definition of child sexual abuse, included the suggestion that in any prosecution for such an offence the onus should be on the accused to establish that he had no improper motive.  I am not sure whether this aspect of the proposal has been omitted from the Bill inadvertently or through misgivings about its effect.  Perhaps Senator Henry will tell me later.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (vi) of the definition deals with sexual exploitation of children, including child pornography. Returning to my argument about substantive Irish law on child sexual abuse, child pornography is another example of an issue which deserves to be considered and dealt with in national law. If the law on child pornography needs improvement, and a good case can be made for an examination of this aspect, any changes should apply in Ireland and not only in relation to exploitation of children abroad.  Again, however, a change in the substantive law lies outside the scope of the Bill and in any event would require careful consideration. We must ensure that any new law will have a clear objective and will be workable and effective.</P>
    <P>The proposed definition in the Bill refers to engaging in the recording &mdash; on video tape, film, audio tape or other temporary or permanent material &mdash; posing, modelling or performing of any act involving the exhibition of a child's body for the purpose of sexual gratification of an audience or for the purpose of any other sexual act referred to in subparagraphs (i) to (v).  The logical thread holding the proposal together gets somewhat tangled in the detail of the wording.  I am not sure one can speak of a person engaging in the posing or modelling of an act involving the exhibition of a child's body.  In any event, my main point relates to the scope of the provision and its subjectivity. It apparently deals only with the recording of any act involving the exhibition <Col N="365" /> of a child's body for the purpose of sexual gratification of an audience or for the purpose of any other sexual act referred to in the other subsections.</P>
    <P>My earlier remarks on the difficulties caused for the prosecution by subjective elements of an offence also apply to the reference to sexual gratification of an audience.  I am also concerned about the linkage between the reference to recording and the sexual acts referred to in the other subsections.  The wording appears to restrict the provision to cases where a child's body is exhibited for the purpose of those acts.  There may also be some doubt over the precise meaning of &ldquo;exhibit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In making these points I am not particularly concerned about purely drafting issues &mdash; mistakes can always be put right &mdash; but about the policy which must lie behind changes to the law.  We must be clear on what we want to achieve and any proposals must be thought through in detail.  The discussion paper on sexual offences, which I mentioned earlier, could offer a way in which this could be achieved, not only in terms of detailed analysis of the law but in terms of inviting ideas and proposals on the law from experts in child sexual abuse in the criminal justice, health and education services.</P>
    <P>I now turn to section 2(b).  I note that a child is defined as a person under the age of 16 years.  The question of the ideal age of sexual consent is a very difficult one and I do not criticise Senator Henry for choosing 16 years.  It does, however, illustrate the variety of views which exist on the issue.  Sixteen years is neither in line with the existing age of sexual consent in Irish law, which is 17, nor with the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.  It recommended that it should only be possible to commit the offence of child sexual abuse with a child under 15 years, although this would rise to 16 where the other person is in a position of authority over the child, such as a parent, close relation or a person in <i>loco parentis.</i></P>
    <P>Again, this is an issue which should be considered in a wider context.  Even if <Col N="366" /> 16 years was the agreed choice of this House in relation to this Bill, we must have regard to the fact that 17 years is the age of consent under Irish law, not to mention that 18 years is the age limit which is contained in the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill in the Dáil. I find it difficult to see how we could apply different standards of protection to children in Ireland and children living abroad.  This is an issue where any changes must be considered in the context of substantive Irish law.  That is something I am willing to do, but it lies outside the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the age of consent brings me to the question of dual criminality. Whatever age of consent applies in Ireland, we must respect the corresponding age of consent abroad.  If a country has an age of consent of 15 years, this Bill would label as a child abuser an Irish citizen who in that country engages in consensual sexual relations with someone of that age.  That surely cannot be what is meant.  It is perfectly understandable that in discussing this Bill we have in mind child sexual abuse in less developed countries, but we must remember that the provisions of the Bill would apply to any travel out of the country, including travel by young Irish people to European countries which have an age of consent lower than 16 years.</P>
    <P>A related matter which must be addressed is the question of sexual relations within marriage.  Under Irish law a consensual sexual act with a person under the age of consent is nevertheless lawful if it takes place within marriage.  We must bear in mind the variety of laws on marriage which exist in other countries.  This is automatically provided for if the offences under this Bill are related to existing Irish law, but otherwise special provision would need to be made.</P>
    <P>I turn now to section 3, which creates the offences in the Bill.  I am in broad agreement with the contents of this section, subject to relatively minor drafting points which I will not go into now.  The only reservation I have is that, <Col N="367" /> while I have no difficulty with the section covering travel in Ireland with the intention of facilitating sexual abuse outside Ireland, the scope of section 3 seems to apply to travel which leads to sexual abuse within Ireland.  I believe that our existing criminal law, including the law on conspiracy to commit an offence and aiding and abetting the commission of an offence, would cover this activity in Ireland.  In addition, we would need to consider very carefully how this provision based on the proposed definition of child sexual abuse might fit in with existing Irish law on sexual offences.</P>
    <P>I will not go into in any detail on section 4, which provides for punishment, but I might mention that while a fine of £5,000 may well exceed the limit permitted for a summary offence, I do not see why we should not provide for prosecution on indictment.  There are other relatively minor matters arising under section 4, but there is no need to go into them now.</P>
    <P>I agree with the objective of this Bill and I will not, therefore, oppose Second Stage.  However, the Bill gives rise to serious issues which must be addressed if this legislation is to be practical and workable.  That is my aim and I know it is shared by Senator Henry and the House.  We must also take account of the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1995, which has already passed Second Stage in the Dáil, to see how best the two sets of related proposals can be integrated into a co-ordinated reform of the law to tackle child sexual abuse abroad.</P>
    <P>The best way forward is to base any new offences on existing Irish law, and that is what the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1995, does.  However, the essence of the Bill before the House, that is, the criminalisation of child sex tourism, can be adapted to that approach and I intend to put forward suggestions in the Dáil to that end.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry deserves to be congratulated for her commitment in bringing forward this proposal which, along <Col N="368" /> with the proposals in the Dáil, will demonstrate Ireland's solidarity with the sexually exploited children of the less developed countries.  I would also like to pay tribute to Fr. Shay Cullen, whom I have met a number of times, on the work he has done in raising awareness of this issue not only in Ireland, but in many other countries to which he has travelled.  We will show clearly that we are prepared to do whatever we can to stop this appalling suffering and that we will play a full part in the efforts of the international community to stamp out this evil trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister in praising the work Senator Henry has put into this Bill.  She was ably assisted by one of those horrible creatures &mdash; a senior counsel.  Last year we began to discuss the reporting of incest cases.  On that occasion the Minister said that sexual offences and sexual offences against children were being examined.  I call on her to bring forward the results of these studies as a priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning I listened to a shocking report on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; about a person who had badly battered a baby and who, on a previous occasion, was found guilty of physical abuse.  While we should be concerned with the abuse of foreign children, we should not be seen to be more concerned with that when there is a large number of child abuse cases in this country.  We must get our <Col N="369" /> house in order, a point which I am sure Senator Henry would accept.</P>
    <P>The Bill is worthwhile because it advances the debate as regards this offence and its effect on tourism.  Tourism is a commercial activity and it is appalling that business people would knowingly and intentionally &mdash; I recognise that the word &ldquo;intentionally&rdquo; is specifically mentioned in the Bill &mdash; organise tourism based on the sexual exploitation of young people.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is to bring forward proposals she should bear in mind that it is not just child sexual tourism but all forms of sexual tourism with which we should be concerned.  It is unacceptable that somebody would, knowingly and intentionally, organise tourism based on the exploitation of men or women of any age.  Perhaps the Minister might advise whether or not it would be illegal to organise adult sex tourism, either within Ireland or to a foreign country. If it is not illegal then it should, because a far greater number of adults, young adults perhaps, are exploited sexually or physically by way of the tourism trade.</P>
    <P>This is not a subject about which anybody would wish to take any kind of glib advantage.  However, as generously acknowledged by the Minister and by Senator Henry, the beginning of debate on this legislation was commenced by Deputy Eoin Ryan and Deputy O'Donoghue in their Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1995.  This seeks to make it an offence for somebody to commit a sexual offence in a foreign jurisdiction if such an act is also an offence in the Irish jurisdiction.  I agree with the broad thrust of the Minister's speech when she says that, for the sake of completeness and because we wish to secure convictions under the legislation, it is essential that we get the definition of child sexual abuse correct.  I do not know whether the Minister considers that it would be sufficient to amend the definition of child sexual abuse in Senator Henry's Bill so that it corresponds to the schedule of offences listed in the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, or whether it would be more worthwhile <Col N="370" /> to await the discussion reports of her group dealing with sexual and child offences.  Without authority from anybody, I suggest that perhaps this is a topic that could be covered by one Bill. As a practising lawyer I am always daunted by the fact that, on similar or related topics, we have to consider several different documents.  There is a case to be made for amalgamating these two Bills and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I more or less said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;seeing if the finest elements of both could be synthesised into one piece of legislation, whereby everybody could readily identify its source.  I will probably be rapped on the knuckles by my colleagues, Deputy Eoin Ryan and Deputy O'Donoghue, because I have no authority for suggesting this.  However, it is such an important topic that it behoves us all to strive for the best possible result, no matter what its origin.</P>
      <P>The Government generously gave its time to the Bill by Deputy Eoin Ryan and Deputy O'Donoghue and to this Bill by Senator Henry.  We on this side of the House want the very best possible result for the protection of children in so far as we can do it by prohibiting child sex tourism and by prosecuting Irish people who travel abroad and commit these heinous offences against young, poor and perhaps neglected children.</P>
      <P>In a world that is increasingly prosperous and materialistic, it is a terrible tragedy that children appear to be suffering more and more every day.  It is not a coincidence that when one takes up a copy of any of the international news magazines children appear on the front pages.  I have two copies of <i>Time</i> magazine before me.  One relates to the Lebanon the other to Bosnia, with children featured on the front pages of each.  A cynic could say that children appear thus because they sell magazines and products; everybody can relate to children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> However, it is a sad fact that, more than anybody, and aside from the work undertaken by UN agencies, by non Governmental agencies, charities etc., children are the voiceless and defenceless victims.  They have no voice.  I commend Senator Henry for giving them a voice.  If we could ensure one prosecution and keep one child from being the victim of a sex paedophile tourist, then Senator Henry's work will be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Children are increasingly the victims. For example, in India an incredible number of young children, aged three, four, five and six years of age, work on a full time basis in the most horrendous condition, lifting very heavy objects and, as the Minister remarked, losing their childhood; and the street children in Brazil are routinely murdered to such an extent that such events do not merit even a column inch in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>There is a broader question here which the Minister and her officials could consider.  What will be our international response to companies, agencies or Governments which by their inactivity knowingly, negligently or recklessly allow this exploitation, not necessarily in terms of sexual activity, to continue?  Deputy Eoin Ryan, Deputy O'Donoghue and Senator Henry have started this debate on what will be the response of this Legislature <i>vis-à-vis</i> the abuse, primarily the sexual abuse, of children in foreign jurisdictions?</P>
    <P>A good aspect of the Bill is that it addresses child pornography.  We do not have to travel to Bangkok or Manila to witness this. A trip, perhaps, to London or to Amsterdam, or, for all we know, but hopefully not, a trip within our own city may reveal that young children are abused in that they are exploited for the purposes of pornographic material.  I hope that when we improve this Bill or merge it with the other Bill we could include a definition regarding the abuse of children in pornography such as to make it an offence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> It would be a most serious crime for any Irish shop to sell pornographic material involving children.  To the best of my knowledge there is no such illegally published material in Ireland.  It is illegal, as presumably it would not pass the censors and would offend our decency laws.  We are approaching the 21st century and there are new ways of exploiting children and of publishing child pornography &mdash; for example, through the Internet.  We must look at these new methods of communication and close all the loopholes in the best way we can.</P>
    <P>The other sad point about child abuse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I read the Minister's speech in great detail and she correctly pointed out a number of legal difficulties.  Senator Henry should seek to modify this Bill in certain areas.  If this House is anxious for this Bill to proceed quickly, the offices of the Attorney General and the drafting expertise there should be made available to Senator Henry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All sexual abuse is unacceptable, but child sexual abuse and child pornography are particularly unacceptable.  I assure Senator Henry and the Minister that the Fianna Fáil Party will be constructive and helpful in seeking to secure the most watertight legislation to prohibit Irish people from undertaking <Col N="373" /> acts abroad which are offences in this country and to outlaw the heinous commercial activity of child sexual exploitation and abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We are indebted to Senator Henry for introducing this Private Members' Bill on child sex tourism. She must be complimented on the work she has done in this area.  She has a great interest in the protection of those who are most vulnerable, particularly children.  This is a useful debate to highlight this matter and to examine the possibility of introducing legislation. The Minister has responded positively and she has examined the difficulties involved.  As the previous speaker said, everyone has good suggestions to make on this issue.</P>
      <P>We can introduce legislation to deal with people who promote or are involved in child sex tourism, but it must work.  At the World Tourism Organisation Conference last October in Cairo, 31 states passed a motion urging Governments to get tough on sex tourism. The western world and European countries are <i>ad idem</i> on this issue.  The Minister for Justice, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Health have discussed this matter at various meetings.  We must introduce proper legislation and try to get other countries to toe the line in this regard. The conference passed a motion to combat the growing trade in child sex tourism. It stated that at least one million children worldwide are involved.  The motion called for the drawing up of effective legislation to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation; the prosecution of companies, agencies, clubs and individuals who promote child sex tourism; and the punishment of tourists involved in sexual exploitation of children either in the country where the offence is committed or in their own states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister outlined the difficulties involved.  It is important that the Government has responded positively and that it will not oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.  Senator Henry <Col N="374" /> does not have the same resources or assistance as the Minister.  However, I am sure the Minister learned something new today and I am sure she would welcome other suggestions or ideas.</P>
    <P>Today has proven that we can rationally discuss a difficult issue which must be addressed.  As Senator Mulcahy said, we not only see child abuse in magazines or on television programmes.  The Government is beginning to implement the Child Care Act.  I urge the Minister to ensure that adequate resources are available in this regard.</P>
    <P>Child pornography and violence on television and videos were mentioned. While such material may be limited in this country, illegal videos and magazines are still available.  The Minister should urge the authorities to stamp this out.  We will only bring about change if we continue to mention this issue at various fora and try to involve other Governments.  Ireland by itself will not be able to stop it, although it may help bring about a change in opinion.</P>
    <P>I support the intention behind the Bill and thank Senator Henry for bringing it forward and providing us with information on the matter.  I also thank the Minister for outlining the various difficulties. I hope she will be able in time to come back with further proposals, incorporating the contents of Senator Henry's Bill and including other matters which should be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Henry on her initiative in this Bill and on her success.  She has a remarkable career; this is still the first session after her election and it is most unusual for someone to have such a distinguished record in terms of contribution, not just in its volume but in the good sense she speaks and the number of amendments she has had carried.  Now, historically, she has been allowed introduce the Second Stage of a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this new openness on the part of the Government.  The Minister and Senators on both the Government and Opposition benches know this has been a pet hobby horse of mine for <Col N="375" /> many years.  It is the first time I have noticed it.  I hope it is the beginning of a new trend and that there is no partisanship involved, so that those of us who are not Members of a political party will be treated equally and other Bills will be accepted from this side of the House.  I will watch this with considerable interest.  Some years ago Senator Ross had a Bill on capital punishment, which reached a certain point and was then taken over by the Government. I had a Bill on interpretation, to which the same happened.  I congratulate Senator Henry on this breakthrough, but I hope it is not just a breakthrough but a beach-head.  Let this not be the end to the introduction of legislation in a truly democratic and independent Seanad.  I say that without begrudgery &mdash; to prove that, I will mention my pleasure at the presence of our new colleague, Senator Hayes.  I was not in the House on the day of his induction but he is a welcome addition.</P>
    <P>I was happy to sign this Bill when Senator Henry asked me.  It is a matter of concern to many of us.  However, we would be incorrect if we thought this existed only outside our shores.  The Minister talked about exploitation of children and how we in the Oireachtas must do everything possible to prevent Ireland taking any part in what is a growing world phenomenon.  However, we already are taking part in one sense; we have had it on our doorstep but for many years have turned a blind eye to it, particularly male children from 12 upwards being exploited as prostitutes.</P>
    <P>I came across this when running the Hirschfeld Centre, which received little support from any Government and has since closed down.  It was a difficult problem for us to deal with.  One winter night, when I was going home across O'Connell Bridge, I was stopped by someone I knew to be a prostitute.  He was a most unpleasant person, then aged about 20, who had been involved in this routine for at least six years.  He had been known to me for some time as a dangerous individual.  I did not know <Col N="376" /> his background but it must have been ghastly to have produced something like that.  Three years later he was found floating in the Liffey, presumably as the result of a failed blackmail attempt.</P>
    <P>That night, this person asked me what I was going to do about &ldquo;her&rdquo;, meaning a 13 year old boy.  There was nothing I could do about that boy because I knew if I incorporated this work into the then work of the centre, we would all be tarred with a brush which would bring down the valuable work we did for other people.  What alternative did that child have that winter's night?  Through prostitution, he presumably found shelter and some degree of financial support, which apparently was not forthcoming from elsewhere.  That was not in the Philippines or Brazil but in the capital city of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must take a two-pronged approach.  We must be aware that this has existed in our country &mdash; I do not suggest we have a beam in our eye which must be removed but we at least have some motes of dust which are comparable and analogous to what occurs in some other countries, although it is by no means so extreme here.</P>
    <P>I do not approve of sex tourism or the exploitation of children, but there are worse things and we would be failing in our human responsibility if we did not acknowledge that.  In some of the countries mentioned such as Brazil, these children are categorised as &ldquo;disposable&rdquo;, along with gay people.  The use of that word is utterly horrifying and however degrading and terrible child prostitution is, it is not as bad as being finally snuffed out.</P>
    <P>I recall a case a number of years ago where a lay brother took a child away from a school in County Wicklow and went to Scotland.  There was some kind of blocked sexual impulse which did not eventually emerge in a physical sexual act but the emotional tension became extreme.  This man did not wish to return the boy to a situation in which he felt he was being abused so he drowned him in a bath.  The counsel for this man's defence uttered a phrase which has <Col N="377" /> never left my mind since: &ldquo;At least, my lord, he did not interfere with him&rdquo;.  The brother drowned the child, ending his life.  If one constructs a scale which includes those acts rightly mentioned in Senator Henry's Bill &mdash; the penetration of the vagina or the anus and masturbation in the presence of a child &mdash; the murder of a child is far worse.  Such a scale must be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I applaud the work of journalists such as Ms Nuala Ó Faoláin.  She wrote a series of articles, which I will not discuss in detail because many Senators wish to contribute, for which we owe her a great debt of gratitude.  Thanks is also due to priests like Fr. Cullen.  We must, however, have a two pronged approach. We must consult people like Fr. Cullen to find out how we can assist their organisations.  To be callous, it is not enough to throw child prostitutes out of work, so to speak, without providing a positive framework in which their energies may be properly employed.  We must look at this in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I was watching this debate on the monitor &mdash; the newspapers occasionally report that there were few Members in the House at a certain time but we watch our television monitors.  I did not catch all of Senator Henry's excellent speech and I do not know if she provided evidence about the current prevalence of child sex tourism from Ireland. It might be useful to have such evidence to see the urgency of the matter.  Even if it is not prevalent, Senator Henry probably intends the Bill to be a preemptive strike, for which there is a good argument.  The Senator and I attended a conference on AIDS in Barcelona, at which a Spanish woman said one did not put up a sign about a hairpin bend two miles after it has occurred; it is put up before it occurs so that people do not drive over the edge.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters, the first being different ages of consent.  That is quite a complicated, technical matter on which the Senator may take advice to synchronise the ages, although it is not clear how it can be done.  I did a study <Col N="378" /> of ages of consent in Europe and they are quite disparate.  There is a wide range of ages.  Surprisingly, in some Catholic countries there may be a joint age of consent of as low as 12.</P>
    <P>It is not clear how one can convict somebody in Ireland of a sexual offence that took place in a jurisdiction where that act was not a sexual offence.  A good example of this, although it involves religious law rather than domestic law, is the case of the 13 year old British girl who went to Turkey recently and had a consensual sexual relationship with a Turkish youth having been married under Islamic law.  There may be jurisdictions where that might not only be permissible under religious law but might be legally permissible.  The matter is probably covered in section 2(b) which gives the definition of a child as &ldquo;a person under the age of 16 years&rdquo; and that would render illegal in this country something which may not be legal in the country where the act was committed.</P>
    <P>The question of masturbation in the presence of a child may be fairly vague. In some other part of the world a liaison may take place between an Irish national and a local adult; they may go to have some form of consenting sexual relationship in a dwelling where there is only one family room in which there may be a child asleep.  I do not know if that issue needs examination.  There are issues in the Bill on which I do not have expertise.  I am not a sex tourist and, furthermore, I have never been in the slightest interested in children.  I have always been interested in people of the same age as me &mdash; when I was 16 years old I was interested in 16 year olds and now that I am 51 years old those in this country who are 51 years old had better look out because I will undoubtedly find them sexually attractive.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (vi) refers to &ldquo;... posing, modelling or performing of any act involving the exhibition of a child's body for the purpose of sexual gratification ...&rdquo;.  I applaud the Senator's motivation although this point may need further investigation.  I am put in <Col N="379" /> mind of the position of a well known television presenter whose husband took a photograph of their young daughter in the bath.  Somebody in the photograph processing section of the shop where the film was brought to be developed spotted the photograph of the child, reported the woman and her husband to the police and they were arrested.  Although every decent person is against the exploitation of children one must also be sensitive to the fact that it is necessary to ensure there are no foolish or misguided prosecutions.</P>
    <P>My worry about the age of consent springs principally from the fact that ages of consent always have a cut off point.  Although it is difficult to get it into law, I prefer the principle of consent rather than an age of consent, particularly in an international situation where there is no agreement as to what constitutes a proper age of consent.</P>

      <P>In looking at this Bill I was reminded that sometimes the conscience of a nation is pricked by the work of a journalist.  It happened when a British journalist's reports on the appalling famine in Ethiopia led to Live Aid and, more recently, with the programme &ldquo;The Dying Room&rdquo; on the orphanages in China.  The work of Nuala Ó Faoláin in highlighting the issue of child sexual abuse abroad is to be congratulated.  We owe a lot to journalists who raise issues that might not otherwise come to our attention.  I congratulate Senator Henry on succeeding in bringing the Bill before us and giving us a lot of information on a difficult subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussion of the issues of child sexual abuse is relatively new to us in Ireland.  The first time the question of paedophilia came to light to any great extent via the media was in terms of the conduct of a certain priest.  The issue received wide discussion for the first time in the light of that particular case. There had been a certain ignorance as to the existence of paedophilia, never mind the extent of sexual abuse in <Col N="380" /> Ireland generally.  The fact that the issue is raised brings about a need for us as legislators to address it.</P>
    <P>Child sexual abuse may seem such a difficult and horrible subject that one wonders how it can be tackled in law.  It is difficult but it should be tackled when possible.  Child sexual abuse abroad is an issue we can deal with by introducing legislation, such as this Bill, which indicates that we do not accept that Irish citizens should be permitted to carry out such brutal deeds abroad.  Where we can address an area of abuse we should do so.</P>
    <P>I understand the flaws which the Minister has highlighted in the Bill.  She is to complimented on her proactive response to the Bill &mdash; rather than knocking the Bill for its flaws she has suggested ways in which they might be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The law on child sexual abuse and sexual abuse in general needs to be examined.  I welcome that there is a discussion paper in preparation in the Department.  It would be a severe injustice if we were to provide wide definitions of child sexual abuse abroad and not apply the same protections for children in Ireland.  The whole matter should be examined in a comprehensive fashion.  If, as the Minister's speech indicates, we have at least eight different classes of sexual offence, there is something wrong in legislative terms.  It offers the opportunity to an offender to escape conviction on a technicality whereby a prosecution should have been taken place for one class of offence as opposed to another.  It also indicates that the history of our tackling sexual crimes generally has been haphazard.</P>
    <P>I strongly favour an examination of the law on sexual abuse generally and a comprehensive Bill with definitions for the various degrees of offence.  We must ensure the law does not fail to cover a particular offence simply because a long standing Act failed to deal with it.  We must make sure to cover as much as possible in legislation.  The aspect of pornography highlighted in Senator <Col N="381" /> Henry's Bill is one that could be dealt with easily in a new Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the issues in the Bill before us today will be addressed in a much wider way.  We should have an Act to deal with sexual abuse abroad as a separate issue.  However, let us work to bring forward an Act to deal with sexual abuse in Ireland in a better way than is the case at present.  We have a problem with child abuse, which is underestimated, but I would not limit a review to child sexual abuse.  There are great gaps in the law generally which affect Irish women and these must also be examined.</P>
    <P>When I was in Cambodia I saw bars where there were girls aged between 14 and 25 years &mdash; it was difficult to tell their ages &mdash; imported from Thailand who were effectively there to service the UN.  We should not turn a blind eye to such behaviour.  It may not be an offence under the Bill, yet it seems to be the essence of abuse of people and of poverty.  We should seek to cover that in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are problems with the definition in the Bill, as the Minister pointed out.  The creation of a new offence of child sexual abuse <i>per se</i> is rather difficult in terms of the huge array of existing legislation on the matter. I query the feasibility of any such Bill, given the difficulty of proving an offence which has occurred abroad.  It may be easier to tackle the tourist agencies and find evidence against them in this country as it seems very difficult to take an action against the offender, in terms of the burden of proof.  From the criminal law point of view, I ask for more to be done to examine how that issue would be tackled.  While the intention of the Bill is evident, the practicalities are not clear.</P>
    <P>This is part of a much greater problem in Ireland.  It is easy for us, as Irish people, to say that the problem is abroad and is, therefore, much easier to accept.  However, the problem is very much at home.  Our society is increasingly open to international media with the Internet, videos and satellite television. <Col N="382" /> We must examine material which is readily available to young children. Nobody seems to be educating children that such treatment of other people is wrong.  I am worried about an increase in sexual crimes in this country because children are growing up without being taught that it is incorrect to abuse people, particularly women and children, as we see happening daily on ordinary television channels, never mind videos and satellite television channels. Perhaps, I am becoming old fashioned &mdash; I have been here for a while.</P>

      <P>It bothers me that we, as a society, deem this to be acceptable. Every day on television the norm is for every girl to be exceedingly pretty and for every boy to take advantage of her. It seems to be acceptable that our young children are growing up with standards which I do not like.  We should tackle that issue in terms of education and our attitudes, as it is a growing problem.</P>
      <P>I support the idea of addressing the identifiable problem of child sexual abuse abroad.  We should not tolerate Irish citizens engaging in this practice.  I hope that the Minister will return to the House on this matter very soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that others wish to speak so I will be as brief as possible.  Many years ago, as chairman of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, I first encountered this putrid problem.  I congratulate members of the justice and peace commission in Ireland and throughout Europe who, over the last ten or 15 years, have tried to raise public consciousness.  Through the good work of journalists and concerned people, they have brought this issue to the forefront.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now in the happy position of having two separate pieces of draft legislation dealing with this problem before both Houses of the Oireachtas at the same time.  Deputy Ryan, Deputy O'Donoghue and Senator Henry have done all of us a considerable service.  We <Col N="383" /> are also in the happy position that the draft legislation is, as the Minister said, complementary in many ways.  I agree with the Minister's suggestion that some means of bringing the two Bills together and enacting them quickly should be sought.  Very few issues would bring all sides of the House together as quickly and an all party Joint Committee could do very good work in this area.  That work should be done sooner rather than later because Ireland's EU Presidency has a role to play in this regard.</P>
    <P>Child sex tourism is a particularly hideous form of exploitation which is visited on the Third World by the so-called developed world.  The available figures are frightening, distressing and disquieting in equal measure.  The developed world, having raped the colonies of their resources and in many cases destroyed their environment and indigenous cultures, now sends its least desirable adults to those countries to destroy the children &mdash; the only wealth they have left.</P>
    <P>In November 1995, <i>The European</i> newspaper reported that German officials had calculated that half of all German male tourists visiting Kenya, South Korea and the Philippines did so specifically for sexual activities with children.  A separate report suggested that up to 70 per cent of male visitors to Thailand &mdash; a country with its own culture &mdash; go there for the same dark and putrid purpose.  The Dutch charity, Child Right Worldwide, suggests that at present more than one million children are victims of the predatory sexual activities of Western Europeans.  Those figures redound to all our discredit.</P>
    <P>It is suggested by other charities that up to 200,000 Nepalese girls have been sold into sexual slavery.  In the Philippines, 60,000 children work as prostitutes, most of them catering specifically for tourists or R&amp;R for various military bases.  In Thailand, between 200,000 and 250,000 children are involved in this trade.  In Colombia, one third of all prostitutes are under the age of 14 years and Christian Aid has calculated that 5 <Col N="384" /> per cent are under the age of ten years. It is estimated that as many as 10,000 young boys between the ages of six and 14 years have been sold into indentured slavery to the brothels of Sri Lanka. Anybody with a shred of humanity in their body cannot but be moved, horrified and offended by these statistics.</P>
    <P>In many of the countries, particularly in east Asia, where the abuse has been most endemic, domestic legislation has always been poor.  However, because of international pressure and revulsion, there has been at least some tightening up.  One of the extraordinary results of this is that the phenomenon has moved west towards Europe.  The campaign group, End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism, suggested in a recent report that one of the unexpected results of the fall of the Berlin Wall is that the problem of child prostitution for tourists has become a major problem in former command economies.  Many of us who have visited these countries, perhaps in the context of electoral observers, have seen this scourage and horror at first hand.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, therefore, that any country which wishes to consider itself civilised cannot stand idly by and do nothing in the face of these horrors.  In the European Union, Belgium, France, Finland, Denmark, Sweden and Germany have enacted strong legislation in this regard.  There is an ongoing debate in the United Kingdom at the moment but for some reason, which is not clear, the Government does not seem willing to take the matter on board.  In the European Union, where services can be freely traded across borders, it is important that all 15 member states put in place a comprehensive and common bulwark.  It is particularly important that Ireland should not provide a safe haven for operators driven out of other countries. It is also important that we look to ourselves because, as the Minister said, I am sure that Irish people are not without blame in this regard.</P>
    <P>This Bill, and that introduced by Deputy Ryan and Deputy O'Donoghue, are timely reminders of what can be <Col N="385" /> done.  I suggest to the Minister and the drafters of both Bills that they should be combined and put before a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas with a view to producing one piece of legislation. I also suggest that both Houses should set a target to enact legislation in this area before Ireland's EU Presidency. This issue should be a plank of that Presidency.  Many member states have made efforts to combat this evil and we should take that a step further.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for her suggested approach of trying to use both Bills, and the resources of her Department, to produce a composite set of legislative proposals which the Oireachtas can speedily enact.  This is a good way to introduce legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Sex tourism is the latest form of exploitation of the developing world by developed nations.  I congratulate Senator Henry on the work she has invested in this Bill.  Like Deputy Eoin Ryan and Deputy O'Donoghue who introduced a similar piece of legislation in the Lower House, she has given great thought to this latest form of colonialism &mdash; the exploitation by a small number of Western tourists of young children in certain parts of the developing world.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Father Shay Cullen for his tireless work in exposing the scandal of child prostitution in the Philippines and in lobbying the Governments of the developed world to enact legislation such as that being debated in this House.  I also congratulate Nuala Ó Faoláin, who recently dealt with this issue in an extremely well written and disturbing exposé.  It is largely due to their efforts, and those of organisations such as Trócaire, that politicians and the public have become aware of this issue and that Bills similar to this are being debated in parliaments throughout Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the gulf between the developed and developing worlds increases, certain types of exports are flourishing.  The developed world is increasingly exporting its social and economic ills, <Col N="386" /> which range from environmental despoliation to child exploitation.  Child sex tourism is the ultimate in social dumping.  As awareness of child sexual abuse increases in the developed world and legislation is enacted, increasing numbers of paedophiles are seeking new hunting grounds in the poorest countries of Asia and Africa, including Thailand, India, the Philippines, Kenya and other African countries.</P>
    <P>Child prostitution is as subject to the laws of supply and demand as any other commodity.  The increasing demand from European, American and Australian tourists for child prostitutes has created a seemingly inexhaustible supply. UNICEF estimates that 60,000 child prostitutes are operating in the Philippines, a substantial number of them for the benefit of foreign tourists.  While most of the destination countries have enacted legislation to deal with child prostitution, prosecutions of foreign nationals are extremely rare.  This is due to a combination of factors: lack of resources, the logistical difficulties of prosecuting a tourist and, in some cases, corruption.  To the best of my knowledge, no foreign paedophile has been convicted under the Philippines' stringent child protection laws.  This is not due to lack of evidence because sex tour brochures, videos and records of sexual encounters are readily available.</P>
    <P>The enactment of legislation to prosecute paedophiles for offences committed abroad serves a number of purposes. It will send a clear message that, on their return to Ireland, people who have abused children elsewhere will not find a safe haven.  The legislation will reassure people in destination countries that we are not prepared to see those countries being used as paedophile dumping grounds.  It will also ensure that child abusers will not be at liberty to continue their activities in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Legislation similar to that before the House has been enacted in jurisdictions such as Australia and Sweden.  Perhaps it is too early to assess the effectiveness of that legislation, but in years to come <Col N="387" /> it will create a climate of intolerance against touring paedophiles.  In the short term, this type of legislation will provide a legal sanction against Irish child abusers travelling to the developing world in search of victims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her attendance in the House and her support of the objectives of this Bill.  I congratulate Senator Henry for introducing the Bill and the work she has done in relation to it.  When the Travel Trade Bill was before the House last year Senator Henry raised this issue and I supported her at that time.  She deserves our thanks and support for introducing this worthwhile Bill which makes it an offence to organise travel or publish any information with the intention of facilitating child sexual abuse abroad.</P>
      <P>In recent years people in Ireland have become aware of the extent of child sexual abuse throughout the country and none of us seems to be shocked by revelations in this regard.  Nuala Ó Faoláin's recent articles in <i>The Irish Times</i> shocked everyone.  The horrifying fact, however, is that none of what she stated is an exaggeration.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister and other Senators, I met Father Shay Cullen.  The horrific stories he related about the exploitation of children in the Philippines and other Third World countries were shocking. Ireland, as a developed country, should do everything possible to show solidarity with these children.  I welcome the fact that the Minister would like to see the objectives of this Bill implemented into law.  I agree with Senator Roche that we will have a great opportunity to put this issue high on the agenda during Ireland's upcoming Presidency of the EU.  This country must provide an example by implementing legislation.  Other countries have introduced such legislation and, by the end of 1996, 12 of the 15 EU member states will have legislation on their statute books.  It is fitting that Ireland do likewise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="388" /> The issues raised in this Bill and the extent of child sex tourism, prostitution and paedophilia have been well publicised by several non governmental organisations and Irish workers and missionaries abroad, such as Father Cullen.  Their lobbying and their highlighting of the problem encouraged the introduction of Senator Henry's Bill and also that of Deputy Eoin Ryan and Deputy O'Donoghue in the Lower House.  If people engage in promoting child sex tourism in Ireland or travel abroad to exploit children, they must be aware that they will punished under Irish law.  Whatever standards we have in this country, people must be aware that it is not acceptable to carry out these acts abroad.</P>
    <P>There is no available estimate for the number of Irish people involved in sex tourism.  We might not wish to believe it, but the Minister stated that it is happening among Irish people.  The Oireachtas has a responsibility to do whatever possible to stop this.  Therefore, legislation is necessary.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why men travel thousands of miles to exploit children who are already the victims of great poverty and injustice.  It does happen, however.  Nuala Ó Faoláin's articles in <i>The Irish Times</i> exposed how rooted in poverty and injustice is child prostitution in the Philippines.  There is an increasing economic rift between countries such as the Philippines, where children are horribly exploited, and developed nations such as Ireland, where there is a demand for sex tourism. Action must be taken by the Governments of both countries.  In one of her articles Nuala Ó Faoláin stated that &ldquo;There are small and completely vulnerable children around the streets because not one of them is worth as much to anyone who has ever met them as a pair of Imelda Marcos' shoes.&rdquo;.  It will be worthwhile if we try to show solidarity with those children and also show them that we place a value on their lives and have respect for them.  My party is glad to support Senator Henry's Bill or whatever composite Bill the Minister <Col N="389" /> believes can be introduced to deal with this horrific problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Henry on taking the initiative to draft this Bill and present it to the House.  I fully support what she is seeking to achieve.  The Minister outlined difficulties in relation to compatibility with Irish law and also regarding definition.  I hope she will be able to gather contributions from both Houses and introduce an effective and enforceable law to this area.</P>
      <P>In the short time available to me, I want to go straight to a point I wanted to make on section 3(3)(b) of the Bill, where Senator Henry addresses the problem of different sources of information and how to control other sources of information than those we are used to normally.  I am concerned particularly that the era of the Internet allows new and worrying access to information which is extremely difficult to control. An article in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> last Monday indicated that technology specialists say it will be extremely difficult to control information on the Internet and similar technologies.  I hope the Minister will address the particular difficulties posed by this area.  The US, German and French Governments are trying to deal with this issue at present and are troubled by pornography, xenophobia, racism, etc. which is being transmitted on the Internet.</P>
      <P>This type of tourism is an insidious kind of imperialism and Senator Roche referred to it as a form of colonialism. It is based on the supposition that it is all right to inflict treatment which would be outlawed at home on children in far away places.  The mind set of the people who can live with such double standards must be challenged and their activities curtailed.  Even putting such legislation on the Statute Book might be enough to put a stop to child sex tourism in Ireland and the promotion of it, because the kind of people who take advantage of the vulnerability of others in this area are probably too cowardly to risk exposure and prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> I hope that by enacting this legislation we will be able to put a stop to child sex tourism.  I realise the difficulties of enforcement and compatibility with Irish law but I congratulate Senator Henry on the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the thrust of Senator Henry's Bill and the Minister's response.  I hope it will have some effect.</P>
      <P>Taking up the matter to which Senator Gallagher alluded, my fear is that once the general drift of social thought is in the direction of what I will loosely, and without prejudice, call no fault individual behaviour, it is difficult to know where one introduces the line of fault.  While I always welcome the Minister for Justice to the House, every time she has been present, whether it is in relation to drugs, crime or, more recently, on this issue, it is in a way almost like having the Minister for Sisyphean activity or endeavour present because it is trying to put sticking plaster on wounds which are gaping in society and which many of our other impulses, and the directions in which we think, actually foster rather than counter. While I welcome this and hope a good Bill emerges from it, I wonder whether it is not, in fact, fighting an uphill battle against a general drift of a great deal of our other thinking and that we ourselves may have an element of double thinking in the way in which we go about things at home as well as abroad.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her response to this Bill and all of my fellow Senators for the way in which they have received it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see the Minister's heart is obviously with me and, listening to her speech, I feel that the hand of her Department is in favour of this sort of legislation, so I am quite sure we will be able to bring forward some provision. Naturally, as she pointed out, I do not have the benefit of the backup of the Department and I was relieved to read in the papers that apparently in the proposed <Col N="391" /> Dáil reform money will be provided to the Opposition and, I hope to the Independents, for research and for Private Members' Bills because I had to rely on the good offices of friends.</P>
    <P>I want to address a few points which I thought were relevant.  Senator Norris congratulated me on my breakthrough in getting this Bill to Second Stage, but I am quite sure he will be looked on as favourably by Senator Manning, particularly at present.  He was right to raise the lack of shelter for children in this country who have become involved in prostitution.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris used the words &ldquo;snuffed out&rdquo; with regard to children abroad.  I did not say it in my opening remarks, but I was told by one person who has done work in this area abroad that she had heard too many child prostitutes say that some of their siblings been sold for snuff films to feel it was not true.  In these situations, the parents are usually drug addicts and there is a serious problem with drug addicts in third world countries who sell their children into the most appalling situations. I have talked to Fr. Cullen about what we can do about this and these are the sorts of efforts which he wanted brought forward.</P>
    <P>Those Senators who pointed out that this really is a form of colonialism and imperialism are quite right.  They made the point that what is not permissible at home is all right when we get out to people who are considered to be a lesser type of being.  This is most unfortunate but it is true.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee is right, too, when he spoke about no fault individual behaviour, and Senator Gallagher spoke about that also.  We must look at the general drift of what goes on with regard to children on television and so forth.  For example, I wonder how many people saw a programme called &ldquo;Painted Babes&rdquo; recently about what was really the sexual exploitation of small girls in America where they were dolled up by their mothers for beauty competitions at the age of five.  When <Col N="392" /> one thinks of the trouble Graham Greene got into years ago for pointing to the activities of Shirley Temple and saying that there was a sexual element to it, I wonder what one would have to think of programmes such as this one. The Minister's point that so much of my Bill is subjective is important here, because I suppose one could say that those who look at these sorts of programmes are getting a sexual thrill from them too.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Mulcahy for saying that Fianna Fáil welcomes the Bill and take his points about the overlap between my Bill and those of his colleagues in the other House.  But there are differences too, because what is important about this Bill is that we can actually do something about it here and need not rely on getting evidence from anywhere else in the world in order to deal with the situation and companies here.  He asked what our response was to companies and Governments who allowed the exploitation of children.  We are keen on fine words, not just in Ireland but also internationally, with regard to things that happen in Third World countries but are not so enthusiastic about putting our money where our mouth is.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for welcoming the Bill.  Senator Gallagher said something which is really most sad. Women and, indeed, children are brought in to service Third World agencies, be they military, peace-keeping or whatever, which were sent abroad to help.  Senator Roche was right to point out the great work of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace in this area.</P>
    <P>With the help of the Department, we can bring forward legislation which will deal with the matter.  In particular, we might give ourselves a target date of Ireland's Presidency of the EU, as several Senators suggested.  It is important, as other Senators pointed out, because if legislation is enacted abroad, this country could be used as a sort of haven out of which some people could operate. If the Minister could address the <Col N="393" /> problems with this Bill as soon as possible, I would be grateful.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In this Act, where the context so requires, a reference to a spouse includes a reference to a person who is a party to a marriage that is void or voidable or has been annulled in the State or that has been dissolved or annulled under the law of a country or jurisdiction other than the State.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  We are all pleased with yesterday's judgment in the High Court and we look forward to the introduction of divorce legislation shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 1, we received representations from various groups such as Women's Aid and the Coolock Law Centre about the Bill.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the category of people who can apply for a safety order will include ex-spouses <Col N="394" /> and parties whose marriages have been annulled or in relation to which a valid foreign divorce has been granted.  The Progressive Democrats believe that a person whose marriage has been annulled or dissolved in another jurisdiction should be entitled to the same level of protection.  This amendment is really a technical amendment. I am concerned that there is a loophole in the Bill which would prevent these people from applying for a safety order under the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The combined effect of these amendments would be to enable one party to a marriage which is void or voidable or has been annulled in the State or has been dissolved or annulled under the law of a country or jurisdiction other than the State to obtain a barring order against the other party to that marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as foreign decrees of divorce which are recognised here are concerned, in the recently enacted Family Law Act, 1995, provision is made for the granting of barring orders under the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, to ex-spouses who have a recognised foreign decree of divorce. This will continue to be the position even after the repeal of the 1981 Act by this Bill.  However, the circumstances in which such orders can be granted under the Family Law Act are heavily circumscribed.  The court must first hear an <i>ex parte</i> application to ensure that the application is well founded and that the party satisfied certain jurisdictional rules.  This is to ensure that valuable court time is not wasted on spurious applications from persons with foreign divorce decrees who do not meet the criteria for recognition in Ireland.  In addition, the Act provides that where either spouse has remarried the remedy is not available.  The court must also take a number of other factors into account such as the length of time which has elapsed since the foreign divorce was granted and the extent to <Col N="395" /> which the order is likely to be enforceable.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan's amendment raises a question in relation to the protection of spouses who have a domestic or foreign decree of annulment of marriage and wish to obtain orders under the Bill.  I have examined this matter carefully and it is not at all straightforward.  I am of the view that separate legislation covering nullity would be the more appropriate and safest way forward.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms. Honan Ms. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is a complicated matter; it is not as straightforward as it might seem.  I accept the Minister's contention that the way to deal with this might be through nullity legislation. I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1) (a) (ii), lines 28 to 30, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;during&rdquo; in line 28, down to an including &ldquo;order&rdquo; in line 30 and substitute &ldquo;or is the parent of a child in common with the respondent.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In proposing this amendment I was concerned about the type of person who may make an application for a safety order.  An applicant should specifically include a person who has a child in common with the respondent whether they are living or ever have lived together. I also have concerns about limiting the definition of cohabitees to persons who have lived together for at least six of the previous 12 months.  This might cause difficulties for the applicant in proving that the parties resided together within that definition.</P>
      <P>We should remember that the purpose of the legislation is to provide for the protection of persons who are not protected under existing legislation.  In the absence of the legislation before us, parties seeking protection must rely on the injunction procedure.  The procedure provided for in this Bill is more simplified and welcome.  It is designed particularly for domestic violence situations and is less cumbersome and costly than the injunction procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had representations from Women's Aid and the Coolock Law Centre who have experience in dealing with cases of domestic violence.  Having carried out a review of recent cases handled by the centre on behalf of unmarried applicants in domestic violence <Col N="397" /> situations, the Coolock Law Centre believes that one half of these applicants would not fall within the definition in this Bill of applicants for a safety order.  They would still have to rely on the injunction procedure, so the provisions of the Bill would be of no assistance to them.  On that basis I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I received the same submission from the Coolock Law Centre, so I will not repeat the points made by Senator Honan.  This legislation seeks to give more security and safety to people in situations of domestic violence. The wording in my amendment would ensure that anybody who is a parent of a child, regardless of their marital status, would benefit from this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Coolock Law Centre told us that prior to the introduction of this Bill, the injunction procedure was the only one available to people who were not part of a married couple.  The changes in the law would only help about half of the cases with which they have been dealing. This amendment seeks to ensure that the remaining people will be able to avail of the protection of this legislation. I welcomed this legislation on Second Stage and I still do so.  I know there are constraints on the Minister but perhaps he could advise us if it is possible to achieve this objective without placing the Bill at risk and if he is in a position to introduce an amendment which would do this.</P>

      <P>I support the sentiments expressed by Senator Honan and Senator McGennis.  Our concern is for women who may have children in common with respondents and who may have been living apart for many years. A large number of domestic disputes affect children and involve matters such as access to and the maintenance of children and visiting rights.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on how this protection can be guaranteed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of amendment No. 3 would be to fundamentally change <Col N="398" /> the requirement in the Bill that cohabitants be living together for six months on aggregate in the period of 12 months immediately prior to an application for a safety order to a requirement that they were living together at any time for a period of six months on aggregate.  I regret I am unable to agree to a change of this kind.  It would mean that cohabitants who split up at any time, be it for two, three or five years or any indeterminate time, could apply for a safety order.  I am satisfied that an amendment on those lines would present problems in principle and in practice.  If two people happen to have lived together for an aggregate period of six months, subsequently break up and have had little or no contact for a year or more, there would seem to be no particular reason the safety order remedy in particular should be available between them.  A line has to be drawn somewhere. The Bill achieves a satisfactory balance in the matter.</P>
      <P>The effects of amendments Nos. 4, 5, 10, 11 and 12 would be to allow all persons with a child in common to avail of the barring order and safety order remedies. The applicant, on the basis proposed, need not be a cohabitant and there need not be any residence requirements immediately prior to application. As the barring order and safety order provisions in sections 2 and 3, respectively, stand, cohabitants who have children may apply for either such order or their protection and/or the protection of their children.</P>
      <P>In so far as an application for a barring order is concerned, a main condition is that the cohabitant must have lived with the respondent cohabitant for a period of at least six months on aggregate during the period of nine months immediately prior to the application for the barring order.  So far as a safety order is concerned, the cohabitants must be living together for a period of at least six months on aggregate during the period of 12 months immediately prior to the application for the barring order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> The difference in the qualifying conditions under sections 2 and 3 reflect, in part, the difference in the seriousness of the two orders in question.  To extend coverage further to all persons who have a child in common, even where they do not reside together, would depart from the main purpose, which is to protect persons who are residing together.  This is as far as the Bill can go.  To go any further would be to allow persons invoke a special law which was never designed to apply to anything other than domestic relationships and, most certainly, not relationships of the most casual kind where there is no such domestic relationship in fact.</P>
    <P>A breach of a safety order gives rise to serious consequences.  It would render a person liable to arrest in respect of behaviour which might not otherwise constitute a criminal offence.  The respondent may be arrested without warrant and the Garda Síochána, for the purpose of arrest, may enter any place where the respondent happens to be, whether in his or her home or any other place.  The barring order is a most powerful order which enables the court in certain circumstances to bar a cohabitant from his or her place of residence. It, too, renders a person liable to arrest for any breach and allows the Garda Síochána to enter any place for the purpose of such arrest.  It is important that these powers, which are far-reaching, even in the context of domestic violence, should be available in specific circumstances only.</P>
    <P>I am advised that to extend the categories of persons who may apply for a safety or barring order any further than is provided for in the Bill would run the risk of a successful constitutional challenge and therein lies the problem.  I hope Senators will understand and appreciate that I am not prepared to run that risk and, with regret, I must oppose these amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9, in the name of Senator Honan, proposes that the period of living together be six months on aggregate within a 12 month period <Col N="400" /> immediately prior to the application.  I appreciate that such a formula would cohere with the formula in the Bill with regard to safety orders.  Under section 3, as drafted, a cohabitant will be in a position to apply for a barring order where he or she is living with the cohabitant for a period of six months during the period of nine months immediately prior to the application for the barring order.  I am advised that a stricter provision is necessary in the case of a barring order than in the case of safety order for the reason that the giving of a power to the court to order a cohabitant from his or her home runs the risk of constitutional challenge.  To minimise the chances of success of any such challenge, the provisions need to be operated under strict conditions consistent, of course, with the need to protect persons from violence in the home. With regret, I am not in a position to support the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he could not consider an amendment to deal with a woman who has a child in common with a person who is abusing but not living with her.  Women's Aid feels strongly that people who have children in common with persons who abuse them should be entitled to apply for a safety order under section 2 or a barring order under section 3.  With regard to the difficulties concerning the period of six months out of the previous 12 months and the period of six months out of the previous nine months in the case of safety orders and barring orders, many relationships are marked by long periods of absence from the home of violent partners.  To impose conditions concerning a period of six months out of the previous nine months is not acceptable.  I think courts can take this into consideration when dealing with cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said it is not possible to cover this contingency under the provisions of the Bill.  If a woman is being threatened and abused by a person with whom she has a child in common, in what circumstances can she apply for a <Col N="401" /> barring order or a safety order?  I understand the Minister has difficulties with regard to the time period.  He said that barring orders are much more serious than safety orders and he has, therefore, increased the time period for the latter. I do not accept that it is not possible to allow someone who has a child in common with a respondent to apply for a safety order or a barring order. Women's Aid and the Coolock Law Centre have lobbied strongly on this issue.  Both groups have a great deal of experience in this area and their recommendations should not be taken lightly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said.  What is the legal position regarding women who are harassed and abused in their homes by people who are not cohabitants?  Women's Aid and other organisations are faced with the reality of such violence.  Are there any provisions in other legislation which would help these women, whom the Minister says will not be covered by the order provided for in this Bill?  I do not want to weaken this order by insisting that it be extended to cover these people.</P>
      <P>If this appears to the Minister to be strong legislation that is geared, focused and addressed to the needs of those people, then I accept it totally. However, is there any way the violence and abuse directed towards women and children in a non-cohabiting couple can be addressed?  Is there other legislation in existence which already addresses that problem or would it be possible to re-examine it in another Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I have been told that children in these situations <Col N="402" /> will be protected under the Guardianship of Infants Act and the Child Care Act and women will be protected under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, and common assault legislation. My question is broadly the same as that asked by Senator McGennis, but I would be grateful if the Minister could tell me if this is the legislation under which the women can protect themselves and their children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course, other legislation.  The Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, and the Children Act, 1908, have relevance but the remedies would not be as easy, quick and effective as those being provided for in this legislation.  It would be nice if there could be a broad extension of these new remedies in this legislation but there are difficulties and I outlined them in my statement.</P>
      <P>This Domestic Violence Bill deals with cohabiting couples.  If the couple has a child in common but has not cohabited for a long time, these remedies would not be appropriate.  At present, barring orders and protection remedies are confined to the spousal situation.  We are making a major extension in this Bill by bringing in cohabitants for the first time, which has been sought and considered for a long time.  It does not cover every situation &mdash; there are still property, ownership and cohabitation constraints &mdash; but it is a massive sea change from the present position which confines those effective remedies to the spousal situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thrust of this Bill is fraught with constitutional difficulty.  I have had extensive discussions with the Office of the Attorney General and I ask Senators to accept that I am pushing the boat out as far as I reasonably can; Senators would not wish me to run the risk of impunging the entire legislation by pushing it out too far and maybe sinking it.  I cannot risk doing that; the need for this legislation is too strong.  It has been sought for a long time and much time was spent going through all <Col N="403" /> the aspects.  We have extended it as far as possible.  While I fully realise and accept it is the rightful job of Senators to press matters as far as possible, my responsibility is to ensure the legislation is as constitutionally sound as I can make it and as appropriate to the type of situation with which I am trying to deal, and I have done that.</P>

      <P>It would if the Bill was referred to the President and found to be unconstitutional.  On the other hand, if it was signed by the President, it could be challenged on an ongoing basis.  As the Senator knows, these items of legislation do get challenged clause by clause.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister has said.  I congratulate him for pressing forward with this legislation and for going as far as he believes is constitutionally possible.  However, like Senator McGennis, I urge him to press the Minister for Justice to introduce changes to take care of these grave concerns. The Minister can see this from the submissions made by various organisations working with women who have been victims of domestic violence on Committee Stage of this Bill in the other House.  They are concerned about a large number of their clients.  I ask the <Col N="404" /> Government to take this on board by either introducing or amending legislation to take care of them.  The Minister has supported these issues and has done much work in this regard.  The Minister has gone as far as he believes is possible constitutionally, but it is our duty to raise these concerns.</P>

      <P>The aim behind this amendment was raised by Women's Aid.  My concern in moving this amendment is that a respondent might be in breach of the provisions of a barring order.  We want to be sufficiently precise about the exact place, etc., without being all encompassing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of these amendments in one form or another is that they would allow the court under a safety order or a barring order to prohibit a respondent from approaching the applicant or from watching or besetting the applicant at any place where the applicant happens to be.  Amendment No. 6 is specific in that places where persons are intended to be protected would include places where the applicant works or attends for educational purposes or any other place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of the view that the Bill is already framed in a way which meets the circumstances in which a person <Col N="405" /> might need the protection of a safety order outside of the home.  Section 2 (2) (a) and section 3 (3) (a) have a provision to the effect that a person may be directed not to use, or threaten to use, violence against, molest or put in fear the applicant, no matter where that applicant is at the time.  In addition, the court may make a safety order or barring order subject to such exceptions and conditions as it may specify.  That provision should meet the situations which are apparently intended to be covered by these amendments.  The amendments are not necessary and, therefore, I cannot support them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment was put down as a reaction to Senator Honan's amendment, even though its spirit was very much the same.  I was a little taken aback when I saw &ldquo;educational purposes&rdquo; in the Senator's amendment and, in drafting my amendment, I may have been thinking myopically of my institution which is scattered over three miles.  A person may by chance be working in or visiting a place where that other person may be at the time.  This amendment struck me as being too loose.  The provision in my amendment &ldquo;or any other place the Court may specify&rdquo; may seem even wider but it does not draw any attention to education institutions.  I defer to the Minister's judgment about section 2 (2) (a) covering much of that.  In that case why is section 2 (2) (b) needed?  Does section 2 (2) (a) not cover everything in section 2 (2) (b)?  If one allows section 2 (2) (a) to apply everywhere, does that not take care of the situation anticipated in 2 (2) (b) as it stands?  What is the difference between that and what Senator Honan and I put forward?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important section.  Senator Honan and Senator Lee put down their amendments because there has been much discussion in the international media recently about stalker crimes where women are beset by people following them in the workplace or even within hospitals and <Col N="406" /> so forth.  Apparently there have been great difficulties preventing people torturing women.  In 80 per cent of cases the person doing the stalking is well known and quite often is a partner or previous partner of the person who is being victimised. If the Minister says this provision will cover that 80 per cent of cases it is most welcome.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of discussion in the media recently about violence and crime but as far as women are concerned, since, in nine out of ten cases, the people involved in the crime are people they know, not deranged strangers, even in the case of murder, this section of the Bill is of great practical importance.  If the Minister can widen its application to cover these cases I would be very glad.  If he cannot I will have to understand the limitations of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Lee and Senator Henry.  Where a woman is under serious threat she should be protected wherever she is.  Our concerns should correspond to those of the woman in this case.  She should have protection wherever she needs it. Senator Lee's amendment would give the court power to specify particular locations.</P>
      <P>The Minister obviously thinks my amendment is too wide but we are talking about the protection of women and, as Senator Henry said, many women are victims of abuse from people they know.  It can be very intimidating for them to feel that such a person who has been barred from the family home, or from wherever they have been barred, can still effectively torture and cause misery for these women by following them, going to their place of work etc.  Women end up as prisoners in their own home, afraid to go out in case they come across the person from whom they are being inadequately protected by the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support and sympathise with the points made by the Senators but the sections already cover these situations. Section 2 (2) (a), for example, enables the court to make an order prohibiting the respondent from putting the applicant in fear.  This covers stalking them anywhere; there is no restriction as to place or limitation.  The court has full authority in lines 21 and 22 to make the order subject to such conditions as it may specify; it can specify a place or a location.  That is already clearly spelled out in the section.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (2) (b) is different.  This provides for a special situation, that of watching or besetting.  We felt that was so important that it should be spelled out.  Where the respondent and applicant are living in separate places we specificially provide for watching and besetting to be restricted, but any other way of putting in fear is clearly covered by section 2 (2) (a).  That could be stalking or making intimidating telephone calls from another location.  Anything that puts the person in fear is covered under that section and if the court feels it necessary to specify a particular circumstance, such as a specific location or method of putting in fear, the court can do that.</P>

      <P>I see.  Why not simply amend section 2 (2) (a)?  The phrase &ldquo;put in fear&rdquo; seems to me to cover watch or beset as a mechanism of putting in fear as well as the other things <Col N="408" /> the Minister has mentioned.  Section 2 (2) (b) has a sense of limitation of residence. Why should watch or beset be confined to a particular residence whereas put in fear covers everything? If one wants to identify this specifically without limitation of residence, why not simply amend section 2 (2) (a) to read &ldquo;molest or put in fear, watch or beset the applicant or that dependent person&rdquo;? This covers the applicant or dependent person everywhere and achieves more comprehensively what the Minister is trying to do here.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 23 to 36, to delete subsection (4) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) In a case in which application is made for a barring order in respect of the place where the applicant or dependent person resides, and the respondent has a legal or beneficial interest in that place, but the applicant has no such interest or has an interest which, in the opinion of the court, is less than that of the respondent, the court may make a barring order in respect of that place where, in the opinion of the court, the safety or welfare of the applicant or dependent person so require.</P>
      <P>(5) In any application to which subsection (4) applies, the court shall, in deciding whether or not to grant a barring order, and the duration of such order, have regard to all of the circumstances of the case, and, in particular:</P>
      <P>(a) the nature and duration of the relationship between the parties;</P>
      <P>(b) the parties' respective interests, if any, in the property;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> (c) the financial resources of the parties; and</P>
    <P>(d) the safety and welfare of any dependent person of either party.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely important amendment and I expressed concern about this area of the Bill on Second Stage.  I am concerned the court will not have the power to grant an order where the respondent has a greater legal or beneficial interest in the home than the applicant.  In such cases, particularly where children are involved, the court should have the power to grant barring orders even if they are for a limited duration. It is most important that women and children are protected from violence in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>An amendment to section 3(4)(6) in relation to the admission of evidence of an applicant's belief as to his or her legal or beneficial interest in the property was introduced.  However, the amendment does not address the serious concerns in relation to subsection (4)(a).  By virtue of section 3(4), a cohabiting partner or an elderly parent of the respondent is precluded from obtaining a barring order in respect of their place of residence where the respondent has a superior legal or beneficial interest to that of the applicant.</P>
    <P>The rationale behind the provision is to protect the Bill from a constitutional challenge on the grounds that it interferes with property rights.  However, we are being unduly cautious.  We are all concerned about the possible referral of the Bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality.  As the Minister said earlier, he has pushed the boundaries of the Bill as far as he feels possible. However, I cannot understand how it can be said that somebody's property rights are superior to the bodily integrity of women or children.</P>
    <P>The exercise of property rights must be regulated by the principles of social justice and may be delimited by law.  On Second Stage the Minister mentioned his concerns about this matter.  My argument is that, in appropriate circumstances, <Col N="411" /> the right to bodily integrity of women and children should be superior to the property rights of the respondent. The Bill's provisions will introduce discrimination between the children of married parents, in respect of whom these remedies are always available, and the children in a non-marital household who may be denied access to these remedies because, for example, the father has a superior legal or beneficial interest in the home.  This is contrary to the existing constitutional position whereby non-marital children have the same constitutional rights as children born in wedlock.</P>
    <P>The House should consider this matter in depth.  There is no logic in permitting a newly wed with no dependent children to obtain a barring order while denying the same remedy to a long standing non-marital partner with dependent children.  I am aware of the Minister's concerns and that this matter has been discussed at great length. However, my amendment tries to balance the protection of women and children through the granting of a barring order for a limited period without infringing the property rights under the Constitution of the respondent.  This is one of the main issues in the Bill and I am most concerned about it.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned that many people who hope to have recourse to barring orders under the Bill will be restricted in that regard by virtue of the constitutional provisions relating to property. Although the Constitution appears to give a special place to the family and pays much lip service to women, it does not appear to support their everyday lives in a practical way.  The provision in the Bill could have serious consequences for many people and while I am aware of the difficulties with regard to the Constitution &mdash; I am sure the Minister will mention this aspect &mdash; I urge him to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned this matter on Second Stage and I accept the Minister's point that the rationale <Col N="412" /> behind the provisions is to protect the Bill from a constitutional challenge on the grounds that it infringes the property rights of the respondent.  I am not a constitutional lawyer but my amendment attempts to get around that possibility, which might arise if the scope of the Bill is widened.</P>
      <P>The Constitution is anything but clear in terms of what is meant by an unjust attack on property rights.  As Senator Honan said and the Coolock Community Law Centre has informed us, it could plausibly be argued that in appropriate circumstances the right to bodily integrity of a cohabitee or elderly parent could justify a temporary restriction on the respondent's use of a dwelling. Senator Honan also referred to the rights of spouses as opposed to those of cohabitees.  It is enshrined in the Constitution that children born outside wedlock are equally entitled to protection and food as children born within marriage. There is a fear that this provision discriminates against children born outside marriage.</P>
      <P>The Coolock Community Law Centre, which provided Members with much of our information, suggests that, in taking the property rights of the respondent into account, the Oireachtas might decide to place some limits on the duration of a barring order.  My amendment tries to give a judge some discretion rather than directing that he or she must take a certain course.  If it were accepted, judges would have discretion in cases where the applicant does not have a significant interest in the family home.</P>
      <P>The law centre also suggests the length of time the parties have been living together, the ownership of property, the stability of the relationship, the welfare of the child of either party and the financial resources of the party should be considered.  The Minister will probably point out that the grand attempt to do this in the Matrimonial Home Bill failed miserably.  However, he is aware of what we are trying to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister's advice is that my amendment does not achieve that objective <Col N="413" /> and would cause significant damage to the Bill, I will have no hesitation withdrawing it.  I met representatives of Women's Aid after the Joint Committee on Women's Rights launched its report and they favour a strengthening of the Bill in the areas to which amendments have been put down.  They are most concerned about this aspect.  However, as the Minister said today, they also want the Bill enacted and I do not intend to delay its passage.  Will the Minister reassure me that he has thoroughly examined this matter and confirm that the amendments will not achieve the objectives outlined by Women's Aid and the Coolock Community Law Centre and may damage the Bill?  If that is the case I will have no hesitation withdrawing my amendment.</P>
    <P>The Constitution places constraints on all Ministers who wish to change legislation.  As I said on Second Stage, while this Bill is required, we must also address the parts of the Constitution which need amendment if we are to give protection to society.  I am not only talking about cases of domestic violence; the public is also asking for changes to the bail laws.  I accept what the Minister said, that to tamper with this Bill would damage it.  However, I urge him to take action to amend the Constitution to allow for the changes for which the public is calling.</P>

      <P>I support the thrust of the amendments put down by Senator Honan and Senator McGennis. However, following the Minister's speech at the end of the Second Stage debate, I realise that if such amendments were accepted this would be found unconstitutional.  Our Constitution puts property rights ahead of those of the person.  No matter what we may say about the family, its definition in the Constitution is a husband and wife and their children.  If these amendments were accepted, we would run into constitutional difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last divorce referendum I had difficulty persuading some young people to vote in favour of it.  They <Col N="414" /> argued that nowadays nobody cares whether people are married.  Although we may not care, there is a difference under the law, which must be pointed out.  The rights of those with property are placed ahead of those of the person. I hope these issues can be rectified when the divorce legislation is introduced. Those in relationships where there is no impediment to marriage should look at this type of legislation and realise how important it is that they are married, particularly for the sake of their children.  Following the introduction of the legislation, those who are in a position to regularise their affairs should do so because there are differences which are important in terms of the children of such unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke very strongly on Second Stage in favour of the argument that there should be no distinction between the categories defined in the Bill, that is, whether people are living together or otherwise.  As Senator Henry and others said, the inference to be drawn from this is that property rights are placed above the right of bodily integrity, to which I fundamentally object.  I accept what the Minister said, if there is no way around this in terms of legislation, then it should be highlighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody should have their hands tied by a constitution which is out of date in so far as it only refers to women as part of the family, not individuals in their own right.  The 1937 Constitution defines the family as a married couple with children.  As legislators, it is time we highlighted these matters of concern. I do not believe property rights should be on a higher level than that of bodily integrity and the right to safety in one's home.  It would not be acceptable for the judicial system to say that they are incompatible or that it is an inalienable right.  I believe property is less important than the right to safety in one's home.  I would support these amendments if I thought they would work, but I accept the Minister's word in this regard.  This issue must be highlighted <Col N="415" /> and not ignored after the Bill is passed.</P>

      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Gallagher and others.  I hope this aspect of the Constitution will be looked at as a matter of urgency to try to fulfil what everybody would regard as the priority of bodily integrity over property rights as defined in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have much sympathy with the tenor of what was said by the proposers of these amendments and with comments made by others.  I would go as far as to say that if the constitutional constraint did not exist, my approach to this subject might well be different.  However, advice given to me is that a provision along the lines envisaged by amendments Nos. 17 and 18, which would allow a respondent other than a spouse with an ownership interest to be barred on the application of a person with no such interest or with a lesser interest than the respondent, might not survive constitutional scrutiny. This is the case by virtue of the fact that a barring order would constitute an infringement of that person's property rights which the State and its laws must respect under Article 43 of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The position is different where the parties are married.  An infringement of the spouse's property rights is presumed to be justified on the basis that the rights of a family founded on marriage are protected by the Constitution and take precedence over property rights. The difficulty in relation to cohabitants was recognised in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  It recommended that barring order legislation should be extended to cover a situation where the person seeking the order is the owner or tenant of the property.  Indeed, we have gone further than that in the measure we have brought before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must also be remembered that persons with no rights of ownership and <Col N="416" /> property will not be left unprotected. The safety order remedy under the Bill will be available to such persons as will the strengthened powers of arrest for the Garda also provided for in the Bill. I recognise and pay tribute to the efforts made by Senator Honan and Senator McGennis in their amendments to try to get around the constitutional difficulty. I assure the Senators that when preparing the Bill, I made similar efforts which were to no avail because the constitutional difficulties would remain.  With regret, therefore, I am unable to accept the amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was puzzled &mdash; maybe it reflects my ignorance &mdash; by the words &ldquo;an immediate and serious risk of significant harm&rdquo; to the applicant. It seems to take a high risk approach to protecting the applicant.  I accept that section 4(1) (b) introduces the proviso of the granting of a protection order, etc.  If section 4(1) (a) is required, it should simply state &ldquo;a risk of harm&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;any immediate and serious risk of significant harm&rdquo;. <Col N="417" /> The word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; covers an interim period before something is put into operation.  I do not know why one must be satisfied that there is a serious risk of significant harm.  How does one define these things?  What would constitute a risk of harm which is not serious or significant?  It is better to be safe than sorry and that is why I suggest deleting the words &ldquo;serious&rdquo; and &ldquo;significant&rdquo; from this provision.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Lee and Senator Honan, I am concerned about these adjectives.  Would a person have to prove to a court that they would be beaten as soon as they returned home? How do we know how the judge will interpret these adjectives?  I refer to the case I mentioned on Second Stage &mdash; Senator Manning has assured me that the gentleman is still on the bench &mdash; where a woman who was badly beaten was advised to go home with her husband, have a bottle of wine and a couple of steaks.  Some people lead more sheltered lives than the rest of us.  I would not like to think that people had to prove they were about to have their ribs broken or were going to be dragged by the hair around the house before they could get protection in the courts.</P>

      <P>While I accept Senator Lee's concern, I understand that, under the present law, a protection order can be granted by the court immediately prior to any barring order.  However, given that a protection order may not be sufficient in that it does not put somebody out of the house, there is a need for something in between the protection order and the barring order, especially if a barring order will bar one from the family home for a number of years.  I accept that there must be an immediate risk in order for an interim barring order to be granted, which does not need to be a factor pertaining to the subsequent granting of a barring order. It is a good idea, therefore, to provide for an interim barring order and the provision itself is well phrased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>Section 4 provides for the making by the court of an interim barring order pending the determination of an application for a barring order, and the main condition with which the court must be satisfied before granting the interim order is that there is an immediate and serious risk of significant harm to the applicant and any other dependent person if the order is not made immediately.  The effect of Senator Henry's amendment to section 4(1)(a) is that the court would not, in deciding whether to grant an interim barring order, be required to examine either the immediacy or the seriousness of the risk of harm involved to the applicant were the order not to be made.</P>
      <P>I am unable to agree with the amendment as it stands.  I am satisfied that the granting of an interim barring order must be subject to strict conditions for the reason that it is an order made in the interim pending full determination of the case that is made for a barring order.  The barring order remedy is draconian at any time and it is important to recognise that there must be conditions and safeguards attached to the making of such orders by the courts, especially where the order is being made on an interim basis without a full hearing of the case and, indeed, where the court must come to an immediate decision on the facts before it.</P>
      <P>It must also be recognised that the interim order may in some cases be granted on an <i>ex parte</i> basis, that is, in the absence of and without notice to the other party.  These circumstances must demand that conditions and safeguards of the kind which are provided for in section 4 be in place to enable justice to be done to all parties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the amendment helped to highlight for me the fact that the drafting of section 4(1)(a) might be improved in some respects without departing fundamentally from certain essentials.  In response, therefore, I have put down amendment No. 22.  The upshot of this amendment is that the need of the court to be satisfied that there is an immediate and serious risk of significant harm to <Col N="419" /> the applicant would be a need only to be satisfied that there is an immediate risk of significant harm.  On this basis the need to establish a serious risk as such will not arise.  The requirement to establish significant harm should be sufficient to meet the type of stringent conditions which would apply to the granting of interim barring orders.</P>
    <P>My amendment aspires to be similar to the type of amendment since tabled in the names of Senator Lee and Senator Honan.  I ask Senator Henry not to press her amendment and to lend her support to my amendment as a reasonable compromise.  I also ask the House to support this amendment.</P>

      <P>Under existing legislation there is some doubt whether the courts may grant interim barring orders although I understand some District Court judges have granted them in very exceptional or rare occasions, as must be the case when granting such orders, given that they mean people can be barred from their home without receiving any notice &mdash; no summons, no notice to attend court to answer a complaint and so on, in other words, they can find themselves barred from the home <i>ex parte.</i> The order could be based on misleading evidence submitted to the judge as both sides have not been heard.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Clarification may render the amendment unnecessary.  In the interest of natural justice and due process I understand the section allows for the courts to make orders under various Acts, which I welcomed on Second Stage. However, there is concern that the section would allow for the making of orders where no notice of which may be given to the parties to the case.  I am advised that this raises serious issues of <Col N="421" /> due process and constitutional rights. The respondent should have notice to any application made to the court and the likely orders that could be granted by the court.  Will the Minister clarify that the respondent will be given due notice of other issues that would be taken, such as maintenance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 provides that where an application is made for a safety, barring or protection order, the court may, in the same proceedings, make an order under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, an order for maintenance under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, an order in relation to a family home under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, or an order under the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>The effect of Senator McGennis's amendment would be to prevent the court from dealing with matters of custody, maintenance and so on unless prior notice has been given to the other party that such questions will be raised in proceedings.  I appreciate the Senator's concern to ensure that parties will have negotiation.  However, the fact that the court must satisfy itself that it is appropriate to deal with custody, maintenance, etc. in the proceedings fully protects the position of the parties. There will be exceptional situations in barring order procedures where the court may be asked to act quickly, if necessary without notice, under the Acts of 1964, 1976 and 1991.  I am satisfied that those situations must be recognised and covered in the Bill.  The advice available to me is that it is in order to provide in this way in the Bill. There are similar provisions in the Family Law Act, 1995.  I am advised the amendment is not well founded; therefore, I regret I cannot accept it.</P>

      <P>The amendments have been checked by the Attorney General, who is as satisfied, as I am, that the section as it stands conforms with the requirements of natural justice.  The proviso is clearly stated in line 20, &ldquo;if it appears to the court to be proper to do so&rdquo;.  I remind Senators, by analogy with the interim barring order that exceptional situations arise where an order for maintenance, for example, or custody would present itself in the course of a barring order application.  Rather than sending the woman, as it is in most cases, away to get a solicitor who would issue fresh proceedings in an appropriate case, the court must be satisfied that it is proper to do this and that urgency and need require it.  We are giving that discretion to the court in the exceptional case that custody or a family home order would be urgently required.  No court will take advantage in the absence of a person unless there is a pressing reason to do so.  The court could say it will consider the application or put the case back for a week or a fortnight and notify the other spouse.  The alternative is to tell the unfortunate person who needs the custody order or the maintenance order to issue a fresh summons and to start proceedings again.  There are cases where it would be unjust to do that to a person.  The powers are limited, but they should be there.</P>

      <P>I share Senator McGennis's and Senator Henry's concerns. We are giving enormous power to judges in legislation and we are giving more power to the courts than they have already.  Is there any provision to ensure a consistent response, particularly <Col N="423" /> when appointing more District Court judges?  Given the powers being conferred on them &mdash; I accept judicial independence &mdash; there must be some mechanism to ensure a reasonable degree of consistency in the interpretation of such a section which gives sweeping authority to the courts.  Can anything be done about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to do that because every case and circumstance is different.  The type of situations which can arise are wide and unpredictable and we cannot provide for each one. That is why enormous discretion and power must be given to courts and judges in legislation.  They are an organ of Government who take their responsibilities in these matters seriously and carefully.  Any court, before granting an interim barring order, for example, would exercise great care.  Any court which would avail of this power in section 9 would only do so if it was absolutely necessary and urgent.  The fact they may make an order in these proceedings under one of the other Acts does not mean they would do so without giving notice to the other side.  That would be extremely exceptional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There could be circumstances where it might be appropriate to do this, but they would be extremely rare.  More common is the case where in the course of a hearing a judge recognises that the woman urgently needs maintenance but has not been receiving it.  Rather than sending her to a solicitor, issuing a fresh summons, setting a new date for court and undertaking a separate proceeding to the one already underway about a family matter, the judge decides to make it easy for this person.  He decides to deal with the maintenance needs of this woman and her children without asking her to get a fresh summons and to start new legal proceedings.  He puts the case back for a fortnight and asks the woman's solicitor to write to the other spouse to tell him that not only will he deal with the barring order application on Monday week, but that he will <Col N="424" /> also deal with maintenance.  This means the woman does not have to find a solicitor, issue a fresh summons and set a new date for court, which might take months if the courts are busy.  That is the objective and it has a useful role to play.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (1), line 13, to delete &ldquo;or a barring order&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, a barring order, protection order or an interim barring order&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Why did the parliamentary draftsman distinguish between protection orders and interim barring orders and safety orders and barring orders?  As regards barring orders, the courts have the discretion to stay the effects of an order in the event of an appeal.  I thought all orders should have been dealt with on a similar basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 is based on existing law in section 10 of the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981.  Section 12(1) modifies a general District Court rule whereby the operation of a court order is stayed when an appeal is lodged.  The subsection provides that an appeal against a barring order or a safety order shall not stay the operation of the order except if the court that made the order or the appeal court decides that it should have a staying effect, and then only on such terms as may be imposed by that court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> Section 12 (2) provides that an appeal from a protection order or an interim barring order can in no circumstances operate as a stay.  The essential purpose of these orders is to afford emergency protection for a limited period of time, pending the determination of the case at the full hearing.  It would be inconceivable that the operation of such emergency orders could be allowed to be suspended on an appeal being lodged against them.</P>
    <P>The general District Court rule is that a person against whom an order has been made by the District Court may, simply by lodging an appeal, have the order stayed, thereby suspending its effectiveness pending the outcome of the appeal.  Such a rule may no doubt be fair where a monetary payment is being ordered, for example, but in regard to barring orders it might well place the abused victim in considerable peril since by lodging an appeal the respondent would be able to walk back into the home and continue the behaviour which led to the order being sought in the first place.</P>
    <P>Protection orders and interim barring orders are intended to afford emergency protection for a short period, subject to certain conditions.  If the court considers that conditions for the granting of such emergency protection exist, pending the hearing of the application proper, it would seem invidious to suggest that an appeal could effectively stay the order without a full hearing of the case, particularly when one considers that the likelihood is that there would be a full District Court hearing before the Circuit Court appeal.</P>
    <P>The fact that an appeal against a protection order under the 1981 Act cannot operate as a stay has not led to any difficulties in practice as far as I am aware. Any suggestion that emergency protection in serious cases could be delayed by means of an appeal seems to me to be unwarranted and is bound to be seen as a diminution of the present protection afforded by a protection order.  In the circumstances I cannot accept these amendments.</P>

If a husband automatically wishes to appeal, for the sake of making it more difficult, is it possible under this legislation to apply for a protection order and a barring order at the same time, on the basis that if the barring order was appealed, the protection order would not be eligible for appeal and therefore the woman would be guaranteed some immediate safeguard?

      <P>Acceptance of amendment No. 26 involves the deletion of section 25 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 20, before section 25, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;25. (1)  Subject to subsection (2), this Act shall come into operation one month after the date of its passing.</P>
      <P>(2)  Section 6 and so much of the other provisions of this Act as relate to that section shall come into operation on the 1st day of January, 1997.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 25 as it stands provides that &ldquo;the Act shall come into operation one month after the date of its passing&rdquo;.  The effect of amendment 26 is that section 6, giving health boards the power to apply for barring, protection and safety orders on behalf of persons in certain circumstances, would not come into operation until several months later than other provisions in the Bill.  The operative date as proposed is not open ended &mdash; it is set down in the amendments in definite terms as 1 January next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are particular reasons why health boards might not be in a position to operate section 6 adequately if they were required to operate it immediately on enactment of the Bill.  Considerable additional responsibilities have recently <Col N="428" /> been placed on health boards by the coming into operation of 44 sections of the Child Care Act and the training and recruitment of staff is being proceeded with to meet those new demands.  The Government is committed to implementing the Child Care Act in full this year, which would involve further statutory responsibilities on the health boards.  Section 6 of the Domestic Violence Bill has further financial and staffing implications for the child care services of the health boards.  In addition, necessary administrative arrangements will also have to be put in place so that health boards will be in a position properly to take on the new responsibilities placed on them by section 6 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am advised that those arrangements may not be sufficiently in place by the expected time of enactment of the Bill. Accordingly, the amendment now proposed is designed to meet the reality of the situation for the health boards.  The time interval involved is not too great and I ask the House to appreciate that everything possible is being done to ensure that the necessary administrative arrangements will be in place within the time frame allowed for by this amendment. I therefore ask the House to support it for the reason I have given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>My problem with this amendment is that much legislation we have passed &mdash; including the Child Care Act and now this Bill &mdash; places additional responsibilities on health boards.  When Acts are passed there is a presumption that the protection is then in place and the spirit of the legislation can be acted upon.  By submitting this amendment, the Minister is indicating that the safeguard in this provision will not come into place until 1 January 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through my involvement with social workers and the health boards on problems with families and young people, I discovered accidentally that while the Houses of the Oireachtas may pass all the legislation they like to protect those who are vulnerable in society, health boards and health care staff are not prepared <Col N="429" /> to implement those Acts unless additional staff and finance are provided to do so.  Amendment No. 26 quietly admits there is a serious problem in the health boards.</P>
    <P>Almost two years ago I brought a 16 year old boy, who had been thrown out of his home, to a health board social worker.  While she was sympathetic and supportive and pointed me in the right direction, she told me she could not take on his case because she was in the course of industrial action over the additional burdens placed on them. There were no resources and a lack of social workers.  Similarly, in a case for supplementary welfare where a dole payment was not being made, a constituent of mine went to the health board and was told those payments were not being made any more.</P>
    <P>The crisis in the health boards is not the Minister's responsibility, but this amendment covers many other events in the system.  Earlier today, in discussion with representatives of the National Women's Council of Ireland, it was said that the passage of legislation gives out the message that things have changed; but I think that in many instances that message is wrong.  Things can only change if we can support the system to ensure those who are at the coal face can do the job and the Minister must agree that in the health boards at present those faced with dealing with the real and raw cases are not in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>While the Minister says he wants to defer this provision to get it right, he needs to provide the expertise, support and finance to enable these people to carry out this task next month.  I want the Minister to put pressure on the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Health to put the finance and expertise in place to implement this provision.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's old council area in Dublin South &mdash; the Tallaght and Clondalkin area &mdash; there is not one social worker from Dublin Corporation.  The Minister knows the problems of these disadvantaged areas.  The social worker who was there has left and has not been <Col N="430" /> replaced.  This provision signals the crisis at the front line.  I want to be able to tell people that the Government has brought in this legislation, the Child Care Act, 1991 and have provided the necessary finance.  However, there are problems in the health boards and if we keep throwing legislation and additional powers at them they will not be able to implement them unless they are given the necessary resources.  The Minister may say he hopes that will have been done by 1 January 1997 but I would prefer if the Bill were not amended and that an emergency response was put in place to ensure that all sections of the Bill become law within the month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to agree with what Senator McGennis says about the lack of social workers in the community at present.  Unfortunately, the Minister's amendment is realistic.  He should point out to his colleagues in the Department of Health and the Department of Finance that it has not gone unnoticed in the ballroom of Leinster House that there is a dire shortage of social workers to implement the legislation coming to the House.  There are grave problems with the implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991, and the social workers will not be in place by 1 January 1997 to implement the provisions of this Bill unless action is taken.</P>
      <P>In the context of the crisis of getting social workers or probation workers, it is astonishing that we are producing an excess of graduates in these fields yet, even with advertising abroad, we cannot entice them back to work in Ireland. Why has that problem arisen?  A patient asked me recently why all the social workers have English accents.  I presume people are coming from Britain to work here; I doubt if they are expatriates who have acquired English accents while working in Britain.</P>

      <P>We are codding ourselves and the public if we pass admirable legislation but do not provide the resources to allow it to be implemented. I would like an idea of the order of magnitude <Col N="431" /> involved in terms of the numbers of social workers Senators have in mind and the amount of money required to implement this provision as effectively as one would wish.  Have we any idea of the amount of resources needed or how realistic it is to expect this provision to be implemented as of 1 January 1997? What are the prospects of achieving the targets the Senators are talking about if the Minister agrees there is a problem? From where does the date of 1 January 1997 come?  Is it simply a convenient calendar date or is it based on an assumption of the availability of resources at that stage?  Will one be in the same predicament on 1 January 1997 as one will be one month after the date of passing of the Bill?  How far advanced is the planning for that eventuality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The information furnished to me by the Minister for Health, who has responsibility in this regard, is that it will be possible to operate the new responsibilities of the health boards as from 1 January 1997.  There is no question of codding anybody as is evidenced by the fact that we are spelling out in this amendment that these new responsibilities for the health boards will come into operation on a fixed day. If we were trying to introduce a provision whereby the Minister for Health or I was to appoint the date on which section 6 would come into operation, there might be some force to saying that it could be an indefinite date in the future.  However, we are setting it out in the Bill so that it will be fixed and, without any further action on my part, the Minister for Health or anybody else, those responsibilities will come into play on 1 January 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point our saying that we will bring them into operation this year &mdash; that will not be possible.  The staff, training and other resources which will be necessary to operate the section will not be available and ready this year. That is why I must bring the practicality of the situation into line with what will <Col N="432" /> be in the legislation.  It will be possible for the health boards to operate their new responsibilities from 1 January 1997.</P>
    <P>It has to be remembered that the responsibilities being placed on the health boards in the context of domestic violence are new.  They do not exist in any shape or form at present.  The health boards do not have a role in this context at present.  I felt it important that two new powers be brought into play in relation to domestic violence &mdash; the new involvement for the Garda and the new involvement and responsibilities for the health boards.  Hence these new powers are included in the Bill.  I could have brought the Bill forward without either or both of those involvements. It would have been a perfectly good and forward looking Bill if section 6 had not been introduced.</P>
    <P>There is a role for the health boards but it will take a limited time to provide the resources, people and training necessary to enable the health boards to fulfil their responsibilities.  I appeal to Senators to understand the need in this regard.  If I said I expected the section would come into operation in a month's time that would be a cod because the resources will not be there in a month's time.  I am reassured the health boards will be in a position to undertake their responsibilities &mdash; that will be their statutory requirement and obligation &mdash; as from the end of this year.  I ask Senators to accept the amendment in that light.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt the Minister's genuineness.  I did not intend the term &ldquo;codding&rdquo; in the sense of deceiving, rather I was indulging in an amiable illusion.  Had Senator McGennis not drawn our attention to the matter and Senator Henry reinforced the point, I would not have been any the wiser as to why this was the case.  I dare say most people who do not study the matter closely would not be any the wiser.  I accept that resources and training are required and they may not be available immediately.  However, <Col N="433" /> my question is not why it is not being done immediately but if one can be confident the resources required will be there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>What does &ldquo;statutory responsibility&rdquo; mean?  Who determines what resources are required?  The scale of the shortage of social workers the Senators were talking about seems more than a minor detail.  If the Minister is confident they will be there, I accept his word.  It would be reassuring to have an idea of the scale of the investment the Minister for Health is prepared to make in order that this may be implemented in the way the Minister wishes.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be critical or party political on this point but in the public arena there is no differentiation between Government and Opposition &mdash; as politicians we are all tarred with the same brush.  There has been a certain disregard among the public for politicians for some time.  The involvement of health boards in situations of domestic violence has always been urgent but when a newspaper runs with the issue people become panic stricken.  A recent example was the child who was beaten so badly by the man who was living with his mother at that time that he will be permanently disabled. That man had a history of abusing another child.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage, I welcomed the extension of the powers of the health boards and the Garda.  However, there is an urgent need for health board intervention. The Minister is being quite upfront and honest in saying that he is constrained in this Bill by the level of available finance.  However, somebody has to be convinced about the urgency of this matter.  Whatever needs to be done in terms of conciliation, arbitration and finance in order to get the health boards to do this should be done immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> The dreadful case which came to light in the newspapers recently is only one of many.  Will the section of the Bill which gives powers to the health boards to intervene and relieve a child of that nightmare and horror allow for a monitoring of the perpetrator in order to ensure that he does not abuse another child?  Is that safeguard in the Bill?  I intended to raise the question under section 6 and to table an amendment if necessary, but I was told that this new section gives those powers to the health boards.</P>
    <P>As Senator Gallagher said, property rights should not supersede bodily integrity.  One of the arguments used during the divorce referendum debate was that we should not allow abusers to remarry.  Regardless of whether they are married, abusers move from family to family.  Will the Minister assure the House that the powers given to the health boards will allow them to monitor abusers in order to ensure they do not abuse children in other families?  I know that this is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  However, I think that the Minister should have kicked &mdash; as it is known he can &mdash; in order to get the necessary finance.  He has been known to achieve his heart's desire in relation to other issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. However, it is not just a matter of money but a question of gearing up to undertake important new tasks, the recruitment and training of qualified people and so on.  The Minister for Health has assured me that the necessary resources and people will be in place by 1 January 1997.  If there was any doubt about that I would not have dealt with the section in this way but would have provided that the section would come into operation on such a day as I would fix by order.  That would have put it on an indefinite basis. Instead, I have written a specified date into the Bill as evidence of our good intentions in this matter.  It will come into operation on that date and the resources will be in place.  The powers <Col N="435" /> of the health boards on an ongoing basis are set out in sections 6 and 7, in particular, of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, and all the Members of the Seanad for their very helpful contributions on this important Bill.  Tragically, incidents of domestic violence are increasing in Ireland at a frightening level.  We know the number of barring orders which are made.  We also know from our constituencies of the situations which arise, some of which were touched on by many Senators in the course of their contributions.  This Bill has been greatly welcomed by the organisations which work with women, in particular.  They appreciate the need for this legislation which has many new features.  The safety order, the extended period of <Col N="436" /> barring orders, the new role and powers for the Garda and the new role of the health boards will all be very important.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have been able to introduce the Bill and I thank Senators for their help and understanding.  I also pay tribute to the officials in my Department who worked long and hard to prepare the difficult provisions in the Bill. As we know from our discussion here this afternoon, it has many constitutional implications which always present great difficulties.  One has to take great care where the Constitution comes into play that one does not put important legislation at risk on a constitutional basis.  This is now a very good Bill and I thank Senators for their help.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and his staff for bringing forward this legislation.  The Bill is very welcome as it seeks to tackle the serious problem of domestic violence and to provide additional protection for victims of domestic violence.  This is a major positive step on the part of the Government which acknowledges the problem and seeks solutions.  Those who work in the area of domestic violence are very reassured to see this issue being actively addressed.  There are some problems with the Bill, about which I have expressed concern.  I urge the Minister to ensure that those issues are addressed and tackled, whether they have implications for the Department of Health, the Department of Justice or the Constitution. The passing of the Bill makes this is a very good day for the people of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister and his officials on bringing forward this excellent Bill.  I hope he will not think that I am at odds with him when I say I do not think that domestic violence has increased but rather that people are much less prepared to put up with it nowadays.  This Bill shows that society is not prepared to put up with it either, which is most important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad about the additional role for the Garda.  On Second Stage I said <Col N="437" /> that the initiation of a Garda domestic liaison squad would be useful.  The Minister will be glad to know that I have already written to the Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner about that issue.  I hope that he will support me in this area as this legislation would not need to be used quite so much if such a squad existed.</P>

      <P>This is a fine piece of legislation for which many women in my constituency were waiting.  I referred on Second Stage to an elderly woman who is abused in her home by her son.  Such people deserve to be protected in their old age.  This legislation will be of practical benefit to thousands of people.  It was well debated in this House and is well thought out.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, his advisers and officials on a job well done. A great amount of effort was expended examining this area, where so many gaps and flaws existed, and the problems have been rectified by the legislation. I am proud that we have achieved something by passing this Bill into law.</P>
      <P>During the Second Stage debate I stated that I was contacted by women regarding the conjugal rights to which their husbands claim entitlement.  It is most important that women are made aware of their rights under this legislation. In terms of education and public awareness, we must consider how people can be made aware of their rights as a result of these important and crucial changes.  Many women are unaware of this legislation and do not know what the law can do to remove them from horrific situations.  That is why I believe education is very important in this area.  As I stated earlier, however, this is an excellent Bill.</P>

      <P>I echo Senator Gallagher's comments about the importance of diffusing knowledge and information about the legislation among those most likely to benefit from it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue relates to the future of the vocational education committees in the Dublin area, particularly in Dún Laoghaire.  Members are aware of the existence of the County Dublin vocational education committee, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire vocational education committee and the City of Dublin vocational education committee. While changes may be proposed on the basis of the new county areas, it is desirable that the tried and trusted vocational education committee system continue in future, in some form.  This is the approach that I advocate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Changes are required because the present County Dublin vocational education committee covers too large an area.  I pay tribute to the people who served on the vocational education committee in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire which concerned itself with the various schools in that area.  Schools might suffer if changes come about because of centralisation.  However, the vocational education committee does much work in the areas of adult education, youth services, post-leaving certificate education, community employment schemes and education for the <Col N="439" /> unemployed and there should be input at local level.</P>
    <P>If the system becomes too centralised, much local knowledge and input could be lost.  I request that the present system be continued, perhaps with some modification. Under its chairman, Áine Elliott, chief executive officer, Mr. Leonard, Mr. Kevin Brown and the heads of the various colleges, great work is being done by Dún Laoghaire vocational education committee.  Many people are availing of education in one form or another.  However, without localised knowledge, the commitment of the various heads of the colleges and those involved in radio productions, community support services and other activities, many of these people would be left by the wayside.  The present committee has worked well.  If reorganisation and rationalisation are required, so be it, but why try to fix something that is not broken?</P>
    <P>If changes are required, local input should be encouraged.  This might include involvement on the committee by local people, public representatives, representatives from the various colleges, community employment projects, Youthreach projects and the Dún Laoghaire Institute of Further Education. It is important that there be a positive response to this suggestion.  We should not establish further bureaucracy or encourage increased centralisation.  I ask that the Minister respond positively on this matter.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I will quote from the Dún Laoghaire vocational education committee pamphlet, &ldquo;Providing Opportunities for All&rdquo;, in which Áine Elliot states:</P>
    <P>We remain convinced that small is beautiful, that the most effective service is that which develops from intimate local knowledge and understanding, and we are confident that the role played by the vocational education committee in the future will be cherished and further enhanced in the public interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> I ask the Minister of State to take my comments on board, although I am unsure if this matter pertains to her brief.  Perhaps she might inform the Minister for Education, who has an indepth knowledge of Dún Laoghaire, of this issue.  The Minister of State, from her experience in Bray, has seen the benefits that vocational education committees bring to the community.</P>

      <P>I will ensure that the Minister is advised of the Senator's concerns.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education, &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo;, sets out Government policy in this area.  The vocational education system plays and will continue to play, through the education boards, a significant role in the development and provision of education services.  It has been decided that there will be legislative reform and rationalisation of the vocational education committee system.  The amending legislation for the vocational education committees will provide for the retention of the vocational education committees, with a substantial local authority involvement and the recognition of the vocational education committees as providers of education.</P>
      <P>The Commission on School Accommodation Needs, the membership of which has recently been announced, will commence its work on 1 March 1996 under the chairmanship of Mr. Frank Murray, General Secretary of the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools.  As its first task, the commission will examine the existing vocational education committee structure and report and make recommendations on the rationalisation of vocational education committees.  The report and recommendations will be set in the context of establishment, functions and responsibilities of the education boards.  The commission will also have full regard to the key principles and policy aims set out in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> The commission will report within three months of its establishment and its report will be published.  The legislative rationalisation of vocational education committees will be implemented in advance of the formal establishment of education boards, taking full account of the recommendations of the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion calls on the Minister for the Environment to sanction and provide funds for a public sewerage scheme in the villages of Ballintubber and Cloonfad in County Roscommon. These picturesque villages are situated in north-west Roscommon and have great potential.  The people of the locality believe great opportunities exist with regard to industrial, commercial and tourism development.  Both villages are being held back and hamstrung to a great extent due to the fact that they do not have a public sewerage scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both are progressive villages in so far as they both have development associations which have a long and fruitful record with different agencies: the county council, the enterprise board, Leader, the Department of Education with regard to an amenity grant, etc. They have developed the villages as far as possible at present and Ballintubber has come second on many occasions in the Tidy Towns competition in County Roscommon.  That does not happen without massive community involvement and the House will appreciate that.  They have a great tradition of organising events, such as the Ballintubber Fair, and many other attractions which bring people into the town.  Along with that, of course, is Suck Valley Cooperative which has major tourism opportunities in the valley of the River Suck.  I have a letter from that co-operative dating back a year or more which indicates the importance of getting a sewage treatment scheme for the village of Ballintubber to avoid pollution of the <Col N="442" /> River Suck as the result of overflows from the concentration of septic tanks in the Ballintubber area.</P>
    <P>To give the Minister an idea of the size of Ballintubber, we are talking about almost 200 houses and the proposed scheme will cost in the region of £450,000.  Roscommon County Council has undertaken all the costings and plans, has submitted them to the Department of the Environment and endorses the proposal.</P>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach is also well aware of the situation.  We have received strong representations over a long period with regard to the request for a sewerage scheme in that area.  Their case is a good one.  By sanctioning funds for this scheme, the Minister can be assured it will be money well spent.  This is a vibrant community, with a development association, and there are real opportunities for tourism.  Back up is provided by the now well developed Shannon Valley Co-op, which is involved in major angling events right along the Suck Valley and of which we are proud.</P>
    <P>That is the case I make for the village of Ballintubber.  As regards Cloonfad, which is a little further west and quite close to the County Mayo border, it also has a vibrant community.  In fact, the record will show they have built a fine community and sports centre there, with social services day-care facilities, which caters for both young and old.  All this has been done on a voluntary basis.  We were fortunate to get grants under two headings: the sport and recreation section of the Department of Education and the Departments of Social Welfare and Health, which provided grant aid for equipment and the running of the day centre.  The Cloonfad community, which is larger than than in Ballintubber, is also well organised.  Between 250 and 300 houses in this area would benefit from this scheme.  I believe there is a great case to be made here for this scheme, which will cost less than £500,000.  It would be money well spent. Included in the scheme for Cloonfad is a proposal to take away some surface <Col N="443" /> water too and all this can add greatly to that village, which is ideally located.  It is located right on the route of people who would travel across north-west Roscommon into the fishing areas of County Mayo, but it provides good course-fishing too.  There are great opportunities here but, as I say, both villages are being hamstrung due to the lack of a public sewerage scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not need to mention the letters, representations and lists of residents which have been sent to me and to other Oireachtas Members and councillors throughout the county pleading for a public sewerage scheme in these two villages. I know that public representatives at both Oireachtas and county council levels support fully both villages.  I have no doubt they have made good cases, but as we begin another new tourism season the people are becoming edgy and are beginning to apply political pressure to establish whether the Department of the Environment and the Minister will come to their aid and indicate whether it will provide a public sewerage scheme for both villages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Finneran for the opportunity of dealing with this issue.  The Minister is well aware of the difficulties arising from the unsatisfactory performance of existing septic tanks systems at Ballintubber and Cloonfad and of the concern in both villages that sewage collection and treatment should be improved at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Finneran will know that at present a number of major projects are being advanced for County Roscommon. Stage 1 of the Lough Derg, and Stage 1 of the Lough Ree Catchment Protection Schemes aim to provide sewage collection and treatment at Monksland, Castlerea, Boyle, Ballaghadereen, Tarmonbarry and Roscommon town at a cost of around £10 million.  Both schemes have been submitted to the European Commission for co-financing under the Cohesion Fund.  In addition, <Col N="444" /> a major water supply scheme at Boyle-Ardcarne was recently approved at a cost of £2.8 million; work has now started and the project will be substantially completed this year.  Smaller projects at a number of other locations were also paid grants of £150,000 within the last year.</P>
    <P>The Minister is, of course, keenly interested in the provision of sewerage services for rural villages but, unfortunately, demand exceeds available resources for projects of this kind.  We need, therefore, to look at new technologies which are both environmentally safe and cost-effective so as to allow us to maximise resources for these smaller schemes.</P>
    <P>Both Cloonfad and Ballintubber are small villages with a combined population of about 300 people.  Surface water is collected and discharged to local streams.  Septic tanks deal with sewage disposal for individual houses. The cost of providing new conventional sewage treatment and collection, as has been proposed for these two villages, would run to about £1 million.  This would represent a cost of over £12,000 per house served.  At a time when major sources of pollution must be addressed, both within County Roscommon and at towns and cities around the country, one must question whether cheaper but equally effective alternatives may not be available.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the high cost of the schemes proposed for Cloonfad and Ballintubber and to the existing high level of commitments under the water and sanitary services programme, it is not possible to say when it may be possible to advance these schemes.  It is appropriate, however, that Roscommon County Council should re-examine these proposals with a view to making them more cost-effective while at the same time ensuring that the system adopted is capable of treating the waste load to a satisfactory standard.  The Department will be in touch with the county council for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 14 February 1996.</P>
