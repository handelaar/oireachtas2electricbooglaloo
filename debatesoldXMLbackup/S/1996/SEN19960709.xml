      <P>I have notice from Senator Enright that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to outline her proposals for the implementation and recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report; to improve the setting, running and checking of the leaving certificate examination and to ensure particular safeguards in regard to safety aspects of examination papers and materials attached thereto.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Roche of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The grave concern felt in the House that the matters raised by the Chief State Pathologist be resolved at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to increase funding to the National Safety Council in order that more intensive water safety publicity campaigns can be launched this year and to ensure that all safety <Col N="1070" /> equipment is examined and well maintained.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Enright's and Senator Roche's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Cosgrave may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Item 1 is without debate.  It provides for the implementation of a decision arrived at by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at the instigation of the Leader of the Opposition which will enable Opposition groups to have more than one Private Members' Bill on the Order Paper at any given time.  I am sure there will be full agreement on that.  Item 2 should be fairly brief.  Committee and Remaining Stages of item 3 and Second Stage of item 4 will be taken.  I ask that there be some flexibility in the ordering of business today because items may run longer or shorter than anticipated.  Perhaps the Whips could meet later, if necessary, to postpone business until tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Tomorrow's business, the Court and Court Officers Bill (No. 3), 1996, was ordered for Thursday, but it has not been published yet.  It is a simple Bill containing one section which provides for increasing by three the number of Circuit Court Judges and I wish to give Members notice of its content for the debate tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I note item No. 1 is without debate.  On behalf of my party I wish to thank the Leader of the House in that regard.  It would be remiss of me not to comment on it.  It reflects the view of the Leader of the House that where change is in keeping with the running of the House, he is most amenable.  I also thank the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  This is a progressive step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> As the Leader said, the Whips will meet later in the afternoon to decide on any changes that may be necessary in taking the Bills depending on the time frame involved.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to two major successes by the Garda in the past week.  As the Leader will be aware, we have debated the crime problem here on a regular basis.  On behalf of my party I wish to record the success of the Garda in seizing £800,000 worth of illegal cigarettes last week and in seizing £1 million worth of heroin in Dún Laoghaire last night. It is pleasing that the day to day work of the gardaí is paying off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind that the House will be recalled later this month to deal with a particular matter, it might be practical to also consider debating Northern Ireland at that stage. I am not saying we should debate that issue at this time, but it might be worthwhile giving some consideration to developments there towards the end of this month when the heat has gone out of the situation, I am sure we all have something to say on it.</P>
      <P>Last week I raised with the Leader of the House &mdash; and he undertook to raise it with the appropriate Department &mdash; the tendency to clog up traffic on the north side of Dublin every time a clerk from Brussels comes to talk to a senior civil servant on this side of the Irish Sea. We should know the criteria under which gardaí are taken from the valuable work of detecting crime and following criminals to stand at cross-roads holding up traffic for people who are deemed to be important by persons whom we do not know.  I am not suggesting that Heads of State and important people should not get due deference and tolerance, but holding up traffic at a whim is a matter about which the public ask questions.  There may be security implications when Heads of State are involved but who makes the decision and who takes gardaí from other work to stop traffic on those occasions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1072" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On item 1 dealing with the amendment to Standing Order 82, I agree with Senator Wright.  It is a positive development and I thank the Leader for including it on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>Arising from Senator O'Toole's comments, it would not be helpful at present to debate the position in Northern Ireland because matters are at such a sensitive stage.  I hope he is right that things will settle, and when they have, that we might return to it when we come back to consider the crime problem.  We must also use that opportunity to appeal to Unionists to show restraint and leadership.  There is a solemn obligation on constitutional politicians to ensure that only peaceful means are used to gain their objectives.  It is important that we say that and they must show that they have a commitment to the peace process.  That is something we can go into in greater detail if we debate the matter at that stage.</P>
      <P>The other issue I want to raise is the continuing farce in Bord na Móna.  I appeal to the Leader of the House to draw the attention of the Government to our concerns, stressing that this controversy, which is doing tremendous damage to the company and the morale of its workforce, must end.  Whatever about the rights and wrongs of the position of its chief executive and board, the matter must be resolved.  The Government must tackle and resolve this problem urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure all Members will join me in condemning the wanton destruction and desecration at St. Michan's Church on Sunday night last.  We must all be seen to condemn out of hand any desecretion of areas where the dead are interred.  Perhaps the Leader would also inquire from the relevant Department whether some funds could be made available for the reparation of these valuable artefacts which have been part of Dublin for many hundreds of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within a couple of hundred yards of this House, a young chap lost his life on <Col N="1073" /> Friday evening last, apparently, simply because he pushed someone when he was in a hurry &mdash; under similar pressure, some of us might well do likewise.  This killing did not get the same publicity as recent killings.  I ask the Leader to bring this to the attention of the appropriate authority.  If society is reaching the stage another 18 year old life is lost, appropriate action must be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us endorse Senator Cosgrave's sentiments, especially in relation to St. Michan's Church and the desecration wrought there on Sunday evening last.  As somebody coming from the country it may seem unusual that I should have a particular interest in that church but my earliest recollection of visiting this city was when I was taken to the crypt.  In that crypt are the remains of the Clements family, otherwise known as Lord Leitrim, not remembered with much affection, but the history surrounding whom was influential.  I hope the perpetrators of this atrocious act will be brought to justice expeditiously.</P>
      <P>I am sure the House would like to join me in conveying our sincere thanks to President Robinson, on behalf of the Irish community in Britain but more particularly those in Manchester, following her recent State visit there.  This was by way of reassurance to a city which is to all intents and purposes Irish and which, with the exception of Liverpool, probably has one of the highest concentrations of Irish people.  Indeed, it was ironic that some of the businesses bombed out of existence in that recent callous IRA attack were Irish owned, and some of these owners now face destitution. The IRA might well reflect on the damage they have wrought yet again on the Irish community in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President's visit was reassuring both for the Irish community and their English neighbours.  The manner in which she carried out her duties was exemplary as were her statements about the real sense of Irishness we all feel having been warmly welcomed by civic <Col N="1074" /> leaders and the Irish people there with whom we deal regularly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>May I offer my condolences to the family of Michael McGoldrick, a very recent graduate, a tragic victim of the present unrest in Northern Ireland?  I attended an honorary degree conferring ceremony at Queen's University on Friday last for a good friend of mine, Mr. Paddy Devlin. When I heard this dreadful news, it occurred to me that that young man may well have been in that hall since he was driving a taxi to maintain himself before continuing with his further studies.</P>
      <P>Would the Leader inquire of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government to what extent some fair brokerage can take place in the Drumcree and Garvaghy Road area between the two parties to the dispute?</P>
      <P>I should also like a debate on Northern Ireland sooner than other Members appear to recommend, but that is beyond my remit.  In the case of those Senators who are interested in the present position, that prevailing in north Down where I live is serious but not nearly as bad as on the occasion of the Ulster Workers' Council strike.  Nonetheless, the burning of cars and damaging property is going on apace, with barricades being erected&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must draw the Senator's attention to the fact that we are not now discussing this matter apart from questions being put to the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader of the House would assure me that some sort of brokerage will take place, the position in that area having gone beyond the point of any agency being able to intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to be associated with the condemnation of the vandals who destroyed human remains in St. Michan's Church.  There is no <Col N="1075" /> doubt but that society has reached an all time low when sacred places where bodies have been interred for many years are destroyed.  There is too much of this type of vandalism generally and appropriate authority for its control will have to be reinstated and/or augmented.</P>
      <P>Since RTÉ appears to be handing of money like old hay&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not getting any of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;some with undue haste, to settle libel cases, could the Leader of the House ascertain how much RTÉ spends on such settlements annually?  In addition, would he request the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to refuse to approve increased TV licence fees while taxpayers' money is spent as if it were going out of fashion?  It is scandalous for RTÉ to waste public money.  That body, while criticising us and others, is unable to run its own show, yet it seeks more taxpayers' money.  I hope the Minister will refuse to approve any increase in television licence fees until RTÉ is held properly accountable for the salaries of its staff &mdash; which information has already been refused &mdash; in addition to its precise expenditure on legal fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what I take were calls made rather discreetly for a debate on Northern Ireland.  This is a good time to have such a debate because we should speak out while such occurrences take place.  Would the Leader of the House make provision for statements to be made during the present intolerable occurrences in Drumcree?  As a member of the Church of Ireland, I find it completely and utterly inappropriate and deplorable that a Church of Ireland should be used as a launching pad for this type of demonstration. I very much hope the Archbishop of Armagh, Dr. Robin Eames, made that point clear to the rector of Drumcree, although when I wrote to the <Col N="1076" /> bishops of the Church of Ireland on this issue some ten years ago I did not receive a single response.</P>
      <P>I should like to inquire of the Leader of the House whether the provision for making statements on foreign affairs has now ended because I understood it was continuing.  Unfortunately, I was abroad on a business trip with other members of a Foreign Affairs committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">

      <P>Junket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I avoided using the word &ldquo;junket&rdquo; specifically because I thought it would be indelicate of me to describe our very hard working trip as a junket. Would the Leader say whether provision could be made for a continuation of this debate?</P>
      <P>I wish to raise another matter of considerable concern, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which relates directly to Government and its responsibilities. I had occasion to look for the published reports of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs some time ago having discovered I did not have them.  I raised the matter at that committee when I was told that, because of difficulties with inadequate resources, they were no longer being published; this was raised subsequently by my colleague on that committee, Senator Lanigan.  I should like the Leader to inquire whether that remains the case and to ascertain if something cannot be done about it.  It is extremely insulting to significant committees of this House that the reports have not been published for the past year or so.  That makes our work extremely difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We may not discuss this issue now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was raising a question about it, a Chathaoirligh.  Will time be made available to continue the statements on Foreign Affairs.  Yesterday, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs had a meeting with the head of the International Red Cross who pointed out that Ireland was among a small <Col N="1077" /> number of countries that have not yet ratified Protocols 1 and 2 of the 1970s Revisions of the Geneva Convention. There is no principled or political reason for not having done it; it is simple bureaucratic inertia and, as we hold the Presidency of the European Union, it seems inappropriate that we should not have ratified these instruments.</P>
      <P>I am most grateful to that literate and cultivated Member of the House, Senator Willie Farrell, for pronouncing St. Michan's correctly; I wish RTÉ would do the same.  I regret that there was a disturbance in the vaults of St. Michan's.  These vaults are referred to by Joyce in the Cyclops episode of <i>Ulysses.</i>  They are part of the history and tradition of Dublin.  The Crusader is over 800 years old; I understand the Crusader survived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We may not discuss this matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again I compliment Senator Farrell.  I hope, in his other communications with RTÉ, he will correct its mispronunciation of St. Michan's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the matter raised by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Wright, when he congratulated the Garda Síochána on the seizure of drugs and cigarettes. Thousands of people have signed books of condolence for Veronica Guerin and for the Garda sergeant killed in Adare. However, every day thousands of people buy cigarettes on the streets of Dublin, and that is the fuel, the daily cash flow, that drives the drug barons. It is ordinary law abiding citizens who buy those cigarettes and I understand why, but if they want to make a real statement about the drug barons, they must stop buying the drug barons' cigarettes. Every time they pay over £2 for their packet of Rothmans it goes straight to people who are intent on destroying the youth of this country with heroin and cannabis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> I congratulate the Minister for Justice who presided over these seizures during the past few days.  She is blamed when things go wrong and when things go right she is entitled to praise.  It is important to tackle the sale of cigarettes on the streets.  I do not mean the people who sell them; they are not the problem. The crime barons will just have to find something else to sell.  We have to cut out that cash rich route which is used to buy heroin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Leader of the House is aware of the long drawn out dispute between the Department of the Health and the environmental health officers which is holding up the registration and certification of a huge number of important tourism related projects &mdash; hotels, guesthouses and other premises that wish to be registered now that the tourist season is upon us.  I understand there was some discussion last Friday but no resolution.  Perhaps the Leader of the House could ask the Minister for Health to give some indication of what steps have been taken to get back to the negotiating table so that we can arrive at a resolution of this dispute and open up the possibility of registration for many of the projects that have been held up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House ask the Government to make a decision on the Bord na Móna dispute? This issue has been raised here five times in all and, irrespective of how the contents of a document were leaked, the Government should make the decision which the board of Bord na Móna flunked and publish the salary, expenses and perks paid to the chairman.  In the paper today a freelance journalist said that this controversy could be the &ldquo;industrial shroud&rdquo; of the chairman of the board, an appalling thing to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House in respect of item No. 1.  It is a progressive move and will be facilitated on this side of the House.  When can we <Col N="1079" /> expect the Freedom of Information Bill to be referred to a committee.</P>
      <P>I join with others who congratulated the Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise on the seizures of heroin and cigarettes.  I agree with Senator Magner that it is timely to point out, particularly to the citizens of this city, that, having wrung their hands last week over a foul murder, they might look to their consciences because each time they buy a packet of 20 cigarettes from those people who illegally sell them, they are contributing to the well being of the drug barons we all decry.  It is time Irish hypocrisy was put aside and common sense shown.  If people support the forces of law and order in this small matter, hopefully they will go on to do so in larger matters.</P>
      <P>I join with those who criticised the extraordinary vandalism at St. Michan's Church over the weekend.  It is appalling to think that the body of somebody who went through the Crusade should be endangered.  It would be appropriate to send the good wishes of this House to those who have cared so long for that piece of Ireland's heritage.  I hope the people who perpetrated that absolutely outrageous vandalism will be brought to court soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my own party leader in thanking the Leader of the House for introducing the amendment in respect of item No. 1.  Would the Leader of the House and the members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges between now and next session, examine the possibility of amending the procedure in the Seanad to allow for a question time rather than continuing with the procedure where every Senator is entitled to raise as many issues as he or she can think of on the Order of Business.  This would constitute a more orderly approach than the hit and miss procedure of raising matters on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand some of my colleagues called today for a debate <Col N="1080" /> on Northern Ireland.  This would be an appropriate time for such a debate.  I would also call for the party leaders in the South to come together to discuss the very dangerous situation which is developing in Northern Ireland.  I was at Garvaghy Road and Drumcree on Sunday and the hatred and abuse the RUC had to face would have to be seen to be believed.  I compliment the RUC on the job they have done up to now.  The stories about the residents there are not true.  There is a very strong residents coalition taking in all groups, but there is much tension and there may well be major disruption which could have effects on the economy here and on the way of life of many of our people.  The five leaders should come together and do something about this quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse Senator Dardis' comments on Bord na Móna and wish to convey to the Leader of the House the difficult circumstances under which boards of semi-State companies must operate. The semi-State sector is competing with private industry. The salary of a chief executive of a semi-State body is very low in comparison with that of a chief executive officer in the private sector.  There should be guidelines but they should be fair and allow the semi-State companies to compete with the private sector because they are expected to perform to the same standard.  Some chief executives of semi-State bodies do a magnificent job and are very poorly paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Daly raised the issue of environmental health officers.  The workload of environmental health officers has increased enormously as a result of EU legislation.  The salary levels of environmental health officers were in line with those of community welfare officers approximately eight years ago.  They have similar levels of qualifications and now environmental health officers are seeking pay parity with community welfare officers.  They can stand over the case.  I would like to <Col N="1081" /> see a speedy resolution of the dispute. Will the Leader do everything in this power to bring that about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in congratulating the authorities on the recent seizure of heroin in Dún Laoghaire and the confiscation of illegally imported cigarettes.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister for Justice or her spokesperson make a statement on the criteria for the transfer of prisoners from regimental to open prisons, such as Shelton Abbey?  We have been discussing drug trafficking legislation and I read with horror about the transfer of a prisoner to Shelton Abbey, having served 70 days of his eight year prison sentence for the importation of £7 million worth of drugs.  Somebody will have to take responsibility for this because it sends out the wrong message to the Garda Síochána who worked hard to get convictions and then found that a prisoner, Christopher O'Connell, was transferred to an open prison 70 days into his sentence.  While we are shedding crocodile tears, the general public is rapidly losing faith in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the expressions of congratulations to the Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise officers.  I concur with Senator Magner's point and join with him in asking the citizens of Dublin to refrain from buying from drug barons.  I compliment the people who refused to enter a gangster's pad on the borders of my county in the past two weeks.  That is only right and proper.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Kelleher's point, I always thought it was the governor who made decisions on the transfer of prisoners. I wonder how the decision on the individual concerned was reached because it leaves a lot to be desired and something should be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the Opposition and others for their welcome of item 1.  It is a small improvement but it will help the work of the House.  Senator Wright very correctly drew attention to the two major successes <Col N="1082" /> of the Garda Síochána in recent days.  Obviously everybody will be very pleased with that and I think it should help the process of restoring confidence in the efficacy and authority of the Garda Síochána.  As we approach the appointment of a new Garda Commissioner, it is time that whatever divisions there were within the force was ended and whatever friction there has been between the Garda Síochána and the Government should be put behind them so that all sectors of the State present a united front in opposing crime.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole, among others, raised the question of Northern Ireland. I do not think a debate in this House today or tomorrow would assist the situation in Northern Ireland.  I hope Senator O'Toole is right that things may be restored to calm when the House meets again at the end of this month. Senator McAughtry drew attention to the murder of Michael McGoldrick and pointed out that it is a long time since we had to stand up and condemn a murder, almost certainly sectarian murder or assassination by people whose only intention is to foment greater disorder in Northern Ireland.  This brutal murder deprived a family of their father, and a young man of a career.  We must note the words of his distraught parents who placed some of the blame on the wild talk of some politicians.  I do not think we have to go too far to point the finger at those indulging in wild talk.  There never has been wild talk in this House. Our debates have always been restrained and responsible.  In my judgment a debate in this House might not be a great help at this time but I will keep the matter under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also raised the traffic disruption to accommodate the civil servants who have come here for the European Presidency.  I agree with him that there is a sense of disproportion about the disruption which is frequently caused simply to save some people five, ten or 15 minutes getting from the airport.  Nothing could be more calculated to annoy people than <Col N="1083" /> unnecessary disruptions of this sort.  I imagine the criteria are operational ones controlled by the Garda Síochána but it will do no harm to have the Senator's views conveyed to the relevant authorities.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised the question of Northern Ireland and I endorse his call to the Unionist leadership to show greater restraint and responsibility than has been shown in recent times.</P>
    <P>Senator Haughey and others raised in a helpful way the question of Bord na Móna.  Everybody would like to see this matter resolved and we hope it will be resolved one way or the other today. This unseemly matter has dragged on too long and we would like to see it resolved.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave raised the question of St. Michan's Church &mdash; and I thank Senator Farrell, helped by Senator Norris, for the correct pronunciation. What happened last night was appalling and dastardly.  The last taboo has been broken &mdash; an attack on the dead.  It is also an attack on our heritage.  I hope Senator Cosgrave's proposals that some financial aid can be given to help the authorities to do what they can to make good the damage will be forthcoming. There is a general sense of outrage at this vandalism.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raised an important point.  We should be grateful to President Robinson for going to Manchester. Her tangible bridge building at a difficult time, holding out the hand of friendship and making sure that the people of Manchester know that what has happened to them is repugnant to the overwhelming majority of the Irish people, is building in a very personal way a friendship that could have been damaged.  Senator McAughtry raised the question of Northern Ireland.  I think I answered this point.  We are all conscious of the sensitivity of the situation and that Senator McAughtery is one of the few Members who sees what is happening there daily.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> Senator Farrell raised the question of libel cases against RTÉ.  The public affairs department in RTÉ will give him details of the amount they have paid out, I presume they should, and perhaps then we could use the information.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris made a multiple intervention. Some of the points he raised have been answered.  The debate on foreign affairs will take place in the next session and the reporting of the foreign affairs meeting is a matter for the Joint Committee for Foreign Affairs.  I have no plans for a debate on foreign affairs this session.  Senator Magner made the point which was supported by others on the public responsibility not to buy cigarettes which they know have been stolen or imported illegally.  That could be as much their way of making a gesture as the signing of condolences or giving flowers.  This is a practical way of striking out against those people.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly and Senator Townsend raised the question of the environmental health officers.  I do not have the up to date position but I will try to find out about it.  Senator Roche asked about the Freedom of Information Bill.  It will not be taken in this session but I will look sympathetically at making time available next session.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan raised the question of Question Time in this House. Curiously that was one of the points looked at by the Committee on the Constitution. It came down strongly against Question Time in this House arguing that the Government was primarily responsible to the other House.  We should look at whether there is some way Members can have easier and quicker access to information.  Perhaps we can do that over the summer in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Senator Maloney gave us the benefit of his experiences over the last few days.  Senator Kelleher raised the question of prison sentencing.  It is my understanding that this is exclusively the responsibility of the governor; it is an operational matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), lines 6 to 22, to delete paragraph (e) and (f), and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" />&ldquo;(e) (i) At any time prior to the expiration of the second 24 hour period of detention provided for under paragraph (c), an application may be made to a judge of the Circuit Court, who, if satisfied by oral evidence made by a member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of Chief Superintendent and such other evidence as may be called at an <i>ex-parte</i> hearing, that the further detention of the arrested person is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence in respect of which he has been arrested and that the offence being investigated is a substantial and serious offence, may direct that the period of detention be extended by any period of time not exceeding a further 72 hours from the expiration of the second 24 hour period of detention.</P>
    <P>(ii) If, within the final 6 hours of a period of detention authorised by a judge of the Circuit Court under paragraph (e)(i) of this section, an application is made to a judge of the Circuit Court, that period of detention may be extended by a period of time not greater than 48 hours from the expiration of the period of detention under paragraph (e)(i) of this section if the judge is satisfied, by oral evidence of a member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of Chief Superintendent and such other evidence as may be called at an <i>ex-parte</i> hearing, that the further detention of the arrested person is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence in respect of which he has been arrested and that the offence under investigation is a substantial and serious offence.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State may have read the record of last week's Second Stage debate on this Bill where it was clearly indicated that this Bill enjoyed the full support of the Fianna Fáil Party and that the Fianna Fáil side of the House <Col N="1089" /> would be fully and positively engaged in helping the Government in the fight against crime and in particular by passing this Bill as speedily as possible. Before I speak on the amendment I want to reiterate on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party our congratulations to the Government and the Garda Síochána on the two large drug finds recently. Any such discovery is welcome because it will mean much less misery on our streets.  We wish the Garda, the Navy and Customs and Excise officers every success in the future and I am sure I speak for all.</P>
    <P>This is a tough Bill.  On Second Stage the Minister said it was harsh and draconian. If we are going to be tough, let us be really tough.  Let us not send the officers of law enforcement into battle against people who are hell bent on destroying the fabric of society with only one glove on.  This amendment relates to periods of detention.  If the person under suspicion or their legal representative is in court during a hearing when the reasons, which may include evidential reasons, for the continued detention of the suspected drug trafficker have to be made known, it could arm them with information they may subsequently use in their defence.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes that such applications should be made at an <i>ex parte</i> hearing, in other words, there should be only one party present.  When a superintendent goes to court seeking a search or an arrest warrant in other cases, the subject of the warrant will not be in court.  The Government must justify the insertion of the section in the manner in which it is drafted.  Will the Minister consider accepting this amendment?</P>
    <P>There is no question of Fianna Fáil disagreeing with the seven day detention period.  The rationale for the extension is widely accepted.  As many of those involved in the drugs business &mdash;&ldquo;death business&rdquo; would be a more appropriate title &mdash; have international connections or live in foreign jurisdictions, a period of seven days detention <Col N="1090" /> may be necessary for the gardaí to make international inquiries.  We will not object to a longer than normal period of detention for persons suspected of drug trafficking.  There is no question of extending it to other crimes.  The drug trafficking menace will have to be met with an adequate legislative response and the best way to do that is to provide for <i>ex parte</i> hearings.  The Government should accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential difference between what is being proposed in these amendments and the approach taken in the Bill is that, under these amendments, an application to a court for the continuation of a person's detention would be made <i>ex parte,</i> in other words the detained person would not have to be brought before the court.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that a detained person must be brought before a court and have a right to be heard on the basis that such a provision was considered necessary to comply with requirements under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Having regard to the jurisprudence which has built up in respect of Article 5(1)(c) and (3) of the convention, it is clear that provision must be made for the arrested person to be brought before a court after 48 hours.  There is a substantial body of jurisprudence in this regard.  It would not be sufficient to simply require a chief superintendent to apply for an extension in relation to detention.  The detained person must be physically brought before a judicial officer and given an opportunity to be hard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Schiesser <i>v.</i>  Switzerland, the European Court of Human Rights defined the powers and qualities required of a judicial officer to comply with this provision.  These include complete dependence when performing in the judicial capacity; the detainee must be present at the hearing and the judicial officer must listen to the detainee's representations or those of his or her representative; the need for <Col N="1091" /> all the circumstances for or against release to be reviewed and for the judicial officer to decide, by reference to established legal criteria, whether there are reasons to justify detention and the power to order immediate release where continued detention is no longer justified.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been carefully drafted to take into account these and other requirements arising from that case and subsequent cases dealing with related matters.  I recognise the concerns which have been raised about the practicalities of what is proposed in the Bill but, on the basis of the advice available, the safeguards provided are necessary if we are not to fall foul of the convention and I am sure nobody would suggest that we should deliberately include a provision in the Bill which would be in breach of the convention.  It will, of course, be a matter for the judge in an individual case to decide on the evidence that is necessary to enable him or her to conclude that further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of an offence and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously.  We could not realistically include in legislation more precise guidelines which would deal with every eventuality in detail, but I am sure we would all accept that in exercising judicial discretion the Judiciary will take into account any implications that particular information might have in terms of prejudicing an ongoing investigation.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances the proposed amendments cannot be accepted for the reasons which I have already stated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In broad terms, the Minister of State's reply reflects the Minister's reply on the last occasion we dealt with this matter.  On that occasion I stated that drug traffickers do not have much respect for the European Convention on Human Rights.  They will not have read a word of that convention before plying their deadly trade.  Would the Government prefer if the applications to court were made <i>ex parte?</i><Col N="1092" /> Would the Garda and others investigating drug trafficking offences prefer if applications were made <i>ex parte?</i>  Is the European Convention on Human Rights an obstacle to the proper prosecution of drug traffickers?  If that is the case, should we not take up the matter with the Council of Europe?  I am sure it was never envisaged that the European Convention on Human Rights would act as a shield for persons who seek to destroy a fabric of our society.  If that is the case, we should consider making an application to the Council of Europe in the hope that a Protocol or amendment could be made in these extraordinary circumstances.</P>

      <P>I understand Deputy Mulcahy's point, but the people with whom this Bill will deal have no concern for human rights and would laugh at the mention of a European Convention on Human Rights.  We must have confidence that our courts will be objective and sensitive to what the Garda is doing to ensure the full facts are obtained in terms of drug trafficking.  If Senator Mulcahy's amendment is passed it would be misused by certain sections to undermine the work the Garda is doing in this area.</P>
      <P>We must ensure the proposals are workable and transparent and that they do not impinge on the European Convention on Human Rights.  We have signed this convention and we must adopt a positive approach to it.  Involvement by the courts in deciding that further detention should take place will not inhibit the Garda in progressing its investigations into drug arch criminals &mdash; as I call them.  If we have confidence in our courts we should support the views of the European convention and accept the Bill as it stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention of the Government to do precisely that suggested by the Senators &mdash; to meet head on the very serious threat to society from the activities of people involved in the importation and distribution of drugs; because of the magnitude of the <Col N="1093" /> fortunes they make, those people are a great threat to society.  In view of the Government's intention to tackle the problem head on, it is essential that legislative changes made are constitutional and come within the parameters of European law.  If, for instance, a case was brought before the European Court of Human Rights, it would bring the law into disrepute and would hinder the Government in its efforts against the drug barons.</P>
      <P>In recent years we have witnessed an increase in the activities of those involved in drug trafficking and in the extent to which they circumnavigate the law.  Those involved in such activities must not be given the opportunity to circumvent the legislation.  The combined efforts of everyone involved will be required to ensure the legislation has the maximum impact on those for whom it is intended.  I am sure that is the Senator's intention in moving the amendment, as it is the Government's intention.  It is our advice that the inclusion of the amendments might create an advantage for those whom we seek to dispossess and for that reason I cannot accept them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2(2)(d) provides that a direction given by a chief superintendent under paragraph (b) or (c), that is, a direction for the extension for periods of detention, may be given orally or in writing and, if given orally, shall be recorded in writing as soon as practicable. Paragraphs (e) and (f) further provide that details of the date and time when the direction was given as well as the name and rank of the officer who gave it and the fact that he or she had reasonable grounds for believing that the further detention was necessary for the proper investigation of the offence, will be recorded and attached to, and form part of, the custody record of the person detained.</P>
      <P>This amendment provides that where a direction is given orally it shall be confirmed in writing within 12 hours of it being given rather than as soon as practicable. Obviously it is desirable that a written record should exist as quickly as possible, but the setting of a 12 hour limit would be to some extent arbitrary and a dilution of the protection already in the Bill, which provides that the direction must be given in writing as soon as it is possible to do so.  The effect of the amendment would remove the requirement to provide written confirmation as soon as possible if that is within 12 hours of the direction being given.  The amendment would weaken rather than strengthen the Bill; consequently it is not acceptable.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(b) (i) The Minister may make regulations for the treatment of persons detained pursuant to this section, whether in a Garda station or in a place of detention.</P>
      <P>(ii) Such regulations shall include provision for the assignment to a member of the Garda Síochána (not being a member who was involved in the arrest of the person) of responsibility for overseeing the application of the regulations in respect of that person, without prejudice to the responsibilities and duties of any other member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>(iii) Such regulations shall provide for the making of an audiovisual record of any interview between a person detained pursuant to this section and a member or members of the Garda Síochána, and of any physical examination of such person.</P>
      <P>(iv) Such regulations shall provide for the provision, to a person detained pursuant to this subsection, of access to a solicitor.</P>
      <P>(v) Such regulations shall provide for the provision of medical treatment for persons detained pursuant to this section who have, or who appear to have, a physical dependence on controlled substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> (vi) A failure on the part of any member of an Garda Síochána to observe any provision of such regulations shall not of itself render that member liable to any civil or criminal proceedings or of itself affect the lawfulness of the custody of the detained person or the admissibility in evidence of any statement made by him or her.</P>
    <P>(vii) A failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall render him liable to any disciplinary proceedings.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats fully support this Bill which proposes major changes in periods of detention.  One of the concerns raised is that, because of the increased powers of detention, safeguards should be introduced and the conditions under which a person is detained must be carefully considered. The Minister stated that the regulations made under the 1984 Act for the detention of persons for questioning will equally be applied in terms of the increased periods of detention under this Bill.</P>
    <P>My party believes that regulations in respect of the 12 hour detention provision under the 1984 Act and those applying to detention under section 2 of this Bill in a Garda station or place of detention are not the same because of the increased period of detention.  It is necessary to deal with contingencies which might arise in respect of seven days' detention and this is the purpose of this amendment.  For example, how often will a detained person have access to his or her solicitor?  What happens if a person detained under section 2 of this Bill is a drug addict suffering from withdrawal symptoms and is somebody who would be likely to confess to anything in order to get a fix?  There is no provision under this Bill for the videotaping of interviews while persons are being interrogated.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the fact that the Government has accepted a curtailment on the absolute right to silence in drug <Col N="1097" /> trafficking cases but if we are making these changes in the law it is very important that the Government introduces corresponding safeguards, not just from the point of view of civil liberties but also from the Garda point of view. People in custody can allege that they have been abused and if interviews were recorded on video we would have an independent reference.  In many cases people have injured themselves and have then alleged that these injuries were inflicted by gardaí and that confessions were obtained by force.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that while this Bill was passing through the other House the safeguards proposed to balance the extended powers this Bill gives the Garda and the extended powers of detention it contains were not accepted. Provision for videotaping has been in force since the 1984 legislation was introduced and it is my understanding that a pilot project is being carried out at the moment, but a delay of 12 years between the introduction of legislation and its implementation is unacceptable. It is unacceptable that safeguards cannot be put in place to balance the introduction of measures which we all support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considerable sympathy with this amendment but I am not in a position to support it.  As far as I am aware Garda custody regulations are already in place.  It is a while since I accepted my last criminal brief but as far as I recall the Garda custody regulations apply to anybody taken into any Garda station once arrested.  I have sympathy for this amendment because, as Senator Honan has correctly said, a detention period of seven days is new in our criminal law.  Safeguards are already built into the system whereby the accused or his or her legal representatives will come before the court on one or more occasions before the seven day period is up and if a prisoner is being ill treated, his or her legal advisers have an opportunity to inform the judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tend to go overboard with regulations. It is possible to over-regulate <Col N="1098" /> and this is part of the problem with our criminal justice system.  On any visit to any court it is possible to see gardaí being put through the hoops by clever lawyers who point out that they have not complied with this or that technicality. Cases can be dismissed because of these technicalities and they are often incidental to the main subject at issue. Will we arrive at a situation where it could become virtually impossible to secure a conviction?  If there are too many regulations it will be impossible for people to be detained legally in Garda stations.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with the amendment but I am worried &mdash; this is why I cannot support it &mdash; that gardaí would be afraid to do anything once a person was in detention for seven days.  That is no excuse for breaches of civil liberties; nobody is for a moment suggesting that gardaí have the right to assault prisoners or treat them in anything other than a very dignified fashion.  However, there are remedies available at civil law and before the courts under the seven day system and a remedy is available under the Garda Síochána custody regulations already in force.  We do not need any more regulations, we need to get on with convicting people who are pushing drugs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much merit in this amendment.  We have to consider the sort of people who are likely to be remanded for this length of time; seven days is a very long time.  We have not encountered this situation before so I tried to look at the type of people I thought would be taken into custody. I am sure the Minister is aware of what was described as Penrose's law.  In 1939 Penrose discussed the inverse relationship between the populations of mental institutions and of penal institutions.  Of course in this country we have been trying to close down our large mental institutions and treat people on a community and outpatient basis.  There are varying reports on the influence the closure of large mental institutions is having internationally on those who end <Col N="1099" /> up in prison but there is quite a bit of evidence coming forward to show that if long-term beds had been available, certain people might not have become involved in crime.</P>
      <P>The drugs problem is very serious. Colleagues of mine recently did a survey on psychiatric disease in Irish women prisoners and the figures that really worried me were those to do with remand prisoners.  These were the nearest I could get to what I thought would be the type of people we would be likely to be holding for these drug related offences.  Although only a few were in a seriously psychotic situation when they were examined by these doctors, the incidence of a past or present history of major psychiatric illness was much higher among remand prisoners, at 28 per cent, than among sentenced prisoners, at 18 per cent.</P>
      <P>This was a specific survey dealing with women prisoners and it is reckoned that women who become involved in crime are more likely to have psychiatric problems than men.  Over 50 per cent of women prisoners surveyed have these problems compared to just over 30 per cent of male prisoners.  However, we do not have many of the safeguards operating in England about transferring people to psychiatric hospitals as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>It may have been decided to put these women in Mountjoy Prison for their own good while they were being psychiatrically assessed before they came before the courts again, but under this legislation many suspects with psychiatric diseases will be in Garda stations or other places of detention and there is a lot of merit in Senator Honan's proposals regarding the regulations for their treatment, and specifically about the provision of medical treatment for persons detained who may have a physical dependence on controlled substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People on Ecstasy often think they can fly.  How reliable will their statements be without good audio-visual records, etc., of their interrogation?  We <Col N="1100" /> will not be dealing with major hardened criminals all the time &mdash; they manage to elude this kind of situation &mdash; but with people who are referred to by those involved in crime as being disposable because they are easily replaced.  If some of these people are removed from general circulation, they are easily replaced by their brothers, cousins, sisters or aunts.</P>
    <P>This psychiatrically vulnerable group, although criminals, are involved and many of them are dependent on drugs, particularly those involved in acquisitive crimes, such as shoplifting, passing stolen goods, etc.  All safeguards, for our benefit as well as theirs, should be put in place.</P>

      <P>Section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, provides that the Minister for Justice shall make regulations providing for the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations. Such regulations have been made in the treatment of persons in custody in Garda Síochána Stations (Regulations), 1987.  Those regulations will apply to persons detained under the present Bill and they already deal with many of the matters contained in this amendment, such as the role of the member in charge, access to a solicitor and medical treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of audio-visual recording of Garda interviews with persons detained at Garda stations, the position is as follows.  Provision was made in section 27 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, enabling the Minister for Justice to make regulations providing for the electronic recording of Garda interviews with suspects. In 1990, a committee established under the chairmanship of Judge Frank Martin to inquire into certain aspects of criminal procedure strongly recommended as a safeguard towards ensuring that inculpatory admission to the Garda Síochána are properly obtained and recorded and that the questioning of suspects takes place before an audio-visual recording device.  The committee also recommended that the audio-visual <Col N="1101" /> recording should, in the first instance, be introduced in selected Garda stations by way of a pilot scheme.</P>
    <P>This recommendation was accepted and in March 1993 a steering committee was established under the chairmanship of Circuit Court Judge Esmond Smith with representatives from the Attorney General's Office, the DPP's Office, the Law Society of Ireland, the Bar Council of Ireland, the Garda and the Department of Justice together with an expert in the field of electronic engineering. The steering committee was asked, for the purposes of establishing field trials, to make recommendations on the necessary features of such a scheme and having attained the Minister for Justice's agreement on the features of the pilot scheme, to arrange for the stringent monitoring of such a pilot scheme.</P>
    <P>It was also asked to arrange for an assessment of the operational cost of the scheme, the likely effects of audio and audio-visual recording on the criminal justice system as a whole and to identify the extent to which the pilot scheme shows that an effective and economical basis can be found for a national scheme.  It is to submit a report to the Minister on the outcome of such an assessment.</P>
    <P>After an initial research and planning phase, the steering committee presented an interim report in March 1994 which recommended that the questioning of suspects in Garda stations should take place before an audio-visual device. However, recognising the considerable cost involved and other time consuming factors, such as the selection and purchase of equipment and the provision of training, it also recommended that implementation should commence with the pilot scheme.  The committee's recommendations were accepted and it proceeded to establish a pilot scheme involving four selected Garda stations &mdash; the Bridewell in Dublin, Cork, Tallaght and Portlaoise.  The scheme commenced in Tallaght in May 1994 and was fully introduced at the other stations in April 1995.</P>
    <P>The committee decided that, to obviate <Col N="1102" /> the need for making of regulations under section 27 of the 1984 Act at that early stage, participation by detained persons in the scheme should be voluntary. However, this proved to be a problem as it turned out that only around 10 per cent of the persons detained had agreed to participate.  That in itself probably underlines the situation as practised and foreseen at present.  In these circumstances, the amendment is not deemed necessary or desirable, despite the cogent case put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but I do not accept it.  The 1987 regulations, which came from the 1984 Act, are not adequate to deal with periods of detention of up to seven days. We accept that these major provisions are a departure from anything in existing legislation and that they were introduced specifically to deal with drugs, the drug barons and our serious law and order problems.</P>
      <P>An Act was passed in 1984 and regulations were introduced in 1987.  A committee under the chairmanship of Judge Martin was set up in 1990 which recommended the audio-visual recording of interviews.  Another steering committee was set up in 1993.  Its 1994 interim report seemed to recommend the audio-visual recording of interviews but the cost was a consideration.  It is now 1996, 12 years after this Act was put in place, and we still do not have the procedures that could be implemented under it.</P>
      <P>We have also seen changes, since this Bill was introduced, between Committee and Report Stage in the other House.  On 18 June, the curtailment of the right to silence was rejected by this Government.  However, when Report Stage was going through on 2 July, this curtailment was accepted because of the changed circumstances in the country at the time and because the Minister and the Government felt the public wanted a response to what was happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it extraordinary that when we are curtailing the right to silence, we are afraid to insert safeguards.  I am not just talking about protecting the rights of the <Col N="1103" /> accused.  It is important to protect the public interest in this matter so that the Garda, the public and the authorities who will have to adjudicate on these matters will have an independent record of what happened when such an interrogation took place.  A trial might collapse because of insinuations of abuse by gardaí.  If we had independent records and recording, that could not happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry said that many of the people being taken into custody will be drug addicts.  Their state of mind, health, etc., will be obvious from the recording.  We are not talking about people at the top of these drug empires but addicts who are being used by the drug barons.  We should strike a balance. If we are introducing strong measures, which I support, justice should be done as well as seen to be done.  Otherwise we will regret the fact that we have not introduced these safeguards.</P>
    <P>It is a pity Senator Mulcahy cannot support this amendment, although his colleagues in the other House did.  Not alone do these measures have the support of the Fianna Fáil Party but it has the support of the Independents and Deputies from the Government benches. We all want a balance.  We want to introduce stringent measures but we also need safeguards so that we are not left open to criticism in the future as being seen to have rushed in and curtailed one side of the right to silence while not providing safeguards to protect not only the accused but also the Garda and the public.  I am sorry the Minister does not see it fit to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I am a great believer in judging society by how it treats its outcasts, I will again refer to drug addicts.  Treatment is specified in this legislation, but will drug addicts be expected to go cold turkey if they are remanded in these places of detention? Heroin addiction is no joke.  Addicts <Col N="1104" /> have a terrible physical as well as a psychological dependence on heroin. That is why they are in such an appalling mess in the first place.  They become involved in crime to feed their terrible habit.  Does the Minister have any specific proposals in mind, if they are not written into the Bill, on how these people will be treated?  At least if they are committed to prison they will get involved in an admittedly very brief detoxification programme.  There is nothing here to say someone can bring them in a fix.  Are we going to do anything for them while they are within the confines of the place of detention?  They could become increasingly ill while they are there and their witness could be considered less reliable.</P>

      <P>The people we are discussing are trafficking in drugs; they sell them to people who are victims of the drug culture.  After 48 hours, the lawyer of the accused can bring all aspects of the interrogation and the case to date in front of a judge.  There are provisions for checks and balances in the system. Of course, we would love to go the full way with regard to the proposal being made.  However, these are extraordinary times and it has been shown repeatedly over the last few weeks that we have to introduce measures which none of us would have tolerated years &mdash; or even months &mdash; ago.</P>
      <P>We now realise the extent of the problem and must take measures which we might not have supported in the past but which we must support now. However, there are checks to ensure that abuses do not take place; under section 2 the courts have an involvement at a reasonably early stage in the seven day detention period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to deal with the serious crime problem which everybody agrees exists and must be tackled.  The object of the exercise is to bring those people before the courts and, if they are found guilty, to incarcerate them for the regulatory period.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan referred to the Government's anxiety to respond quickly to the people.  Great stress was laid on the fact that there should be no dramatic or knee-jerk response, because that would be the weakest way to deal with this situation.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice repeatedly stated in the other House that it is imperative to ensure that whatever legislation is being contemplated at the moment should be seen to be effective and constitutional.  That is why it is necessary to refer to what the Senator said in her opening remarks.  It would be very misleading and wrong to assume that the legislation was inspired by a ground swell of opinion rather than dealing with a situation with which had to be dealt, and with which we are dealing.</P>
      <P>Access to solicitors and medical attention at all reasonable times is already provided for under the present custody regulations.  These regulations deal with detention for 48 hours under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, as well as the 12 hours detention under the 1984 Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also respectfully suggest that the committee of experts which has studied the situation in relation to audio-visual supervision, etc., is probably in the best position to make recommendations, although it has not done so yet.  Having given the committee a job to do, which responsibility it accepted seriously, I assume that the obvious thing is to await its final recommendations, which might or might not be in accordance with the suggestions set out in the Senator's amendment.  I already mentioned the low participation rates when the voluntary system was introduced. It is necessary to introduce the legislation in the form in which it is <Col N="1106" /> couched.  It is felt there are adequate protections there already.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, it is important that the legislation we introduce on a matter of this nature, which is likely to be tested many times in the courts, be constitutionally sound and stand up to the rigours of international statutes.  Notwithstanding all that, I take the point that we must ensure there are safeguards. However, do not forget that the safeguards will also apply to those who are not so vulnerable.</P>
    <P>It is a question of finely balancing the direction of the legislation and ensuring it takes account of the people to whom Senators referred &mdash; vulnerable drug addicts and those who might not be as able to speak for themselves as their richer overlords who have access to the highest paid legal opinion and have every intention of ensuring that every syllable of legislation targeted against them is questioned.  The legislation is considered to be the best which can be introduced in the circumstances, having regard to the need to protect people's human and civil rights while, at the same time, tackling the serious problem of organised crime and racketeering which has become the scourge of society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister of State's reassurance that the 1987 custody regulations apply to this Bill.  I had anticipated that; I am glad I can still remember the date of the custody regulations.  I have read those regulations on several occasions and I have gone through them in great detail. They are a very broadly based but detailed framework for the treatment of persons in custody.  They are very specific about hours of rest, food, water, access to solicitors, custody records and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many cases have been thrown out of court because some part of those custody regulations was not complied with. Non-compliance with custody regulations has been successfully used as a full defence and many serious criminal cases have had to be thrown out of court <Col N="1107" /> as a result; bringing in more custody regulations is going too far.  The good custody regulations we have are adequate.  It is time we got on with this and let the Garda do its job.</P>
    <P>The people want action and results.  If we are to reflect the mood of the people, we must make it clear that we do not want to tie the Garda Síochána up in knots when its members are trying to question suspects.  However, this must be achieved in a correct and humane way.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the tenor of Senator Henry's contribution.  I accept that I do not know many drug lords.  However, my impression of drug lords or barons is that they are never &ldquo;high&rdquo; or &ldquo;spaced out&rdquo; on hallucinogenic drugs.  These people appear to be cold, calculating and logical in their own perverted way and seem to have thought things out very well.  There is no particular need for special treatment facilities for accused drug traffickers.  As Senator Neville stated, this is a drug trafficking Bill; it is not a misuse of drugs Bill.  It is not intended that people who purchase drugs for their personal use will be subjected to a seven day detention order.  If they are, the Minister of State will agree that this would represent a gross misuse of the Bill.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I stated that section 11 is one of the most important in the Bill; it contains a clause calling for an annual review of the Bill.  In other words, sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will automatically expire every 12 months unless they are renewed by the Oireachtas.  If there is any evidence that the Garda have abused their powers under section 2, that matter will be brought before this House at the time of the annual review.</P>
    <P>I am entitled to engage in intellectual disagreements, even with my colleagues. They would be first to encourage me to do so.  No one wants to be hidebound or stifled.  We are trying to create a consensus toward an intellectual endeavour to obtain the best solution to deal with this problem.  We are attempting to do this in a unified way because recent tragic <Col N="1108" /> events have impelled us in that direction. The public will not tolerate differences for the sake of differences.  It wants action and results and is entitled to them.  For that reason I respectfully suggest that the proposed amendment be seriously reconsidered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State indicated that this matter was considered at great length and was not part of an immediate response to demands for action from the public.  The curtailment of the right to silence was voted down by the Government on 18 June when Committee Stage of this Bill was debated in the Lower House.  On Report Stage, however, the Minister accepted an amendment tabled by one of my party colleagues which advocated the curtailment of the right to silence. The safeguards we are proposing in the amendment before the House should be incorporated into the Bill because of that curtailment of the right to silence.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister of State's point regarding the constitutionality of the Bill, which is very important.  The Bill was very finely balanced to ensure its constitutionality.  I believe the safeguards proposed in amendment No. 4a would further enhance that constitutionality. I was also interested by the Minister of State's statement about awaiting the committee's final report. All the indications from the 1987 regulations, Judge Martin's original committee in 1990 and the interim report of the 1993 committee are that audio-visual recordings should be put in place.  The only concerns raised seem to relate to the cost involved.  The Minister of State indicated that, where audio-visual recordings were utilised, only 10 per cent of suspects volunteered to have their interviews recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed safeguards are important from the point of view of suspects, but they are equally important to protect the interests of the Garda Síochána and the public.  As already stated, only 10 per cent of suspects were interested in having their interviews video recorded.  In many cases allegations <Col N="1109" /> are made against the gardaí which can prove difficult to deal with when there is no video evidence to act as an independent record of what occurred during an interrogation. Therefore, these safeguards are very important and would improve the constitutionality of the Bill.  All the indications seem to be that audio-visual recording should be introduced.  This modern method was introduced in other countries and it is not satisfactory that our criminal justice system should remain in the dark ages.  If the facilities are available, they should be used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is taking a multi-faceted approach to the problem of drugs in this country.  This is essential. However, we should not fool ourselves that this Bill will facilitate the arrest of those who make most money from drug trafficking.  Such people will be apprehended under the freezing of assets Bill and legislation dealing with the powers of the Revenue Commissioners.  Those dealt with under the Bill before the House are people identified as &ldquo;mules&rdquo;; such individuals are also indelicately referred to &ldquo;stuffers&rdquo; and &ldquo;swallowers&rdquo; and it is they who will be subject to seven day periods of detention.</P>
      <P>It was correctly stated that the gardaí are extremely careful about the custody regulations because, if these are not strictly observed, the courts come down on the side of those being interviewed and have been seen to favour the civil rights of such individuals.  The Garda was extremely annoyed that good cases were lost due to any small infringement of the regulations.  I hope the Minister of State's and Senator Mulcahy's reassurances that the present regulations will be sufficient are correct and that Senator Honan's amendment is not needed.</P>

I have debated many Bills in this House and during my time as a Member of the Opposition, I considered it a positive step when a Minister did not accept an <Col N="1110" /> amendment on Committee Stage but gave an undertaking to reconsider the matter for Report Stage.  I felt I had influenced the system if a Minister did not accept an amendment on Committee Stage but introduced a similar amendment on Report Stage.  When in Opposition, I recognised that we lacked the support to force the issue.  During this debate, Senator Honan criticised the Government for doing exactly that with regard to the right to silence.  I do not understand why she feels it necessary to do so.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 47 to 52, and in page 9, lines 1 to 11, to delete subsections (1), (2) and (3) and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Section 2 of the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1988, is hereby amended by the insertion of the following subsections after subsection (8):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(9) An officer of the Customs and Excise in the course of exercising any power under this section of this Act, may ask a person any question provided that, if the officer is of the opinion that the person has committed or is committing any criminal offence in respect of which the officer is exercising a power under this Act, he shall inform the person&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  of his suspicion,</P>
      <P>(b)  that the person is not legally obliged to answer any questions put to him,</P>
      <P>(c)  that the answers given to any questions may be given in evidence in any prosecution brought against him.</P>
      <P>(10) Any questions put to a person and the answers, if any, given to those questions shall, as soon as is practicable, be recorded in writing by an officer of the Customs and Excise and read over to the person at the termination of the interview or as soon as is practicable, thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(11) Any failure by an officer of the Customs and Excise to observe the provisions of subsections (9) or (10) of this section, shall not of itself affect the lawfulness of the power being exercised by the officer or the admissibility in evidence of any statement or comment made by the person in respect of <Col N="1112" /> whom the power is being exercised.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that if we are going to get tough, let us get really tough.  One of the ways we can do that is to give those at the forefront of drug seizures, that is, Customs and Excise officers, powers to ask alleged drug traffickers questions without a garda being present.  The intention behind amendment No. 5 is to delete section 6 (1), (2) and (3) and to replace it with the wording contained in the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>The amendment states:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(9) An officer of the Customs and Excise in the course of exercising any power under this section of this Act, may ask a person any question provided that, if the officer is of the opinion that the person has committed or is committing any criminal offence in respect of which the officer is exercising a power under this Act, he shall inform the person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  of his suspicion,</P>
    <P>(b)  that the person is not legally obliged to answer any questions put to him,</P>
    <P>(c)  that the answers given to any questions may be given in evidence in any prosecution brought against him.</P>
    <P>The amendment also provides for the recording in writing of questions and answers.  This point was ably articulated by Deputy O'Donoghue in the Dáil.  I do not know why the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment.  I compliment the Government, the Garda and the Customs and Excise on the recent drug seizures.  In both instances, the Customs and Excise was very much involved, as it has been in the large seizures in the ports.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not say he cannot accept the amendment because he has received legal advice and that the amendment is not well drafted.  I must inform him that Fianna Fáil has excellent legal advice available to it, of which <Col N="1113" /> I am not part.  A team of legal experts has given advice on the drafting of this section.  It is frustrating when a Minister says the Attorney General has advised that an amendment is illegal, unconstitutional or badly drafted without providing the rationale behind the decision. While the Attorney General may be the adviser to the Government, he is not the adviser to the Oireachtas or to the Fianna Fáil Party.  We are entitled to put forward differing legal opinion and advice.  It is our opinion that this amendment is legal.  It would make it easier for Customs and Excise officers to question those they find at the scene of a drugs seizure.  If this amendment was accepted, it would allow for the successful prosecution of drug traffickers. I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there is adequate legal advice available to parties in both Houses.  I have the height of respect for the legal profession, although I am not a member of that august body.  The Senator was correct when he said the Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government.  He has a responsibility to point out the possibility of legislation being flawed. Legal expert opinion can be sought from many sources, all eminent. However, the ultimate test of legal opinion is in the courts and we must remember that sometimes it does not prevail, depending on its basis.</P>
      <P>There was no suggestion from any quarter that one opinion was inferior to another but the Attorney General has specific responsibilities.  On a number of occasions in the past year or two the Attorney General's opinion has proved to be correct when tested in the courts. That is not to say it will always happen, but I am sure it will again.  It is virtually impossible to anticipate the ultimate arbitration of legal opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seeks to delete section 6 (1), (2) and (3).  This would remove the provisions allowing Customs officers to be present at and to participate in the questioning of persons <Col N="1114" /> detained by the Garda.  The Senator's amendment provides for the amendment of section 2 of the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1988, with the purported aim of giving Customs officers additional powers to stop and question persons.  These are identical to the provisions in section 4 of the Private Members' Criminal Justice (Misuse of Drugs) Bill, 1996, introduced by Deputy O'Donoghue in the Dáil earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The amendment is not acceptable primarily because it goes beyond what is appropriate in the context of the Bill and would eliminate the sensible provisions which it contains dealing with Customs and Garda co-operation.  I assure the Senator that in devising its proposals for special organisational measures to be taken in tackling organised crime, the Government is prepared to bring forward any legislation conferring additional powers which may be required after time has elapsed.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this exercise is to have the maximum impact on those for whom the legislation is intended while at the same time providing for the protection of people's constitutional and human rights.  If we do not do that, we will bring our legislation into disrepute and this will weaken it and the thrust of our policy against those involved in drug trafficking. It is not in the interests of this House or society that the Government deviate from targeting individuals involved in drug trafficking.  The amendment is not acceptable for the reasons indicated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;(1) If a member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of Superintendent has reasonable grounds for believing that&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  a person is in possession, in contravention of the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, on any premises, of a controlled drug or any documents relating to the importation, possession or distribution of a controlled drug, and <Col N="1117" /> (b)  there is a serious risk that the controlled drug or document may be moved or destroyed if the premises is not searched immediately, and</P>
    <P>(c)  it is not practicable in the time available to make an application for a search warrant pursuant to section 8 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, or pursuant to section 3 of the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1988,</P>
    <P>such member of the Garda Síochána may issue a search warrant mentioned in subsection (2) of this section.</P>
    <P>(2) A search warrant issued under this section shall be expressed and operate to authorise a named member of the Garda Síochána, accompanied by such other members of the Garda Síochána as may be necessary, at any time within 3 hours of the time of issue of the warrant, to enter, if need be, by force the premises named in the warrant, to search the premises and any person found therein, to examine any substance or article found therein, to inspect any book, record or other document found therein and if there is reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence has been or is being committed under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984 in relation to a substance or article found on the premises or that a document so found, is a document of the class mentioned in subsection (1)(a) of this section or is a record or other document which the member has cause to believe to be a document which may be required as evidence in proceedings for an offence, to seize and detain the substance, article or document as the case may be.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with search warrants and is self-explanatory.  Section 8 (g) sets out details of a search warrant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> It is essential that where members of the Garda Síochána ascertain controlled drugs on a premises they should be able to move speedily.  The net effect of accepting this amendment would mean that gardaí would be empowered to issue a search warrant to carry out quick searches and would not have to make a court application for one.  I would like to hear the Minister's rationale on this matter if he intends to propose the amendment providing for the insertion of this new section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The issuing of search warrants is dealt with adequately in section 8.  Under that section a member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of superintendent, may issue a warrant if he or she is satisfied it is necessary for the proper investigation of a drug trafficking offence and that the circumstances of urgency giving rise to the need for the immediate issue of the warrant would render it impracticable to apply for a search warrant under section 26 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. It is a question of a time factor.</P>
      <P>The amendment is fairly similar to what is being proposed, but the criteria set out in section 8 represent the best approach to the issue.  In particular, the amendment would not appear to be confined to drug trafficking cases.  It might be used in cases of simple possession of a small quantity of drugs for personal use.  It seems to be right to confine the power to drug trafficking cases. The criteria set out in section 8 provide appropriate safeguards and operational flexibility for the gardaí.  I refer to the discussion on the previous amendment when concern was expressed as to whether sections might be seen to target a more vulnerable group in society, hence the reference in that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the amendment the lifetime of the warrant would expire after three hours whereas under the terms of section 8 the currency of the warrant would be 24 hours.  The three hours' time limit proposed in the amendment is too short and I would prefer to adhere to the 24 hour limit.  Any shortening of <Col N="1119" /> the period during which a warrant would be valid would tend to hinder the gardaí and prevent the new provision being truly effective.  Therefore, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This subsection provides that it will be an offence to obstruct or attempt to obstruct a Garda acting under the new section.  The penalty for such an offence, following summary conviction, will be a fine of up to £1,000. This penalty is only in respect of the offence of obstruction or attempted obstruction.

In the case of renewal of licences, in circumstances in which parties may have committed offences in premises and so on, has any consideration been given to allowing such evidence at the renewal date?  No doubt the Garda are aware of venues in which drugs are &ldquo;trafficked&rdquo; leading to potential death.  The owners of dance halls, discos or other such places of entertainment <Col N="1121" /> must be held comprehensively responsible for them.  It is our fervent hope that all such people will accept their responsibility and assist the Garda in detecting such drug pushers. However, if there are doubts about such occurrences I hope that such evidence will be admitted at the date of renewal of licences and that judges will respond positively by refusing licence renewal.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 10, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&mdash;(1) At the trial on indictment of any person over the age of 16 for a drug trafficking offence the following provisions of this section shall apply unless he or she pleads guilty, except that subsection (2) shall not apply if</P>
      <P>(a)  the court holds that there is no case to answer, or</P>
      <P>(b)  before any evidence is called for the defence, the accused, or counsel or a solicitor representing him or her, informs the court that the accused will be giving evidence, or</P>
      <P>(c)  it appears to the court that the physical or mental condition of the accused or other mental condition or other substantial reason makes it undesirable or unfair for him to be called upon to give evidence.</P>
      <P>(2) Before any evidence is called for the defence, the court shall tell the accused that he may be called upon by the prosecution to give evidence in his own defence and shall tell him in ordinary language what the effect of this section will be if, when so called upon, he refuses to be sworn; and the court may, unless it considers it oppressive or unfair, require the accused to give evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> (3) If the accused</P>
    <P>(a)  after being called upon by the court to give evidence in pursuance of this section, or after he or she or counsel or a solicitor representing him or her has informed the court that he or she will be giving evidence, refuses to be sworn, or</P>
    <P>(b) having been sworn, without good cause refuses to answer any question,</P>
    <P>the court or jury, in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw such inference from the refusal as appears proper; and the refusal may, on the basis of such inference, be treated as, or as capable of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence given against the accused.</P>
    <P>(4) Nothing in this section shall be taken to render the accused compellable to give evidence on his own behalf, and he shall accordingly not be guilty of contempt of court by reason of a refusal in the circumstances described in subsection (3) above.</P>
    <P>(5) For the purposes of this section a person who, having been sworn, refuses to answer any question shall be taken to do so without good cause unless</P>
    <P>(a)  he is entitled to refuse to answer the question on the ground of privilege, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the court in the exercise of its general discretion excuses him from answering it.</P>
    <P>(6) Section 1(b) of the Criminal Justice (Evidence) Act, 1924 shall not apply in any case where the provisions of this section apply.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At the end of a prosecution case, when the State will have presented all its evidence against the accused and unless the accused is entitled to a direction on the <Col N="1124" /> grounds of insufficient evidence, this amendment provides that a judge must inquire whether the accused proposes to participate in his or her trial.  If the accused, having been called upon by the court to give evidence, fails to do so, the court or jury is permitted to draw an adverse inference.  This amendment takes account of the fact that, because of youth, incapacity or a physical or mental condition, such a decision might be unfair to the accused.</P>
    <P>My party tabled two Committee Stage amendments on the right to silence in the Dáil.  The Minister tabled an amendment which encompassed one of these.  Is it inconsistent to allow a guilty inference to be drawn when somebody produces a new defence at the last minute?  On the other hand, if an inference is not allowed to be drawn, if an accused does not give evidence at his or her trial, the procedure outlined in my amendment, would apply and is already in force in Northern Ireland, arising from the 1973 report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee in England, from which the Minister's amendment emanated.  Perhaps the Minister would explain this inconsistency?  It does not make sense to amend the law to allow a guilty inference be drawn against a person who produces some defence and makes some contribution to his or her trial while, at the same time, allow none to be drawn in the case of another person who effectively remains dumb throughout his or her trial.  I am not proposing that an accused should be forced to give evidence or suggesting that he or she be deemed to be in contempt of court by failure to produce evidence or participate in his or her trial.  Nonetheless, it is common sense to allow a court and a jury to draw its conclusions from the failure of an accused to participate in the trial proceedings.</P>
    <P>The safeguards incorporated in my first amendment would allay the concerns of many people at the curtailment of the right to silence of an accused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>While having a large degree of sympathy with this amendment, <Col N="1125" /> I must revert to a word that has gained unfortunate currency due to recent events, that is, &ldquo;untouchable&rdquo;. There is a huge amount of frustration that certain people who are regarded as &ldquo;untouchable&rdquo; seem to be outside the grasp of the criminal justice system and, all of a sudden, we are exercising ourselves to see how such people can be brought within its ambit.</P>
      <P>We do not have an inquisitorial system of justice.  We have what is referred to as an adversarial system.  In other words, somebody puts up a case and somebody else puts up a contrary case and a judge or a jury decides on it. There is a very strong case to be made for making a substantial alteration to the structure of the criminal justice system in so far as it relates to organised criminals and drug traffickers to allow for some sort of inquisitorial system. The United States of America has such a system where the district attorney who has seisin of a case will investigate and, after such investigations, bring his case before the grand jury &mdash; the district attorney is both prosecutor and investigator.</P>
      <P>What is clear is that in drug trafficking cases and in organised crime cases, of which there do not appear to have been very many in Ireland, our criminal justice system does not seem to have worked well, and there is a feeling abroad that it is because people are using or, in a sense, abusing the right to silence to protect themselves from the scrutiny of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no more fundamental safeguard in any criminal justice system than the right to silence.  In America it is referred to as the Fifth Amendment. A person can refuse to say anything because he has the right not to incriminate himself.  The wording in this Bill relating to the change in the right to silence is a limited intrusion into that right but, because it is limited, I am of the opinion that it is all that should be supported at this stage.  As the Minister explained, the intrusion into the right to silence already contained in the Bill only relates to corroboration and does <Col N="1126" /> not arise after an accused person has been charged.  There is, therefore, a very big difference between having a right to silence before one is charged and having an absolute right to silence after one is charged.</P>
    <P>It is frustrating when somebody who is accused of a crime does not give their side of the story.  The most remarkable example of that in recent times was the O.J. Simpson case where only one side of the coin was presented and the entire world, it seems, was left guessing as to what Mr. Simpson's side of the story was.  His lawyers advised him that he did not have to incriminate himself.  He had that constitutional protection and he availed of it.  Anybody charged with any offence would find the right to silence, if advised to avail of it, to be a fundamental cornerstone of our protection in any criminal justice system.  If we were to fundamentally alter the right to silence we would also, perhaps, have to look at a related concept, the burden of proof, because if the burden of proof is on the State, it might make it much easier for the State if the right to silence were abolished in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am in sympathy with this amendment because it is trying to deal with the frustration that people feel when crime bosses come into court and do not say anything.  However, in amendment 7 (3) (b) it is stated: &ldquo;... the court or jury, in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw such inference from the refusal as appears proper;&rdquo;.  As I understand the law at the moment, no mention can be made to a jury of the fact that a person has decided to remain silent and the jury can make of it what it wants. However, I believe juries make up their own minds on this issue, no matter what a judge says.  If I am accused of a string of heinous crimes and decide not to answer them, I believe the jury will make up its own mind anyway, regardless of what a judge says.  In a sense what is sought to be achieved here is already implicitly done by juries.  Perhaps that is a little naive and most juries would indeed take the direction of the <Col N="1127" /> judge when the judge says they are not allowed to take any inference from the fact that the accused person has maintained his or her right to silence.</P>
    <P>My overall feeling about this proposed amendment is that if we change our system of justice it cannot be a piecemeal change.  This is proposing a radical change to the right to silence without adjusting the other pieces on the chessboard.  Those other pieces on the chessboard would be some sort of inquisitorial system where a district attorney would inquire into a crime in a situation where alleged drug traffickers were forced to make statements, with their lawyers present, in the course of such an investigation.  If my reading of the amendment is correct, here we are talking about it in a trial context which is very different; we are pointing out to a jury that a person has decided not to incriminate himself and the jury can take whatever message it wants from that.</P>
    <P>I have much sympathy with this amendment, but I am a little worried about it for the reasons I have stated, and my mind will eventually be made up according to the calibre of the Minister's argument against it.</P>

      <P>I am not proposing that the accused should be forced to give evidence at his trial.  Nor am I saying that the accused should be held in contempt for refusing to participate in the trial. All I am saying is that it is common sense to allow a court or jury to draw their own conclusions from the accused persons's failure to participate.  Senator Mulcahy has said that the jury probably does that anyway.  However, the law at the moment, under the Criminal Justice Act, 1924, modified by the 1984 Act, is that no mention can ever be made by prosecuting counsel of the failure of the accused person to give evidence, and the judge is obliged to warn the jury not to draw an inference from the failure of the accused to give evidence at a trial. All I am saying is that the jury could draw its own conclusions.  The amendment <Col N="1128" /> does not propose that drug barons would be forced, in the presence of their solicitors, to answer questions.  It just proposes that a jury could draw an inference from the failure of the accused person to participate in the trial.</P>

I think the Senator said that something like this was in place in Northern Ireland, and there are other jurisdictions which are different from ours.  How effective is that deemed to be?  That is a general question.</P>
      <P>I have a very specific question concerning amendment No. 7; section (10) (3):</P>

      <P>Is it possible to think of a situation where the accused may indeed be guilty of something but may also have a number of charges against him of which he is not guilty?  If he opens his mouth and tries to refute some charges but does not address another that, in effect, will incriminate him.  There is the phrase which refers to the corroboration of any evidence given against the accused.  I do not wish to strengthen the hand of the accused in these circumstances but I can see where false or invalid evidence could come to be accepted as valid if the right of silence was interpreted in a particular way.</P>

      <P>This matter has been debated both inside and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas over a long period.  We have to be particularly cautious in this area because of constitutional requirements.  We referred earlier this afternoon to those who would <Col N="1129" /> be vulnerable, not the drug barons but their minions, and how they would be treated by this legislation.  In this section I argued that the most likely victims of drawing a conclusion on the basis of using the right to silence would be the minions as opposed to the barons.  I presume that the drug traffickers, the people who make their livelihood from trafficking in drugs and other people's misery, are capable of having the right to silence removed and actually going into court and winning an argument if there is not sufficient evidence to support the charge in the first instance. There could be a danger of too much emphasis being placed on improving the case for the prosecution by removing the right to silence.  That is not necessarily the case in relation to drug barons. It might have the opposite effect and it might seriously militate against the minions referred to earlier.  I would worry also about the impact it might have on a person who might not be deemed to be a good witness and who might, by virtue of being forced into a position of having to make a statement, incriminate himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is at issue in this amendment is the question of the person's silence in court.  There are provisions in Northern Ireland and in British legislation in relation to silence of the accused which were recently introduced.  If the accused chooses not to give evidence or, having been sworn without good cause, refuses to answer any question, the court or jury may draw such inferences as appear proper from the failure.  That is an interesting statement.  This targets both the accused who fails from the witness box to support positive defence and the accused who simply puts the prosecution to proof by challenging the credibility of the prosecution witnesses. A decision not to testify will not, however, be something that can be taken into account in determining whether there is a case to answer nor will it proper for the court to draw the inference that because the accused refused to give evidence in his or her defence, he or she was, therefore, guilty, <Col N="1130" /> although the inference might be drawn in the absence of evidence from the accused, for example, that there is no reasonable possibility of an innocent explanation to rebut the prosecution's evidence and may lead to the conclusion that the accused is, in fact, guilty.  That opens up an area which leaves a lot to conjecture and to the manner in which the court proceedings actually took place.  The circumstances, the atmosphere, etc., surrounding the hearing at the time could have an impact on the outcome.</P>
    <P>There is some uncertainty about the constitutionality of any further encroachment on the right to silence beyond what is already contained in section 7 taken together with the provisions of other enactments, such as the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  For example, the US Supreme Court has struck down the Californian law which permitted the court to make adverse comment on an accused's decision not to testify and also confirmed that the constitutional protection contained in the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination guaranteed the individual &ldquo;the right to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own free will whether during custodial interrogation or in court.&rdquo; There is no suggestion that the judgment would be followed here but it gives an indication of the complexities that arise and the thinking that is taking place in jurisdictions where the right to silence has been seriously eroded.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is keeping the question of the right to silence under review but does not propose that we go beyond the provisions of section 7 in relation to the right to silence at this stage.  As I said earlier, if it is deemed that further amendments to legislation are necessary at a later stage, that will be done.  Too great a dependence on the removal of the right to silence could have an adverse effect which, in turn, could bring the legislation we are introducing to improve the situation into contention.  Too dramatic a move in <Col N="1131" /> that direction at this time might set the legislation back, which is something we would not wish to do.</P>

      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy for the thrust of Senator Honan's amendment which attempts to improve the situation in regard to the right to silence.  That is commendable but I would be very worried if there was a question about its constitutionality. We do not want to see the Bill fail in the Supreme Court and have to go back to the drawing board.  We want to have the provisions of the Bill operational by the Garda as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I share Deputy Neville's concern.  My party supports this Bill fully and wants to see it enacted as quickly as possible.  I was pleased to hear the Minister is keeping the right to silence under constant review.  All Members are concerned about the difficulties in bringing major players in drug trafficking to justice and having them convicted by the courts and sent to prison. I accept the Minister's view point that the removal of the absolute right to silence could have an adverse effect and set the legislation back.  That was not what I intended.  In this amendment I am trying to improve the situation and make it easier to bring these people to justice.  I accept the Minister of State's view that the legislation should be evenly balanced so that it will not fail if it is referred to the Supreme Court.</P>

    <P>12.&mdash;(1)  The prosecutor shall cause <Col N="1132" /> the following documents to be served on the accused&mdash;</P>

    <P>(3)  The accused shall have the right to inspect all exhibits.</P>
    <P>(4)  A prosecutor may cause to be served on the accused and furnished to the court not later than 7 days before the date for trial, or if after 7 days, before the trial not without the leave of the court granted after hearing an application by the prosecutor grounded on affidavit setting out the reason why the evidence was not previously served, a further statement of the evidence to be given by any witness a statement of whose evidence has already been supplied.</P>
    <P>(5)  On the hearing of an application of the type mentioned in subsection (4) of this Act the court shall not grant leave to serve the further statement of evidence unless it is satisfied that there is a good and substantial reason as to why the evidence could not have been served earlier and that the interest of justice requires that the evidence be allowed.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Subsections (1), (2) and (3) of the Senator's amendment repeat subsections (1) to (3) of section 6 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  The <Col N="1133" /> effect of subsections (4) and (5) of the amendment would be to place an obligation on the prosecution to serve any further statement of the evidence to be given by any witness at least seven days prior to the date set for the trial.</P>
      <P>If the evidence is to be furnished less than seven days before the trial then it may only be served after the court has been satisfied that it could not have been done earlier and that the interests of justice require that the evidence be allowed.</P>
      <P>The question of reform of the preliminary examination in the District Court and related procedures is one which needs careful consideration.  The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, through its chairman, Mr. Justice Blaney, has been asked to look at the matter.  In particular he has been asked to review and have recommendations as soon as possible on the following: the preliminary examination procedure including the extent of the delay, if any, occasioned by the procedure; the circumstances in which an accused or the prosecution should be entitled to request sworn depositions and the question of restricting the right to apply to sworn depositions in cases where that option is exercised; the necessity for the current practice with respect to the preparation of books of evidence and the delays occasioned thereby and whether the preliminary examination procedure should be abolished or abolished and replaced with a different system; and any other aspects of the present practice and procedure governing the hearing of indictable offences in the District Court which give rise to unnecessary delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Senator will appreciate that, in advance of receiving the committee's expert view, any change in current procedures would not be appropriate. The Minister for Justice spoke with the chairman of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure recently and was assured that its views would be available shortly.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> In page 6, to delete, lines 49 to 52 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) (i)  The Minister may make regulations for the treatment of persons detained pursuant to this section, whether in a Garda station or in a place of detention.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Such regulations shall include provision for the assignment to a member of the Garda Síochána (not being a member who was involved in the arrest of the person) of responsibility for overseeing the application of the regulations in respect of that person, without prejudice to the responsibilities and duties of any other member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Such regulations shall provide for the making of an audiovisual record of any interview between a person detained pursuant to this section and a member or members of the Garda Síochána, and of any physical examination of such person.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Such regulations shall provide for the provision, to a person detained pursuant to this subsection, of access to a solicitor.</P>
    <P>(v)  Such regulations shall provide for the provision of medical treatment for persons detained pursuant to this section who have, or who appear to have, a physical dependence on controlled substances.</P>
    <P>(vi)  A failure on the part of any member of an Garda Síochána to observe any provision of such regulations shall not of itself render that member liable to any civil or criminal proceedings or of itself affect the lawfulness of the custody of the detained person or the admissibility in evidence of any statement made by him or her.</P>
    <P>(vii)  A failure on the part of any <Col N="1136" /> member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall render him liable to any disciplinany proceedings.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister of State said that the Martin committee was established in 1990 and that the steering committee established in 1993 published an interim report in 1994 recommending that video recording should be carried out on a pilot basis at four Garda stations.  He also stated that as only 10 per cent of accused persons in these cases volunteer to be the subject of video recordings it would be difficult for the committee to reach conclusions, but that its recommendations would be implemented as soon as they are published.  As only a small number of accused persons are volunteering to use the audio-visual equipment, it will be some time before the committee can reach conclusions.  It is unacceptable that the necessary safeguards are not inserted in the legislation.</P>

      <P>The official phrase used when a committee reports is that it will be &ldquo;acted upon&rdquo;. If the committee did not make a recommendation, there would not be anything to implement.  The correct phraseology is &ldquo;acted upon&rdquo;.  The points raised by the Senator are similar to those raised on Committee Stage.  Short cuts cannot be taken in this matter.  The best way to proceed is to allow the expert committee to complete the pilot scheme and make recommendations on the introduction of a general scheme.  Having set up the procedures to carry out a pilot scheme, it would be odd if the Minister decided not to-await the recommendations. It would also be a slight on those involved in the committee.  Therefore, the position will not be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to rehash the arguments made on Committee <Col N="1137" /> Stage.  Expert committee reports are usually a recipe for deferral.  This provision should be incorporated in this fundamental legislation.  Advances in technology must benefit all areas of State activity, including the criminal justice system.  It would be of assistance in ensuring that justice is not only done but is seen to be done.  It would remove any ambiguity as to what took place or was alleged to have taken place during interview.  For those reasons it is important that the amendments be included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am always concerned when I hear Ministers talk, as they frequently do, about the possibility of a measure being unconstitutional and saying that the Attorney General or another leading legal person has advised that an aspect of a Bill is unconstitutional and, therefore, amendments should not be made. I often wonder if that is a good basis for not pressing amendments.  Sometimes it is no harm to test the constitutionality of a Bill.  It is open to the President, if she sees fit, to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court even if we in our wisdom regard it as constitutional.  I recommend to the Minister that he consider this amendment sympathetically.  There is little difference in our views in terms of the principle involved; it is the exercise of the principle, that is, how we should proceed from here, that is at issue.  The Minister wishes to refer the matter to the expert committee whereas we would prefer to proceed with it because it is the right thing to do.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that only 10 per cent of those who were asked to volunteer did so.  I do not know what the implications of that will be, but it is an interesting statistic.  An expert committee has been set up to report on this matter.  We are introducing a new system which is a departure from the usual procedure and we must get it right. There were good reasons for the setting up of the expert group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Senator Dardis's point about the constitutionality of Bills, I agree with him to an extent.  Some very good Bills <Col N="1138" /> have been put through the House, often supported by all sides, but because a small part of the Bill was found unconstitutional the entire Bill went out the window.  Pages of positive improvements have fallen because one section was found unconstitutional.  The marital home Bill is one example.  We laboured for many weeks on that legislation and our advice was that it might be unconstitutional &mdash; Deputy Shatter referred to that matter in the Dáil.  One section was subsequently found to be unconstitutional and every other section also fell.</P>

For that reason I intend to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment arises because of the need to put beyond doubt the position where an accused may have failed to answer any question put by an officer of Customs and Excise who was participating in the questioning under regulations made under section 6. As drafted, section 7 refers to inferences which may be drawn where a person failed to mention certain facts during questioning by a member of the Garda Síochána or failed to mention those facts at certain other times spelled out in the section.  Since section 6 provides for participation, at the request of the Garda, of an officer of Customs and Excise in the questioning of a person detailed under the Bill, it is necessary to provide that the failure to answer questions put by that officer should carry the same potential consequences, without which the Bill would lose some of its intended effect.</P>

When debating legislation brought before the House last week by the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, on semi-State bodies and the ACC Bank, the words &ldquo;his&rdquo; and &ldquo;her&rdquo; arose in the Bill, and while I agree it is desirable to have both genders equally represented under the legislation, it makes for cumbersome reading.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish primarily to thank the Minister and the Minister of State who dealt with the Bill today.  The Minister of State will agree that the House co-operated to the best of its ability in passing this legislation. Broadly speaking, there is consensus throughout the Oireachtas that whatever legislative weapons are required by the forces of law and order to deal with those involved in drug trafficking will be made available.  I think the Minister will agree it is rare that such national consensus is arrived at.  In building on that consensus, any legislation required to deal with what we on this side of the House regard as a crisis will be supported.</P>
      <P>This Bill will send a clear signal to the drugs community that its behaviour is no longer tolerated or accepted in society.  This is a short but strong Bill.  It is a radical Bill in terms of powers of detention.  The slight curtailing of the right to silence deals only with the corroboration aspect.  New powers are given to the Customs and Excise in assisting the Garda Síochána and the Naval Service in the fight against drug trafficking which is a scourge and a menace.  However, when the people unite against the common foe it is very hard to defeat them.  I am very critical of the fact that in this debate there was nobody present from either the Labour Party or the Democratic Left.</P>

      <P>I did not mention them by name.  It has been a central argument of the Fianna Fáil party during this Government that the Labour Party and the Democratic Left have been dragging their heels on all aspects of reform of law affecting the fight against crime. <Col N="1142" /> The actions of those parties in relation to bail, prison reform and the prison building programme are a matter of public record.  I have been supportive of the Minister for Justice on every occasion on which she has come into this House but this is the first and only criminal justice legislation which this Minister has brought in since February 1995.</P>
      <P>It is a sad reflection on the Government that it has managed to produce only one short Bill of some 12 sections on criminal justice legislation.  That performance is not good enough; it smacks of complacency and lethargy.  This Government must get its act together and put in place the necessary legislative changes.  In regard to the related topic of Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill on the seizure and freezing of assets, I ask the Minister and the Government not to put down that Bill by arguing, in some cases spuriously, that the Bill might be unconstitutional or that certain sections of it might be improper.  It will be a very good Bill and will aid in the fight against crime.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  Fianna Fáil is proud to have played a constructive part in its passing, but unfortunately this Government retains its lamentable record on the new legislation it has put in place in the fight against crime and in particular the fight against drug trafficking. Having said that, however, I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I am not opposing the Bill.  Senator Mulcahy is right in one respect.  There is a consensus throughout the country and within the Houses that this legislation is urgent and necessary. There will always be arguments as to the detail and that is where the consensus might not always be evident.  It is in that spirit my party moved certain amendments.  They would have improved and strengthened the Bill, but they have not been accepted and we accept that as the democratic process in which we participate willingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation is only as good as the will to implement it.  It is my wish that this <Col N="1143" /> Bill is implemented rigorously and that those who have escaped justice and inflicted misery on so many people and rewarding themselves in the process will be brought to justice, convicted and serve long terms of imprisonment.  If the Bill achieves that objective it is to be welcomed.  No Government of any complexion would ever defeat the will of the people.  Our democratic process does not allow that.  It might be allowed in the short term but in the long term, if something contrary to the will of the people was done it would be reversed.  I hope the legislation will be effective.</P>

      <P>I welcome the passing of the Bill which is an important instrument in our fight against drug trafficking. The whole area of drugs is more complex than the area dealt with by this Bill and I welcome the proposals by the Minister for Justice to take care of this.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the statement that the Minister for Justice has not been active. She has been more active than any other Minister for Justice in my time in this House and I commend her for that.  For many years we discussed the removal of the right to silence to enable the Garda to bring to court information to the effect that people refused to answer reasonable questions and allow an inference to be taken from that.  At no time did anybody suggest it should be sufficient to ensure a conviction.  This Bill does not do that, it gives a signal to drug traffickers that their time is running out. This and other legislation will ensure that their regime comes to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with Senator Dardis when he says that the legislation is only as good as the will to implement it.  It is important that the resources are there for the Garda to implement this legislation. The Minister's recent announcement will ensure that more resources are provided to implement this and other necessary measures, but we must always ensure that adequate resources are available.  It will take some time for some of those resources to come on stream but we must ensure that everything <Col N="1144" /> is done as quickly as possible to ensure that these provisions to attack this cancer in society are implemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister is here on behalf of the Government.  My role is to represent all the parties of Government in this House.  I take issue with any reference by Senator Mulcahy to Senators from this side of the House not being present, because he was the only Senator to contribute from his party whereas several Senators from other parties contributed.</P>

      <P>I thank each Member who participated in discussing the Bill.  On behalf of the Minister for Justice, I acknowledge the support from all sides for the Bill responding to this serious situation.</P>
      <P>The necessity for this legislation is now obvious.  I reject the suggestion that the Government or any of its constituent bodies has failed.  All Government parties have clearly recognised the need to respond to the situation as it has arisen.  It is easy to say that if such legislation had been put in place five or six years ago, it would not now be necessary to respond in such rapid fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spent a great deal of time in Opposition and recall pointing out the necessity <Col N="1146" /> for changes in the law to tackle organised crime.  Criminal activity has developed to an unprecedented extent. Unless the Legislature takes account of this and acts accordingly, we will find ourselves at a disadvantage.  The drug barons and the criminals, who are highly organised and efficient, have thrown down the gauntlet before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the people and have clearly indicated their total disregard for the law.  It must be resolutely picked up by the Minister for Justice supported by all sides of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am glad to see the Houses of the Oireachtas have made a unified response to the atrocities that have taken place over the past number of years.  It is not in anybody's interest or to anyone's advantage to seek to gain from the recent tragic events for reasons of political expediency.  It would not be advantageous for anybody to attempt to exploit the situation for political gain.  I do not think anybody will do this.</P>
    <P>In this situation, a clear message should emanate from the Houses of the Oireachtas on behalf of our law abiding people that no quarter will be given to those who blatantly trample on the rights of our people and who indulge in nefarious activities which have ended in loss of life and caused grief to many people.</P>
    <P>Recent events have brought home to everybody the seriousness of ensuring we deal adequately with events as they arise.  More importantly, we might in future observe the need to make these changes at an earlier stage and consequently avoid the kind of situation that has unfolded before us in recent times.</P>
    <P>I thank every Member who contributed to the debate; their support is appreciated.  On behalf of me and the Minister for Justice, I thank Members for ensuring the smooth and safe passage of the Bill through the House.  I also thank the officials from the Department of Justice who kindly briefed me on this occasion.</P>

    <Title>National Standards Authority of Ireland Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Standards Authority of Ireland is responsible for establishing standards for a wide range of products and processes and for the certification of these standards.  This work is undertaken in direct co-operation with Irish industry together with international regulatory authorities under the auspices of the European Commission and other standards agencies which have a recognised worldwide remit.  In the interests of individual consumers and to facilitate growth in trade and commerce, the mutual recognition and achievement of established standards is an absolute essential in the contemporary world.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to establish the NSAI as an independent and autonomous agency and in so doing to underpin and enhance its role in the development and certification of a wide range of standards.  The need to establish this agency on a legally independent basis results from a requirement of the European Commission and the necessity for the NSAI to have an administrative structure which is seen to be independent of all other client agencies.  The current administrative and operational status of the NSAI, as a committee within the ambit of Forfás, is not in line with these requirements.  Accordingly, this legislation will give effect to the change in its status which my Department has been independently advised as being legally necessary to underpin the certification work undertaken by the NSAI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal purpose of standardisation is to facilitate trade and to establish common criteria for particular products or processes.  Standardisation seeks to achieve the protection of consumer interests by ensuring adequate and consistent quality of goods and services; <Col N="1148" /> economy of effort, materials and energy consumption in the production of goods or the provision of services; enhancement of public safety, health and protection of the environment and the elimination of technical barriers to trade.</P>
    <P>The agreement of all interested parties is essential if the benefits of standardisation are to be achieved.  The main advantages which agreed standards confer are the limitation of unnecessary variation in design and manufacturing procedures; giving more stability to production and marketing for the manufacturer and simplifying procurement for the purchaser; the interchangeability of component parts giving access to wider markets for the manufacturer and a choice of suppliers to the purchaser; improved communications and information exchange between the manufacturer and the purchaser by reference to standards documents containing agreed requirements for design and performance and increased consumer confidence that goods ordered will comply with the required criteria and that quality and reliability can be assured.</P>
    <P>The degree to which any product or process functions satisfactorily depends on the adequacy of the relevant standard specifications and the assurance of conformity to those standards.  This clearly is an increasingly important task and one which has been well delivered to date in this country by the NSAI.</P>
    <P>The NSAI currently operates as a semi-autonomous committee of Forfás and was established under section 10 of the Industrial Development Act, 1993. Its essential functions are the promulgation and formulation of standards on behalf of the Minister and the certification of products and processes that comply with these standards.  The NSAI was originally set up under section 17 of the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961, to assist and advise the board of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards in relation to standards.</P>
    <P>In this context the IIRS was required to formulate for the Minister, in accordance with his directions, specifications <Col N="1149" /> for such commodities, processes and practices as the Minister may from time to time request; with the consent of the Minister, to declare any specification so formulated to be a standard specification for the commodity process or practice to which it relates; to make recommendations to the Minister as to the provision and use of standard marks for commodities, processes and practices that conform to standard specifications and to test and analyse commodities intended for sale or for use by the public for the purpose of ensuring conformity with standard specifications, encouraging the standardisation of commodities, processes and practices or generally with the object of ascertaining for the public benefit, the characteristics of such commodities.</P>
    <P>The 1961 Act provided for the development of a body of standards by reference to existing national and international norms, provided for standards relating to public health and safety and contained powers to make these standards mandatory.  It also established an Irish standard mark scheme under which Irish manufacturers can, under licence from the NSAI, demonstrate that their product meets the performance and safety requirements of a particular standard relative to that product.</P>
    <P>In discharging its statutory functions, there are two broad categories of service which the NSAI provides &mdash; standards development and product and process certification.  These services have now become central in their significance and an important aspect in enhancing the competitiveness of our industry and services sectors.</P>
    <P>The standards development service provides industry with the opportunity of making an input into national, European and international standards.  It does this by means of its standards membership scheme and through its national consultative committees.  The standards membership scheme provides industry with up to date information on developments in relation to standards and technical regulations at national, <Col N="1150" /> European and international levels.  Frequent meetings are held throughout the country at which the standards and technical regulations are explained and individual manufacturers are invited to demonstrate the effects of standards and regulations on their businesses.  In addition, NSAI has established 14 consultative committees, each one dedicated to a particular business sector, in which requirements for individual standards or the Irish position in relation to European or international standard proposals is determined.</P>
    <P>The certification service operated by NSAI has had a dramatic impact in Ireland over the past five years.  The fact that over 1,300 Irish companies are now registered to the ISO 9000 series of standards for quality management systems indicates a clear recognition of the importance of developing and improving our management systems.  By the end of 1997 there will be over 2,000 Irish companies registered by NSAI.  Each company registered remains subject to a continuing programme of monitoring inspections for as long as its registration is valid.</P>
    <P>Product and process certification is also an important service provided by NSAI.  With increasing numbers of products being submitted for certification as complying with specified requirements in EU directives, demand for this service is expected to continue to grow.  A range of additional EU directives, which seek to reduce the barriers to international trade and give reality to the concept of a common market, are currently under discussion or in the process of being implemented.  Compliance with these requirements will involve continuing growth in the service of product certification provided by the NSAI.</P>
    <P>The elimination of technical barriers to trade was recognised by the European Union as a priority task in the programme for the completion of the Single Market.  Since the adoption by the Council of a new approach to technical harmonisation and standardisation in 1985, the harmonisation of European <Col N="1151" /> industrial standards addressed in EU technical legislation has become an essential instrument in achieving this objective.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the European Commission recognised that a major problem was being encountered in the development of regulations and directives designed to increase safety and remove barriers to trade across the whole of the European Union.  The difficulty specifically related to the inclusion of technical specifications in the text of the regulations and directives.  It was decided that they should only specify the essential requirements &mdash; quality, performance and safety &mdash; and devolve responsibility for the drafting of the relevant standards to the European standardisation bodies.  This freed up the process and several new approach directives have since been adopted covering a diverse range of products such as toys, machinery and medical devices.  The European standards bodies are given mandates to provide manufacturers of the products concerned with a set of technical specifications recognised in the directives as giving a presumption of conformity to the essential requirements.</P>
    <P>In a separate initiative, the Commission has given these harmonised European standards a prominent role in the opening up of public procurement markets.  Directives on public supplies and works, telecommunications, transport, energy and water supply require purchasing authorities to refer to national standards, which transpose European standards, with a view to ensuring that manufacturers in all member states have an equal chance to obtain public procurement contracts.  In more recent times the EU is negotiating mutual recognition agreements on standards with third countries, of which the US and Canada, New Zealand and Australia and Japan are examples.</P>
    <P>The object of these negotiations is to agree terms for mutual recognition in relation to technical specifications laid down in the respective markets of each country and to accept the common testing, <Col N="1152" /> certification and marking of products. This will reduce the need for, and cost of, duplicate testing and certification, will open up those markets and will facilitate trade growth between the countries in question.</P>
    <P>The NSAI has responded to this increasing role for standardisation.  As indicated, it has established 14 consultative committees bringing together interests in various industrial sectors with the objective of monitoring worldwide standards work continuously, identifying projects relevant to Ireland and developing Irish positions relating to them.  NSAI is also represented on the three European standardisation bodies. Each of these bodies has up to 5,000 standards projects under review at any one time.  NSAI is also represented on the two international standards organisations, the International Standards Organisation, ISO, and the International Electronics Commission, IEC.</P>
    <P>While the Authority develops national standards as required, the emphasis of its workload relates to the implementation of European and international standards.  In addition, NSAI publishes and distributes a wide range of Irish and international standards, guidebooks and catalogues.  It also publishes an annual guide to products and processes certified by NSAI during the year in question.  It provides an information and education service for industry relating to standards and regulations applying in various export markets.</P>
    <P>As a result of extensive consultation and planning by the European Commission, a more clearly defined European structure for testing and certification is evolving.  European standards setting out operating criteria for laboratories, certification and inspection bodies and accreditation bodies have been published as the EN5000 series &mdash; under European rules these must be transposed into national standards in each member state.  In addition, the Council of Ministers responsible for the internal market adopted a resolution endorsing the key issues of the Commission's document on a global approach to testing <Col N="1153" /> and certification.  These issues include the development of national accreditation structures, the promotion of the EN 29000 and EN 45000 series of standards relating to quality assurance systems and the operating criteria for laboratories and certification bodies respectively, and the establishment of the European Organisation for Testing and Certification.</P>
    <P>Accreditation involves giving national authorities the responsibility of assessing the abilities of test laboratories and certification bodies to properly carry out their tasks.  It formally recognises competence by means of third party expert technical assessment against agreed criteria.  It also involves regular surveillance and periodic reassessment. Accreditation in Ireland is carried out by Forfás through another autonomous committee, the National Accreditation Board, established under section 10 of the Industrial Development Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>A consequence of developments at European level is that national accreditation systems must comply with requirements for the establishment of notified bodies.  These are testing laboratories and certification/inspection bodies which are specifically designated by member states and notified to the European Commission to carry out the conformity assessment requirements as set out in the relevant directives.  A number of different conformity assessment procedures are set out in the directives.  They vary from simple product certification to product design, manufacturing procedures and quality system certification for complex products used, for example, in the medical field.</P>
    <P>A key requirement of notified bodies is that, apart from having the necessary technical competence, they should operate independently and impartially and have a separate legal identity.  They are expected to conform to operating, including organisational, criteria laid down in the EN 45000 series of standards. In our situation this requires that <Col N="1154" /> testing laboratories operated by Forbairt and NSAI certification procedures, and those of other bodies, be accredited within an independent and impartial system.  Only in this way can they comply with the 45000 series of standards.</P>
    <P>In summary, the objectives of the EN 45000 series of standards require that accreditation functions and certification functions be carried out by authorities which are absolutely independent of one another.  Accordingly, under present structures the National Accreditation Board and the National Standards Authority of Ireland &mdash; both of which now operate as committees of Forfás &mdash; do not meet the key operating and assessment criteria required by the EN 45000 series of standards for such bodies.  The National Accreditation Board cannot, in present circumstances, accredit NSAI as a certification body and the integrity of NSAI certificates, including the 1,300 ISO 9000 certificates already issued by them, could potentially be called into question in the continued absence of conformity with legal requirements relating to the operational independence of agencies.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the necessity for proper accreditation, I have had a number of different approaches examined, including a number put forward by the staff interests in NSAI.  I consulted my own legal advisers, the NSAI itself, the National Accreditation Board, the European Organisation for Tests and Certifications and the European Commission. The advice I received was that the setting up of an independent national standards body was necessary. I am, therefore, proposing that responsibility for the accreditation of the laboratories, certification bodies and inspection bodies should remain with Forfás, but that Forfás' responsibility for standardisation and certification matters, at present delegated to the NSAI as a committee of that agency, should be transferred to the NSAI as an independent statutory body under the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>Section 38 is a centrally important <Col N="1155" /> section of the Bill.  It deals with the transfer of staff to the new authority.  As a result of staff concerns regarding their future terms and conditions of employment, a complete redrafting of section 38 was undertaken on my instructions. Staff representatives requested that they remain as staff of Forfás and be seconded to the NSAI.  A fundamental issue was the reason for the establishment of NSAI as an independent body in the first place.  It must be accredited under the full terms and conditions attaching to a certification body as set out in the European standard EN 45012. This requires, <i>inter alia,</i> that staff will be independent in the discharge of their functions and, therefore, any control of staff in an operational sense on the part of Forfás would negate this requirement.</P>
    <P>Subsubsection (1)(a) and (b) of section 38 provides for the staffing of the authority, and subsection (1)(a) provides fully for the permanent staff to remain as staff of Forfás.  They are, however, required to fulfil all their functions in accordance with the directions of the NSAI.  This achieves the requirement of accreditation and meets staff interests.  Responsibility for all contract staff will transfer fully to the NSAI on the establishment day.  Subsection (2) of section 38 guarantees that the terms and conditions relating to tenure of both permanent and contract staff will be no less favourable than they are at present. Subsection (3) guarantees the rights of staff to apply for and be considered for promotion in either Forfás, Forbairt or IDA Ireland.  This will ensure that their promotion rights cannot be negatively affected by transferring to the authority. Subsections (4) and (5) give those necessary guarantees that their terms, conditions and scales of pay will not be lessened, and also provides that they can be increased in accordance with any collective agreement negotiated on behalf of the staff.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill, as amended by the Dáil, ensure fully that personnel in the NSAI cannot be disadvantaged <Col N="1156" /> in any way when, on the passage of this legislation, the agency is established as an autonomous legal entity and is functionally separate from Forfás.  In the course of our debate on the Report and Final Stages in the Dáil last week, Opposition spokespersons were gracious in accepting that I had positively addressed fundamental concerns which existed at the outset of consideration of this proposed legislation.  I did this by way of amendments which I put down in my own name, and through accepting a number of significant amendments proposed by the deputy leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy O'Rourke, and others.  There is now general agreement that, by reference to the constraints placed on me to effect change in the legal status of the NSAI by establishing it as an autonomous entity, these proposals are balanced and fair.  I have listened to the concerns of staff representatives and politicians and acted on them.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides the Minister with the right to appoint not more than 13 members to the board of the new authority.  The Bill follows the common international approach in requiring that only those persons who are already directly interested and involved in the standardisation process should be considered for representation on the board. It requires that the board comprise the widest range of interests possible, without any one section predominating.  It will thus be possible to ensure that consumer interests as well as safety experts will be represented, together with a range of interests of manufacturers and industrialists.  The chief executive officer will automatically become a member of the board.</P>
    <P>I believe the fullest involvement of staff at all levels of the organisation will enhance morale and increase efficiency. Workers should be facilitated in making the fullest contribution to the operations of the NSAI and be directly involved in its decision making processes. Accordingly, on my own initiative, I have made provision for representation of worker representatives on the <Col N="1157" /> board of the NSAI so that they can have the influence and authority to inform decisions, be they of an operational or policy nature.  Such worker representation has not been a feature of the NSAI board to date.  However, it will now give all employees the confidence to approach the organisational change which is in prospect with renewed assurance and the positive expectation of an even better working environment characterising the newly constituted NSAI.</P>
    <P>The autonomous establishment of the NSAI is a significant development.  It involves a necessary change in the structure and status of the organisation.  That change will enhance its role and ensure that an awareness of the importance of standards and their certification is further profiled nationally and internationally. It will bring the best out of the organisation and ensure its future prosperity through the most effective delivery of its important national task.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the main provisions of this Bill and the rationale which gave rise to its introduction.  It is not a contentious piece of legislation and has been refined and improved on the course of its passage through the Dáil. It is informed by an increasing focus on the part of the European Union and international agencies on the importance of establishing and achieving product and process standards.  That importance reflects the role which agreed and recognised standards now play in facilitating trade growth, economic development and employment creation.  When enacted, the legislation will reinforce the independence of the National Standards Authority of Ireland by making its certification and standards development services totally independent of other agencies, charged with delivering different tasks.</P>
    <P>The role of standards and their certification is central to the whole process of economic development.  This legislation will put the NSAI on a very sound legal and administrative footing.  It is important to do this quickly.  I commend the Bill with confidence to the Seanad <Col N="1158" /> and look forward to constructive and informative debate on its provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister of State on its introduction.  The Bill is overdue because it is almost 35 years since the industrial research and standards legislation was passed by the Oireachtas. While it served the economy well in the past, it is time the legislation was modernised because of changes in the thrust of economic development in recent years.  I was very critical of the complex and convoluted construction of the last Bill the Minister of State brought before this House.  However, I compliment him on this occasion because he has clearly set out the objectives of the authority and defined the functions of the board, the chief executive and the administration. The Bill is a very neat piece of legislation and has been well prepared by the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>In relation to the title of the Bill, the National Standards Authority of Ireland Bill, I would suggest that a more user-friendly title be found.  CERT would be an ideal name, but this has already been applied to the hotel and training authority legislation.  However, something of that nature would be advantageous in terms of having an effective title which could be easily distinguished.  I am frequently confused by the NSAI and NASA &mdash; the North American Space Agency.  The NSAI will be involved in international business and, as the development of high technology in Ireland gathers pace and accelerates, perhaps it is time to consider an alternative title.  I offer the title CERT as a case in point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the legislation which is designed to establish the independent statutory body under the control of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. It is proposed to transfer the functions relating to standards and certification from Forfás to the new Authority.  Section 7 specifies much of what is being attempted in this regard. The Authority's main function will be to promote, foster and encourage the use <Col N="1159" /> of standards and specifications as a means for improving the technical processes and methods used by industries within the State.  Setting down an Irish standards specification, supervising the use of standard marks and related issues are very laudable and important functions of the new authority.  I believe the establishment of the new Authority is a timely event.  I am glad the Government and the Minister used a specific statutory framework to enable work which needs to be done to be undertaken in an efficient way.  It will be distinguishable from other agencies.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years there have been changes in the legislation dealing with industrial promotion.  The Industrial Development Authority was broken up and Forfás, Forbairt and IDA Ireland were established.  We also have agencies like the Shannon development company and the other development organisations.  Business was frustrated by the changes in terms of which agency was responsible for what function.  By identifying an authority which will deal with this area of responsibility which, in many respects, is highly specialised and complex, the Minister adopted the right approach which will result in significant changes and important benefits in terms of employment opportunities and prospects for improving the standard of goods and services.</P>
    <P>There has been a fairly dramatic increase in the number of innovations and inventions since the new legislation was put in place.  Close co-operation between the agencies and the new authority is necessary.  Will the Minister indicate the numbers involved in the transfer? Will the new authority include the National Accreditation Board, which is under Forfás?  Will it embody some of the functions of Forfás that relate to the activities of the new agency?</P>
    <P>I am critical of the lack of Government investment in science and technology over the past number of years. Since 1987 Exchequer funding for science and technology has dropped from <Col N="1160" /> about 87 per cent Government funding to approximately 65 or 68 per cent in 1995.  The science budget for 1995 was somewhere in the region of £750 million comprising £79 or £80 million in European regional development funding. There has been a substantial increase in the amount of earned income being devoted to the science and technology budget.  In 1987 earned income from science and technology was about £20 million. Since then it has increased to in excess of £155 million in 1995.  Taking into account the increase in earned income in science and technology and the availability of European regional development funding, State investment in this area is diminishing.  This is a retrograde step which this economy will live to regret.  We must give the necessary back-up to enable the economy to prosper and thrive, so that more employment opportunities can be created.</P>
    <P>I re-emphasise the point that where ERD funding is available and earned income increases substantially, the Government should match it.  Rather than diminishing its contribution to the science and technology budget, it should substantially increase it.  I make this point in the context of the legislation before us because it will give a further boost to the innovative and technology areas.  We should underline the necessity to provide funding, which is essential if innovation, science and technology are to continue to make a valuable contribution to the development of the economy and new jobs.</P>
    <P>Is it necessary to have 14 consultative committees?  A number of these committees will deal with European standards and international business and some will probably be set up overseas. Perhaps the Minister might see if it is possible to reduce the number of committees, although there may be a particular reason for this number.  The 14 consultative committees were proved for in the old legislation and they deal with specific areas.  However, with a new streamlined system, it should be possible to reduce the number.  By so doing. <Col N="1161" /> it will be possible to have a more rationalised and effective mechanism in place. If the Minister convinces me that they are necessary, I will not object.</P>
    <P>Some 911 new standards were registered in 1994 which brought the number to well over 3,000 for that year.  In addition, it was indicated that ISO, the national quality standard, was being availed of to a great degree here and that 325 companies were registered under the quality and management standards in 1994.  These new developments indicate enthusiasm among businesses, especially in high technology ones, to be registered.  There is an onus on the Government to provide back-up finances to enable this to be accelerated as this would have a substantial impact on jobs.</P>
    <P>The recent EU White Paper on Competitiveness and Employment brought home to us the impact the information society will have in future and the policies necessary to harness new technologies. Genetic engineering, biotechnology, new products and processes open up opportunities to create more dynamics in the industry and technology areas than in the past, particularly with the quality of graduates leaving our colleges and universities.  We are moving into a new era of economic activity based on high technology and information technology. We need to set down specific standards and guidelines and to enforce and monitor them.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with staffing.  What is the budget for this new authority? When establishing a new authority it is important to ensure it is given the necessary finances to deal with problems. I note the Minister for Finance will keep strict control over the budget and the number of staff.  Will the Minister indicate the number of staff involved and what the budget is likely to be?  As regards the grants which will be paid under the legislation, will the Minister of State indicate whether additional funding will be provided or will the budgets disbursed through the IDA and those provided under other legislation be reclassified and paid out <Col N="1162" /> under this legislation?  Will he indicate what additional resources will be provided to enable the new Authority to carry out its work?</P>
    <P>Will he clarify that it is proposed to update registers that are covered under existing legislation in so far as that is necessary?  Sections 24 and 25 deal with that.  Sections 25 and 26 are confusing and I ask him to explain what is involved and how the provisions in those sections differ from those in existing legislation.</P>
    <P>Under section 28 the Minister has power to make regulations.  I am not certain how the line of communication between Forfás and the new Authority will be maintained.  I presume they will work closely together, but it is not clear what the new arrangement will be and how it will work in practice.  The final sections deal with the financial implications involved and neither the Minister's speech nor the legislation indicate what resources will be provided to cover them.</P>
    <P>Some people working in this area are employed in the Glasnevin complex. When deciding the location of the headquarters of the new agency I strongly urge the Minister of State to consider decentralising it from Dublin.  A number of years ago decisions were made to establish new agencies or authorities outside Dublin because of the major increase in employment in the Dublin area and the necessity to decentralise. I strongly recommend that he consider setting it up in Shannon where a laboratory is in place in the premises of the former Industrial Research and Standards Authority where valuable work was done.  Will the Minister of State indicate the position regarding the transfer of laboratories and the volume of facilities that will be transferred to the new authority?</P>
    <P>This is excellent legislation.  The Minister of State has put his stamp on it, unlike the last Bill he introduced.  I am satisfied the Authority will carry out the work for which he has given it responsibility.</P>
    <P>I object to some matters which I will <Col N="1163" /> raise on Committee Stage.  I do not see why it is necessary to debar members of local authorities from membership of the board.  I do not disagree with Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas being debarred from it.  but I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the subsection that debars members of local authorities.  I welcome the legislation and we will support it fully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and his introduction of this legislation.  It is interesting to recall that in 1993 when Forfás, Forbairt and the IDA were set up I was sitting on the opposite side of the House and we were informed that this development might take place and that it would come on stream within a reasonable period. We spoke at length about the excellent work being done by a large number of companies which were being approved for the ISO 9000 certification.  The numbers are growing substantially and rapidly &mdash; there are 1,300 and that will shortly increase to 2,000.  The standards being achieved by these companies show that those involved in small, medium and large businesses want to be confident when promoting their products on world markets that they are producing goods of the highest quality. That certification has given people initiative.  Some people ranging from management to the junior on the shop floor in small companies have gone out of their way and worked extremely hard to achieve that certificate, which proves that those companies are producing goods of a standard comparable with the best in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth while and interesting that we are changing and updating a 1961 Act.  It takes a long time for things to change and we are taking a positive step.  The NSAI should be separate and should operate from its own buildings.  I do not agree with Senator Daly that the authority should be established in Shannon for the sake of being established there.  At every opportunity companies have located in Shannon to avail of tax <Col N="1164" /> concessions, etc.  when other counties would have welcomed such investment. I am not 100 per cent sure whether it is intended to relocate the authority outside Glasnevin.  I was in the Glasnevin complex recently and the size of the operation and the numbers employed are astonishing.  A good deal of excellent work is being done and great help is being given to companies around the country.</P>
    <P>I question the need for the number of committees that will be involved.  I accept a large range of topics across the spectrum of industry is being covered and it may be necessary to have those committees.  If that is the case, will the Minister of State outline the range of work that will be covered by them?  Will he indicate the number of staff that will be seconded to the Authority?  It is interesting that last week we were also passing legislation seconding staff from one organisation to another.  That happened because of the changes taking place and EU directives to which they have given rise which provide that we must identify different bodies on their merits.  Is it intended that the budget to cover the seconded staff will come out of the IDA, Forfás or Forbairt budgets? It appears that will be the case.  Is it intended that the Authority will charge for some of its work or will the State pay for the Authority's work in approving company standards?</P>
    <P>Having regard to the package involved and the introduction of legislation which provides that some elected members are not eligible for appointment to boards, I question why we should go down that road.  We discussed that matter four months ago when debating other legislation under which local authority members are not eligible for board membership.  I do not have a fixed view on whether they should be eligible for appointment, but a number of those members have done fine work on particular boards to which they were appointed.  I recommend that they take that work equally seriously.</P>
    <P>I hope Senators will co-operate in approving this Bill, which provides for <Col N="1165" /> the establishment of an independent agency to aid industries already satisfied with events over the past few years. Some three years have elapsed since this Bill was promised, another example of the slowly grinding wheels in drafting legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill rescinds previous legislation passed since I became a Senator.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly referred to the name of the new institute.  It is important that its name is pronounceable.  The &ldquo;State Institute for National Standards&rdquo;&mdash; which, when abbreviated, would emerges as &ldquo;SINS&rdquo;&mdash; is probably not suitable.  I congratulate the Minister on devising the name National Accreditation Board &mdash; NAB &mdash; which also sounds quite good but, even if we adhere to the NSAI, this Bill constitutes the second major revision of the Act amalgamating the old Industrial Development Authority and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, another unpronounceable abbreviated title.  Last year we passed a Bill restoring a number of powers to Forbairt and IDA Ireland, particularly that to hold property which, in the original legislation, had been vested in Forfás only when, if one listened very intently, in the background one could hear the sounds of empires quietly being rebuilt.  Now, with this Mark II, the National Standards Authority of Ireland is being respun as a separate body.  It is not an exaggeration to say that what I might describe as the original multimerger is beginning to fall apart. However, I do not necessarily see that as a bad thing.  There is no doubt that this new Authority should be a separate body or agency and clearly seen as independent of other State agencies that may have a particular axe to grind. From that point of view, I congratulate the Minister on its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This contingency could and should have been foreseen when Forfás and its subsidiary agencies, were established but, in the unholy rush to amalgamate everything into one super agency, this <Col N="1166" /> blindingly obvious point was overlooked. The omission is now being rectified.</P>
    <P>In the spirit of this Bill, I make two suggestions on how the original super agency might be refined even further. My first concerns the place of science: note, I did not say &ldquo;science and technology&rdquo; because there is a clear distinction to be drawn between the two which has often been blurred in the past to the detriment of science.  It is appropriate that responsibility for technology lies with Forbairt, as part of its remit is clearly to encourage the greatest possible interplay between industrial development and technology.  Irish-owned industry has always been under-strength from the point of view of technology, which is demonstrated by our very poor level of investment in research and development.</P>
    <P>There is more to science than that. There is need for basic, pure scientific research in addition to the type of applied research with direct application to industrial development.  One must have both.  Pure research is like the duck's legs beneath the water and applied research is like its feathers above water.  The point is that one cannot buy the top part of the duck only, without which it has no driving power.</P>
    <P>As matters stand, Forbairt is responsible for promoting our national science effort.  It is not a job appropriate to that agency or one in which it excels and I do not believe it is a task the agency itself particularly wants.  In the next revision of the great Forfás empire, the Minister should define a separate niche for science, remaining within the Forfás umbrella but definitely outside the aegis of Forbairt.</P>
    <P>The second revision is one I suggested at the time of the amalgamation of those agencies, as obvious as the need that gave rise to this Bill, but in the heat of the moment, it was again ignored; the absence of An Bord Tráchtála from the overall Forfás family.  To have the trade board separate from Forfás but reporting to a separate Minister flies in the face of common sense.  This has <Col N="1167" /> resulted in companies dealing with Forbairt on the one hand and An Bord Tráchtála on the other, both agencies singing from different hymn books, if not simultaneously in different churches.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that on the formation of the Government approximately 18 months ago, the opportunity was not taken to abolish the quite ridiculous Department of Trade and Tourism. Trade should be part of industrial development &mdash; there is no logic in any other arrangement &mdash; as tourism is more than sufficiently important to the future development of our economy to warrant a separate Government Department.</P>
    <P>While some of those points have been made before, I was anxious to stitch them into this debate.  Clearly this Bill is worthy of support.  There is a Japanese term &ldquo;<i>Kaizen</i>&rdquo; which means &ldquo;continuous improvement&rdquo;.  I welcome this Bill as evidence that the Government is ready to consider continuously revising the structure of existing State agencies that support industry.  I hope this process of continuous improvement will be maintained along the lines I outlined.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that this Bill will be passed without any difficulty because I do not perceive any great defect in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it from me to be the exception in not welcoming this Bill. Senators Daly and Quinn, without casting any reflection on my friend and colleague, Senator Farrelly, articulated many of my sentiments on the various provisions of this welcome Bill.</P>
      <P>In 1985 a first attempt was made to harmonise standards within the European Community, as it was then.  Why had we to await an EU directive before introducing this Bill?  As Senator Quinn correctly pointed out, it is astonishing that, within the period of his membership of this House, and the lifetime of this Seanad, two Bills were introduced, the provisions of which will have considerable impact on industrial development and promotion generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> When one examines in detail the former role of Forfás, its present and future one on the passage of this Bill, I am forced to inquire of the Minister, what its <i>raison d'être</i> is because it certainly appears to me to be a case of empire building.  I cannot see what function it should continue to have when its chief executive, in his statement in its 1994 Annual Report said:</P>
    <P>Forfás is the body in which the State's legal powers for industrial promotion and technology development have been vested under the 1993 Industrial Development Act...</P>
    <P>It is also the body through which powers are delegated for the promotion of indigenous industry and to IDA-Ireland for the promotion of inward investment as agents of Forfás.</P>
    <P>Yet when one examines the activities of Forfás in greater detail one finds, from its most recently available report in 1994, that it works closely with the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Forbairt and IDA-Ireland to bring new organisational structures into effective operation.</P>
    <P>The Strategic Management Initiative is already in place, a root and branch radical reform to improve Government efficiency.  On my reading of it, Forfás is involved in that with a Government Department.  They then go on to say &mdash; and this is the nub of my argument &mdash; that at present Forfás retains direct responsibility for a number of executive functions including the industrial land and property portfolio.</P>
    <P>We legislated to remove that from the remit of Forfás.  We are about to legislate to remove the National Standards Authority of Ireland from the ambit of Forfás.  We are now left with the third part of the trinity &mdash; legal responsibility for the portfolio of State equity investments and the client firms of both Forbairt and IDA Ireland.  The report goes on to say these functions are currently under review.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might tell us <Col N="1169" /> what is the point of having a continuance of Forfás.  There was some disquiet when the original three Bills were introduced this House.  I am fully aware it was a Fianna Fáil-led Government that initiated the legislation, but that does not make it any more correct.  Members of my party decry all of the State agencies in existence, conveniently forgetting that we were probably responsible for setting up most of them.  This is a bugbear of mine in the context of county enterprise boards, Leader programmes, etc.  We are dealing with specific legislation, and perhaps the Minister can, quite correctly and technically, refrain from going down the road I have suggested. There is, perhaps, a need to reflect a little on what the continuing use of Forfás is now that its assets are being stripped.  On Senator Quinn's comment about empire building, this is empire building at its greatest, unless there is some other role for Forfás of which I am not aware.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Bill, I have perceived for many years, particularly in relation to electrical goods, perhaps even manufactured in Ireland but certainly manufactured by companies with Irish manufacturing bases, tabs denoting that they conform to British standards specifications.  Now we are setting up this new body, will the Irish standards logo be legally obligatory on all such labelling for domestic and industrial products?  If so, it would strike yet another blow for our sovereignty in the world markets.  In the context of monitoring this obligation, would there be any way of preventing goods circulating in this country from being labelled with marks from other countries?  Is the whole purpose of the legislation to harmonise all of the various marks across Europe, or must any goods circulating in this country specifically and exclusively have an Irish specification mark on it?  It is a rather technical area and I may be going down a different avenue to what the Minister suggested in his opening remarks on Second Stage.  It is just that I do not see why we should buy products here, especially if they are <Col N="1170" /> being made here even under licence by a subsidiary of an overseas company, that retain on their commercial labelling a standard specification mark other than one originating in this country.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly referred to staffing arrangements.  In association with him, I would ask the Minister to pursue that line of debate.  The Bill specifically states that all staff currently involved in the area of specifications and marks will be transferred.  How many will be transferred, what percentage of the existing Forfás staff the transfer will affect and how many will be left, apart from the board and the chief executive who seem to have nothing to do other than their legal obligation to oversee the equity investments of their two subsidiaries, IDA and Forbairt?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister envisage the new legislation resulting in an expansion of the existing workforce which is allowed under this Bill, and which would be another charge on the Exchequer?  I am not talking about the administrative structures but the practical structures on the shop floor.  Will one of the first acts of this new authority be to start employing more staff?  I am not against that in principle, but legislation such as this seems to result in job creation not just in the context of the appointment of board members but across a wide area.  We then find we have to change it, as we discussed earlier.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to harmonisation in the labelling of electrical goods.  Will this legislation also deal with the lack of harmonisation currently in the European Union in relation to, for example, electric plugs &mdash; on the Continent the plugs are round whereas ours are square.  I understand one of the reasons we have not followed the European model is that we are so exposed to the British market.  If my memory serves me right, the reason the British did not change was because of strong lobbying from electrical goods manufacturers in the UK who would have had to face very high financial losses had they been obliged to change.  There may also have been a question of compensation.  It <Col N="1171" /> seems ridiculous that we have to bring an electric plug with us whenever we go to visit the rest of the European Union when we are supposed to be Europeans.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister envisage this body being in the forefront of attempts currently under way to harmonise a wide range of areas on the domestic front?  I have in mind specifically television and the current debate about widescreen technology, about European and Japanese standards and whether the authority will be charged with furthering this process of harmonisation.</P>
    <P>As to the cost of implementation, I realise I am barking up the wrong tree and that this legislation will cost money because of the setting up of the authority, the board and the whole structure. However, what sometimes irritates me as a member of a local authority, is that the Government, the Executive, is responding to a European directive which they are legally obliged to implement, by proceeding with this legislation and including an appropriate amount of money in the Appropriations so that the taxpayer will take up the tab. However, whenever legislation is passed here as a result of an EU directive which requires local authorities to implement that directive the local authorities have to pick up the tab.</P>
    <P>One example that springs to mind relates to the Abattoirs Act where it became incumbent on each local authority to employ veterinary inspectors.  They could not seek resources from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to pay the extra staff everybody knew would be needed to implement the EU directive on abattoirs and, despite several motions from local authorities, including my own in Leitrim, the motions were kicked back from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to the local authorities telling them (a) they must implement this directive, (b) they must employ staff and (c) they must fund it out of their own resources.</P>
    <P>Funding is not a problem in this <Col N="1172" /> Government legislation.  Double standards appear to be in operation &mdash; excuse the pun &mdash; which is very unfair. I am not suggesting the Minister has got the answers today, but I make the point that with the increasing responsibility on local authorities to implement European directives, there is no recognition of the resulting financial difficulty facing them, yet they have to fund it out of their limited resources.</P>
    <P>I too draw the Minister's attention to the First Schedule.  First Schedule 2(2), states the board of the Authority shall consist of not more than 13 members.  I would have liked to see provision in the legislation for gender balance.  I have become a convert to the need for gender balance provisions in legislation, particularly after a meeting with our parliamentary colleagues from the Norwegian foreign affairs committee who are to the forefront in innovative legislation.  Legislative provisions on gender balance have had such an effect across the whole of Norwegian society that one Norwegian cited the example of the son of his colleague who is only six years of age asking, &ldquo;Can a boy become prime minister of Norway?&rdquo;.  I am not sure we will ever reach that situation but the point is well made.  I would like to have seen provision that the board shall consist of not more than 13 members, of which a certain number shall be women.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly spoke on the reference in the Second Schedule to local authority members.  There seems to be a notice stuck on a board in the parliamentary draftsman's office stating that when drafting legislation creating new boards they should make sure to include a section under the First Schedule stating that the local authority members are not to be included.  I do not understand the logic of it &mdash; it is treating elected members of local authorities with contempt. I cannot figure out the genesis of this idea.  Some individual in the &ldquo;permanent Government&rdquo;&mdash; as John Healy referred to our friends in the Civil Service &mdash; came up with it.  I am not sure that a Minister decided this was to be <Col N="1173" /> the norm.  It is in every Bill coming before both Houses of the Oireachtas. Like lemmings going over a cliff, what happens?  We vote it through on the nod and we do not even have a debate on it. Could somebody explain to me why the First Schedule section 2 (11) states: &ldquo;Board members shall not be members of a local authority within the meaning of the Local Government Act, 1941.&rdquo; We will have a situation from 1998 onwards that a Member of the Dáil or Seanad will not be eligible to become chairperson of a local authority. Nobody will challenge this legislative provision, but I believe it is unconstitutional that having been elected to a body one is precluded because of membership of another body from being chairman of that body.</P>
    <P>Area partnership boards, comprising representatives from State agencies and voluntary bodies, have been set up all over this country in the past six months. They are doing very valuable work.  The legislation setting up these boards specifically precludes members of local authorities from being members of area partnership boards, although county councillors are elected by the people to serve the area.  No wonder the general public is treating politics and politicians with contempt.  No wonder politicians, including Government Ministers, are sidelined.  No wonder we are seeing the effects of this river of cynicism that has infiltrated this country in the past few years and is now building up to a flood. If we have not respect for our institutions, how do we expect the general public to have it?  I have made this speech several times but I am repeating myself in the hope that somebody might end this nonsense.  Senator Daly and I will table an amendment to have this section deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome this Bill.  It is essential to have an autonomous authority setting standards in this country.  Until the Minster spoke, an aspect of the Bill about which I was very concerned was board membership. From the drift of the Bill and on reading <Col N="1174" /> the section regarding the board I formed the impression that the consumer was not being considered very often.  I wish Senator Quinn were here to support my assertion that most trade is consumer driven.  Whatever standards we set, it is absolutely vital that they are what the consumer wants.  If the consumer considers that the standards we have set are not sufficient, it is pointless having them.  I thought we would have learned that from the very costly mistake of the beef crisis.  When An Bord Bia was set up Senator Quinn and I urged that consumers should be represented on the board, but they were not.  However, amending legislation was recently introduced to have a consumer representative on the board.  This is essential.  The Minister of State indicated in his speech that consumers will be represented on this board.  I support Senator Mooney's proposals on achieving a gender balance whereby 40 per cent female representation would be maintained.  An enormous number of consumers are women; women do the shopping.  As Senator Mooney suggested, it is probably the women who will consider the dangers inherent in sockets and whether children will try to put their fingers or objects into the holes.  I am glad the Minister confirmed that consumers will be represented on the board and I hope that there will be a high number of consumer representatives.</P>
      <P>Sometimes we act as if industry will solve our problems, that if we give it its head, it will set the standard which will be all right.  It is important to remember that financial reward is very important to industry and they may set a standard that the consumer does not want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Consumer Association of Ireland has been consulted in the drafting of the Bill.  This worthwhile body deserves a great deal of support. Since it was established the Consumer Association of Ireland has received £3,000 in Government funding, which is very little.  It is supported entirely on voluntary funding, yet it publishes a very good magazine, <i>Consumer Choice.</i><Col N="1175" /> Portugal, Greece, Spain, Italy and Ireland are the only countries in the European Union that do not give financial support to consumer associations.  It is not that I want every voluntary organisation supported.  The Consumer Association of Ireland is an independent group.  Bodies such as the trade unions get money for education and so on.  IBEC, the industry body, is funded by its members but they can offset their contribution against tax.  The Consumer Association of Ireland is a voluntary body, funded from the after tax income of consumers.  The Consumer Association has joined ANEC, the European association of consumer associations. We are involved in SEN, which is very important.  SEN sets the European standards. We have to be careful that we do not take a blanket look at European standards and decide they are all right. To date we have judged ourselves against the British standards.  Industrial nations very often drive legislation and standards to suit an industry in their jurisdiction.  Now that we are in SEN we should try to take a leading role in setting standards.</P>
    <P>I will give an example which was brought to my attention recently regarding riding helmets.  The Minister will probably be aware of problems in the racing industry regarding standards for riding helmets.  Those in the horse industry have expressed concern regarding standards for helmets which appeared to be acceptable.  For example, I always thought the British standards were perfectly acceptable until I was told about a serious accident where standards obviously were not good enough.  The parents, who were very careful, ensured their child was wearing what they considered the best helmet.  The child was out riding and fell, the horse also fell and rolled on the child thus killing the child.  When the helmet was examined it was discovered it had no lateral stressing, although it had a safety standard on it, and no protection for the temples.  They tried to raise this matter with the National Standards <Col N="1176" /> Authority here but it had no interest or competence to deal with such a matter.  We should look specifically at consumer areas such as horse riding, which we promote for tourism purposes, to ensure that we as well as all other countries examine what standards will provide safety, not just standards, in some of our more important European neighbours and decide that their standards are acceptable.  Very often their standards are not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I wish the Authority well and hope it takes its work seriously because we could make an important contribution from the point of view of being consumers in respect of the standarisation required to be set up for products, services and so on, not only in this State but in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the legislation and I have no difficulty with it. There are a few aspects on which I would like to comment and make a few points.  It is important &mdash; and the Minister made the point in his introduction to the Bill &mdash; that the body is independent and autonomous.  That is critical.  I note some of the points made in respect of Forfás, Forbairt and so on.  It is important from the point of view of consumer confidence that a body which is responsible for setting standards and standardisation should have that degree of autonomy.  That is required under EN 45000 to conform to international requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that Ireland does not have something as readily identifiable as the British kitemark so that when consumers take a product from the shelf they know instantly from the accreditation mark it conforms to certain standards and that, therefore, they have a certain confidence in it.  In the past the British kitemark helped to achieve that degree of consumer confidence. Certain sections of the Bill deal with what companies may or may not do, in terms of initiatives and so on.  It is important that the consumer should know the standard is verifiable and that <Col N="1177" /> there is something on the product which allows him to have that degree of confidence. This is related in a curious way to the BSE issue &mdash; although we cannot put a kitemark on a pound of steak &mdash; in terms of food.  Commodities come within the ambit of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn made a point, with which I agree, about the sound in the background of empire building.  When we debated the Forfás-Forbairt legislation I was critical of creating more agencies and layer upon layer of agencies to the extent that everybody becomes totally confused about what agency is responsible for what.  Having said that I accept there is need for this body.  Senator Quinn had some difficulties about the acronym which might be used in respect of the body.  It struck me immediately it could be called NASI &mdash; the National Authority for Standards in Ireland but as that could lead to confusion it is better to leave it at the more cumbersome way designated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important to have standardisation to facilitate trade because, unquestionably, countries have used technical impediments to prevent trade between countries.  They have been used as devices for protection, particularly by some of our European partners &mdash; the French spring readily to mind.  All countries bear some culpability that they have, over time, used these technical impediments to trade to protect their own markets.  Under the World Trade Agreement that will become much more difficult.  It is important when we go to Germany, Italy or France and plug in our electrical appliances that they will work and that it will be same throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>I now want to say something contradictory. I do not know if I bored the Minister before about the European free range hen but even if I have I am prepared to do so again.  I visited a farm in County Cork a few years ago which, under the Leader programme, introduced a free range hen enterprise and packed eggs for neighbouring farmers and did a good job.  The hens were out on grass on a field which had a shed. <Col N="1178" /> Originally the farmer had the hens in his shed in the yard as was traditional on all Irish farms.  He was told this could not be considered a free range hen.  The hen that went to the field and returned to the farmyard could not be considered a free range hen.  This was because some bureaucrat in Brussels had decreed that any hen that walked across concrete from the field to the shed could not be regarded as a free range hen.  I make this point to demonstrate the lunacy &mdash; I use that word advisedly &mdash; which is at work in Brussels on occasion.  The banana has been used most often to demonstrate this degree of interference and regulation which is unhealthy for enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Leader programme has been very successful in developing rural enterprise and small businesses.  The county enterprise partnership board is another example.  There are people with a huge degree of initiative and energy who will go to enormous lengths to create businesses which most people regard as not being viable.  In Easky, County Sligo, I saw dillisk &mdash; seaweed &mdash; being processed, dried and sold in shops.  This was a successful enterprise which had grown out of a traditional activity of harvesting seaweed on the beach.  It is depressing for those people to find when they get a business to a certain point of development that the Brussels bureaucracy intervenes and that what was a good idea and had financial and other supports was nipped in the bud because of the nonsensical approach to the activities in which they were engaged.  I realise I am straying from the content of the Bill but it is a closely related issue.  We must ensure we do not impose so much regulation on small businesses that they cannot flourish, grow and develop.  I sometimes think that some of the regulations at European level are introduced at the behest of very large multinational corporations who are there to protect their own interest and ensure that the private individual, to whom I referred, did not get off the ground.</P>
    <P>The man with the eggs goes into his <Col N="1179" /> local supermarket as he has traditionally done over the years and is told he must have a &ldquo;packed&rdquo; licence to sell his eggs there.  I accept there are health dimensions to all this, such as salmonella and so on.  However, we must adopt a liberal approach that fosters local initiative and does not impose insurmountable technical difficulties.  Standards are not the same as standardisation.  Standardisation across the board in electrical products does not necessarily imply that the standard of a particular product is adequate.</P>
    <P>Consumer confidence is a key factor in this area.  Companies with ISO 9000 accreditation are regarded as adhering to high standards and the public has confidence in them.  There is a dramatic absence of ISO 9000 accreditation in the State sector.  It is about time Government Departments, county councils and so on did whatever is necessary to attain that accreditation.  Products must be safe.  There have been some major accidents with toys, although I accept they were imported from the Far East and not the European Union.</P>
    <P>If the Bord na Móna experience is anything to go by, we will find it difficult to get people to serve on State boards. People will wonder why they should have to drive around the country, work for a modest amount of money and be subject to a great deal of criticism.  Fortunately, some people are prepared to take on the mantle of public servants and serve on State boards and, despite the present difficulties, I hope that continues.</P>
    <P>This would be a better Bill if it included a provision to allow consumer interest representation on the board. My party tabled an amendment to the An Bord Bia Bill, 1994 specifically to include consumer interests on the board.  I proposed that a person from a recognised consumer organisation should nominate people to the Minister who could then decide who to appoint. Consumer interests should be designated as part of the NSAI board.</P>
    <P>I agree with Members' comments <Col N="1180" /> about county councillors.  From my experience members of county councils have particular competencies and merit consideration for membership of the board.  This would not give rise to a conflict of interest.  They would not have a close sectoral interest, which others might bring to bear on the board and should not, by definition, be excluded from the board.</P>
    <P>The Minister said consumer interests could be included on the board, but that is not what I am arguing.  There should be a representative of consumer interests, by definition, on the board.  I welcome the legislation and we will not impede its passage through the House.</P>

      <P>I thank Members who managed to make the debate on the Bill interesting, something we did not manage to do in the other House.  Some interesting questions were raised.</P>
      <P>Senators Daly, Mooney, Dardis and Farrelly referred to the exclusion of local authority members from the board.  I agree with their comments, but it is not something that was prominently in my mind in regard to this Bill.  The board to which we refer was appointed by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and I extended its life, pending this legislation.  This is a specialist area, but that does not mean I do not accept the argument about a consumer dimension.  I agree in general with the arguments for the inclusion of local authority members on the board.  It is wrong to exclude them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House accepted the necessity in this case for an autonomous independent body.  There are very specific reasons, including a legal imperative, why this body must be separate from the agencies, which have a different remit. If I had not plugged in my electrical appliance at 5.30 a.m. this morning in Brussels I might have followed more vigorously some of the arguments raised.  Interesting questions were raised about the legislation that set up IDA Ireland, Forbairt and Forfás.  The arguments <Col N="1181" /> for setting up three agencies to do the job of the former IDA would not count in this case because of the legal imperative to protect the quality of our accreditation.  The division of the agencies is a complex matter.  Most people would agree it was necessary to set up a specific agency to focus on the building of the indigenous sector, which was the poor relation in the IDA which did a good job in the foreign sector.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raised questions about the rationale behind the setting up of Forfás.  There is room for argument in this regard.  Forfás is the think tank, the intellectual sinews of industrial policy.  It is questionable whether it should be reposed in the Department or set up as a separate agency.  When I was in Opposition I argued that it should be reposed in the Department, but I now see merit in having it removed from the Department, even if only at a small step. The recent document it produced is worthy of study.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the point about the 14 committees and asked whether a fee income is raised by the NSAI.  The fee income totals almost 70 per cent.  The NSAI has a growing reputation in terms of its ability to earn revenue. Senators asked whether the number of staff will increase, whether there will be additional expenditure and so on, but it is important to make the point that the NSAI is a revenue earner in its own right, to the extent of no less than 70 per cent, which is very significant.  It has an international reputation.  I do not know why there are 14 committees as distinct from 13 or 15, but they seem to be as different as chalk and cheese &mdash; for example, the electro-technical safety committee and committees on construction products, consumer consultation, pharmaceutical and medical devices, information technology and environment. All the committees are vastly different and deal with specialist areas. I think the House will accept the need for specialists in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the tragic case brought to our attention by Senator <Col N="1182" /> Henry relating to the riding helmets standard.  The NSAI put the parents of the child who tragically died in the riding accident, to which the Senator referred in touch with the relevant experts in the USA.  They are working together to draft technical specifications to guarantee lateral stiffness and protection. The NSAI will propose an amendment to the European standard when available, but unfortunately no such specifications are yet available.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to the Euro plug.  The NSAI, in consultation with 18 other members of the European standardisation body for electronics and electrical products are working towards the introduction of a European wide Euro plug which will replace the seven different designs of plug used throughout Europe.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn could hear in the background the sound of empires being rebuilt.  That is a little unfair in this case because the motivation behind the construction of this agency as an independent and autonomous body has nothing to do with empires.  There is a legal imperative behind it.  There is a pressing requirement to protect our quality marks.  The staffing complement is in the order of 110 in total.  Senators will be surprised to learn that half of them are contract staff, whose position will improve when this legislation is passed.  There are no immediate plans for significant change in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Quinn about the separation of science and technology.  It is more difficult now than ever before to draw distinction between science and technology.  The difference between pure or basic research and applied research is becoming more blurred, and as the information society develops that is likely to be the trend.  I hope to bring a White Paper to Government within the next few weeks on science <Col N="1183" /> and technology policy, and many of the questions raised by Senator Quinn and Senator Daly will be dealt with in that paper.  I would be delighted if the public engaged in debate on that matter, which does not set the world on fire &mdash; I agree with Senators who said that that is regrettable in a modern society.  I have proffered the view elsewhere that if one could enliven such a debate with the same enthusiasm as on arts and culture perhaps greater progress would be made, but I recognised immediately that that was an argument in favour of the Minister, Deputy Higgins, to replace me in this job, although there may be merit in that.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn asked why the trade board is a separate body which reports to a separate Minister.  Everybody knows the reason for that, and perhaps the position should have been changed by this Government, but that is a debate for another day.  It would not be acceptable to chop and change agencies every time there was a change of Government. We have a fantastic fascination with agencies &mdash; for example, if something goes wrong somebody has a great idea for a new agency or suggests that certain agencies should not have been divided and should be amalgamated again.  In my brief experience, the business of putting departments together again is not necessarily always the wisest solution.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly requested that the new agency be decentralised to Shannon.  I have not dwelt very much on that question. There is a possibility of decentralising it to the third major city in the Republic, Tallaght, to which I could give consideration.</P>

      <P>It ought to be recognised that the consultative committees comprise specialist people who are not paid for that work, nor, extraordinarily, are they paid travelling expenses.  As <Col N="1184" /> Senator Dardis said, they do a public service job and our appreciation is due to them for that.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis raised the interesting question of whether we are over regulated and he instanced the daft extremes to which the European bureaucracy goes in that regard.  He made the interesting point that very often it is the lobby system that produces that effect. It can be very important for the giant trans-national corporations to have things done that seem daft to us.  For example, in the area of intellectual property it is a very valuable instrument for very large companies to have certain agreements given effect to at the level of the European Union and between the European Union and the other major trading blocks.  Very often there is not a rationale from the point of view of the consumer, but there is from the point of view of the large multinationals who have a monopoly in that area.</P>
      <P>I will not dispute the point made about the prevalence of the ISO 9,000 standard throughout the public service. There has been a fantastic awakening about quality in recent years and the extent to which the ISO 9,000 has been adopted is very encouraging.  It is a boost to consumer confidence in the quality of the organisations involved and I agree with Senator Dardis' comments in that regard.  The matter was raised as a minor point by Senator Daly, and other Senators have taken up the point that the name is complicated and not easily recognised and does not trip lightly off the tongue.  Since the ISO 9000 mark has become so prevalent the NSAI logo is beginning to get wider circulation and appreciation.  It has an international as well as a national reputation. Some of the people concerned are very highly regarded for their professionalism. I do not wish to pre-empt the House but I think we are stuck with that one now and so be it.  I will have regard to the arguments made.</P>

I take the point of the particular reference Senator Dardis made in respect of An Bord Bia.  This Government brought in amending legislation, although perhaps it was somewhat delayed.  The legislation emerged from the co-operation between the Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Food, Deputy Yates and me during the recent BSE scare and I was very pleased that he was able to accede to the request I made for representation on An Bord Bia of the consumer organisations.  It might be a bit late but it is a valuable acknowledgment that without consumer confidence, the quality of the product really does not matter.  Consumers will vote with their feet if they do not believe in the quality of the product.  It is important for the restoration of consumer confidence that they be represented.

      <P>I am sure the Minister of State is aware there has been a virtual prohibition on the establishment of some new technologies because of the difficulty of obtaining UK standards where commodities have to undergo certain tests.  The cost of that is very high and in some cases it prohibited the establishment of small businesses here. I presume the Irish standards authority will not have the facilities to enable some of those procedures to be undertaken here and there will still be a requirement for many new products to go to the UK for standardisation.</P>
      <P>How can this be avoided?  It is probably not relevant to this section but, as far as I can see, this legislation will not do away with the system which has prevented small Irish businesses from establishing standards for commodities because of the cost involved in taking them to the UK.  A number of inventions have been prevented from being put into production here because of the cost of having these tests done in the UK.

The whole thrust now &mdash; the next stage beyond mutual recognition of standards and so on &mdash; is towards a common standard, for good or ill.  We have to be careful to recognise the consumer dimension of this.  Senator Dardis spoke on Second Stage about the dangers to consumers of products coming on the market which do not comply with standards which are generally applicable in the European Union.

      <P>I will probably ask the same questions on section 22 because there seems to be a correlation here in relation to the false use of standards.  I am not sure whether the section refers to the illegal use of standard markings for counterfeiting purposes.  Retail products are ordinarily manufactured to a high degree and have the standard marking to enhance that credibility, but that could be open to abuse.  The Minister of State referred to monitoring, but how will the counterfeiting of standards be monitored?  What procedures will there be for implementing this section on false representation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>If this legislation is to be effective it is very important that if someone sets out to make a false representation he is deemed to be guilty of an offence.  That is essentially what the section seeks to do.  The Director of Consumer Affairs will have a role in the policing of this.  The counterfeiting phenomenon, to which Senator Mooney referred, is probably appropriate to trademarks law primarily.  The recent Bill on trademarks which I introduced to the House sought to deal with the question of counterfeiting.  Senators will note that one or two major seizures were made very recently.  Representations were made to Members by the anti counterfeiting group in respect of the point raised by the Senator. However, it is more proper to trademarks law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 20(3) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> A standard mark shall include the words &ldquo;Caighdeán Éireannach&rdquo; or the initials &ldquo;C.É.&rdquo; and may include the words &ldquo;Irish Standard&rdquo; or the initials &ldquo;I.S.&rdquo; or any other mark.</P>
    <P>That is quite desirable in terms of the national language being the first language and so on.  However, in terms of establishing the mark as something in which consumers can have confidence and which is readily identifiable, it strikes me that it is the wrong way around.  It should read that it &ldquo;shall include the words &lsquo;Irish Standard&rsquo; or the initials &lsquo;I.S.&rsquo; and may include the words. ...&rdquo;.  It is rather like the coat hangers with the words &ldquo;An tSualainn tír a déanta&rdquo; written on them.</P>
    <P>I assume that exported goods conforming to the standard will have the Irish standard stamped on them if the exporter so wishes.  In those circumstances, it would be preferable if the mark was in English rather than Irish. If I am reading the legislation correctly, irrespective of whether it is written in English on the product, the Irish wording has to be included.  In other words, the English wording would be additional to the Irish wording.  That strikes me as unnecessarily complicated and not very consumer friendly.  I suppose in England they might take &ldquo;C.E.&rdquo; to mean Church of England.</P>

      <P>I heard what Senator Dardis said.  It is a matter of taste, to some extent.  That is the structure recommended by the parliamentary draftsman, as is the construction of words used.  There was considerable discussion in the other House about that. There is a separate section which refers to provision to deceive in terms of the use of the word &ldquo;standard&rdquo; and so on. It is somewhat like the discussion we had on the Title of the Bill.  I do not <Col N="1192" /> know whether it might remind one of the Church of England.  The argument is that it is very distinctively Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more important than that.  I accept that Irish is the first national language and I share the desire to revive it.  However, an aggressive exporting country such as Japan does not put Japanese symbols on its products, as far as I am aware &mdash; they almost always use English.  We have to accept if we are trying to sell goods on international markets and to establish that our standards are good ones which we can stand over, it would be preferable from a commercial, rather than philosophical, point of view to have it as the &ldquo;Irish Standard&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>From my reading of it, the section seems to allow the authority to devise its own brand &mdash; be that a harp or something which is distinctly Irish &mdash; to use in conjunction with the proposed wording.  Senator Dardis referred to a particular standard which will quickly become identifiable as the Irish quality mark.  As I understand it, some form of Irish mark will be developed which will readily identify a product as being Irish manufactured to a particular quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning is correct.  The NSAI's mark is the main one.  There may also be a European logo or mark but it will not have the same significance.  We entered into a similar discussion on the Title of the Bill and there is a pin, which represents the main logo of the NSAI.  My officials have confirmed that Senator Manning's comments regarding the authority devising its own brand or mark are correct. Ireland will not be solely dependent on the Caighdeán Éireannach symbol for selling goods to other countries.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 21 agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1193" /> SECTION 22.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 22 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In contributing to the discussion on section 19, I indicated that section 22 was similar.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify what is the difference between &ldquo;false representation&rdquo; and &ldquo;unlawful use&rdquo;?  It seems that these terms correlate with each other.  While I accept the Minister of State's comments in relation to section 19, are his replies as pertinent to this section?</P>
      <P>Everyone hopes that the standard mark will become important and will identify the country of origin in a positive and upbeat manner but it may also attract the attention of criminal elements.  With regard to retail products, there is no doubt but that there will be, not so much counterfeiting, as misuse and illegal use of the mark which will have been licensed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy and myself are involved in the music industry.  We know that significant pirating of video and audio cassette tapes is occurring in Dublin and throughout the country. Irish manufacturers of such products will seek to obtain the standard mark. With the export of the ethnic Irish music product overseas, they may believe that use of the mark will enhance their credibility.  There is no doubt that this is becoming a multi-million pound industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the Minister of State has all the answers or that the Bill will go any way towards addressing the problem.  However, it is past time that there was a stronger response to pirating of products.  The Minister of State correctly referred to the seizure of cigarettes in this regard, but more effective action must be taken.  The Garda Síochána state that it does not have the requisite resources to deal with the problem.  Equally, under current law, people suspected of such nefarious activities must be caught in possession of illegal goods.  These people only take <Col N="1194" /> a small amount of such goods onto the streets for sale.  They place them on a baker's box and can walk away if an attempt is made to apprehend them. They will not run away taking the product with them because they are aware that they can be charged once they are caught in possession of it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to broaden the debate, but there is need to provide for more effective monitoring.  If we are to establish the standard mark in the manner in which it is being debated, we must also consider the other side of the coin.  We must look at effective measures to prevent or at least minimise illegal use of the mark.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Mooney's comments about the standard mark and an effective monitoring system. Three weeks before Christmas 120,000 pirated video cassettes were discovered in County Louth.  These items were not being manufactured by someone from the Republic or Northern Ireland, but by a citizen of another country.  This type of activity causes enormous damage to employment.  In Ireland, as elsewhere, 80 per cent of the turnover in the music business is earned in the five weeks before Christmas.  This industry must be protected because it is a tremendous asset.  Irish musicians abroad are great ambassadors for this country.  A standard mark is a must in the effort to put a stop to piracy.</P>
      <P>From a personal, not a political, point of view, I have always admired the work carried out by the Minister of State.  I request that he investigate this issue as a matter of urgency.  Piracy is one of the top five offences in Scotland.  Perhaps the Minister of State's officials would consider the Scottish regulations and laws dealing with this issue.  This would help the music industry, among others, which is under much pressure.</P>

      <P>I will not quibble about this issue but both Senators have used the section to make an entirely separate point.  I cannot say that I have never done so myself.  Having referred to <Col N="1195" /> trademarks law, we have moved to copyright law.  I have good news for Senators Cassidy and Mooney in that I am currently preparing a major Bill to deal with the issue of copyright.  Unfortunately, it runs to over 500 sections and work on it will be adversely affected as a result of personnel from my Department being diverted to help with EU Presidency work.  The area of intellectual property is very detailed and specific, and development of the proposed legislation cannot progress until the relevant expertise becomes available.  I hope to publish the Bill in whatever time is remains to me as Minister of State.</P>

I am pleased that he indicated his intention to publish a new copyright Bill.  Will the Minister of State give serious consideration to introducing that Bill in this House?  In case he feels a Bill with 500 sections might be too onerous, the Companies Act, which ran to almost 400 sections, was introduced in the Seanad. The Minister of State made a valid point about expertise.  I am not suggesting that as Members of the Upper House we have a monopoly on expertise in this area, but this complex Bill deserves reflection by the Seanad before it is placed before the Dáil.  I am making a political point.</P>

      <P>I agree the penalty of £1,500 or imprisonment seems to be small in what could be a sizeable case.  If a person's patent or licence is interfered with, thousands of pounds could be involved.  There is no provision for somebody to claim damages from a third party who may be in breach of the legislation.

Both penalties can apply and 12 months imprisonment is not trivial. The essence of this is the question of speedy access to justice and to the jurisdiction of the District Court.  I do not foresee the major counterfeiting scams which we discussed earlier and for which we had penalties of £0.5 million. Therefore, speedy access to justice and to the jurisdiction of the District Court is important.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 50, after &ldquo;members&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;of which 40% shall be women&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already discussed the reasons this amendment should be accepted.  It is in keeping with the Government's guidelines in relation to the percentage of women appointed or nominated to semi-State boards and boards to which appointments are in the gift of the Government.  The precedent I cite is the Heritage Council Bill, 1994, introduced by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  That council comprises 14 members, so it was relatively easy for the Minister to provide that not less than seven members should be women.  We have some difficulty with this legislation in that the board of the Authority shall consist of not more than 13 members.  We tried to be Solomon like, but we could not split the baby in half.  Rather than opt for a specific figure, we suggest that not less than 40 per cent of the new authority shall consist of women.  The argument has been well made so I will not repeat it <i>ad nauseam.</i><Col N="1199" /> I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In technical terms, the Senator has split the baby in half.  The amendment states that not less than 40 per cent shall be women.  If the authority is to consist of 13 members, then it would require 5.2 women, which is impossible unless we are talking about a combination of a hermaphrodite or an androgynous person.  I agree with the sentiment, but the impossibility of implementation gives rise to concern.</P>

      <P>The amendment is incapable of implementation, although the argument is well made.  I draw the Senator's attention to subsection (4), in particular the clause that reads &ldquo;taking into account guidelines issued from time to time by the Government&rdquo;.  The guidelines issued by the Government are precisely those for which Senator Mooney argues.  Without being in breach of Cabinet confidentiality, I can tell Members that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform raises them each time a Bill comes to Government. I am sure he will do that in this case and I hope, despite the point made by Deputy Sherlock about the specialist nature of this board, we will be able to <Col N="1200" /> find the requisite number of women &mdash; approximately 40 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The motive behind tabling this amendment has been more than justified by the short debate that has taken place and the Minister's response to it.  I take the point that it is not pleasant when one is hoisted on one's petard in the context of the breakdown of numbers, but the figure of 40 per cent has been put forward because that is stated in the guidelines.  I accept Senator O'Toole's point that legislation should be specific and, if it was, it would be the opposite of a Solomon-like judgment because Solomon did not split the baby in half.  In the circumstances the Minister's reply is perfectly acceptable. I hope legislation will be more specific in future rather than, as the Minister quoted, &ldquo;taking into account guidelines issued from time to time by the Government&rdquo;.  A Government may be 100 per cent male chauvinist and may decide to debar women.  The legislation should reflect the gender breakdown in society and should be specific in that regard.</P>

      <P>In page 16, line 50, after &ldquo;members.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;One ordinary member shall be appointed on the nomination of such organisations as the Minister considers to be representative of consumers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have fascinating thoughts on the previous amendment.  Sometimes males are spoken of as old women and perhaps there are men who are 20 per cent female.  That would allow us conform to the 40 per cent requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised the point covered in this amendment on Committee Stage and the Minister of State conceded it to an extent and accepted that the composition of the board of An Bord Bia had been improved by a representation of the consumer interest.  The amendment <Col N="1201" /> before the House is the same as that contained in the An Bord Bia Bill.  It gives the Minister discretion to designate organisations or to seek nominations from organisations he considers represent consumers.  The Consumers Association of Ireland is one that springs most readily to mind.  Given the thrust of the Bill, it would be desirable if one person was designated as representing consumer interests.  That provision improved the An Bord Bia Bill and it could improve this Bill.  I commend this to the Minister who made the point that he was glad the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry accepted this proposal, one which we tabled originally to the 1994 An Bord Bia Bill which had not been passed at that stage.  The inclusion of this provision is desirable.  The more consumer confidence there is in bodies of this nature the better, and the more it will give authority to the standards established by the board, the more confidence the consumer will have.  For that reason I strongly commend the amendment to the Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dardis is right. I accepted the argument at an early stage when this was under discussion. Subsection (4) was pointed out to me at that stage.  Without any single interest predominating, the expectation is that there will be multiple consumer interests on the board.  Perhaps Senator Dardis is making a provision for a specific consumer organisation, but that is not stated in his amendment which refers to such organisations.  I am persuaded of the merit of the argument, but in practice there will be considerably more than one representative on this board and for reasons of economy I am prepared to give Senator Dardis an absolute undertaking that if I am the Minister of State at the time the board is appointed I will undertake to ensure there is at least such a nomination requested from the consumers organisation that Senator Dardis has in mind.</P>

Section 2 (4) of the Schedule provides that the interests are ones that are involved in the process of standardisation and certification of commodities, processes and practices.  While I accept that no one interest should predominate, that does not include consumer interests.  Under the terms of that subsection it would be possible to exclude the consumer interests.  As we pointed out in respect of an earlier section, not every Minister will be as enlightened as the present incumbent.  It would add substantially to the authority which could be conferred on the authority, to use a tautology, if the consumer was represented.</P>

I know Senator Dardis is considering consumers in the sense of consumers represented by the Consumers Association of Ireland which, as Senator Henry said, are the type of people who will shop for those products who tend to be predominantly female.  In the circumstances the only way in which I can deal with them is to give that assurance in respect of the specific organisation that Senator Dardis has in mind and to invite them to make a nomination.</P>

      <P>I listened to the earlier debate and when I glanced through the Bill this morning I did not pick up this point and, if I had, I would have raised <Col N="1203" /> it on Second Stage.  I feel aggrieved on behalf of local authority members.  The Minister of State said this is almost a tradition in the sense that it appears in legislation time after time in regard to Members of the Oireachtas and so on. That type of utterance indulges begrudgery.  Those people have a begrudging attitude towards those who give of their time in local democracy.  It diminishes the overall importance of local government, the subject of much debate.  If I might draw a parallel with the present debate on crime and getting the fundamentals right from the beginning, attitudes to local government have been deteriorating since the 1977 general election which diminished the powers of local authorities and abolished rates.</P>
      <P>People should be encouraged to participate in local government.  I have no intention of doing so myself and never had any intention of being a candidate, but I do admire those who give of their time serving on local authorities, be they county councils, urban councils or town commissions that form a very important part of the overall democratic process.  In other European countries it is very common for people, perhaps in their fifties, who have been successful in their careers, businesses and professions, to become candidates for membership of local authorities, it is almost perceived as an honour.</P>
      <P>I am afraid our attitude to county councillors, town commissioners, those who serve on urban councils and so on, is very negative, the attitude appears to be that it is very bad for the democratic process.  Indeed, people's distrust in public representation is manifested in young people's reluctance, perhaps on the verge of a career, to participate in public life at any level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision that board members shall not be members of a local authority within the meaning of the Local Government Act, 1941, is gratuitous and can emit one signal only, that somehow such people are not to be trusted, perhaps are not the right calibre or <Col N="1204" /> whatever; all this is very negative.  I have no doubt that that was not the intention of those who drafted this provision. Nonetheless, it demeans participation in local government representation and encourages cynicism.  In addition, it might rule out people with a commitment to public service whose energies would be expended for the common good, giving of their services for the betterment of society generally, who might be appointed to this board through a different route.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging that it is unreal to expect the Minister to accept an amendment at this stage, we must send clear signals to members of local authorities that we value their contribution to the community, that we wish them to continue and give a similar signal to those they represent, that those they elect are valued by the electorate.  It is fundamentally wrong that they should be excluded.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney in his Second Stage contribution expressed the view that this provision might be unconstitutional. I do not believe it is but I certainly agree with the point he made that, as drafted, it is very difficult to accept.  I regret its inclusion and wish we were afforded an opportunity to omit it even at this late stage.  I make this point in the hope that this type of provision will not be incorporated in future legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be associated with other Members' comments on this Part of the Bill.  For some time there has been strong feeling among members of local authorities that the will of the electorate is not being heard or implemented by those elected at local authority level.  A person in my area, unsuccessful in a local election, now holds a position of enormous importance. In my view that does not represent democracy or correspond with the will of the people.  I am totally opposed to the provision that a board member shall not be a member of a local authority within the meaning of the Local Government Act, 1941.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is at present no encouragement <Col N="1205" /> for people to enter public life, to participate in our overall democratic structures or to engage in the hard work undertaken voluntarily by members of local authorities nationwide.  In all justification, this House, which selects almost 50 of its Members through the ballot box, cannot allow this Part of a Bill be passed.  It is a disgrace; it demeans members of local authorities and is a provision with which I cannot associate myself as a Member of this House for the past 14 years.  I am totally opposed to it, as I believe are most Members, if not the Leader.  This provision must be seriously re-examined. We should all like to think that future politicians would have a training ground within which they could represent members of their respective communities, make their way through the democratic process, as all of us here have done.  Indeed, most Members of both Houses will already have served as members of local authorities before being elected and it is through that privileged will of the electorate we can offer our views on this Part of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the amendment and do not believe this subsection should have been included. There is an inference to be drawn from all of this &mdash; that somehow members of local authorities are unfit to serve on boards of this nature.  Senator O'Toole is right when he says it is demeaning and indicates to the general public that somehow members of local authorities are unfit and/or cannot be trusted.  I could see a reason for its inclusion if the potential existed for a conflict of interest.  I contend there is greater potential for conflict of interest through the appointment of somebody from a large commercial concern than in appointing a member of a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one thinks of the number of bodies nationwide on whose boards members of local authorities serve, such as universities, county enterprise boards &mdash; to which members of local authorities make a significant contribution &mdash; in <Col N="1206" /> addition to vocational education committees, while there are exceptions, generally members of all those bodies serve in the interests of the common good and refrain from politicising them.  In the case of the County Kildare Vocational Education Committee, of which I am not a member, my experience has been that they are not political and all cooperate in the interests of the community they serve.  It is in that spirit of public service that most people approach membership of a local authority and is the reason they stand for election; this should be encouraged.  For all those reasons I believe this provision should be deleted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not repeat the arguments made by my colleagues because I find myself in agreement with every word uttered.  Rather I should like to endeavour to be helpful because striking down this one provision &mdash; which probably would not affect many local authority members &mdash; might not be particularly helpful.  It is a much wider issue this type of subsection which finds its way almost automatically into every Bill being the problem.  As Leader of the House I would be very happy to raise the matter with the Government, conveying the views of all Members that this is an issue which must be examined by the Attorney General and parliamentary draftsmen, in an endeavour to ascertain why this provision is included in Bills of this type, obtain an answer, thus ensuring that this type of subsection is not automatically included in Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may occasionally be a conflict of interest, although in most cases there is not.  As a Seanad, given our electorate, we should examine this.  Starting at tomorrow's meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I will be happy to look at this question over the summer and go to Government with our proposals.  Our case should be made in a reasoned way.  I guarantee it will be if I can get all-party agreement.  Rather than striking down this issue tonight in one Bill which may not be relevant, it <Col N="1207" /> would be better to make the general point for all future legislation and, possibly, a Bill which might repeal sections of existing legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the intervention of Senator Manning and would wish him to do precisely as he suggested. Nevertheless, we are faced with having this in the Bill.  Senator Mooney and I came to the conclusion that any attempt to amend this would make it worse and that the easiest way to deal with the matter would be to delete the subsection.  That is what we are proposing.</P>
      <P>We had agreed to finalise this Bill this evening, but if the Minister is adamant about not changing it, we will have to consider our position on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am adamant about nothing except that I agree with the view which has been expressed.  Senator O'Toole said he did not pick it up when he went through the Bill.  I am ashamed to say I did not pick it up either, nor, with respect to my colleagues on the other side of the House, did their colleagues in the other House.  I took on board a number of amendments advanced by the Opposition in the Dáil. This point was not adverted to at any stage and I sat through the entire proceedings. I do not think it was the intention to demean anyone.  It is unfortunate that this is an automatic importation into Bills nowadays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with it. To be brutally frank, if the other House had not risen, I would not have the slightest compunction about accepting the amendment, even though I do not think it has much reference to this Bill. However, we are in the twelfth hour in more ways than one.  The other House has risen.  This has certain implications in terms of having to go back before the other House in the autumn, and that has certain implications in terms of the purpose <Col N="1208" /> of the Bill.  In the event, as Senator Manning says, it does not impact on this Bill particularly because of subclause (4) to which we adverted earlier.  I agree with the arguments made and I have no compunction about putting my views on the record.  If the matter had been brought to my attention earlier I would have been only too happy to comply with the request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister.  I fully appreciate his dilemma and I welcome Senator Manning's intervention. The other House will be coming back on 25 July, albeit for a specific purpose.  This relates to the removal of but one subsection of the First Schedule which I contend would not be a contentious issue in the other House and would be welcomed by the Members there.  In those circumstances, I can hardly stand back from falling in line with the Minister's desires and the view expressed by the Leader of the House because this is an issue that goes to the core of local democracy.  It is an issue that is constantly debated wherever councillors meet.  They see this type of legislation as the thin end of the wedge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that if we continue to pass legislation of this nature, which is a blocking mechanism for locally elected members, people of merit and credibility will no longer see the option of elected office as an attractive option and will throw their considerable energies into the fast growing non-elected voluntary sector.  That is already happening. There is no one measure I can point to that has diminished local authority elected members in the eyes of the public. It has been a slow drip effect over many years.  If the mind set of Government and of the parliamentary drafts people, whenever they are faced with legislation of this nature in the creation of new boards, is to automatically exclude local authority members for no logical reason, I cannot stand over that. The Minister and the Leader of the House have asked, rhetorically, why this is in legislation and say they will attempt <Col N="1209" /> to find out but the absence of a formal response, I will tell the House.  It is there because there is a diminution in the perception of the work of local authority members.  The higher one goes, the more one looks up and the less one looks down.  That is part of the reason. That may sound unfair to parliamentary drafts people and to civil servants, but there is a feeling in Government, irrespective of party, within official Ireland &mdash; to use that terrible term Éamon Dunphy uses &mdash; that somehow local authority members are less important than others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for conceding the earlier point.  It was a magnanimous gesture on his part.  To underline the argument, the Second Schedule deals with the people who would be seconded from the staff of the authority, and membership of a local authority would not require one to stand seconded.  One could be a member of staff and be a member of a local authority.  It was not considered desirable to have someone who was a member <Col N="1210" /> of a local authority as a member of the board.</P>

I earnestly appeal to the Leader of the Fianna Fáil group to use his authority and connections to ensure that his colleagues facilitate the taking of this Bill on 25 July.  On that day there is one item on the agenda the House knows about.  I am sure nobody in the other House would object to what the Seanad has done and I would be grateful if this Bill could be taken without debate in the Dáil.  There are matters of staffing, investment, money and reputation of standards at issue.
