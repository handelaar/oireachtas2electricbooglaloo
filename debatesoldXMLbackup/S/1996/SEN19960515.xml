      <P>I have notice from Senator McGennis that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P> The need for the Minister for Education to outline the reason the boys' and girls' schools at Scoil Bhríde, Blanchardstown, do not have a separate full-time remedial teacher. </P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
      <P> The need for the Minister for Education to grant disadvantaged status to Scoil Cholmcill, Letterkenny, County Donegal. </P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Sherlock of the following matter:</P>
      <P> The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to outline this policy on the promotion and marketing of venison. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator McGennis's and Senator Maloney's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Sherlock may give notice on <Col N="658" /> another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1 and item 19, motion No. 30.  There will be 30 minutes per spokesperson on item 1 and 20 minutes thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know the promotion of Senator O'Sullivan was part of the revival of the Labour Party's fortunes.</P>
      <P>I asked the Leader last week about our forthcoming legislation programme. Can the Acting Leader remind him of that?  This side would like to know the programme of business for the rest of this term.  Can she also pass on to the Tánaiste the request made by this House on a number of occasions in the last few months to bring us up to date and to give us a say on the Northern Ireland process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should note the unfortunate incident in the south-side of Dublin relating to drug abuse. These problems have been raised many times in this House.  There is no proper substance abuse education programme in our schools and no resources have been made available to provide such a programme.  A start must be made somewhere on this issue and that will require imaginative and creative thinking from the Department and the Minister for Education.  The sooner that happens, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On the matter referred to by Senator O'Toole, the House should express its view that it is not acceptable in a civilised society that anybody should be taken out and beaten to death, irrespective of what they are alleged to have done.  We discussed this matter in the past when people were summarily executed in Belfast for alleged drug trafficking.  We condemned <Col N="659" /> that practice and it would be consistent to condemn this matter in the same way.</P>
      <P>The other issue I wish to raise &mdash; it was also raised by Senator Wright &mdash; is statements on Northern Ireland.  The Leader indicated that he would attempt to deal with this matter before the Northern Ireland forum meets on 10 June.  It would be wise to do this sooner rather than later.  The House has a good history of giving balanced views on this issue and it is an important time in the electoral and peace processes.  Our views would be valuable and I ask the Acting Leader to find time within the next week to debate this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is related to another <i>faux pas</i> by the Department of Education in transporting examination papers.  There seems to be something radically wrong with the administration of how these boxes are brought from the examination centres to the Department. The Minister said in the past that this would not happen again but it has. It is now nearly examination time and it is extremely important that the Minister comes to the House and lays down how this practice will be tightened up to the extent that it will not happen again in any physical examinations taking place this year.  The Minister has not made any statement about this matter in this House and it is important we get this message across to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Health to come into the House as soon as possible to hear a proposition.  A committee at Letterkenny General Hospital, County Donegal, has raised in excess of £600,000 for a CAT scan.  The CAT scan unit has been bought, the building has been put out for contract, the North-Western Health Board has approved the development plan and we are just waiting for the Minister for Health to give his approval.  Where the voluntary effort has raised £600,000 we are entitled to a response from the Department of Health.  We have been waiting <Col N="660" /> for over 12 months for the Department and the Minister to respond and to give approval.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue in the House.  Will we get approval from the Minister for Health or will the decision be put on the long finger?  I hope we will not be waiting for this approval until the weeks before the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator O'Toole and Senator Dardis in their condemnation of a vigilante group dealing with the drug problem which exists in Dublin and in many other areas.  It is appropriate that this House would utterly condemn the use of vigilante groups.  It is totally inappropriate and we should send out that message.</P>
      <P>There are two other items I want to mention.  First, with regard to the major fish kill which took place on the River Shannon over the weekend, it is important the the Minister instigate an immediate investigation and seek a conviction so that such an occurrence does not happen again.  Hundreds of guesthouse owners, proprietors of B and Bs and people who promote angling tourism are being put out of business because of fish kills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter would be more appropriate to a motion on the Adjournment or a Private Members' motion than the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that that may be the case but I ask the Leader to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister because it is of national importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, we have been seeking a debate on health for months.  I do not blame the Acting Leader but I am extremely disappointed with the narrow debate we are to have.  While the drugs issue is important we have been seeking a broader debate.  A number of speakers, including me, have emphasised the need for a debate on the White Paper on Mental Health.  I ask the Leader to tell the Minister for Health that we have been seeking a debate on that issue for <Col N="661" /> nine months.  It is nearly an insult to this House that at this stage we cannot debate the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole and others in condemning the vigilante group who beat up a person last night in Dublin.  Is it not time we had a debate on law and order, because there is nearly one murder every week and vigilante groups are taking over? Where that happends, is it not true that law and order has broken down completely? If we do not do something about it, the situation will get even more serious and there will be a return to mob law.</P>
      <P>The Minister set up a task force recently in response to the situation at Packard Electric which was a good development, but a factory closed in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, a short while ago with the loss of 300 jobs and this had a far greater impact in proportion to the numbers of people in north Sligo and north Leitrim than had the Packard Electric closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>There were not 300 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There was very near it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should get his figures right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We were refused a task force.  Why will we not provide a task force in rural Ireland?  Have we no regard for jobs lost in rural Ireland?  Is all the emphasis on what happens in the city?  I am asking the Leader of the House to ask the Minister why they were refused a task force for Ballyshannon. The job losses were equally important to them as Tallaght.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is not the public representative there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Maloney does not want employment in north Sligo-Ballyshannon and in this area &mdash; that is <Col N="662" /> all right.  Let him be honest and say that he condones the closure of factories because that in effect is what he is saying. Senator Maloney's party is saying &ldquo;To hell with the country, let the jobs go, we do not want them&rdquo;.  If that is Labour's attitude, fair play, but the Senator should come out openly and say it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator did not even ask for a task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope I will cause less disorder.  Can the Acting Leader make some arrangement to deal with the Freedom of Information Bill which we will be addressing tomorrow in the context of delivering better Government.  The Committee Stage of the Bill was dealt with on 30 April and it is important that we should put it in place.  There is a technical problem because the Bill is effectively stuck on Committee Stage, unless we can refer it to the Dáil Committee which is examining the Government's draft headings.  It is important to resolve that issue.</P>
      <P>Can the Acting Leader arrange to let us know, through the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, how it is that Ireland seems to be more sanguine about the BSE ban on British products than other European states?  Gelatine sweets are on sale in our shops.  They are technically banned, but they are still coming in from Britain.  The ban is a sham because it clearly does not exist here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will have to find another way of raising that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in condemning the crime by a vigilante group in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the newspapers the report of the Commission on Local Government Restructuring has been finalised.  Can the Acting Leader <Col N="663" /> arrange to have the report circulated as early as possible?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>While I share Senator Ormonde's concern in asking the Minister for Education to examine the situation with regard to the delivery of practical examination projects, it should be pointed out that the system in question has been used for many years. I supervised examinations over 20 years ago.  The system has worked well and has stood the test of time, but it is regrettable that in recent times there have been problems.  The Acting Leader should ask the Minister to consider the idea of sending examiners to correct practical examinations in the schools.  In that case there would be no need to send exam pieces back to the Department of Education, which is a cumbersome method.  It is a pity that problems have arisen but with the amount of goods being sent on trains nowadays, some errors may occur along the way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should come in here and discuss it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Acting Leader arrange a debate on the issue of defamation? Increasingly public representatives are being muzzled because they cannot raise issues of general interest in public.  When my colleague, Senator Gallagher, raised an issue of public interest she was immediately threatened with a law suit.  We have seen this even more recently in the public domain. Recently entire sections of the report on the inquiry into Madonna House were deleted because of defamation considerations. If issues of public concern cannot be raised by public representatives, county councillors, Senators or TDs, democracy is diminished.  We need an <Col N="664" /> open debate on this topic as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand legislation dealing with discrimination against certain people and establishments will shortly come before the House.  When is the legislation due and will it apply to casino owners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>A young girl died tragically at an indoor concert last weekend. Will the Acting Leader ask the Minister for the Environment if anything more than a code of practice must be undertaken by those promoting these concerts? In the past I raised the issue of the lack of regulations, even in relation to the supply of drinking water, at some of these events.  Is there legislation allowing a particular number of people to a certain square footage?  In this case things seem to have got out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Finneran's call for a debate on the fish kill in the Shannon.  This concerns Members in whose areas inland fisheries are located.  I also support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland because it is some time since we last discussed this. As regards the matter raised by Senator Farrell, the Ballyshannon factory would not have closed if the local Deputy had not transferred a factory to his own town of Dungloe and given a promise that the Ballyshannon factory would not close.  The unfortunate aspect of this is that the factory in Dungloe is thriving while the Ballyshannon factory is now closed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise the delay in paying pollution grants.  Farmers have spent a lot of money, have taken out loans and are paying high interest rates.  There is a delay of up to two years in the payment of these grants to farmers.  I understand they will not be paid before the general election next year.  That will not soften farmers.  I ask for a debate on agriculture; I understand the Leader is in favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We must all be pleased that there has been a breakthrough in relation to the difficulties with the CPSU in dealing with blood samples, providing cards and so on.  While I hope the entire matter will be resolved in the near future, this breakthrough will be welcomed by many farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Rory Kiely called for a debate on agriculture where a number of problems must be resolved. As regards the tragic death in the Point Depot this weekend, it is essential that we have a debate on crowd safety.  I attended a match some years ago and I was alarmed by the crowd pushing and shoving at the entrance.  The entrances and exits at a number of venues are dangerous.  There is a real danger in many places where people congregate. This matter extends over a number of areas and is the responsibility of various bodies, including the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the tragedy at the Point at the weekend.  I spoke to a parent of one of the children injured and learned that the number of people allowed into the premises and the way things were handled leave much to be desired.  No further activities should take place at that venue until an investigation is held and a report produced.  It has also come to light that the water was turned off at a recent rave party there.  This also affected people who had not taken tablets.</P>

      <P>I note the statement by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry yesterday that the Government intends to <Col N="667" /> publish the Bill relating to wild horses soon.  Will the Acting Leader make it known to the Government and the relevant Ministers that I understand the legislation can be introduced as a matter of urgency and dealt with in both Houses before the summer recess to ensure it will be on the Statute Book as soon as possible?  This problem is affecting the new Dublin satellite towns and needs to be addressed urgently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Wright raised the issue of forthcoming legislation. When I discussed this matter with the Leader of the House this morning he indicated that he hopes to have a list of forthcoming legislation for the House tomorrow.  Senator Wright also called for a debate on Northern Ireland.  Many Members have previously sought this debate and I hope it can be arranged as soon as possible, certainly before 10 June which is the date for all party talks.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the drugs question.  The Minister for Health will be in the House tomorrow for a debate on drugs and perhaps some of the Senator's points can be covered then.  I understand his questions primarily apply to the Minister of Education, but he can mention them tomorrow.</P>
      <P>In referring to drugs, a number of Members, including Senator Dardis, condemned the summary justice imposed on a man in Dublin yesterday. I add my voice to the condemnation of that matter.  The House should condemn any type of summary executions, such as the killing yesterday.  It is no way to deal with the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ormonde mentioned the examination boxes which were found.  I share her concern and I understand an inquiry is ongoing.  When that is complete, <Col N="668" /> I presume the Minister will be in a position to make a statement in the House and I am sure she will do so. Senator McDonagh's suggestion about having the examination corrected and marked in the schools is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan raised the issue of a CAT scan for Letterkenny hospital. As it is such a specific issue it might be more suited to be raised on the Adjournment.  Senator Finneran requested a broad debate on health.  I discussed the matter with the Leader of the House and he indicated that he intends to arrange a number of debates on health &mdash; tomorrow's is specifically targeted on drugs but there will be others.  The Senator has made requests for a debate on the White Paper on mental health over many months and I am sure it will be given priority.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell referred to the issue of jobs in Ballyshannon; that might be more suited to the Adjournment.  The Government has done a lot to target the west by giving a Minister of State responsibility for the area and in its general response to proposals for the development of the west.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche raised the Freedom of Information Bill.  There are some technical problems dealing with that Bill.  He also raised his concern about the BSE ban and certain beef related products, such as gelatine, which should be brought to the attention of the Department.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock asked about the local government restructuring report which he said is about to be published. I know it is near finalisation but I was not aware it was at the point of publication. I am sure Senators will receive it as soon as it is available.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly referred to defamation and the problems for public representatives raising issues of public concern. Privilege does not extend to fora other than the Oireachtas.  It is a matter which is worthy of consideration.  She referred to cases related to a Member of this House and to the Madonna House report; the Kelly Fitzgerald report might <Col N="669" /> also be included as an example where difficulties in dealing with issues arose because of defamation considerations. Senator Lydon asked about the equal status legislation.  I understand it is with the Attorney General and it should be ready in the near future.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry, Senator Farrelly and Senator Enright raised the issue of the tragic death of a young girl at the Point Depot last weekend.  An inquiry is ongoing.  Senator Henry suggested there should be a code of practice and Senator Farrelly suggested there should be co-ordination of the various bodies with relevant responsibilities, for example the local authority, the Department of the Environment and the police. It is horrific that such a death should happen.  The large numbers of young people who attend such events pose serious dangers and there will have to be regulations to protect the safety of young people.</P>
    <P>Senator Rory Kiely asked about the delay in the payment of pollution grants.  The Senator has been good at raising agricultural matters on the Adjournment and getting answers.  This might be another case for that approach.  I note he is seeking a general debate on agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Protection of Young Persons Bill is a timely updating of the law which protects young people during an important stage of their lives.  As legislators, we have a duty to put in place laws which protect vulnerable sections of our community.  This legislation aims to protect young people at a stage when they are moving from education into the world of work, from the home into independence and when they are combining work with education.</P>
      <P>Naturally we want to encourage young people toward independence and adulthood, but in doing so we must ensure that the legislation we design sets its priorities right.  A young person's education should be at the top of that priority list.  The Protection of Young Persons Bill sends a very important signal to parents, employers and young people that education comes first.  It offers a statutory guide to parents, guardians and employers in ensuring that the period between school and work is properly regulated in a balanced way which recognises the growing independence of the teenager.  It is also important to protect young people from exploitation by employers and ensure that they benefit from education during their growing years.  By following this route, it is hoped that they will then pursue a fulfilling career.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Bill strikes the correct balance between regulating and protecting vulnerable people and allowing them enough independence to taste the world of work while at school.  Many parents like to instil a sense of the work <Col N="671" /> ethic in their children; this Bill allows them to do that while still recognising the primacy of school and its importance in the child's future development.</P>
    <P>Historically, children and young people have always been a convenient source of cheap labour for employers and there has been a need to introduce protections of young people as a result. In the 19th century, during the Industrial Revolution, horrific exploitation of young people occurred and various social reformers introduced legislation to raise the minimum age at which children could go to work, while the maximum hours they could work were gradually reduced.  In the 1930s Ireland replaced the old British legislation with its own laws, which restricted the type of jobs young workers were allowed to do, and when they might do them.  This legislation was updated by the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977.</P>
    <P>Over the years, at international level, Governments have taken action to prevent the exploitation of young people in employment and establish basic principles.  At its first meeting in 1919, the International Labour Organisation adopted the first of 11 conventions on the minimum age for admission to employment, as well as the first of three conventions on night work for children. The Council of Europe's Social Charter, which was signed in 1961, states that children and young people have the right to special protection against the physical and moral hazards to which they are exposed.  The United Nations has also adopted successive instruments to protect the rights of young workers. In 1992, Ireland ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in which children were defined as people under the age of 18 years.  Article 32 of the Convention states that</P>
    <P>...Parties recognise the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, <Col N="672" /> or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development ... </P>
    <P>Consequently, this Bill, which implements an EU Directive, consolidates and builds on existing international standards designed to protect young people at work.  In 1994, Ireland signed an EU Directive which originated with the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights for Workers and states that the minimum employment age must not be lower than the minimum school leaving age.</P>
    <P>It also states that appropriate measures must be taken to adjust labour regulations applicable to young workers so that their specific development and vocational training and access to employment needs are met.  The European Social Charter declares that the duration of work, in particular, must be limited and night work prohibited in the case of workers under 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>We signed up to the EU Directive which gives effect to the principles of the European Social Charter and this Bill brings that directive into law.  In fact, it goes further than the directive in that we are raising the minimum age for normal working to 16.  However, we provide for employment of young workers by licence or regulation, for example, in the film industry or advertising and cultural activities.  We allow 14 and 15 year olds to work during the school holidays and for a limited amount of time during term time.  Generally speaking, the minimum age for holding a normal job is being raised to 16.</P>
    <P>I am providing a new avenue of appeal for young workers and their parents to enable them to go to the rights commissioner and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I am ensuring that where young people are working during the school holidays they will be allowed a minimum of three weeks off so they will come back to school refreshed.  The important thing is that schooling comes first.  The best thing we can do in the long-term interests of young people is <Col N="673" /> ensure that work and school are kept in proportion.  The benefits of education come first and where young people are working part-time while still at school, work should not interfere with the most important thing to them, which is getting an education.</P>
    <P>The Bill also relaxes the conditions on night work.  Under the 1977 Act young people under the age of 18 are prohibited from working after 10 p.m.  That rule is breached widely at the moment &mdash; for example, in the licensing trade, cafes and so on.  I have taken careful note of various points made to me, not least by young people themselves, who say this is the only kind of work they can get which fulfils their need for independence and money of their own.  I am also cognisant of the fact that education must come first.</P>
    <P>I have taken legal advice and the furthest I can move in terms of our international obligation is to allow an extension up to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday during the school holidays and on days not followed by a school day. We are relaxing to some extent the existing law relating to young people aged 16 and 17 engaged in night work which had been there for the last 18 years.</P>
    <P>I have taken the decision in this Bill to consolidate the existing law.  Some laws relating to the employment of young people go back to the 1930s.  The main legislation is the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977.  In addition to the new provisions I am repealing and re-enacting that legislation so that we will have, in one single instrument, the law relating to the employment of young people.  That will make it easier for employers to know their legal obligations and for young people, their trade unions and their parents to find out their legal rights.</P>
    <P>I intend, on the passage of this Bill, to undertake an information campaign among young people and workers and among the major employers of young labour to ensure the provisions are met. I am also raising the penalties in the Bill <Col N="674" /> for breaches of the legislation because it is important to ensure that the health, safety and right to an education of young people are respected and that the laws are upheld by their employers.</P>
    <P>I will outline the main areas of difference between the directive which we are implementing and our existing laws. Certain categories of employment which are excluded from specific provisions of our existing legislation come within the scope of the directive.  The directive requires a specific authorisation procedure for the employment of children on cultural or similar activities. The directive is more restrictive than the existing legislation relating to the maximum working time for those aged 16 to 18.  The directive provides for a longer minimum rest period to be given in any seven day period.  The directive permits the employment of children for a limited number of hours during school term time.  This is not permitted under the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the provisions of the EU directive which must be implemented by member states by 22 June 1996.  I am repealing and replacing the 1977 Act as well as the relevant provisions of the 1936 legislation.  This Bill is comprehensive and covers all areas related to the protection of young people.  The safety and health provisions of the directive &mdash; Articles 6 and 7 &mdash; are not covered by this Bill.  They will be implemented by way of regulation under the 1989 Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes beyond the terms of the directive by prohibiting the employment of people under 16 years of age or the school leaving age, whichever is the higher.  The existing minimum age for entry into employment is 15 years of age but the proposal to raise the minimum age is consistent with the Department of Education's plan to raise the school leaving age to 16.  Our intention is to encourage young people to remain in education and training beyond the age of 15 for the purpose of furthering their education.  Young people who leave school early are most likely to end up as <Col N="675" /> tomorrow's long-term unemployed.  We will use this legislation to encourage young people to stay at school rather than leave it prematurely for a dead-end job only to find themselves at 18 years of age signing on for unemployment assistance and, perhaps, signing on for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide for the first time that young people will have an avenue of redress against employers who penalise them for not working longer hours than the legislation allows.  Their right of appeal is the rights commissioner after which they may appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The Bill supports measures which are designed to give young people a chance to obtain a certificate or diploma without having to leave the school system or an appropriate training course prematurely and at the same time to boost their chances on the labour market.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not interfere with the opportunities of young persons aged 15 and over to participate in approved training or work experience schemes which will offer valuable training or worthwhile genuine work experience skills, thereby enhancing their job prospects. The new legislation does not seek to impose a ban on the employment of young people on the labour market but to prevent abuse in the way young people's labour is utilised.</P>
    <P>I have examined the issue of working hours for young people.  In 1946 we signed up to the ILO convention on night work by young people and that was implemented in 1977.  The directive to which this Bill gives effect provides that we should not reduce the level of protection currently afforded to young people.  Within the flexibility offered by the directive, the furthest I can go is to allow young people to work up to 11 p.m. but that is restricted to days which are not followed by a school day.  It is extremely important that young people with a part-time job will not be working to the detriment of their schooling.  The Bill provides that 14 year olds cannot work more than seven hours per week <Col N="676" /> and 15 year olds cannot work more than eight hours per week during school term.  Young people under 18 cannot work after 10 p.m. mid-week and after 11 p.m. on days following which there is no school.  Young people should not arrive at school boggle eyed and unable to avail of their education.</P>
    <P>It is important that young people realise that their education must come first and that their schooling must take priority at this stage in their lives.  There is no problem with working short hours but there is a problem when young people work long hours for low wages, often with the complicity of parents or guardians.  In addition, the local community tends not to question cases where young people are working late hours.  The main areas of complaint received by my Department are supermarkets, pubs, catering and fast food establishments, petrol service stations and the general services sector.  Children and young people attending school cannot work until late at night without such work affecting their physical and mental development and having a detrimental effect on their education.  While such children are attending school, everything possible must be done to ensure that they benefit to the greatest extent possible from their education.</P>
    <P>I stress the importance of a balance being struck between providing the necessary protection for young people at work while not unduly hindering their access to suitable employment and to the type of experience they may require in making the transition from school to work.  I am satisfied that this legislation strikes the right balance in this area.  It protects young people from exploitation and gives them a new channel of redress; it increases the penalties for employers who are in default and it provides a regime for working in term time which is complementary to education and does not cut across it.  We have provided the necessary flexibility in the Bill to deal with particular situations, such as young people who baby sit, who work in a family business and those in apprenticeships. I can make such exemptions <Col N="677" /> and regulations provided I am satisfied that the health, safety, welfare and education of the young person is respected in whatever alternative arrangements are put in place.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is a standard interpretation section.  Section 2 empowers the Minister to declare any form of work to be industrial work for the purposes of the Bill.  Section 3 generally prohibits the employment of children under 16 years of age.  However, it allows children to be employed in certain circumstances by licence or regulation.  The employment of children in cultural, artistic, sports and advertising activities may be authorised in individual cases by licence and the employment of children over 13 years of age in such activities may also be authorised by regulation.  That is to allow a group of children, for example working in a film, to be brought under a particular regulation.  Those regulations will deal with the health, safety, welfare and schooling of the young person while they are working in a particular project or film.</P>
    <P>A child over 14 years may do non-industrial light work outside the school term provided the hours of work do not exceed seven hours in any day or 35 hours in any week.  However, it is important that a child has an adequate rest period during the summer holidays before returning to school and so is prohibited from doing any work for at least 21 days during that period.  There is at least a three week holiday break so that the young person will go back to school refreshed and in a position to derive benefit from the next year's school work.</P>
    <P>A child over 15 years is permitted to do light non-industrial work for up to eight hours per week during school term time.  While this is not permitted under the present legislation, it is felt that the short periods of light work, as long as it does not interfere with schooling, can help a child's development.  A child over 14 years and in full-time secondary education may be employed as part of a work experience or education programme for up to eight hours in any day <Col N="678" /> or 40 hours in any week.  A child over 15 years may participate in a training or work experience programme arranged or approved by the Minister or FÁS for up to eight hours in any day or 40 hours in any week.</P>
    <P>Section 4 specifies additional provisions relating to the employment of children, where permitted by licence or regulation under section 3, relating to night work, minimum rest periods and breaks.  A child &mdash; any person under 16 years &mdash; may not be employed between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. and must receive a minimum period of rest of 14 hours in each 24 hour period and two days in any period of seven days.  If it is found necessary for technical or organisational reasons, this two day period may be reduced by regulation to 36 hours.  The section also provides a minimum break period of 30 minutes in any period of work which exceeds four hours.</P>
    <P>Section 5 outlines the duties of an employer in relation to the employment of young people and children.  Before employing a young person or child, the employer must obtain a copy of the birth certificate or other satisfactory evidence of age and, when employing somebody under 16, must obtain the written permission of the parent or guardian.  The employer is also required to maintain a register containing particulars in relation to every young person or child employed by him or her. These provisions are already in the 1977 legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 specifies the circumstances in which an employer may employ a young person between 16 and 18 years of age.  The young person must not be required to work for more than eight hours per day or 40 hours per week.  A young person must not be required to work between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.  This period may be changed to 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. in exceptional circumstances.  He or she must have a minimum rest period of 12 hours in each 24 hour period and two days in any seven day period as well as a 30 minute break in any period of work which exceeds four and a half hours.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> The shipping and fishing sectors are exempted from the minimum rest provisions, provided there are objective grounds for not complying with the provisions and provided the young persons receive compensatory rest times at some time during each 24 hour and seven day period.  The hours of work and night work provisions will not apply to members of the Defence Forces in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 permit, by licence or regulation, the employment of young persons on terms other than those specified in section 6 provided that the terms of such licences and regulations comply with the directive, the health, welfare and safety of the employees is not endangered and compliance with the terms of section 6 would be impractical for technical or organisational reasons; examples are young people who work as racing apprentices and who may have to work later than the normal hours after a race to put the horses back in the stables.  Provisions in the regulations would ensure they get compensatory rest and that their health, safety and welfare would not be endangered.  Such flexibility can be made by regulation.</P>
    <P>Section 9 allows regulations to be made which would exclude employment by close relatives from certain provisions of the legislation.  Such regulations must comply with the terms of the directive and ensure that the health, safety and welfare of the employees will not be affected.</P>
    <P>Section 10 prohibits double employment. This provision is already in the present legislation.  Section 11 provides that any time spent by a young person working under a combined work/ training scheme or in-plant work experience scheme is deemed to be working time.  This provision is also in the present legislation.  Section 12 specifies that every employer must display an abstract of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 13 preserves existing rates of pay and conditions of employment of employees where, in order to comply <Col N="680" /> with the provisions of this Act when it comes into operation, the hours of work might be reduced or altered.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that it will be a defence to any proceedings taken against an employer for a breach of the Act to show that the breach resulted from an emergency.</P>
    <P>Section 15 specifies that the employer must keep records for at least three years to show that he or she is complying with the Act.  Section 16 makes provision for the recovery of money due to an employee.  Section 17 provides that an employee who refuses to co-operate with an employer in breaching the Act shall not be penalised.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that the parent or guardian of a child or young person may refer a complaint to a rights commissioner if the employer has contravened section 13 or section 17.  This is a new provision allowing additional legal protection and an avenue of redress in such situations.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals with appeals from and enforcement of the recommendations of a rights commissioner.  A party may appeal such a recommendation to the Employment Appeals Tribunal within six weeks and the tribunal will issue a determination which affirms, varies or sets aside the recommendations of the rights commissioner.  The section allows a party to appeal a determination of the tribunal to the High Court on a point of law and also provides that the Minister, at the request of the tribunal, may refer a question of law to the High Court for determination.</P>
    <P>Section 20 deals with enforcement of determinations of the tribunal and provides that, in circumstances where an employer fails to implement a determination of the tribunal which has not been appealed, the District Court, on application to it by the Minister or the parent or guardian of the child or young person concerned or the trade union of the young person concerned, may make an order directing the employer to implement the determination without hearing the employer or requiring further evidence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> Section 21 deals with evidence in relation to prosecution of a person for failure to attend before the Employment Appeals Tribunal or refusal to give evidence or failure or refusal to produce documents.</P>
    <P>Section 22 empowers the Minister to appoint inspectors for the purposes of the Act and sets out the powers of these inspectors.  This is similar to the present legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that where an offence is committed by a body corporate, senior officers who act on behalf of such a body shall also be deemed to be guilty of an offence if they knowingly or through neglect allow a breach of the legislation.  This provision is already in the 1977 Act.  Section 24 provides that offences may be prosecuted summarily by the Minister.  An offence, other than an offence under sections 19 and 22, may also be prosecuted by the employee's trade union.</P>
    <P>Section 25 proposes penalties of up to £1,500 on summary conviction.  Where the person after conviction continues to contravene the provision concerned, a fine on summary conviction of up to £250 per day is proposed.  This increase in penalties will, I hope, act as a deterrent against the contravention of the legislation by employers.</P>
    <P>Section 26 repeals sections 15, 41 (1) (b), 45, 47 and 49 (7) of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, and the entire Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977.  While the present legislation could have been amended by regulation or an amending Act in order to implement the directive, it was felt that a single new composite Act would be the more efficient option.</P>
    <P>Section 27 is a standard provision dealing with expenses incurred in the administration of the Act.  Section 28 is a standard requirement relating to orders and regulations made under the legislation.  Section 29 is a standard provision dealing with the short title and date of commencement of the Act.</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill I believe it is important that we protect young people from exploitation by unscrupulous <Col N="682" /> employers and that we ensure their physical and mental health and well being and educational future are safeguarded. It is important to put work in perspective for young people of school going age.  At present, 84.5 per cent of young people stay on at school to do the leaving certificate.  The White Paper on education proposes that this should be increased to 90 per cent.  Virtually all young people covered by this legislation are going through the education system. This is why there is such an emphasis on striking the balance between the worlds of education and work.  In enacting this new Bill and in updating our legislation, we are bringing our laws fully into line with best European practice.  We are showing our practical adoption and concern for our obligations under the European Social Charter and as a member of the International Labour Organisation.</P>
    <P>Good employers have nothing to fear from this Bill.  I am confident that its provisions will enhance the conditions of employment of young people and ensure that their future and the contribution they can make through their work will benefit everybody.  I will be in consultation with the different employer bodies involved on the passing of this Bill to draw attention to the new provisions. My inspectorate in the Department will be very much involved in trying to ensure that this legislation is respected and honoured.</P>
    <P>During the course of preparation, it has come to my attention that the 1977 Act is being broken in a number of respects.  It is important for young people and their employers to ensure we have respect for the law.  I have built a reasonable flexibility into the Bill as drafted.  I have gone as far as possible while reconciling the two objectives of the legislation and keeping to our international obligations.  I expect that employers in turn will respect this law and the young people who work for them and will ensure their future is safeguarded and is not set back by them taking up jobs in their important teenage years.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome many aspects of this Bill.  I am in favour of its overall thrust, for which I compliment the Minister and her predecessor, who also followed the 1994 EU directive. While both the Minister and her predecessor were coming from the same base, there are some parts of the Bill I would like to discuss.</P>
      <P>This Bill is welcome because it brings the 1936 and the 1977 legislation for the protection and employment of young people under the one umbrella &mdash; the Minister said it would avoid cross references and confusion.  Anything we can do to facilitate people knowing their rights is welcome and we should be aiming to make the process more user friendly.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with the protection of young people between 14 to 16 and 16 to 18 years of age in employment.  Its thrust is facilitating, in the transition from education to work, whether one should take precedence over the other, whether there should be a balance between the two and how best we can get that right.  This is not easy because there is a difference of opinion about the age a young person should be before being allowed to work or if they should only be allowed to work part time.  It is arbitrary in the sense that it may work well for one student while not for another.</P>
      <P>We are trying to put education first, to ensure that every child gets a good education before they start working and to prepare them for working while they are being educated and not send them straight from one to another.  One should complement the other; that is the new change in second level schools. Many education commentators would strongly support playing a joint role judging how best we can work together as a community and the school developing the potential of every student.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation is mainly concerned in consulting with parents and teachers &mdash; I did not hear much about that process in the Minister's speech but it would have to have been there.  When a consultation <Col N="684" /> process involving young people between 16 and 18 years of age is taking place, school authorities, parents and employers like to know what is happening. We are becoming more community oriented in our education process. It should be strongly reinforced that we are not just glibly saying in the legislation that only consultation is involved; it is more than that.  It is part of our current education process that parents come to the schools to meet the teachers and <i>vice versa.</i>  It is not a case of a parent calling a teacher to say that their child is starting employment; it is a growing process.  I want to strengthen that consultation aspect of the Bill on Committee Stage.  We must find a balance between education and maturity. An 18 year old may not be able to do a certain job but a 14 year old might be ideal for it.  It is not right to set down arbitrary lines in the Bill, such as saying that nobody under 16 years of age should be working longer than one hour per evening or eight hours per week.</P>
    <P>We want to put school first.  However, I am conscious of the number of young people who drop out of the education process.  Many students in my school and living in the surrounding areas would leave education if they could find a job.  Many of them want to get their junior certificate and move into an apprenticeship.  They do not want to stay in school any longer because there is nothing there for them.  While I encourage education, I would also tell 15 and 16 year olds to take work if they can get it.  If they are interested in the catering or service industries, for example, they should get a part-time job on a Saturday or Sunday.  Teachers will know quickly if they are suffering from exhaustion or tiredness.  The majority of them can cope with it and want to do so.  Many do not have much choice because of their disadvantaged backgrounds &mdash; they may not have any back up services.</P>
    <P>We should try to keep them in school and let them take a part-time job.  They are being introduced to a work ethic and, at the same time, are being given <Col N="685" /> the space to do their schooling and hold down a part-time job.  Many school subjects are practical and hands on in nature and do not need much study.  These young people can follow a good leaving or junior certificate programme without suffering major study pressures.  Two hours' study can get a 15 or 16 year old through the junior certificate if they wish.  Most students will not want to do any major work at that stage, but there is a percentage of students who would need to be able to do two hours' work in the evening.  Alternatively, they may work two nights per week in the local bar.  In such cases they come in at 8 p.m. as a lounge boy or girl, are picked up by their parents, older brother or sister at midnight and are able for school the next day.</P>
    <P>Teachers would be the first to say to the student or parents that he or she cannot work any more because they are suffering from exhaustion.  Therefore, the Minister should allow the school authorities and parents to take a greater role in monitoring the situation. Students under 15 years of age should be allowed work one hour per night, not after 8 p.m.  I have no difficulty with the 35 hours per week during the summer and three weeks holidays, but students should be allowed to work two or three nights per week in service industries.  I am working with the system so I know it can work, but I agree with the Minister that it is important to strike a balance. The Minister should really leave that particular aspect of it be more flexible. She should allow the parents and the school authorities to have a big say in it because these are the people who monitor the situation closely.</P>
    <P>Students between the ages of 16 to 18 are in senior cycle.  Many of these students are in transition year, the first year, and much of that programme is hands-on project work, which is often tied to a particular local issue.  Work experience is incorporated into that year, which, I appreciate, is excluded from the provisions being discussed.  I have no difficulty with that at all &mdash; that is as it should be.  Many of these <Col N="686" /> students do not need to study that year. It is not a study year; it is a transition from junior cycle to senior cycle.  It is an improving year for the student, yet the Minister is denying these students a job for themselves.  That is not right.  It is extremely wrong that she should make a blanket statement that no student between the ages of 16 and 18 can work during term.  I know the Minister has changed this today so that students can work up to 11 p.m. and are restricted to the extent to which she referred.  I must come down strongly on this.  It is incorrect to enforce such a draconian measure on those students.  I know; I work with them.  I know exactly what they are capable of doing.  I know there are fine students who would gain from working and being at school.  They would like the concept.  If the Minister deprives them of that, they will leave school and get a job because many of them do not want to be in school at all. These students are looking for the right job.  If it comes right and the Minister deprives them of it with this legislation, it is not right and I would be strongly against such a measure for that particular year group.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with it for leaving certificate students when there is pressure and much study to be done.  I have seen students exhausted and undernourished in class because of the pressure of study.  In such cases I would tell students that they cannot be working late and studying, that they must take periods of rest.  Again, that should be left to the school authorities and parents or guardians, as the case may be, to facilitate students.  That can happen only from February to June.  From September to January, and particularly in the lead up to Christmas, there is a great opportunity to get their own sample of work experience, which has nothing to do with schooling and the work experience programme.  It gives them a golden opportunity to make a little money.  You will not find them in school anyway during the three weeks before Christmas because the attendance falls off totally around the first week of December.  The <Col N="687" /> Minister has not taken that into account.  She has deprived them of working in the first week of December in the run up to Christmas when students need extra money for their Christmas shopping.  This is a golden opportunity for young people to get involved in the world of work and I see no mention of that in the Minister's contribution.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter which would worry me is if the Minister made it too hard for the youngster to stay on at school and get a job for fear of working beyond the times to which she referred.  She is saying that the employer must demand a birth certificate, have a register and a licence and that she must police it.  Such provisions would put off an employer immediately.  If I telephoned an employer on behalf of a 16 year old student and said that the student had been on a work experience programme, that this was not part of this year's work experience programme but he was dying to work and needed the money; and if the employer had a little job between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. everyday, the child could not take the job because the Minister would have put an embargo on such employment.  The employer would also be obliged to see the student's birth certificate, have a licence and register the job.  If the employer did not abide by these regulations, there would be a penalty.  That is so off-putting in this day and age that I would not want to put an employer in that situation.</P>

      <P>Most new career paths are in service industries.  Most relevant jobs are in the restaurant business, the fast-food business, recreation and leisure centres, and baby-sitting or child care, all of which are outside of the traditional 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. day.  It will be difficult to regulate it.  Employers will have to measure it in terms of when a student can work as a result of the changes in the regulations.</P>
      <P>The old school of thinking was based on a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. day and this Bill is based on that thinking too.  It does not take into consideration the variation of career paths and opportunities for young people which are coming on stream today.  It makes it difficult to facilitate the transition from education to work and to allow people to combine both.  My big problem with this Bill is that it puts a stop on people's development, even though the Minister made a point of balancing education and work in her contribution.  I do not think the Minister is getting that balance right. She must examine that matter again in the context of the service industries.</P>
      <P>I welcome the aspects of redress in the Bill, which provides an avenue, in the rights commissioner and, eventually, the Labour Tribunal, for young people who find themselves being exploited.  It is useful to know that these provisions exist.  As educationalists, we know how to link in with the rights commissioners should a young student of 14 to 16, or one of 16 to 18, be caught in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many young people start third level education at the age of 17, and many of that age I know of are doing arts <Col N="689" /> degrees at the moment.  I asked some how they were managing to do it. According to this Bill every one of them would be outside the law, yet they have no difficulty working for money to buy books and cover their weekly expenses. Employers do not mind either and they treat young people very well.  The students did not like to think there would be a curtailment on work by 17 year olds in third level education.</P>
    <P>While they want to work, they will now be impeded from doing so in fast food outlets, bars and restaurants as well as by baby-sitting.  They will do anything to cover their maintenance costs and earn pocket money to stay in college because maintenance grants are insufficient to cover all the expenses involved.  This is a draconian measure for many 17 year old students who are starting college having passed the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the school leaving age will be raised to 16, but many students sitting the leaving certificate at 17 will be caught in this situation. I have huge reservations about the Bill's provisions as regards part-time work for the 16 to 18 age group.  I also have reservations regarding transition year students, who do not have to have the same curriculum in the school as leaving certificate students.  We are trying to hold them in school at that age, but there should be flexibility to allow them to earn money doing part-time jobs before Easter and Christmas.  In my experience of dealing with young people, it is very difficult to keep them at school from the first week of December because they want to get jobs to earn pocket money coming up to Christmas.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider how best we can facilitate students in that regard.  It goes without saying I welcome the fact that the Minister is allowing flexibility in relation to cultural activities, artistic adventures and educational programmes.  However, has the Minister taken into account the variety of change that has taken place within educational curricula?  One can take a variety of subjects <Col N="690" /> in the junior certificate, for example, that do not require a huge amount of study or pressure, particularly if one is taking a lower level paper.</P>
    <P>Many students would like to be able to work and educate themselves at the one time, but the Minister is saying education must come first.  However, many parents left school early themselves in order to work and all they want for their children is a job.  I am all for education but it may not be what many parents want.</P>
    <P>I am an educationalist by profession so I am promoting the thrust of what the Minister is saying, but many parents just want their children to get jobs.  Such parents have told me that if their children could get jobs they would not stay on in education.  If jobs arise in the local supermarket or elsewhere these parents are delighted to send them down at 4 o'clock because it may provide an opportunity to work there full-time next year.  Why should children not do that?</P>
    <P>Parents acknowledge that most teachers like to strike a balance for their students between education and work. The Minister should leave it to school authorities to decide what is important for the 14 to 16 age group because while one student may be mature enough to cope with work, another of the same age may not.  In that sense it is hard to make a ruling in a Bill that puts everyone under the same umbrella concerning the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>The law is important and we must abide by it, but we should thrash this issue out carefully in consultation with teachers.  The Minister said she spoke to many teachers and so have I.  I discussed all these points in my own staff room with a cross section of 20 teachers, each of whom pointed out that the measure was too strong for many students who could cope with part-time work.  They said the Minister should allow flexibility for parents and school authorities to work closely together.  The Minister mentioned the word &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; but it needs to be spelt out in more detail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> I am not disputing that overall the Bill is a good one.  We must, however, get a balance in education, which should come first.  I am experienced enough as an educationalist to say that sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 are a bit tough, involving children in the age categories 14 to 16, and 16 to 18.  I do not know whether the Minister got a consensus of opinion when she consulted teachers.  Most teachers I spoke to felt that part of the Bill lacked flexibility.  While the Minister should re-examine that, I congratulate her on the overall thrust of the measure which contains many good elements.</P>
    <P>I am well aware there has been exploitation by employers both in supermarkets and the fast food business because I am a link person dealing with school and workplaces.  Once school authorities link in with employers, however, they are very co-operative. Employers whose businesses are near to schools are anxious to help and work with the school system relating to both age groups, although it is more difficult with the 16 to 18 year old group.  At that stage one is talking about adults so it is a different ball game.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not flexible enough, but perhaps improvements can be made on Committee Stage.  I would be delighted to have a further discussion with the Minister then.  Many people I have spoken to say the Minister has not got it absolutely right.  I know it is difficult to get it all right, but I am anxious about that aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  As the Minister and Senator Ormonde indicated, we are talking about a substantial number of students of school going age.  Some 84 per cent of students today will sit the leaving certificate and a substantial number of them, particularly those doing transition year, want temporary employment.  We must ensure they are not exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation will bring us in line with European Union regulations.  I <Col N="692" /> understood Senator Ormonde to say that each employer would contact the school about potential employees. According to my information, many schools would not know that students were working long hours and would only find out when they fell behind or there were problems with their school work.</P>
    <P>Many students like the opportunity to earn some money, particularly in the service industry, to help pay for school books or for socialising.  Many commentators will say that some of the students we are trying to protect are being exploited &mdash; we could all cite examples of this.  We are talking about extending working hours to 11 p.m., but I wonder how many prosecutions have been taken against employers.  Have we successfully convicted and fined anyone over the years?  Do we have any data in this regard?  Often employees want to work all the hours God sends.  What are the penalties?</P>
    <P>These issues are frequently discussed on local radio when presenters throw out a carrot.  It seems that the majority of students like to see if they can hold down a job, even a temporary one.  It gives them the opportunity to gain experience before they go out into the world.  As Senator Ormonde said, a number of parents will say that their children are still at school because there are no opportunities for them in the workplace or for apprenticeships.  There are not enough opportunities and incentives for employers to give young people the chance for an apprenticeship.  Not enough people are going into apprenticeships today.  A person only discovers that when they must wait a week or a fortnight for a qualified person to carry out work in their house.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Rourke was Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment we discussed the need for a system in which local authorities, when building houses, would, with the help of FÁS, take on and train people in apprenticeships, such as carpentry and bricklaying.  Many <Col N="693" /> of my colleagues in primary school who went to vocational school ended up in trades and now successfully run their own businesses.  This is not happening today and it is the reason 84 per cent of students sit the leaving certificate and that so many children are looking for temporary employment at a young age. We have not dealt significantly with this issue.  The Culliton report did not take on board and emphasise what should be done in this area.</P>
    <P>Trade unions do their best to make their members aware of the laws.  In County Meath the Council of Trade Unions has a say in the approval of FÁS schemes in tourism and other areas.  It has the power to withhold approval of some schemes and this has happened with the tourism company of which I am chairman.  There must be some give and take.  Many young people who want the opportunity to obtain six to 12 months' training in tourism, which is the fastest growing industry, have come to me because of my position.  Perhaps these young people, who are disappointed that they will not get the opportunity to gain experience and training, will miss out on the possibility of a permanent job.</P>
    <P>The Bill updates and regulates procedures in terms of our European Union commitments.  However, it is hard to get everything right.  Although we are changing the hours of work, we all know many of these young people will work longer hours because they want to and their employers will not pass any comment.  I do not foresee the scenario Senator Ormonde outlined as regards the involvement of schools because they have an enormous amount of work to do.  I am delighted to hear that many employers in the Dublin area, in which Senator Ormonde works, contact schools for recommendations.  I have no problem with that, but it is not the case in the country where people deal with each other more on a one to one basis.  Individuals know the families involved and the picture painted by Senator Ormonde does not compare like with like. <Col N="694" /> I concur to some extent with Senator Ormonde's point about the transition years.  Students get an opportunity during this year to work for six weeks, if they can secure a placement, and many of them are glad to have the chance.  It gives them an appetite for work and, as soon as they get their holidays, they want to earn some money.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to protect vulnerable students.  Some cowboy employers exploit their positions and pay people the least amount possible.  It is right to have legislation to ensure people caught doing this continuously are punished. The details of the Bill regarding the fines which can be imposed will be teased out during Committee and Report Stages.  However, I am interested to know the number of people prosecuted since the legislation was introduced in 1977.  I have not read many reports in newspapers about such cases, and I am sure there were not many.</P>

      <P>If the Senator is correct, I welcome it because the purpose of the Bill is to protect young students.  When one reaches 17 or 18 years of age, one is capable, if one is willing, of a fair amount of work.  However, such work takes much more out of younger people. I know how tired they get and how quickly, from watching my children and others who have been in that position. The aim of the Bill is to protect them and ensure they are in a position to take full advantage of their time in school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to the Minister's reply.  However, I am not 100 per cent happy.  I have no problem <Col N="695" /> with the idea that every student should have the opportunity to do the leaving certificate but I have a serious problem when students, who do the leaving certificate and want to do apprenticeships, say they are two years too old and they are not willing to enter the system.  Ample jobs are available in that area, and not just in Ireland.  I am not suggesting they should go abroad but many people are seeking trainees and they cannot find them.</P>
    <P>We must look at the overall picture to see whether thousands of people can be brought into trades annually.  Given the way the system has been geared over the past ten years, people are not entering trades.  A neighbour in the building business told me six months ago that he wanted top class qualified people with specific skills but they were not available.  I asked him how many apprentices he had.  He said he did not have any because the system is too costly.</P>
    <P>An overall package to rejuvenate the system, which would give such employers an incentive to take on apprentices, should be considered. There is no doubt that a percentage of the students in second level education wish to learn a trade but the opportunities do not exist.  The Government must create the environment for industries to provide these opportunities. This would relieve much of the pressure on third level education places.  I hope something can be done about this matter over the next couple of years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to find out how many children are involved in employment, but a considerable number work in cafés, restaurants, shops and supermarkets. It is difficult to get statistics but I was lucky to come across a book by Dr. <Col N="696" /> Jean Whyte, the senior lecturer in psychology in Trinity College, Dublin, called <i>Changing Times: Challenges to Identity</i> which examined the situations of children between the ages of 12 and 13 years in west Belfast, east Belfast, London and Dublin.  The main purpose of the research was to consider the effects of the troubles on children in Belfast and compare them to children elsewhere.  However, the book also contains much other useful information.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the lower end of the employment spectrum and I am delighted Senator Ormonde and Senator Farrelly took the other end. The book contains interesting statistics about children between the ages of 12 and 13 years in working class areas of west Belfast, east Belfast, London and Dublin.  The children were asked if they had paid employment on a regular basis and 74 per cent in Dublin said yes.  This was the highest level; in west Belfast 72 per cent of the children said they had regular employment, while the levels were 66 per cent in east Belfast and 44 per cent in London.  The figures changed slightly over ten years, but the biggest change was in London where there was a decrease.  This was not due to the fact that children in London had more money but rather that job opportunities decreased there.</P>
    <P>The researchers found that those who had the least opportunity to work had the lowest level of work.  It is interesting that children from more affluent areas were just as likely to try to get jobs as those from poorer areas.  The group measured affluence in terms of whether the family had a car, a television set, a telephone, etc.  The children's socio-economic criteria were perhaps different from those of the researchers. However, they found that children from middle class homes were just as keen to get work and the important point was its availability.  This is also important in terms of adults.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 74 per cent at work in Dublin, children there also earned the most.  They earned more than children in the other areas and, over a ten <Col N="697" /> year period, their earnings increased the most; indeed, earnings increased everywhere except London.  I do not know whether to blame Mrs. Thatcher or Lady Porter for what has happened to employment among 12 year olds in London but I am sure one of them is responsible.</P>
    <P>The children earned surprising amounts of money.  Some earned over £20 in Dublin, which is not bad, but most only earned £5.  Girls were inclined to earn less than boys.  Women earn 70 per cent of the average male industrial wage and it is interesting that in 1992 girls earned £4 to nearly £6 for boys &mdash; not too far off the 70 per cent rate for adults.</P>
    <P>The amounts of time worked in the various jobs were not given.  However, an indication was given of the jobs done. Gardening and car washing were popular in all locations.  In west Belfast more children were employed in shops and cafés while in east Belfast and Dublin children did paper rounds.  Boys were more inclined to be involved in paper rounds than girls.  In London children did housework.  Baby-sitting, shopping and pet care were also mentioned, but the sought after jobs were paper rounds, car washing, working in cafés and shops and these were twice as likely to be the jobs held by boys &mdash; 27 per cent &mdash; as opposed to girls &mdash; 15 per cent.  They were also inclined to be the better paid jobs.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about the deleterious effects on children of working when at school.  However, the research found that children who had jobs were much more likely to be independent, to have greater self-esteem and to be more self-reliant.  Therefore, there are positive aspects to their employment.  The children involved were young teenagers who did not have to face imminent exam pressure.  The children did not feel their homework had suffered.  They seemed to do an incredible amount of homework &mdash; apart from boys in west Belfast who appeared to do no homework &mdash; and they suggested they did up <Col N="698" /> to two or three hours homework in the afternoons.</P>
    <P>The research also looked at why the children wanted to earn money and what they did with it.  Although some of them got respectable amounts of pocket money, they were keen to get money for themselves.  The vast majority of the money went on sweets.  Clothes were popular with girls, although by 1992 boys were catching up in that regard. The money was also spent on tapes, comics, records, space invaders, charities, youth clubs and, in surprisingly large numbers, savings.  Nearly 80 per cent of children in Ireland, North and South, saved.  In 1981 in Dublin the figure was 90 per cent whereas in London the figure was about 60 per cent.  The economic situation in both countries having changed, the children in Dublin decided they could be more flaithiúlach with their money and the number saving reduced to under 80 per cent, while a terror had seized the hearts of those in London and the figure increased to the same figure.</P>
    <P>We have also talked about the deleterious effect of work on children's academic life.  However, work may have an effect on the amount of time children have for sport and games, which are very important in the early teenage years.  Little emphasis is put on sport in national schools because primary school teachers feel they do not have enough training in physical education and there is a fear of litigation in the case of accidents. Some teachers who have an interest in sport are good at organising games for children.</P>
    <P>Too little emphasis is put on physical fitness for children and in the early teens life patterns may be set regarding health.  This may be healthy eating week, but it is not just what one eats that is important.  Exercise is also very important for fitness.  Dr. Tony Watson of the physical education and sports sciences department of the University of Limerick carried out a study into the fitness of Irish school children between the ages of 9 and 12 and its results were worrying.  The survey was published in <Col N="699" /> the <i>Irish Journal of Medical Science</i> and a précis was published in the <i>Irish Medical Times.</i>  Over 1,100 children in Counties Cork, Galway, Mayo, Limerick, Waterford and Wexford were measured, weighed and tested for physical fitness, muscle co-ordination etc. and were compared with similar groups in Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, Great Britain and Finland.</P>
    <P>A histogram was produced which was depressing because on international averages of physical characteristics and fitness the Irish children only exceed the mean in one category &mdash; skin folds or, in other words, fatness.  The study ties in well with the Kilkenny health project which found that 50 per cent of people were overweight and that about 20 per cent of women and 14 or 15 per cent of men were obese.  It seems this phenomenon is setting in as early as 12 years of age.</P>
    <P>The study indicated there was much less physical education in our national schools and little structured work on the development of balance, flexibility, the strength of arms, shoulders, trunk and upper back etc.  It found that 46 per cent of boys and 71 per cent of girls do not undertake the minimum amount of aerobic exercise required to have a training effect on the cardiovascular system. Whatever exercise they may get working in shops or restaurants, very little of it could be described as aerobic. It is important to focus on the health aspect in this debate.</P>
    <P>In the flexibility category Irish children were at only 60 per cent of the mean and this may be an important factor in so many of the adult population having serious back problems.  We have poor muscle development and little knowledge of how to bend correctly. In the arm and shoulder strength category the Irish children were at 80 per cent of comparable values and the study concluded that this indicates poor strength and muscle development of the shoulders, arms and forearms.  The scores were very low for hand to eye co-ordination, suggesting a low level of <Col N="700" /> participation in activities that develop co-ordination and motor skills.  A large amount of employment requires dexterity, co-ordination and motor skills and the study's results would seem to bode ill in that regard.  The Irish children did not score badly in the 25 metre sprint, where the boys were almost up to the average.</P>
    <P>We must be careful not to focus exclusively on academic life and schooling. The jobs gave children good self-esteem, a sense of indepedence and self-worth. It is interesting to note that stress was placed on young people's economic needs.  Children in their latter teens must deal with the high cost of books and college fees and I recently spent £50 on a paperback book for one of my children. Time spent in college is extraordinarily expensive, particularly for people whose mothers are not capable of providing financial support.</P>
    <P>We must carefully consider the lack of emphasis placed on physical fitness for children and young people.  Much of the bone structure, muscle co-ordination and power developed in childhood becomes established during teenage years.  Young people also develop an interest in certain sports.  In Dr. White's survey, children were questioned about games, sports, etc., in which they were interested and most of them only appeared to be in a position to undertake team games.  Such games are often fun, but a person playing as a defender in a good hockey team might be left idle for the duration of the game. Children were asked about tennis, swimming, table tennis, athletics and bowling.  It is a depressing fact that while many expressed an interest, it was very hard for children in Dublin to become involved in such sports.  This problem seemed to worsen between 1981 and 1992.</P>
    <P>It also came to light that the availability of facilities for gymnastics in Dublin is 7 per cent.  This is incredible when we consider that the sport of gymnastics does not require a large amount of equipment, particularly if instructors are trained to teach floor exercises. <Col N="701" /> Children need not leap about on balance beams or jump over vaulting horses to take part in gymnastics when they can be taught floor exercises in large groups.  There is a serious lack of people who are in a position to become involved in teaching children in this regard.  Perhaps more emphasis should be placed on sending PE teachers to visit groups of primary schools to see if this can become a more important part of the curriculum.</P>
    <P>The survey in question also uncovered the fact that the greatest increase in numbers of people watching television occurred in Dublin.  There was a very large increase in people watching TV soap operas in the Dublin area between 1981 and 1992.  Soap operas cannot be described as promoting physical exercise or furthering educational progress.  The children surveyed did not watch programmes which dealt with nature or learning trades or skills. The increase in watching soap operas is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope that the Minister of State, when promoting the legislation, will try to stress that it is important that children's time should not merely be spent attending school and becoming tired from doing too much homework.  There must be a serious consideration of findings such as those of Dr. Watson regarding the health of our children.  Irish people have the highest levels of coronary and cardiovascular disease in Europe.  Northern Irish people experience similar levels and, therefore, it is perhaps a genetic predisposition or reflects our liking for fried food &mdash; which is being improved by our consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables.  Irish adults also have very high levels of blood lipids which can be reduced by physical exercise, etc.</P>
    <P>Perhaps too much blame is being placed on genetics, the Ulster fry or cabbage and bacon.  It is possible that we have become a nation of couch potatoes who sit around and do not take enough exercise.  This begins in childhood and continues into the teenage years when people stagger to the local café where <Col N="702" /> they work in the evenings, eating chips as they do so.  This problem must not be underestimated because Irish men and women experience the highest level of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease in Europe.  Women in particular are seriously affected in this regard. Considering the low level of involvement of Irish teenagers in sports, we must look carefully at this area.  When the Minister of State discusses the legislation with employers, etc., perhaps she could emphasise that we are anxious about the amount of time children spend away from their school books and she might stress that the amount of time to be devoted to physical exercise is extremely important.</P>

      <P>I welcome this piece of legislation.  I am glad that Senator Henry widened the debate to take account of activities enjoyed by teenagers other than those of studying and working.  From my experience, teenagers lead very busy lives and have a wide variety of things on their minds apart from reading books or earning money.  I agree with the Senator's point about the amount of time people, particularly children, spend watching television, which seems to be increasing dramatically.  It cannot be good for health or education when programmes such as the &ldquo;Oprah Winfrey Show&rdquo; and soap operas occupy the minds of many teenagers.</P>
      <P>Last night I spent 90 minutes watching an under 16 soccer final and I concur with Senator Henry's statements about the importance of sport for young people.  Sport was by far the most important event in the day of those I watched playing soccer last night and it was certainly more important than the time they spent at school earlier in the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State and other contributors stated, this Bill involves balancing some level of flexibility with regard to young people being able to work while attending school.  However, I am also of the opinion that education must come first.  If we consider the unemployment figures and statistics <Col N="703" /> relating to the long-term unemployed, there is no doubt that young people who leave school at an early age or do not obtain educational qualifications are much more likely to join the ranks of the long-term unemployed than those who complete their leaving certificate, obtain a qualification and pursue third level education.  It is crucial that we ensure that education takes precedence in relation to this legislation.</P>
    <P>I agree that working to a limited extent can be very positive and often makes young people more mature, selfreliant and self-confident.  I have met teenagers who are unsteady, giddy and not particularly interested in doing well at school.  Taking a summer job or working at weekends often gives such people a sense of self-worth and makes them feel that they can do something worthwhile. These children like to have money in their pockets to buy designer jeans and fashionable running shoes. Access to their own money also means that they can look after themselves if their parents do not have high incomes. The opportunities young people receive during transition year to become involved in work experience can be very valuable.  They can also avail of the many opportunities to which Senator Henry referred such as lifesaving, sport, leadership training, helping to organise events and engage in community work with elderly people, etc.  The balance must come down in favour of education.</P>
    <P>Work can be very seductive for young people, particularly 16 and 17 year olds. Earning money can be more seductive than doing school work and therefore, there must be some regulation.  There must be a point at which it is made clear to a young person that he or she needs to get an education and that, if they want long-term prospects of earning a decent living, school work is more important than the work they do outside of school.</P>
    <P>There is an argument &mdash; and Senator Ormonde used it to some extent &mdash; that if one works part-time it gives one an opportunity to gain experience and, to <Col N="704" /> some extent, that does happen. However, sometimes employers exploit young people and this Bill aims to stop that.  I remember hearing a man say that his son, who was working in a petrol station, would have to give it up because he could no longer work for what he described as &ldquo;boy's wages&rdquo;.  He had turned 18 and obviously his employer was not going to pay him what an 18 year old should be paid.</P>
    <P>There are sectors &mdash; and I would put petrol stations and some pubs in this category &mdash; which exploit young people and use them as cheap labour.  These would not necessarily be sectors which are doing any worse than other employment sectors.  We seem to accept that in certain categories of work it is all right to exploit young people while we do not accept it in other categories.  Young people are employed mainly in service industries.</P>
    <P>The operation is the legislation is obviously more honoured in the breach than in the upholding.  I would also be interested to hear the answer to Senator Farrelly's question about how many people have been prosecuted under the 1977 Act which prohibits young people aged 16 and 17 years from working after 10 p.m.  This Bill will give more leeway and allow them to work until 11 p.m. provided they do not have school the following day.  Therefore, it is not true to say that this legislation is more restrictive in that area.  It is being a bit more honest and facing up to the issues.</P>
    <P>I agree that the working hours of people under 16 should be curtailed during school time.  Many teachers talk about children coming to school looking tired and unable to perform.  They are the very children who will lose out and may, in ten years' time, end up as part of the unemployment statistics.  Admittedly, sometimes they are tired because they stayed up late at night watching some violent film on television but, one way or the other, it is not a good thing. We can control what they do in work terms but I do not know how we can control what happens in their own <Col N="705" /> homes if they are watching television late at night.  That is for another debate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of rest periods. There is a danger that eagerness to make money might mean that young people would be exploited.  The legislation implements the EC directive under the Social Charter, which is about the protection of people generally.  The charter tries to find a balance and ensure that people are not exploited. There are many measures under the Social Charter and this is just one. However, it is an important aspect because we are all aware of the problems associated with young people now and their vulnerability to all sorts of abuse.  We will be talking about drugs tomorrow but there are many areas in which young people can be abused and we must do what we can to protect them.</P>
    <P>We can all look back and say a good education is important.  Many adults are taking the opportunity under VETOS and other schemes to further their education while others regret the fact that they did not stay in school longer.  That is all very well to say that with hindsight but often young people only look to the immediate term.  They look at the few bob they will get in their pockets and they may not appreciate that their education is important.  It is not particularly trendy to like going to school or to want to stay in school.  It is understandable, therefore, that if young people had a free rein they might leave school in their droves.</P>
    <P>The current figures are very good. Senator Farrelly and the Minister mentioned that 84 per cent of young people go on to sit the leaving certificate.  The White Paper on education aspires to having 90 per cent going on to leaving certificate level in the near future. There is no doubt that provides the best opportunity for young people in the long term.  Times are different now. Many people of my generation left school at 13 and 14, got a trade and got a good living.  They were not particularly adversely affected by the fact that <Col N="706" /> they left school early.  It is not like that now.  We must look at the reality of the current competition for jobs and accept that leaving school early is not a recipe for a successful career or life.  Obviously, there are exceptions but generally that is the reality.</P>
    <P>How will the policing aspect of the Bill be implemented?  The current legislation to protect young people does not seem to be effective in relation to late night work.  The Minister will have the opportunity to introduce regulations to appoint inspectors.  I hope they will be effective and that there will be enough of them to ensure that young people are protected.</P>
    <P>It is important that young people have a right of appeal to a rights commissioner and, if necessary, the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Senator Ormonde was concerned that employers would not abide by the rules and would not bother to look for birth certificates or to keep records.  If they are not obliged to do that there is no way a young person can get redress.  The employer could just say he or she did not know the young person was only 16 or 17 years of age.  If records are not kept, one cannot prove that a young person was exploited.  Whether employers like it or not they will have to comply with a certain amount of what might be described as red tape.</P>
    <P>The only way one can protect people is to ensure that the person who might exploit them abides by certain rules. Most employers probably would not want to exploit young people but some do.  We all know of situations where young people work long hours late at night, get low wages and, in effect, deny adults the possibility of getting jobs.  If employers are using many underage people and paying them low wages, they are obviously not employing adults. There are many people on the live register and no sector can be allowed to overuse young people to the detriment of adults who need jobs.  That is an important factor.</P>
    <P>Babysitting was touched on but the Minister spoke about it in the Dáil.  My <Col N="707" /> understanding is that there would not be any great curtailment of young people's opportunities to babysit.  It is traditional and works quite well in that young people babysit in their spare time in the evenings.  It provides a good service for many stressed parents who need to get away from their darlings.  It also provides an opportunity for young people to earn money in their own community. It is a safe way for young people to get out and begin to make some money for themselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation.  It gets the balance right between protecting young people and giving them an opportunity to get out, spread their wings and learn to rely on themselves to earn some money.  They are considered responsible enough to do a job but it should not be the overriding factor in their lives.  Many of them might come from families which do not have large incomes and there might be pressure on them to earn money to supplement those incomes. That is fine so long as it is not to the detriment of the child's future opportunities. The children must be protected.</P>
    <P>Young people like to have part-time work.  It brings variety as well as income and experience into their lives.  They are well capable of balancing their lives and of fitting in the various aspects of education, sport, recreation and work. Obviously, there are times when employment is not appropriate and the Bill covers that area.  The legislation permits young people to work during school holidays and is restrictive on work during school terms so they will put the emphasis on their studies.  During the holidays many parents are delighted to see their children secure employment.  I am a parent of teenagers and the holidays are very long, particularly if the children are not in examination classes.  Holiday work, in addition to giving teenagers an opportunity to earn money, occupies them during the summer, a time when some of us might be a little worried about what they might do otherwise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> I welcome the Bill and look forward to further discussion of its provisions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I see nothing wrong with the Bill but I also see nothing right with it.  I doubt that it will do anything more than militate against young people getting jobs.  There is huge unemployment in this country, but unofficially there is little unemployment.  The quantity of red tape involved in employing people is so great that nobody is taking on employees.  Instead, employers use lump or contract systems and offer limited employment.  Our big problem is that we have gone over the top with bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that there are many cowboy employers who exploit young people.  I have been an employer for a number of years and I live beside Bundoran, which is a famous holiday destination and which I have visited on numerous occasions.  I have never seen young people being exploited there. The &ldquo;exploitation of youth&rdquo; is a great slogan but it is unproven.  Most employers are parents themselves who have reared or are rearing a family. They know how to treat young people. Listening to some Senators, one would think that employers had never had their own families and were awful monsters who do not respect human beings. That is far from the truth.  By and large, employers are parents who have reared families and know how to take care of people.  It is grossly unfair to use the word &ldquo;exploitation&rdquo; and I take grave exception to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said that she did not want children arriving boggle-eyed to school.  What teacher has ever told her about a child arriving at school boggle-eyed from overwork?  Every teacher in the country will tell her that children as young as 12 arrive at school boggle-eyed with the effects of drink and drugs. That is where the trouble lies.  It does not lie with cowboy employers but with parents not taking sufficient interest in their children and letting them get involved with drink and drugs.  If we are <Col N="709" /> serious about taking care of children that is the problem we should tackle.</P>
    <P>When I see children begging on the streets I wonder about our caring society.  What are we doing about those children?  When I drive through Sligo at ten and 11 o'clock at night I regularly see children of ten and 12 years of age around the streets.  What are we doing to take care of those children or the children who rob cars and go joyriding? They are the children for whom we should care.  If they were with employers they would not be as badly abused as they are on the streets.</P>
    <P>Many children are not at school today.  Go to any housing estate and one will see many children out playing in the middle of the day instead of being at school.  What are we doing about inspectors to ensure that those children go to school?  We talk so piously about education one would think we were saints, but we do not care about those children. Where are the school attendance officers?  We employ inspectors to prosecute employers, but why can we not employ school attendance officers?  We are told that there are no resources, but that is where we should direct our money and our efforts.  We are also great at talking about EU directives and, of course, we must comply with them.  However, when it comes to cheap motor cars or taxation we find a way around them.  We do not benefit from all EU directives.  We get the harsh winds and none of the sunny breezes.</P>
    <P>I worked every Saturday after reaching 12 years of age.  I agree with Senator Henry that children who go out to work have an aptitude for work.  Employers are also educators.  They teach young people to be punctual and how to do the job properly.  Years ago young people who started work at 15 or 16 years of age learned how to read the newspaper at work, often because their workmates were reading it and talking about sport. They also learned far more from employers and their colleagues at work. If any member of the workforce tried to blackguard a young person, there was always a solid individual to defend that <Col N="710" /> employee and advise the antagonist to take on somebody his own age and size. There was always a senior member of the workforce to ensure that the young person got a fair crack of the whip. There were checks and balances to ensure that there was no exploitation.</P>
    <P>This Bill will make it impossible for anybody to employ young people.  They will not want to hire them and will not have to.  There is something wrong with a society in which everybody is getting out of employment.  The reason for it happening in our society is the plethora of rules and regulations.  Now, if a woman calls to a shopkeeper and asks him to take on a youngster for two or three months of the summer, the answer will be no.  An employer will not take on the bother of more administration; he already has too much.  The result of this legislation is that an employer will not take on a young person for holiday employment.  This legislation will not help young people.</P>
    <P>I was a vocational student and the vocational education system was great. The schools had work experience courses and got involved in the workplace. In recent years, however, that involvement has decreased.  The vocational schools always ensured that there was work for pupils.  They would give the pupils references and direct them to where they would get a summer job and, on leaving school, to where they would get a permanent job. Senator Farrelly pointed out that he, too, went to a vocational school and that the pupils always secured jobs on leaving those schools.  However, that has changed.</P>
    <P>We should start to look after children at a tender age and ensure that they receive a good primary education.  There is a great shortage of tradespeople at present because nobody is training them.  People are sent to FÁS and other agencies and, as a builder explained to me, they are trained in a hot house setting. They are trained to build and plaster a small wall inside a house, after which it is knocked down and built <Col N="711" /> again for the next exercise.  What does that man know about building a three storey building?  We have generated a system whereby no builder is training people because of rules and regulations. We will experience a severe shortage of real workers in a few years.</P>
    <P>It is time we stopped attacking employers and labelling them as exploiters.  Employers do not exploit anybody.  It is time we gave employers some credit rather than continually jumping on them.  If there are one or two involved we should name and point to the firms which are exploiting people. However, we should not blame everyone with a blanket expression.</P>

      <P>The Senator is not naming the few, if she knows them.  If I knew them I would certainly name them; but I will not stand here while good hardworking people, who are employing young people in shops and other businesses, are accused of exploitation. They are fathers and mothers themselves who came up the hard way and know how to treat people.  There is always some senior employee who will ensure that a young person does not get the wrong end of the wedge.</P>
      <P>Everybody should get a fair crack of the whip.  Children should be allowed to take a little job at 14 years of age if they want.  We have a peculiar situation at present.  Many young girls are mothers at 15 and, as mothers, they are adults.  If a mother wants to keep and rear her child, do we say she cannot get a job or work?  If a person is a mother she is an adult, but she cannot work because she is a child under this legislation.  We are tying ourselves up in knots.  Do we tell a teenage mother that she cannot work? Is that mother an adult or a child?</P>

      <P>She may be a child under law but she is also an adult under the law because she is a mother.  Is a mother an adult or a child?  That is a nice question.</P>
      <P>We are tying ourselves up with regulations and there is no need for half of them.  Many children worked at 14 and 15 years of age.  I worked on Saturdays when I was 12 and I used to get a shilling, which was grand pocket money.  It never caused me any injury.  Many of the good businessmen in this country started as messenger boys and doing paper rounds.  Many good ladies started as office girls and became top administrators. It did not injure them.</P>
      <P>A percentage of the people who are out of work did not sit their leaving certificate. In ten year's time there will be nothing but people who sat their leaving certificates walking around unemployed because we are not creating jobs.  The work is not there.  As Senator Quinn said, one does not create a job; but if one can produce a product and sell and market it at an economic price, a job is created automatically.  One does not create the job, rather one creates the environment in which to create the job. Education on its own will not do that. One must have the will to work and one must have the interest.</P>
      <P>I am not opposing the Bill, but I think we are too harsh on children.  We are not giving them an opportunity.  We say on one hand that children should have their freedom and are entitled to be looked on as individuals and to their own free will.  However, on the other hand we say that they are not entitled to work until they are 16 years of age and then can work only for a few hours. Where is the balance?  They are individuals and either they can do what they like or they cannot.  Under this law they cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry was able to prove my view with figures.  My experience is that children who worked were far more on the ball at school because they were learning over the weekend.  They were far more active and enthusiastic.  They knew more about sport because they <Col N="713" /> learnt from their peers reading the newspapers on Saturday.  Work is not a bad thing and we are going too far here. Any boy or girl of 14 years of age is quite capable of doing some work.  What is the alternative?  We cannot give them work because of all these regulations. They cannot draw the dole because they are too young.  What do they do?  They run about the streets.  FÁS schemes were mentioned.  I do not know of any FÁS schemes which children of 14 years of age can attend during the summer. Have we anything of that kind?  I would love if the Minister set up in every town and village a training course for eight weeks of the summer and three weeks at Christmas when the children are on holidays.  They could go to this training course and earn some money.</P>
    <P>They cannot get dole, they get no assistance from the State and they cannot work.  What options are open to them?  We are heading for more robbing of cars, more joyriding, more drugs and more running around.  We are making children redundant by saying they cannot work at the most vulnerable time of their lives.  They are between childhood and their teenage years and want some work so they can get out and be with people.  However, we are telling them to stay home with their parents.  They will not stay at home; they will stay out on the street and idle hands find mischief.</P>
    <P>This Bill stops children from working. We are denying them the one thing we should not deny them, the right to get a small job at 14 years of age if they want. It is wrong to stop them from doing so. I would love if someone could come up to me and say working at 12 or 14 years of age injured them, or if some professor would come up with some statistic to prove that point.  I would say, without any statistics but having watched things for years, that I have never seen any young boy or girl who went out to work at 14 or 15 years of age, whether in a café, a pub or elsewhere, who did not grow up more street wise and industrious and with a better education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> We should not heed what Europe is doing.  We should look back at how well people of past generations who started work at 14 did.  They worked all their lives.  One will find that many of the people who are unemployed did not work when they were young.  That is a misfortune.  This Bill does nothing to enhance things for children.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and the Government.  If we are to do anything for children, we should go into housing estates in every town and city and do something about drug abuse and ensure that all children go to to school until they are 14 years of age.  They would get on all right if they never went any further, but unfortunately some of them are not going to school at all.  When we talk about caring for children we should start at the very beginning with the young and vulnerable.  This is where we should channel our resources rather than paying inspectors to go around prosecuting good, honest to God employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation implements a European Union directive with which we are obliged to conform.  I have reservations about what is contained in such directives.  There is a great distinction between what is happening in Germany, France, Belgium and even Britain and what is happening in this small country.</P>
      <P>A considerable number of young boys and girls are employed on a regular basis in places such as supermarkets, licensed premises, petrol stations and so forth.  Most of those young people would have been introduced to those jobs by parents and acquaintances. Friendship between the employer and employee would be involved in many of these employments, or at least the employers would know the young people they are employing.  In about 98 per cent of such cases no exploitation takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will always be a small percentage of exploitation and that is difficult to eradicate.  However, it is not widespread, although I could not be as definite <Col N="715" /> as Senator Farrell that there is no such exploitation.  Human nature is human nature and there will always be people who are prepared to exploit others, irrespective of what place they hold in society.  Nevertheless, in the case of the jobs to which this legislation refers, the vast majority of the employees would have been introduced to their employers by friends or acquaintances.</P>
    <P>A huge number of young people are never given the opportunity of obtaining part-time employment.  Many young people living in the larger urban centres never get a chance to work in a shop, petrol station or lounge bar. Working in different spheres of activity is in its own way part of growing up and the education of young people in addition to providing them with pocket money to enjoy their youth.  We should endeavour to broaden potential employment for young people and encourage employers to take on more of them during weekends and holidays. That will be difficult because there are so many young people.  There are only two large urban areas in my constituency, Portlaoise and Tullamore. However, in the smaller urban centres, such as Birr, Ferbane, Clara and Mountrath, everybody knows everybody else. Shopkeepers and petrol station owners know the surrounding population and know the young people to whom they give employment.  It would be of benefit to examine how we could get other young people involved in employment.</P>
    <P>The problem the Bill seeks to address is not part-time employment.  The main problem of exploitation arises when young people, and particularly young boys, are expected to do heavy, manual, dirty work.  There are not many such occurrences but it does happen that young boys of 16 or 17 are given the long end of the stick all the time in employment.  They are expected to carry out heavy work in industries and we should try to provide safeguards for such young people.  It is essential that we assist them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> I remember going for a drink in north Tipperary with a friend and having a long discussion with him about life.  The most memorable comment he made was that there is no free education in the school of experience.  He was correct. One rounds off one's education by travelling around and meeting people.  It broadens one's mind.  The workplace is particularly important in that regard because it is a tough environment and that is part and parcel of life.</P>
    <P>A huge number of young people in this country are exploited, not by employers but by lack of parental care and guidance and by society in general. This Bill will do nothing to help such children.  The problem with young people is most visible on weekends of international football matches.  The greatest affluence can be seen on such weekends by walking around St. Stephen's Green or down Grafton Street.  The wealthiest people in Ireland can be seen.  However, such weekends also see the greatest number of poor people on the streets of Dublin.  They might be begging outside pubs or simply hanging around.  These people are actually starving and often their clothes are threadbare.  They are the people society left behind long ago.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting if on one of those weekends, rather than carry out a survey to find out how so many people got into such situations, somebody made an effort to find out how they could be assisted.  Perhaps the Eastern Health Board or the Departments of Health and Social Welfare could find out how these people live during the rest of the week.  We are discussing the protection of young people, but there are young people out begging on the streets with their parents beside them.  Elderly people also beg and many of them probably have not had a decent meal for months.  We must see if we can assist those people.</P>
    <P>Many will say that it is their own fault and that they are well paid and can draw social welfare benefits.  That is nonsense. Many of those young people are living in the worst possible tenements <Col N="717" /> and many do not have any proper accommodation.  We must see how we can help those young people, who, if they got an opportunity or assistance, might be able to achieve a semblance of order and normality in their lives.  It will not be easy.  That is the most glaring example of the exploitation of youth. Under this legislation many inspectors will be calling to employers and businesses, but we should see how we can assist the young people to whom I have just referred.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to a number of people who were involved in consultations with the Minister of State and the Department's officials about this legislation. The Bill meets many of the problems they discussed and some of the people to whom I spoke gave the Minister of State the height of praise.  They were not pleased with what was being done but they felt a genuine effort was made to try to meet many of their concerns. The National Youth Council of Ireland praised the Minister for meeting it to discuss the problems experienced by young people.  I am glad the Minister's efforts are being recognised.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned age limits and the fact that young people under the age of 16 should not be allowed to work after 8 p.m. I was brought up in a licensed premises where I worked before I was 16.  I learned a lot from listening to people talking.  I see nothing wrong with people under 15 years of age working after 8 p.m.  The Minister also said that people between the ages of 16 and 18 should not work after 10 p.m. She indicated that could be changed to 11 p.m. in exceptional circumstances.  I was in Courtown during the last bank holiday weekend and because the weather was beautiful there was no one in the hotel bars until 11 p.m.  If employers must make arrangements to leave young people home at 11 p.m. when customers are coming in, they will not employ them.</P>
    <P>While we must adopt European directives, we must also take account of our local circumstances.  We work in small rural communities where most people <Col N="718" /> know one another and there is a lot of goodwill.  I see nothing wrong with young boys and girls under 18 years of age working in a licensed premises until 12.30 a.m. or 1 a.m., provided the following day is not a school day.  Many young people are better off working inside a licensed premises rather than trying to obtain alcohol and cider outside it.</P>
    <P>We should make every effort to encourage young people into the workplace, even on a temporary basis, so that they can learn about job satisfaction. We need regulations but we should re-examine the hours specified by the Minister.  Many people will query these hours because they are anxious to get temporary employment for their sons and daughters.  We must strike a balance, therefore the Minister should try to extend the hours.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this Bill. She said that as legislators we have a duty to put in place laws which protect the vulnerable sections of our community. One only has to look at this Bill to realise how far we have travelled from Victorian times when children were expected to climb up chimneys and down mine shafts.  As we consider this Bill, we should also give some thought to parts of the world where child labour is still widely used and children work in appalling conditions.  People who sell goods in the developed world, and especially people who buy goods, should ensure that those goods have not been produced by child labour. That is part of the development of customer power, which is continuously growing. During the 1830s, Drummond, the Under-Secretary for Ireland, said &mdash; I <Col N="719" /> am sure Senator Lee will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that property has its duties as well as its privileges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Right on both counts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The same message must be sent to customers today that we have both rights and responsibilities as regards the products we buy.  We must have more information about what customers buy.  Ireland should be prominent among those in the European Union who are pushing for controls to ensure that Europe does not import the produce of child labour.  There is nothing protectionist about such a stance.  There is no justification for using teenage children in sweat shops.  We should not be slow to insist that our values in this regard are followed when buying goods.</P>
      <P>We are at a different stage in Europe and in this country and this is reflected in the Bill's emphasis on protecting the integrity of the young person's education. We do not want the work which children do to get in the way of their schooling.  We do not want work to compete with schooling so that young people are presented with an irresistible temptation to drop out.  We are just beginning to realise that dropping out is the short cut to &ldquo;life-term&rdquo; unemployment and to all other social problems. The young people most at risk of dropping out are those whom the education system has failed.  Economic pressures can play a great part for a 16 year old and sometimes for their families, as Senator Enright said.  The attraction of even a small wage can be overpowering for that family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason young people drop out is that the education system has nothing to offer them.  In some cases they have been branded as failures from primary school.  If they get an opportunity to succeed in the world of work, they grab it as soon as they can.  We are only now beginning to face up to the fact that our education system does not suit the talents of a large number of <Col N="720" /> those who go through it.  The new leaving certificate-applied in which I was involved, is one aspect of what is being done.  If we succeed with the leaving certificate-applied and with the other measures being introduced to modernise the curriculum, we will have attacked the problem of dropping out at its source.</P>
    <P>A central part of the leaving certificate-applied is work experience.  There is a vital need to build a bridge between the world of education and the world of work so that young people are properly equipped to make the transition from one to the other.  Formal work experience schemes are specifically excluded from the scope of this Bill and that is right.  It also needs to be said loudly and clearly that for adolescents to work towards the end of their schooling is good but the danger is that we could make the error of thinking it is bad but the Minister has not done so and this principle is well protected in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We must make sure that neither the education nor the health of young people is threatened and that they are not exploited.  With these safeguards, we should encourage work by 16 and 17 year olds.  Such work is not a necessary evil or an evil of any kind.  Work by senior cycle school children can be a positive good in many ways.  I am not talking about eight year olds going down mine shafts or up chimneys or Third World children working in sweat-shops instead of going to school.  I am talking about young people, who will soon be school leavers, preparing for the world of work by experiencing its disciplines at first hand.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a large number of exceptions which might dilute its general thrust.  The Minister will have the power to exempt by licence whole industrial sectors from many of its provisions. Given that the number of sectors where young people are employed is small, one is tempted to wonder whether there is much of substance left in the shell of the Bill.  This is empowerment legislation and the making of these exceptions will depend on <Col N="721" /> the Minister of the day, but this power to exempt sectors is a concern.</P>
    <P>Several times in the House and outside I have said &mdash; the Minister may have heard me &mdash; that all social legislation we pass has two effects.  It has a desired effect but it also has the undesired effect of inhibiting job creation. This is not an argument against social legislation.  I have been actively involved in attempting, and in some cases succeeding, to have beneficial changes made to such legislation.  However, there is always a price to pay in terms of jobs.</P>
    <P>My company employs over 600 young people at weekends to pack bags for customers and to wheel trolleys to their cars.  None of them is under 16 years of age so they will not be affected by this legislation.  We do not employ people under 16 because, under the previous legislation, it became too much hassle to ensure we operated within the law.  The 15 year olds we employed were keen, enthusiastic and anxious to get to work. They were sharp enough to cheat on their hours and were motivated enough to want to do it.  To police this situation to make sure we stayed within the law became too much trouble.  We decided to stop employing 14 and 15 year olds even for that limited number of hours. We still employ over 600 16 and 17 year olds so the net result is not much different but it is the principle to which I want to draw attention.</P>
    <P>All social legislation discourages employers in some form or other from taking on as many people as they might otherwise employ.  We can mask this reality but we cannot avoid its consequences. All social legislation is worthy and desirable but this does not take from the inescapable fact that there is a price in lost jobs which must be paid.</P>
    <P>Last year I told the Minister that, in the United States, I joined a table of business people and was introduced and welcomed as somebody from Ireland.  A man at the table said to the others that Ireland is a wonderful and marvellous country and that they should go there as it is a great place for a holiday because <Col N="722" /> of its golf, fishing and great places to stay.  However, he told them they should never open a factory there.  I was jolted. I basked in his lovely words about Ireland until he explained that he was on the board of a company which had to close a factory.  He said that people would not believe the attitude in Ireland to having to let staff go.  He said he was referring not just to trade unions, agencies and legislation but to the fact that people in Ireland do not understand that in order to create employment some jobs will fail and some will only last for a time and then have to go. As a member of the boards of a number of companies, he discouraged the creating of jobs in Ireland.  This was a reminder to me that every time we do something worthy, we must also remind ourselves that we inhibit in some form or other the ability to create jobs.</P>
    <P>I do not have a problem with the Bill. We must learn to live with this problem but we must also keep it in our minds.  I do not make this point to speak against the principle of the Bill.  In any case, I do not think it has teeth.  I make this point to provide yet another reminder that we cannot go on ignoring the general problem forever.  I welcome the Bill and I wish the Minister well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be long and I hope this will allow Senator Lee a chance to contribute.  I welcome the Bill. Last week when I spoke on points in a Bill, I was told I was giving out about the Minister, even though I was not.  I hope this will not happen now. I have some difficulties with the Bill but these have nothing to do with the Minister.  Her intention to encourage young persons to remain in education beyond the age of 15 is laudable and necessary.  We all know what happens when they do not.  She made another laudable point, that is, that the new legislation does not seek to impose a ban on the employment of young people but merely to prevent abuse.  The main message is that it is not work but abuse and exploitation which are wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> There are a few points I wish to have clarified and the Minister might do so when she is concluding.  Section 3 states that a child over 14 may be employed to do non-industrial light work.  The definition in the directive of such work is vague.  It defines it as work which &ldquo;is not likely to be harmful to the safety, health or development of children, and is not such as to be harmful to their attendance at school....&rdquo;  I would like to see this definition clarified.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is complicated because it contains provisions on 13, 14, 15 and 16 year olds.  I have no problem with the general thrust of the Bill but with its detail.  The section states that during the period of the summer holidays, children are prohibited from doing any work for a period of at least 21 days.  Are they prohibited from working during Christmas and Easter holidays?  Many children like to work during the Christmas holidays and maybe work for people like Senator Quinn.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that a child over 14 years in full-time secondary education may be employed as part of a programme of work experience or education programme for up to eight hours in any day or 40 hours in any week. Earlier, the section provides that a 14 year old may be employed to do non-industrial work outside the school term provided the hours do not exceed seven hours in any day.  The section is complicated and will be a minefield to police. The Bill states that there will be inspectors, but God knows how many inspectors will be needed to ask young people whether they are 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>Under section 5 an employer, before employing children, must obtain copies of their birth certificates and written permission from their parents or guardians. Identity cards should be used at some stage, particularly for young people.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that a young person must not be required to work for more than eight hours per day or 40 hours per week or between 10 p.m. and <Col N="724" /> 6 a.m.  It also provides for minimum periods of rest.  It will be difficult to police this, particularly in the case of young people working in two jobs.  The minimum periods of rest provided for in the section are not to apply to the fishing and shipping sectors.</P>
    <P>I understand the directive allows for exceptions in the case of work performed in service with the armed forces and in hospitals or similar establishments. However, there is no reference in the Bill to hospitals or similar establishments or to work in agriculture. From my experience of working on a farm, there are times when hay must be brought in quickly and the family concerned may have to work late into the evening.  They often do it for other families as well, for which they get paid. Will this practice be prohibited?  I am not sure it should.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright referred to the tourism and catering industries where children are employed in bars, hotels etc. which nobody comes into until 10 or 11 p.m. EU countries have different customs and habits.  Germans go to bed early.  When I was in Sweden I was advised to go for dinner at 6.30 p.m. because I would not get anything to eat in a restaurant otherwise.  People there seem to get up in the middle of the night and go to bed in the middle of the day. In Portugal, families stay up until 2 a.m. because they have been in bed for up to four hours in the middle of the day. There is room for flexibility.  I want the Minister to look at this matter carefully. We are making regulations which will affect a great number of young people. I am not against the legislation but it needs more clarification in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>Section 14 gives a defence to an employer if he breaches any provision of the Act in employing a young person if he can show it was necessary because he anticipated &ldquo;fire, flood, storm, violence, a breakdown of plant or machinery or any other emergency&rdquo;. Employers could use this as an escape clause.  They may say they feel a storm is coming and make the child work late <Col N="725" /> that night.  This section is not clear. Section 14 (b) states this is all right when &ldquo;adult workers are not available&rdquo;. This is negative in its thrust.  What does the section mean by an outbreak of violence? I would like the Minister to examine this again.  If an employer is brought to court he can offer as his defence that he needed to keep these young people working because there was a threat of an outbreak of violence, a flood, storm, that the ice cream machine would break down or another emergency.  I am not saying this in a light hearted or joking manner, nor am I trying to oppose the Minister, but I ask her to re-examine this section.  It is a way out for employers who wish to exploit children.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn said he was at a dinner in America and was told that Irish workers were unreliable.  I was at a lunch in Italy before Christmas where an industrialist said exactly the same thing.  He could not depend on Irish workers because a high proportion were alcoholics and he would never open a factory here.  This man had factories in various countries.  It is a sad indictment. An OECD study showed that Finnish workers took approximately 3.6 sick days per year while Irish workers took 33 sick days per year.</P>
    <P>Like other Senators, I think it is good for children to work.  While a child is defined in the United Nations Charter as being under 18 years of age, there is a great difference between a child of 18 years of age and one who is 12 or 13 years of age and there are differences between children of the same age.  I know we must draw a line somewhere, but to say that a 17 or 18 year old cannot work past 11 p.m. on a summer's night, for example, is not right.  The Bill also says young people cannot start work too early in the morning.  Many people start work early in the morning and it does not do them any harm.  This is a cultural matter.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be difficult to police. Will it prohibit student nurses or nurses' aids, for example, from doing night duty?  There is a great difference between working during school and <Col N="726" /> holiday time.  I agree with the Minister in that anything that harms the child in any way or encourages late night working should be prohibited.  I do not like to see young people working in bars.</P>
    <P>We must strike a balance and I am not sure we have got it exactly right in this case.  There are cultural differences across the Community and between rural and urban Ireland which may allow for differences between young people working different hours.  I have difficulties with sections 3 and 14 and maybe we can come back to them on Committee Stage.  I welcome the thrust of the Bill and I commend the Minister for it.  Differentiating all these various ages makes it unduly complicated, hard to police and perhaps we should re-examine these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am embarrassed by the kindness with which Senator Quinn and Senator Lydon made time for me.  I cannot rival their dedication in dining for Ireland abroad at this stage.  I am not an expert on this area.  I have a few questions for the Minister.  Like previous contributors, I welcome the general intention behind the Bill.</P>
      <P>My queries relate to how much we know about what we are doing and how competently we can anticipate the consequences? In her statement the Minister said that the intention is to encourage young persons to remain in education training beyond the age of 15 for the purpose of further education etc. She rightly points out there is a disproportionately heavy long term unemployment record among those who left school early &mdash; we all know the data. However, the implication seems to be that if we can give them an extra year in school, their unemployment levels will decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My questions are basic; I should know the answers if the data is there, and if not, I hope the Minister or her Department can tell me.  How many people are we talking about here and where do they live?  Reference was made to rural areas.  I would have assumed the bulk of 15 year olds live in the high unemployment <Col N="727" /> areas clustered around Dublin and in parts of Cork and Limerick etc. but I may be wrong.  We may be largely talking about a systemic situation.</P>
    <P>I have a question about the connection between leaving school at 15 years of age and long-term unemployment.  In her speech the Minister said that once young people become unemployed and remain so for a period of time, they are likely to remain long-term unemployed. She also said that she wants to discourage young persons from leaving school to take up low grade work with poor job prospects.  How many of these long-term unemployed have been unemployed from the moment they left school without any work experience and how many got some work, however low grade, and then became unemployed in due course because they went into dead end jobs? That may be a potentially significant distinction.</P>
    <P>I am not at all confident that raising the school leaving age by one year, which I approve of in principle, will make much difference.  I assume those who leave school at 15 years of age have already acquired a disposition which will make them reluctant to be willing participants in school up to 16 years of age.  They are likely to follow the same trajectory at 16 years of age as they would at 15 years of age unless something changes their attitude towards education and work in the wider sense. Senator Quinn may be right in saying that the changes envisaged in the type of curriculum etc. will attract their enthusiasm in a way the conventional curriculum failed to do.  Is there a danger that all we are doing here is postponing by one year the experience these people will have anyway?</P>
    <P>I assume the main reason we have these unemployment levels is because the jobs are not there.  If they became more educated and got some of the jobs available, there would be a displacement effect among those who already have jobs.  Saying they will be unemployed for the rest of their lives if they leave school at 15 years of age assumes <Col N="728" /> they would have jobs if they were better educated.  If the jobs are not there in the first place, the net effect would be different.  Will this change make much difference in that regard?</P>
    <P>We are talking all the time about integration and the Minister of State was central to the idea of integrated programmes for the Structural Funds. When we are talking about the relationship between work and education, that implies integration presumably between the Minister's portfolio, which includes the Department of Labour, and the Department of Education.  A little further on, the Minister talks about how her Department will receive complaints about the employment of children over long hours for low wages, often with the complicity of parents or guardians.  That is a historical phenomenon going back as far as we want to go.</P>
    <P>What happens if we block employment for these children?  I do not know how many are involved, but if these children live in the high unemployment areas, that is, the ghettos, and no alternative income becomes available for themselves or their families, what are the implications for the families?  This is not a justification for what is happening but is there a Government policy to take cognisance of the consequences or is this one more piece of <i>ad hoc</i> or disconnected legislation which just creates a new problem a little along the line, for which the responsibility for coping lies either with the Minister's Department or some other Department.  Is it possible at this stage to think in more &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; ways about the totality of the implications of this?  I am not saying that in an adversarial or aggressive sense.  I welcome the general thrust of what the Minister is trying to do but I hope these types of implications have been thought through and can be handled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for what was an excellent debate.  Everybody brought their own life experience <Col N="729" /> to it as parents, career-guidance teachers or as people involved in psychology, the business or the academic world.  It has been a very useful and fruitful debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde worried about whether we were being too restrictive with students under 16 years of age.  The framework we are talking about is, first, the under 13s who may be involved in artistic or cultural events, advertising, the theatre, etc., by regulation or licence, where we can lay down the conditions to ensure their health is not abused by the kind of hours they work or the nature of the job, and that their welfare and schooling are protected.</P>
      <P>Fourteen year olds are allowed work seven hours per week during the school term which is a new provision as this was not allowed to date.  We do not cover employment under contract for services, so the Bill does not cover areas of casual work, such as baby sitting, newspaper deliveries, etc., where the youngster can decide his or her hours, and allows flexibility.  There is also flexibility in relation to farm work, work in a family business, etc.</P>
      <P>Fifteen year olds can work up to eight hours per week during the school term. To date, 15 year olds could work a 40 hour week.  We are trying to raise the school leaving age to 16, so I am raising the general work age to 16 years and making this provision for work during the school term for 15 year olds.  During the school holidays, 15 year olds can work a 40 hour week but they must get a three week break in the summer but a break is not necessary at Christmas or Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ormonde raised the question of transition year students.  She said that it was not a study year and perhaps such students should be allowed work longer hours.  Most transition year students are 16 years of age, although some may be 15 years of age.  There is flexibility, which we can tease out in the course of the legislation, to examine this particular issue looking at it as work experience which is sanctioned through the school.  I would not agree that it is good <Col N="730" /> for 14 or 15 year olds in general to be working three hours per day, because what we are trying to ensure is that young people can balance their education and training which is obviously central to their long-term chances in life.  Part-time work, which is an excellent maturing experience, should be kept in proportion.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry emphasised the need for recreation, sport and physical development because these are the growing years when people need a little time and space for themselves.  They need space and time for homework and school, and work must fit in with that in a general way.  We are trying to strike a balance and I think we have struck a balance here.  There is a provision for flexibility by regulation to examine other circumstances provided we meet the terms of the directive and the health and safety requirements.  We can look at them on a case by case basis because there is that flexibility, and we are trying to look after the long-term interests of the young people concerned.</P>
    <P>As Senator Lee said rightly, young people who drop out of school early are likely to be tomorrow's long-term unemployed.  Many of these people may end up signing on at 18 years of age and not signing off until they are eligible for old age pensions.  We are doing nobody any favour if we encourage youngsters to drop out of full-time education for a couple of months, take a full-time job, get bored and end up sitting around without work.  We know from surveys of school leavers surveys and other research that the likelihood of being long-term unemployed is directly related to lack of skill in early life, so, if we can, we should encourage people to get an education and training the first time round instead of trying to catch up with second chance education.  That is important.</P>
    <P>I accept everything Senator Quinn said about the importance of an appropriate curriculum, particularly for students who do not have the academic abilities which seem to be the most valued in our points mad curriculum.  I <Col N="731" /> know he has done a huge amount of work on the leaving certificate-applied, which is very important.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly and a number of other Senators asked how many prosecutions there had been.  Over the years, the inspectors spoke with employers, etc., and that sorted out most cases. However, a minority of prosecutions were taken.  We referred 19 cases to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for prosecution since 1977 and he proceeded with ten cases, nine of which were successfully prosecuted.  Prosecutions are an end of a process but I hope we would engage in a process of public education and encouraging employers to come with this.  Criminal sanctions should be the end of the road, not the beginning. The penalties are £1,500 for a breach or £250 per day for a continuing breach of the legislation.</P>
    <P>A number of people said there are not enough apprenticeships and I agree. There is a real problem getting employers to take on apprentices.  Ten years was spent negotiating a new system of apprenticeship, moving from the old &ldquo;time served&rdquo; system to one which alternates periods of on and off the job training.  Employers have been slow to take up this new system although it took a huge amount of time to negotiate.  It is sad to hear that employers, such as the building employer we heard quoted complain of a shortage of bricklayers but they are not willing to take on apprentices.  I have talked to the CIF, IBEC, etc., about this.</P>
    <P>The Department is developing the new model of traineeship, which is a more flexible approach.  We have provided for it in the national plan, there have been some very successful pilot projects and we are working to mainstream on the job training in companies with a more flexible approach to a much wider range of training areas.  I hope that goes well.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry quoted from some wonderful research.  One area she talked about, the 12 year olds, would not be covered by the Bill because it is casual <Col N="732" /> work, that is, the odd gardening job, washing the car, etc.  I agree with her point about the need for young people to have time for themselves for their recreation purposes as well as trying to balance time for school, homework and work.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan asked about policing. There are labour inspectors and Congress has recommended an ongoing regular monitoring review with the different interests coming together a couple of times a year to see what is and what is not working.  I will follow up that idea.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell felt that he had never seen young people being exploited by employers.  That is not the feedback I get and I would not agree with him.  I know many a young person who, many years ago, left school at 14 years of age and did very well, but we are living in a different world and we know that only a fraction of those who drop out at that age &mdash; and I have some figures for Senator Lee &mdash; will end up in decent jobs.  The world has moved on, and I think we are doing many people a disservice. Currently, the minimum school leaving age is 15 years and it will be raised to 16 years.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn talked about the labelling of goods in terms of the exploitation of child labour in the Third World.  We must never forget the horrific things that go on there and we should not collude with it by buying cheap goods.  He asked if the exceptions dilute the legislation.  I do not believe they do because the legislation is governed by the directive and our international obligations. We must bring the spirit of the directive to bear on the application of the exceptions.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon asked about light work, which is defined in the directive and in the Bill.  It is work that is not so heavy that it will interfere with the young person's physical growth or work that is so heavy and difficult that it will inhibit their chances of getting education and training.  There is no restriction on work during the Christmas <Col N="733" /> holidays, once people get the three week break.  Exceptions are provided in the agricultural area because there are a few nights at this time of the year and in July when people work late on a farm because they are saving hay.</P>
    <P>With regard to the tourism and catering areas, it has been argued that people in this country have a different attitude to time.  I took legal advice from the Attorney General's Office to ascertain whether we could offer more flexibility at weekends and during the summer holidays with regard to the 11 p.m. finishing time.  The answer I got was that we could not.  Given our international obligations under the EU directive, which says we cannot dilute our existing protections and our ratification of the 1946 ILO Convention, it is not open to us to extend it beyond 11 p.m.</P>
    <P>The point has been made by ICTU &mdash; and it is worth bearing in mind &mdash; that in many cases young people working in pubs have to stay later than 11 p.m. to clean up.  They receive no pay for this work and end up walking home at a dangerous hour of the night.  We must keep the overall welfare and health provisions in mind.  I have gone as far as I can legally and it has been a reasonable move in this direction.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee asked about the number of early school leavers.  About 5,000 youngsters leave school before their junior certificate or equivalent every year.  The total number of people who leave early every year, including those with no junior certificate and those who leave with only a junior certificate or having failed their junior certificate, is 15,000.  Some people leave school because of the short-term attraction of a job.  If a young person is only getting a couple of pounds pocket money from his or her parents a job paying £30 or £40 a week looks attractive.</P>
    <P>The experience has been that young people who take up full-time work at that age are discarded as soon as they start looking for more money or, alternatively, they begin to feel exploited and drop out.  They do not tend to come back into the school system so it is a <Col N="734" /> false inducement to encourage youngsters to go into full-time work.  We should encourage them to stay in the school system by making it more relevant. There are programmes such as Youthreach and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee may not be aware that the National Economic and Social Forum has done much work on the relationship between early school leaving and youth unemployment.  We had many papers and a plenary session on the issue.  I hope we will identify many of the gaps and problems and areas where we can improve our system.  For example, there are a number of excellent pilot projects being funded under the Horizon programme &mdash; there is one in Dundalk.  They are aimed at early school leavers and potential drop outs and have succeeded in holding them in the school system.  We need to learn from those experiences and ascertain the gaps in our systems.</P>
    <P>We should mainstream this good practice and ensure that, instead of having 15,000 people leaving school with no leaving certificate, we should provide appropriate training or education which will enhance their prospects of education for life.  This Bill has a part to play in the encouragement of the balance and I have worked hard with my staff to strike an appropriate balance.</P>
    <P>We had a good debate in the Dáil and the Bill was improved as a result of that listening experience.  I have listened with care to Senators and I look forward to the Committee Stage debate.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Economic Development of Border Counties: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government's lack of commitment towards the economic development of the Border counties; stresses the <Col N="735" /> absolute necessity to draw down the maximum amount of EU funding available to this area; and calls on the Government to utilise all available peace initiative funds towards industrial infrastructural development in the Border areas. </P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this important matter and I welcome the Minister to the House.  I will outline briefly the picture of neglect as I see it.</P>
    <P>There has been a long history of neglect of the southern Border areas largely because the focus of attention is on the six Northern counties.  This Government, and indeed the previous Government, did not realise the serious deprivation in the southern Border counties and elected representatives of all political persuasions, because this was a delicate or taboo subject, were never in a strong position to make a case for the southern Border counties to compete with the northern Border counties.</P>
    <P>When money was allocated from the EU, the International Fund for Ireland or elsewhere this psychology of 80:20 emerged because the focus was on the six northern counties.  I do not have enough time to make a good case but it is easy to establish that the southern Border counties have suffered serious deprivation and have not been paid.  In the North, where 80 per cent of all funding has been allocated, the deprivation, destruction and damage was paid for on time by the British Government.  This is not widely known and it is not taken into consideration by the different agencies allocating funding.  The psychological focus is on the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I will outline the history for the Minister. The first cross-Border study was conducted in December 1977, 19 years ago; I will make that report available if necessary.  The second report came from a social and economic committee of the EU which undertook a study of all the Border areas.  The EU got involved but nothing significant happened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> I accepted the honesty of the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he wrote to me on 20 August 1985 stating:</P>
    <P> This lack of financial additionality is a major drawback from the Government's point of view in so far as integrated operations are concerned. It could in practice lead to a situation where the existing receipts from the Structural Funds would be over concentrated in certain areas at the expense of the broader national development priority. </P>
    <P>He recognised that nothing special could be done for the Border counties.</P>
    <P>The first indication that we might get some assistance was in 1987 when the Irish and British Governments agreed on 21 October at a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to initiate a study of the north-west cross-Border areas.  An important statement was made on that initiative which read: &ldquo;Both Governments have decided to press ahead with this study because they recognised that the problems of the area are enormous and cannot be effectively tackled by either Government acting in isolation&rdquo;.  That is an important statement from what-ever side of the political divide one comes.</P>
    <P>The next example of neglect in the history of the cross-Border area came on 12 October 1993 when the then Taosieach, Deputy Reynolds, and the Government announced that £20 million was to be allocated for jobs and that the creation of an extra 14,000 jobs a year was the target.  I would like to refer to the National Roads Authority's plan mentioned in these newspapers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will abide by the ruling of the Chair, but I am sure nobody would object to me trying to put my case.  I will make these newspapers available to the Minister and, if he takes <Col N="737" /> this matter seriously, I am sure he will be glad to look at them.</P>
      <P>In 1987 the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, initiated a cross-Border study.  An important conference was held attended by another former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and Mr. John Hume. We also had a live link up with the former EU Regional Commissioner, Mr. Bruce Millan.  I would like to read extracts from speeches made by the then Taoiseach, Sir Patrick Mayhew and Mr. John Hume.</P>
      <P> The then Taoiseach stated:</P>
      <P>....the presence of Sir Patrick Mayhew here today, my own presence and the link up with the Commissioner Bruce Millan shows our clear support and signs of distinct co-operation to try and help the North West to first highlight its problems and then to shape the future together ... Here I can pledge our support in principle to putting that project on a very sound basis for the future. </P>
      <P>Sir Patrick Mayhew stated:</P>
      <P> Both Governments are committed to maintaining and developing this co-operation... I know that this spirit of co-operation and its practical manifestation will continue to be fostered by our two Governments. </P>
      <P>Mr. John Hume stated:</P>
      <P> An analysis of unemployment figures shows that there is a concentration of disadvantage in the North West.  When we take account of other factors and indications of poverty, we have a picture of ingrained deprivation... Our problems and our efforts entitle us to demand treatment, support and assistance which serve to redress our deprivation and disadvantage. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned that nothing has happened despite the efforts, conferences and commitments.  We made a submission for funding under <Col N="738" /> the INTERREG programme.  Every Department, including the Departments of Finance, Tourism and Trade and Enterprise and Employment, received copies of that submission.  I am chairman of a cross-Border group, so I have some responsibility in this regard.  I have a difficult job because I find that people oppose me because of the political party of which I am a member.  I am convinced that this Government is not committed, something which has been borne out on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>I was fortunate to have been part of a group which met Commissioner Wulf-Mathies. She was very frank when she said we should go to our Government and get it to refocus the National Development Plan fund to allocate some funding to the Border counties. INTERREG, the International Fund for Ireland, the Peace and Reconciliation Fund are subject to matching funding, which is not available.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Taoiseach's honesty on 27 October last when he met a cross-Border group.  He said that there will be no additionality because the Government's priority is to monitor national funding so that it is in line with Maastricht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a very helpful interruption.</P>
      <P>We were told by Commissioner Wulf-Mathies if the National Development Plan fund was not refocused and treated as additionality, however anxious she and the EU are to help, that nothing can be provided.  The only funding available to two sewage schemes in County Donegal comes from INTERREG.  That is not additionality, but substitution.  No attempt has been made by the Government to provide for the southern Border counties.  Last week I read that £800,000 had been provided for an advance factory in Strabane.</P>
      <P>The only honest person was the Taosieach who told us the truth.  In a letter to me Commissioner Wulf-Mathies stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" />  At the recent meetings of Monitoring Committees for the Irish Operational Programmes, the Committees were asked to identify ways in which expenditure could be refocused to take into account the needs of the border counties. </P>
    <P>I will not name the senior official at EU level who said we need to put pressure on the Government because it is a good ringfencer.  I needed two hours to make my case properly, but I had only 12 minutes.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, but I have not had enough time to do justice to the case which should and will be made by all political parties in the southern Border counties.  It is not a political issue and the Minister will be mistaken if he opposes the motion.  I ask him to recognise the issue.  The monitoring committee comprises people elected in the southern Border counties.  His response must be stronger than an amendment to the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Taoiseach for his wisdom and foresight in giving Minister of State, Deputy Carey, additional responsibility for the Border counties.  As I am sure the Minister is aware from his frequent visits to the region &mdash; I am sure my colleague, Senator Reynolds, will remind him &mdash; the level of expectation in the area is high.  It remains to be seen whether the Minister fulfils those expectations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best news the Government could give the people of the southern Border counties is that it is considering the introduction of an incentive tax for <Col N="740" /> industry to locate in the region.  This call has been made by all sides; my colleague has requested it on several occasions.  It is one way of addressing the inequities in our region.  The natural disadvantages of the area are well known.  Poor infrastructure, distance from large centres and small urban areas coupled with a scattered population have all contributed to a downgrading of the Border region since the foundation of the State.  Successive Governments are to blame for this.</P>
    <P>Partition has been the greatest single evil perpetrated on the people of my area.  They have been living with that legacy for over 70 years.  The creation of the International Fund for Ireland in the late 1980s was the first public acknowledgement of the need to identify the Border region as a special case in economic terms.  While I fully support the IFI and compliment it on the outstanding contribution it has made and continues to make with its limited funds, I have long objected to the decision reached by the Irish and British Governments &mdash; my party was the Irish Government at that time &mdash; at the outset to expend 75 per cent of the fund in the northern counties and only 25 per cent in the southern counties.  I understand that, unofficially, this ratio has shifted somewhat and that, in real terms, the southern counties might receive nearer to 30 or 35 per cent. However, the legal reality is that the ratio is 75 per cent to 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan mentioned another major obstacle facing development &mdash; the lack of matching funds.  The area suffers many disadvantages but the biggest is that there are no large business centres, such as those in other parts of the country.  The ability to create wealth does not exist in the region; the necessary seed capital is not available. The Minister should consider this aspect in terms of his remit for the Border counties, not as it applies exclusively to EU cross-Border funding but the EU operational programmes, such as that relating to tourism.  I appreciate the Minister was not responsible for its <Col N="741" /> negotiation but there will be a mid-term review.</P>
    <P>Under the current programme for tourism development, unless one is prepared to establish significant hotel accommodation in the Border region, one will not receive the necessary funding and the project must be above a certain size.  Yet, most of the people who want to become involved in tourism in my county and many other Border counties wish to do so at a lower level, such as bed and breakfasts or a small cluster of accommodation.  However, they do not have access to funding and the result is a top tier.</P>
    <P>I understand the reasons for this.  The idea was to secure grand projects involving a major investor who would locate a major hotel with conference centre and leisure facilities which, in turn, would generate their own prosperity. However, with limited exceptions, this is not happening.  It may be taking place in one of the six counties because County Donegal has a highly developed tourism infrastructure but all the other counties are lagging way behind in terms of tourism development and I ask the Minister to consider this aspect.  The thresholds should be lowered to allow people access to the funding mechanism.</P>
    <P>It has always been a source of frustration to those of us who live on the southern side and who regularly visit our separated brethren across the Border that the huge subsidies which kept, and continue to keep, Northern Ireland afloat as an entity have had a beneficial effect on the environment there.  Successive Irish Governments, due to limited resources, have been unable to match this infrastructural development and consequently there are better roads and services in County Fermanagh and County Armagh.  Why would there not be, given the massive amounts of transfers to the northern side?</P>
    <P>Can the Minister imagine how annoyed many people were when they realised that the IFI, and the more recent peace and reconciliation fund, would continue to widen the gap between North and South by the unfair <Col N="742" /> distribution of resources?  It is perhaps not widely known, particularly among people outside rather than inside Ireland, that some quarters feel much of the money from the IFI has gone to businesses which were devastated by the bombing campaign of the last 25 years. This involved urban regeneration and the restoration of businesses which suffered. However, the British Government has compensated, up to the hilt and way beyond, every one of those bombed businesses, irrespective of the presence of the IFI.  Our perception of the IFI money is that it is topping up something which the British Government is already doing.  Under the current IFI rules the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland provides the other 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>One small example, which is known to some of my colleagues, involved a bombed hotel in the small village of Garrison, County Fermanagh.  The local community took it over and decided to regenerate it.  The locals have done an outstanding job and the hotel is a model of its type; what has emerged from the ashes of the bombed hotel is a credit to the IFI and the community; it includes a community hall, a beautiful environmentally landscaped area, retail units, a centre for old people and a number of other services.  It cost £1 million to develop in a village with a population of between 100 or 150, but not one penny came directly from the community.  My town on the southern side of the Border this year received £100,000 from the IFI for the provision of footpaths and environmental improvements.  Leitrim County Council must provide £100,000 in matching funds or benefit in kind in order to avail of that sum.  This is unfair and it is time something was done about it.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention many other points, but I appreciate my time is almost up. The Government must state unambiguously that it will provide additional funding for Border regional development. If this means a special tax incentive, so be it.  Colleagues in the rest of the country who may cast envious eyes <Col N="743" /> at the level of EU funding available to Border counties should remember that the Border region is probably the most disadvantaged in the country, particularly in economic terms, due to partition. This unnatural division has been a far greater handicap to the ordinary economic development of the region than any other factor.  Would others like to live in an area where roads lead nowhere, railways are shut down and there is the politics of the deaf from those with whom one lived in peace and harmony for generations?</P>
    <P>Over the last 12 months, on an initiative from my council, an organisation called Inter Cross-Border Regional Association was formed.  This group, which involves local authorities in Counties Fermanagh, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan, south Donegal and parts of County Tyrone, is now focusing on matters of mutual interest cross-Border and it should be encouraged and nurtured because, importantly, it involves cross-party support.  It is almost the first time for almost 30 years there has been a relationship between those on the northern and southern sides.</P>
    <P>The continuation of the loyalist ceasefire is important for the Border counties. Its end could have disastrous consequences for the people of the area. They would be in the first line of attack in any concerted effort to intimidate the people of the South.  We should admire the courage of David Ervine and Gary MacMichael and all the others on the loyalist side working for a just and lasting settlement on the island.  I look forward to meeting the Minister of State in the future so that we can work to enhance the prosperity of the region in which we live.  I second the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P> To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" />&ldquo;endorses the Government's approach to the socio-economic development of the Border regions; welcomes the continued support of the EU for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and in the Border counties; and commends the Taoiseach for his initiative in asking Minister Donal Carey to undertake a review of funding arrangments in the Border region so that all funding for the region is used to the maximum effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I come from the same county as Senator Mooney and I agree with most of his constructive criticisms.  There are many issues that have to be tackled so that funding can be provided in a better way for the county.  However, the Fianna Fáil motion is not based on reality. Senator McGowan gave us a blinkered view of how the funding has been set up for the Border counties over the past number of years.  He reserved his criticism for Fine Gael and the Labour Party and his compliments for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>With regard to Northern Ireland politics, one should look forward rather than backwards.  I will always remember when I was a fledgling member of Leitrim County Council in 1985 the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed.  I proposed that Leitrim County Council would support its signing but the proposal was defeated.  The Fianna Fáil members voted against it according to their ideas of progress for the Border region.  The then leader of Fianna Fáil, Mr. Haughey, sent a number of his representatives to Washington to try to undermine the work that had been done.</P>
    <P>The International Fund for Ireland came into being after the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed.  The 1995 IFI annual report indicates that since 1987 over £290 million has been spent in the Border counties and in Northern Ireland.  Over the past few years I have heard criticism from Fianna Fáil that not enough is being spent in the southern <Col N="745" /> Border counties.  It cannot have it both ways &mdash; either it is for it or against it.  As long as I am active in politics I will remember Fianna Fáil's hypocritical attempts to undermine the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the funding which came to the Border region.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney would agree that a flagship project of the IFI was the Shannon-Erne link or, as we call it, the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  A total of £35 million was spent on that and it has regenerated the socio-economic development of County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>A lot of money has been spent in the area through the IFI which has created a lot of employment.  The 1995 report of the chairman of the IFI, Mr. William MacArthur, also indicates that up to September 1994, 16,645 jobs were created in IFI supported projects and a further 7,142 indirect and construction jobs arose from IFI supported projects, giving a total employment impact of the fund of 23,787 jobs.</P>
    <P>The Delors package for peace and reconciliation provided £300 million which will be made available up to 1997 by the EU.  In this regard an office has been set up recently in Monaghan and the funding is now coming onstream.  It will play a major role in providing economic development and employment in the Border counties.</P>
    <P>My only criticism of how the funding has worked is that many people looking for funding are not aware of the type of funding available.  There is a lot of misinformation and a lack of information. The Taoiseach's appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, to review the funding available for the Border areas is a positive step.  The Minister of State will identify difficulties, no doubt; but, knowing him, he will address those difficulties tactfully.  In his review he should examine the ways in which information is made available to those applying for funding.  The South receives 25 to 30 per cent of the funding available.  That is an acceptable level, <Col N="746" /> but it would be excellent if it could be increased.  I know that will be one of the Minister of State's priorities.  The funding available is being well spent in the region.</P>
    <P>The opening of the cross-Border roads as part of the peace process has played a significant role in the socio-economic development of the region.  I raised the issue in the Oireachtas on many occasions that Leitrim was the only county without direct access to the North because all the Border crossings were closed.  Since the IRA ceasefire the cross-Border roads into County Leitrim have been opened.  One can see the regeneration of areas such as Kiltyclogher and Kinlough, from where Senator Gallagher hails.  The funding available through the IFI has assisted that regeneration and, hopefully, will be available through the Delors package.</P>
    <P>The Government can work to improve matters, but I do not agree with the tenor of the Fianna Fáil motion.  It does not take into account the vast amount of money that has been spent in the area or the improvements made.  I can see Senator McGowan shaking his head, but I have listened to him complaining about the lack of initiatives taken by many Governments.  However, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have worked hard to secure funding and I am sure President Clinton's visit last November will help secure extra funding for the IFI.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, will carry out a worthwhile review of the money spent in the Border region and whatever improvements can be made will be made.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach seo.  Go n-éirí an t-ádh leis maidir leis an obair mór atá roimhe.  There is no doubt that the Minister has a difficult task ahead.  I believe this motion will help in this regard because he can put pressure on the Government as increased pressure is placed on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> The Minister is aware of the problems experienced in the west of Ireland. There are daily newspaper reports regarding the creation of new jobs but the population of the west, with the exception of that in north Sligo, is still decreasing.  The area between Ballymote, Tubbercurry and Leitrim is completely denuded of population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps more procreation is needed.</P>
      <P>For many years I have stated that the funding is unfairly divided &mdash; Northern Ireland receives 80 per cent while the Republic receives 20 per cent.  Northern Ireland suffered in the past, but not nearly as much as the regions immediately south of the Border.  Northern Ireland received compensation from the British Government and is now receiving money from the International Fund for Ireland.  The Republic has suffered greatly and is in a <i>cul de sac</i> in relation to cross-Border motivation.  To redress the balance the thresholds for access to IFI funds must be lowered.  Small guesthouse and tourism operators must be given the opportunity to benefit in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland needs only a few large hotels with a large number of smaller units to complement them.  Large hotels provide golfing, fishing and leisure facilities. However, the hinterlands surrounding such establishments could be greatly improved if money were provided for small guesthouses and tourism projects. We should discriminate in favour of areas such as north Sligo and north and south Leitrim.  People entering business in these areas should be given a five year tax break.  I have stated on previous occasions that money cannot be lost because there is nothing coming in. If jobs are created, the Government will achieve returns on goods sold and <Col N="748" /> PAYE and PRSI returns.  What is the problem about not receiving tax from the promoter when the area in general benefits?  It would be a positive step to give these people a five year tax break to aid development.  It would not cost the Government anything because at present there is no source of income in the areas to which I referred.  What can the Government lose if business is generated by providing a five year tax break?</P>
    <P>If one travels through Northern Ireland &mdash; or in Beleek, for example &mdash; one can see the amount of money being spent because these areas received matching funds.  People in Northern Ireland pay housing rates.  In my opinion it was a mistake to abolish rates because this removed the main source of local revenue.  Northern Ireland has access to money to obtain matching funds and larger grants while the Republic does not.  For that reason the Government must provide extra money for matching funds.  That is the only way progress will be achieved in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There has been much development of the west during the past four years.  In 1992, there was a crusade for survival, a Government task force was appointed in 1994 and the Western Development Partnership Board was put in place to prepare an action plan, which was published in 1995.  A ridiculous amount of money has been spent on establishing the many organisations and providing funding to people to carry out surveys. I do not see what this has achieved.  A person living in a small village could inform the Government with regard to what action must be taken.</P>
    <P>Another problem relates to the application forms provided by voluntary organisations.  People must employ consultants in order to complete such forms and those consultants are making a fortune as a result.  Why must people employ consultants to complete application forms for small community projects? <Col N="749" /> Why is this necessary?  It is time to remove excess bureaucracy and simplify the position.  Is it not time that we put job creation first and made it easy for people to obtain employment?  The simple way to do this would be to invest the money spent on assessing and examining people's applications for matching funds.  This would go a long way toward launching more projects.</P>
    <P>The Minister faces a tough task.  The major problem in the west of Ireland is that the land is useless and small farming, which was the main source of employment, is no longer viable.  It is time that a project was initiated in relation to the environment.  A major problem exists with regard to the loss of wildlife.  I like to be outdoors and during last winter, when snow prevented my playing golf, I walked through the countryside surrounding my house.  I noticed the absence of birds in many places, with the exception of a field where a farmer was feeding his calves. There is no source of food for birds at present.  In the past when farmers planted gardens and produced tillage, birds had adequate access to food. Today, they are dying of starvation.</P>

      <P>In the past there were poachers and gamekeepers who provided a system of checks and balances to keep wildlife healthy.  I believe a project could be put in place to encourage farmers to produce small amounts of tillage with the specific purpose of feeding wildlife.  This would enhance wildlife. <Col N="750" /> A system could also be introduced to employ official gamekeepers to cull grey crows, magpies and foxes.  When did Members last see a yellowhammer or hear one singing?  Many jobs could be created by making use of the land.</P>

      <P>I must express my amazement at the motion before the House.  I spoke to Deputy Bertie Ahern at the recent by-election in County Donegal.  He informed me that the one thing County Donegal does not have is poverty.  He told me he had never seen so much growth and development in the building industry as he had since crossing the Border at Lifford.  I was surprised that this motion was tabled because the Leader of Fianna Fáil seems to be of a different opinion to the Senators in his party.  However, I am glad to contribute to the debate as I represent a Border constituency.</P>
      <P>As a result of the recent IRA ceasefire and the ongoing peace process, the Border counties have received unprecedented levels of attention in the media and from the Government.  In supranational terms, the most obvious example of this is the special programme for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties. I welcome the EU's continued commitment to the programme despite the breakdown of the IRA ceasefire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate that we consider the prospects for peace on the island.  It is generally accepted that one of the reasons why the Border counties have been unable to fulfil their potential has been the existence of the conflict in the North.  We are now only a few weeks away from the elections and the beginning of the all-party peace talks in Northern Ireland on 10 June.  I ask all those involved in these negotiations not only to remember the social and cultural costs of failure on that front but also the economic costs, which are quite considerable. In the long term the achievement of peace may prove more economically <Col N="751" /> beneficial than any programme run by the Government or the European Union.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong however to view the issue of economic development in a purely negative light.  Of course the failure to achieve a lasting peace on this island will have a negative impact on economic development in the affected areas.  However, we should not underestimate the impact economic development can have on creating the conditions whereby mutual conciliation and understanding between the two traditions in Northern Ireland and between North and South can be enhanced.</P>
    <P>The two EU programmes specific to the Border counties, the Peace Fund and the INTERREG fund, have a role to play.  I am particularly pleased to see that pursuit of objectives under these funds has already had a beneficial effect on cross Border relations.  In my own county of Donegal we have co-operated with councils in Derry and Limavady to produce a joint economic plan.  I congratulate people like Senator McGowan on their input.  He has been very active on that front.  We are not alone.  Monaghan and Louth are also working with the Newry and Mourne District and Down District on joint approaches to economic development.</P>
    <P>Other less formal arrangements are also under way under the auspices of the INTERREG programme.  For instance, a joint management structure has been initiated on the Shannon-Erne waterway committee involving input from both sides of the Border.  I understand that it has also been very successful.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest criticism of the funds available for the Border counties, whether Government or EU sponsored, is the sheer complexity involved in drawing them down or ascertaining who controls them.  This is fair criticism. Some people have estimated that there are now 36 programmes in operation in <Col N="752" /> the Border counties.  Given that there are 18 EU programmes, aside from the Peace Fund or the International Fund for Ireland, this does not sound like an exaggerated figure.  The EU consultancy &mdash; knowing what is where &mdash; is fast becoming a growth industry in itself. However, we would do well to recognise that it is a problem that affects not only the Border counties but the rest of the country as well.</P>
    <P>It is not for nothing that the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell, has had to publish a booklet outlining the range of supports available from the European Union and the State and who is responsible for each of them.  It is a welcome booklet. It is hardly surprising that in the Border counties, where there are extra programmes available, such confusion is even greater.  Partial responsibility for this rests with Brussels, where rules have added a further two supervisory bodies to those already involved in drawing down funds.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Government to request the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, who I welcome to this House this evening, to chair a task force to ensure cohesion and interdepartmental co-operation in the operation of these programmes.  Despite recent comments by members of the Opposition, I have no difficulty with the Minister of State with responsibility for the west also having responsibility in this area.  It does not matter who does the job as long as it is done.</P>
    <P>The range of programmes available is considerable.  Special consideration has been given to local development initiatives. I support such an approach because there is concrete evidence of co-operation to avail of these funds.  The benefits from the latest INTERREG programme and the peace programme are beginning to come on stream.  Of the 330 million ECUs under the peace programme, 20 million is being made available to the six Border counties.  This is <Col N="753" /> the equivalent of £48 million.  By last February there had been over 1,500 requests for the accompanying information pack, both North and South of the Border, and 76 applications from the South had been processed and passed to the relevant authority for final consideration.</P>
    <P>The position of the INTERREG programme is even better.  In this case 156 million ECUs have been allocated to the Border counties.  Progress in implementing this programme is considerable and I particularly welcome the appointment of an INTERREG development officer to assist applicants for funding under this programme.  All of this funding is additional to that planned under the CSF, which has a nationwide application.</P>
    <P>I support the Government amendment. Funds currently available to the Border counties are unprecedented &mdash; a fact for which all parties and not just this Government can take credit.  The one criticism which I believe is valid, namely the difficulties involved for those who wish to access the funding, is being addressed by the Government, although it is not only of their making. I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, every success with the task he has been given and I ask him to pursue it as a matter of priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I live a distance from the Border region I nonetheless feel obliged to support this motion in the strongest possible way.  We have been wrestling with the political issue for some time and the Government are currently preoccupied with it.  However, one of the practical consequences of partition has been, is now and will remain for the foreseeable future that the Border counties on both sides have been gravely disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that when one cuts off any region from its natural hinterland and economic contact, it will be at a significant disadvantage.  Over the years in <Col N="754" /> Government I became very conscious of this fact.  It can be illustrated by reference to infrastructural investment on the part of the Government.  It was clear to us over the years that the return for investment in major infrastructural development and roadways was much less in the Border counties than it was in counties like Kildare, Tipperary, Longford or Cork because one went so far and no further.</P>
    <P>If one developed a major road in Kildare it opened up the whole area for industrial investment.  The same was true of all the other counties throughout the Republic, but when one was investing in the Border regions one found that the return on the investment was much less than it would be in equivalent areas in the rest of the Republic. One went as far as the Border and no further.  One did not get a return in terms of economic development in a natural hinterland as one would get in Kildare, Dublin or elsewhere.  That has been one of the constant features of the disadvantage to the Border areas by virture of the partition of the island and it remains so to this day.</P>
    <P>When I became Minister for Foreign Affairs I was privileged to propose to my colleagues in the European Community in 1978 that the European Community had a role to play in the economic development of disadvantaged regions on both sides of the Border.  I recall the day with some degree of satisfaction when at an informal meeting of the Foreign Ministers it was agreed that, for the first time, the European Community would take a hand in supporting economic and infrastructural developments in the Border regions. Obviously, it has come a long way since then, which I greatly welcome. However, the condition we addressed in 1978 remains a major disability in the Border regions.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House will complain about special priorities for the Border regions and the six north-eastern counties. <Col N="755" /> Nobody will complain about that as a measure of our political commitment, our understanding, our common purpose and solidarity.  We all need to demonstrate that to be so.  Whether that is fairly reflected in the 80:20 allocation being applied by the European Union is the issue.  There is at least as much economic deprivation in Counties Monaghan, Cavan, Louth and Donegal as exists on the other side of the Border. For that reason there has always been an onus on us to ensure that we compensate to the maximum possible extent for this imposed disadvantage.  It is not a natural disadvantage.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the level of industrial investment in the Border regions over the years, one will see there has been a distinct lack of such investment compared to that in the Minister of State's constituency in Clare and even in Tipperary, which has not been a focal point for industrial development, not to mention Dublin, Cork or Galway.  The reason for that is obvious.  External investors looked at conditions as they found them and discovered that the disadvantage to which I have referred exists.  They wanted immediate infrastructural access to ports and other entry points.  They wanted the natural amenities that are required to make a successful enterprise area and they concluded that our Border counties did not have what they wanted, for the reason I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Donegal clearly has been disadvantaged as it is the most northern county on the island and is cut off from its natural hinterland in Derry.  Try to think of Derry without thinking of Donegal and think of Donegal without thinking of Derry: it is a contradiction to attempt to isolate one from the other.  They are both part of the same culture, the same geographic entity and the same community spirit, which is an essential characteristic of any development.</P>
    <P>If Donegal differs from the other Border counties it is a tribute to its local <Col N="756" /> authority representatives and those of Derry.  They have done everything possible at regional and county level to overcome this imposed disability and the level of co-operation, which I witnessed as Minister for Agriculture and Food, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Finance, between both local authorities has been exemplary.  I have no doubt, however, that it would have yielded much more if there was not an unnatural disability imposed on them.  It is only in relatively recent times, with the developments that have taken place through Fruit of the Loom and so forth, that we found we could present both counties as a composite for a programme for development.  That is why I support this motion.</P>
    <P>The European Community indicated from the first that it was supportive and it has demonstrated that support. However, it has been demonstrated through matching funding, a system it applies in every such case.  I worry that even if there is an 80:20 ratio we may be at risk of losing the 20 per cent share because the Government is not putting up the matching funds to ensure that we draw down that 20 per cent.  I am from Tipperary and that is a long way geographically from the regions concerned. However, I like to think I am not far philosophically from those regions.  The least they are entitled to is that we would put up the matching funds and ensure they will get the maximum return, a return they are not getting at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Government's amendment to this motion.  The motion makes no sense when one examines what has happened over recent years.  It might have made sense in the late 1980s or early 1990s but it makes no sense now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the catchphrase in the Border counties at present?  There are too many funds, everybody is confused and nobody knows what to apply for.  We <Col N="757" /> are referring to enterprising people not knowing which fund to choose and not being able to find out which fund is appropriate or available.  It makes no sense.  Enterprising people by definition are the salt of the earth and generally know how to find their way around funds that might be available.</P>
    <P>Another thing one often hears said in the Border counties is: &ldquo;We are not getting our fair share&rdquo;.  Who is getting their fair share?  I do not know.  It is just another catchphrase.  The local newspapers carry headlines in which Deputy or Senator so-and-so claims the Border counties are not getting their fair share. I canvassed in Donegal during the by-election campaign along with many friends and colleagues from Monaghan. They came back with reports that Letterkenny was like a city &mdash; on one's way into the town one was confronted with roundabouts and got confused by them and huge road construction projects. They came back to Monaghan and said: &ldquo;We are not getting our fair share; Donegal is getting it all&rdquo;.  However, Donegal people were also claiming they were not getting their fair share because Monaghan or some other county was getting all the money.  It is the poor mouth phenomemon and a product of our dependency culture.  We are entirely dependent on others and we keep screaming for more.</P>
    <P>We have been moaning about additionality and matching funds for a long time and we ask why there are no matching funds at local authority level. There are many people who should strike their breasts and say &ldquo;<i>mea culpa</i>&rdquo;. Local authorities in Ireland have no matching funds because most of their money is secured by screaming at the Government.  Why?  It is a result of decisions taken in 1977 to buy people's votes.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are impotent.  They can make little input into local development although they are local development authorities.  They cannot carry out <Col N="758" /> development because they have no matching funds and no way of getting them.  They scream at the Government for them.  A terrible dependency culture is running throughout Irish society; it is endemic.  We must develop backbone. This motion would be better if it was positive and honed in on a few deficiencies rather than simply condemn the Government.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what is available in the Border counties at present but is creating so much confusion.  The funds include the INTERREG fund which Senator O'Kennedy mentioned and which he was involved in establishing. The INTERREG II fund is doing valuable work in the Border counties.  There is also the IFI fund, although if Fianna Fáil had had its way it would not exist. However, it exists and has made an incredible contribution in every parish since 1987.  Small enterprises exist throughout the area because there was support available through the IFI.  Virtually all the hotels in Cavan and Monaghan have received funding from IFI as have some of the guesthouses.  It is doing a tremendous job.</P>
    <P>We have seen the establishment of county enterprise boards.  They are putting money into smaller developments throughout the area.  We also have a county enterprise fund in each Border county.  It provides equity or the matching funds, about which people continue to moan.  Equity is available for people who want to set up an enterprise but cannot get the money required.  The county enterprise fund was set up by the IFI to provide some of the matching funds necessary.  A company in the Border counties called Enterprise Equity provides equity for companies which are not able to start their business from grant aid and their own funds.  It is doing tremendous work there.  The Leader programme has reached every parish and townland in the Border counties and throughout Ireland.  We also have the usual operational programmes. <Col N="759" /> People say they are confused but they are only making excuses.  There is so much money in the country, we are wallowing in it.</P>
    <P>This motion is a reflection of the minds of those who tabled it.  It is negative and destructive and it does not further anyone's cause in the Border counties.  I disagree with the last sentence &mdash;&ldquo;and calls on the Government to utilise all available peace initiative funds towards industrial infrastructural development in the Border areas&rdquo;. Most of the peace initiative funds are provided by the European Union while the Irish and British Governments provide smaller amounts.  There was wide consultation and everyone in this House had an opportunity to be present at meetings to discuss the priorities long before the criteria were set down.  Those people who now condemn what happened are condemning themselves. They did not make their voices heard at the time.  The milk is now spilt and they have no option but to lick it off the ground.</P>
    <P>I am happy the funds are directed differently from other available funds and that they are trying to improve the lives of those who have had a rough time over the past 25 years because they live in Border counties.  The money highlights the peace dividend and this should not be interfered with.  There is enough money in the other funds I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The criticism of the Taoiseach is widely misunderstood.  The Taoiseach and the Government were asked to give money to increase the amount of grant aid available.  He is not willing to do that and I agree with him.  In four or five years' time we will say good-bye to grants, and the sooner the better.  If we, as a nation, cannot develop a little backbone and stop whinging and screaming in a dependent way we will never make progress.  The sooner these grants are wiped out the better.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> I support the amendment and decry the reasoning behind the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is foolish because it is divisive.  We should have common concerns and we should work together in the Border counties, but a motion like this does not help.  It is not good enough to cry the béal bocht all the time or to force the Government to say we are delighted with what is being done.  There is a happy medium. Motions like this do not help when there is still work to be done.</P>
      <P>The motion makes the assumption that the Government lacks commitment. If that is true, which it is not, the same lack of commitment was shown by the last Government headed by Fianna Fáil.  It also makes the assumption that the Government provides all the funds. That is not true either because Europe provides the vast majority of funding and it decides how it will be spent.  The motion states that the peace initiative funds should be utilised in industrial infrastructural development.  That is a huge assumption to make.  It is simple and naive to say that the problems of the Border counties would be sorted out by a few vacant factories.  It is on that basis that I strongly oppose the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I grew up in Kinlough in North Leitrim which is across the lake from Garrison in County Fermanagh.  I now live in Castleblayney, County Monaghan, which is surrounded by the North.  That experience has taught me that people in the Border counties have suffered a lot as a result of the troubles in the past 25 years.  Not only were farms divided but people were cut off from their natural hinterland.  Businesses found it impossible to expand and parishes were also divided.  People in Dublin fail to realise the effect this had on communities living along the Border; this effect should not be underestimated.  I am not crying the béal bocht, but we deserve something in peace times to make up for that.  Petrol stations closed in Castleblayney during <Col N="761" /> the troubles and did not open again until recently.  The troubles had a direct impact on the Border towns and villages. It is important that these funds are spent to build a new vibrant community south of the Border so that we can pick up the pieces and make up for lost opportunities.</P>
    <P>The greatest sign of peace for people in the Border counties was the opening of the Border roads.  County Monaghan was greatly affected because at least 50 roads had been closed.  I thank the Tánaiste for his work as Minister with direct responsibility for this area.  His presence in both this Government and the last provided a continuing force in the search for a peaceful settlement. Some years ago at a party conference I called for the opening of Border roads. That seemed like a dream then but it soon became reality.  This development has had a huge impact on people in the Border areas.</P>
    <P>There is a perception that a lot of money is available but we cannot get our hands on it.  That creates problems. Community groups and businesses constantly hear about INTERREG, Cohesion Funds, IFI, the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, the Leader programme and county enterprise boards.  People think there is a deliberate ploy to confuse them and that causes frustration.  There is a definite lack of co-ordination.  This is not a recent problem, it has always existed. There are too many offices dealing with too many areas and more co-ordination would help.  Given that there are at least 36 programmes, people would need to be geniuses to be able to go through each sub-programme and know exactly what funds apply to them because this is not clear from the documentation available on the subject.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with regard to matching funds.  In order to make a project viable and worth while, funds should be available.  People locally should not expect 100 per cent hand outs.  If they <Col N="762" /> feel a project is worth while, they should be able to raise funds for it locally. However, there are communities which cannot afford to do this in the time available to them.  It is on this basis that I would argue strongly that matching funds should be made available from funds such as the IFI.  This should be seriously considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that there is a problem with regard to infrastructure. However, it has been vastly improved over the last few years.  Massive infrastructural investment can be seen in Donegal and other counties along the Border.  We must acknowledge that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, has pumped money into roads, which we badly needed in Cavan and Monaghan.  However, there is still a long way to go, particularly when we see the huge advantages in terms of infrastructure enjoyed by people who live north of the Border.  Although this advantage is unfair, we must realise that it exists.</P>
    <P>We also have a problem with regard to inward investment.  Border areas were ignored for many years and they must now catch up.</P>

      <P>I wish to outline possible solutions which the Minister might consider.  There is a crucial need to provide information about grants to ordinary people in ordinary language.  We need more co-ordination and I welcome the Minister's appointment with regard to the task force.  We need to speed up the process so that it does not take months to deal with applications with the result that people may find it is too late to submit other ones.  We need more focus from Forbairt and the IDA on inward investment and domestic support in the Border counties.  We need to look at the provision of matching funds through, possibly, the IFI.  We need to consider special tax incentives.  Such <Col N="763" /> incentives were provided for seaside resorts, but Border counties have a greater case to make for them.  I call on the Minister to provide improved roads from Greenore to Dundalk and to Sligo. This is vital if we are to build a base in terms of infrastructure and industry in the Border counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot hope to go into the sort of detail I have listened to tonight.  I can only give my more superficial impression of the problem.  I was disappointed to hear Senator McGowan and others use phrases such as &ldquo;sundered territory&rdquo; and &ldquo;separated brethren&rdquo;. This has nothing to do with the problem.  The Government is a sovereign one and I have the honour to stand and serve it this evening.  It is a party to the agreement for consent in the North. I respectfully suggest that the problem of the Border areas should be addressed as a single problem and not as it bears on the North, on history and on 70 years of separation.  It should not be addressed with cries that &ldquo;they have taken away my hinterland and I know not where to find it&rdquo;.  This issue is to be addressed on 10 June and should not be dealt with here during a discussion on Border areas.</P>
      <P>When I first heard the word &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; I was greatly struck by it. This was 30 years ago when Captain Terence O'Neill used it to refer to Craigavon.  He built the M1, which shows that good roads in the North did not stem since the Troubles.  It was built to convey heavy goods from Craigavon to Larne.  The M2 was built later.  Captain O'Neill was ahead of his time and he built not just roads but also good towns.  This was when &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; first came into the vocabulary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion ought to condemn all Governments since the founding of the State.  I would like to see an exercise carried out in which we would, based on the hypothesis that the Border never <Col N="764" /> existed, see what state the Border counties would be in.  I remember when these counties were envied.  I used to travel by train through Goragh Wood to Dundalk to buy items which were not available in Northern Ireland.  Every advantage the North has today was sorely bought.  We could not get these goods because we fought the Fascists from 1939 to 1945 and were bombed by them.  We paid a heavy price for our involvement in that war.  The steps taken by the Labour Government in Britain in 1945 and the Butler Education Act gave an impetus to the Northern state which it normally would not have had.  Wonderful talents were brought out to pull the State up to a par with the best of what the British could do.</P>
    <P>Monaghan is the only Border county about which I know in any depth.  I attended a function in the Four Seasons Hotel in Monaghan and I was absolutely touched by the almost desperation in the faces of the people there at the plight in which they find themselves. They work hard and they have many volunteers and good ideas.  I have seen the brochure they have drawn up and the ways they have suggested of tackling this dreadful problem.  They are tackling it well on their own.  There is no effort comparable to it in the North.  This work is bringing the community together.</P>
    <P>I know that Senator McGowan and his colleagues will agree that efforts should not be directed towards looking at the extra money being provided in Northern Ireland.  People who live cheek by jowl with others are bound to make such comparisons.  Within Northern Ireland, the agricultural sector made comparisons between it and the urban sector.  It argued that urban decay was being addressed to a far greater extent than it ought to have been and that money should be diverted to agriculture. Such a reaction is only human nature.</P>
    <P>This motion clearly seeks not a reduction in the assistance received by <Col N="765" /> Northern Ireland but an increase in the assistance to Border counties to help them rise as close to the level of Northern Ireland as possible.  I agree with this proposal.  However, I must support the amendment, because in my view the present situation is the fault not just of this Government but of every Government which has touched on the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to reply to this motion.  This Government has been extremely successful in generating economic growth.  It is important now to ensure that all our people benefit from the increase in economic activity which has been generated.  The Government, the European Commission and the wider international community recognise that the Border region is economically and socially disadvantaged.  In recognising this fact, additional programmes have been put in place in the Border region.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the Government's socio-economic strategy are: to maximise the growth potential of the economy and services in tourism, agriculture and natural resources; to put in place productive infrastructure to improve the capacity and competitiveness of the economy; to maximise the skills and access to opportunity of our people through education and training; to place a special emphasis on harnessing local energies for socio-economic development and to rebuild the economic potential of unemployment blackspots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key feature of the Government's approach is the tackling of long-term unemployment, economic marginalisation and social exclusion.  The European Union, through the Community support framework, supports the actions which the Government is taking to achieve socio-economic development. Operational programmes are in place which fund activities in the area of agriculture, <Col N="766" /> farm investment, farm diversification, headage payments, control of farm pollution and research and advisory services.  The tourism and human resources operational programmes fund tourism projects and education together with training activities.  Under the industrial development operational programme, measures are funded which upgrade and improve the capabilities and capacity of indigenous firms, enhance the level and quality of research and development and improve industries' marketing capability. Actions are supported which improve the economic infrastructure, environmental services and fisheries.</P>
    <P>Under these programmes, which operate nationally, it is expected that approximately £1.7 billion will be spent in the Border region up to the end of 1999.  This represents a <i>per capita</i> expenditure of £3,846 in the Border region as against an average <i>per capita</i> expenditure for the country of £3,338.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, both the European Union and the wider international community recognise that the Border region is disadvantaged.  The fact that it is a border region means that it is cut off from its natural hinterland.  The violence that has taken place in Northern Ireland over the past 25 years has also had a negative impact.  This recognition has been given tangible expression through the INTERREG programme, the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation and the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The INTERREG II programme was approved in February 1995 and has generated a lot of interest in the Border area.  However, implementation of the programme has been slower than anticipated because of the need to design and agree a common project selection, monitoring and evaluation process between the relevant agencies in the South and their Northern counterparts.</P>
    <P>Out of a total of £96 million available to the Republic, £36 million has been specifically earmarked to support the <Col N="767" /> Department of the Environment in the areas of roads, water and sewerage works.  In addition, most of the funding available under the economic development measure of the INTERREG programme has been earmarked for actions supporting integrated area development and small and medium enterprises in the Border region.  The total public funding available to this measure is £12 million.</P>
    <P>The special EU initiative on Peace and Reconciliation is a generous response to the unique opportunities and additional needs which have sprung directly from the quest for peace.  Funding under the various measures of the programme was consequential on the weighting given to the various constituent sectors by the EU Commission task force which took wide ranging consultations in the area.  The programme contains measures which are intended to contribute directly to economic development.</P>
    <P>Approximately £2 million is available under Subprogramme 5, productive investment, to increase trade and marketing both within the island of Ireland and beyond and to promote linkages between large firms and small to medium sized enterprises, local suppliers and networks and industrial clusters. Under another measure of the programme, £1 million is available to provide the facilities necessary to maximise the opportunities emerging, especially in deprived areas, and to support the development of small business, including tourism and subcontracting from larger businesses.  Some £1 million is available to promote peace and reconciliation through initiatives aimed at boosting action for jobs and combating unemployment, especially among disadvantaged groups.  Some £2 million is available to support innovative actions, especially those with the potential to create and safeguard jobs in deprived areas or in sectors which have been <Col N="768" /> particularly disadvantaged by the conflict.</P>
    <P>Particular emphasis has been given to measures which promote social inclusion.  This theme extends across all the measures and there is also a specific social inclusion subprogramme which accounts for 30 per cent of the total funds available.</P>
    <P>To date under the local development programme, three area partnerships in Border counties have had their plans appraised by ADM Limited.  These are Dundalk, Drogheda and Donegal Local Development Company which has been allocated approximately £6 million to the end of 1999.  There are six further partnerships in Border counties who, it is expected, will submit their action plans before the end of the summer. These are Counties Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim, Sligo, Donegal and the Inishowen and Donegal Gaeltacht areas.  There are six Leader groups operating in the Border region.  For the period to the end of 1999 they will receive funding of £12.74 million.</P>
    <P>In addition, the International Fund for Ireland, which is financed by international contributions from the United States, the European Union, Canada, New Zealand, and most recently Australia, has contributed funds to the region.  It gives top priority to areas of particular disadvantage.</P>
    <P>One issue which needs to be considered, however, is how best to channel this financial support from both national and European sources.  The variety of programmes and initiatives can be confusing. For that reason, I have been asked by the Taoiseach to review these arrangements to ensure that they are as effective as possible.  I am currently examining the various programmes and I intend to make recommendations to the Government in the near future which will improve the co-ordination of this vital effort.</P>
    <P>While recognising the unique needs of the area and the need for industrial infrastructure, it is essential to ensure <Col N="769" /> that the development of the area is balanced. With regard to the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, any decision on a refocusing or a reallocation of funding from one measure to another can only be made with the approval of the programme's joint monitoring committee.  This committee includes EU representatives as well as representatives of relevant Departments and implementing agencies.  In normal circumstances, such reallocation of funding would only occur as a consequence of the failure of particular measures to use up their allocation.</P>
    <P>Account may also have to be taken of the extent to which the objectives of a particular measure are already supported under EU financed programmes. It is desirable that the application process and the appropriate agency to which applications are addressed should be as clear and as simple as possible for individuals making applications.  It is also essential that people should know the objectives and targets of each programme, the complementary nature of the programmes and the additional nature of the funding provided.  Departments are required to examine on an ongoing basis the possibilities of refocusing operational programmes and other Community initiatives to provide additional support for Border counties. Given the long lead-in time, it is difficult to refocus programmes where large projects are concerned.  However, the position regarding small scale schemes is kept under review.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that all INTERREG II and Programme for Peace and Reconciliation funds in particular have been and will continue to be allocated to the counties for which they were intended and there has not been and will not be offsetting reductions in other funding.</P>
    <P>I am pleased I have been given this opportunity by the Seanad to put on the record the Government's commitment <Col N="770" /> to the development of the Border counties. I have given a broad overview of the Government's priorities and objectives for the development of the region. We should strive to ensure that all our people benefit from the favourable economic conditions that now apply. We are all agreed that it is vital that the Border region, which we all recognise has particular difficulties, should gain to the maximum extent possible from all the programmes and initiatives in place.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed, even my colleague from the mid-west. I listened to each contribution.  I have visited the Border areas a number of times recently and was struck by the vibrancy of Buncrana, Letterkenny and Derry and the interaction there.  Anybody who met the people living in the areas close to the Border spoke of Derry as being the capital town.  I found half of the people were employed in Derry and the other half in Buncrana, County Donegal.</P>

      <P>I would not be as despondent as Senator McGowan was about it.  There is a need to update the spending and improve the way in which it is being drawn down.  To that end I must compliment the Combat Poverty Agency and the ADM for the initiative they are taking in this area &mdash; they have re-focused the application.  There had been a complicated system of applying and, as Senator Cotter said, it is very easy to make an application now that there is a simpler form.  They have set up a one stop shop in Monaghan, from which we hope all the information for the myriad of programmes can be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that I have inherited this myriad of programmes and I hope to see that the economy of the Border regions benefits from all the moneys that are <Col N="771" /> available and can be drawn down.  I will take into consideration all the points which have been made by Senators and I agree with Senator McAughtry that we need to join with our Northern brethren.</P>
    <P>While in County Donegal before the by-election, I read in Northern newspapers of attacks on northern local authorities for the lack of development of major roads, particularly, for instance, the road from Derry to Monaghan. These reports illustrated the point by referring to the quality of the road from Monaghan to Dublin at present.  The report could not understand why the Northern Ireland authorities were not putting more funds into that area, so Senators must be a little balanced too as some Northern Ireland development has not been to everybody's advantage.  Perhaps the roads are too twisty for Senator McGowan and hold him up or perhaps they hold up lorries.  I do not know exactly, but I believe we can come to an agreement.  I have seen tremendous development associated with the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal and the people who pushed that project initially are to be complimented, because many people doubted whether it would ever be of any value.  I am glad it has been such a success.  It is the Government's intention, as I said, to provide the one stop shop to expedite the applications which have been processed already.  As one Senator said, some 76 applications have been made under a number of measures.  These allocations will be announced in the very near future.</P>
    <P>When Senators see the result of the work of the task force for the committee, they will resist trying to down play the value of the measures put into place to relieve the depression which had hit the region.  I would also have to balance that by saying that expectations have been raised way beyond reality.  If this motion does anything to me, it makes <Col N="772" /> me shiver a little, because while I have answered this question on numerous occasions in the Dáil, the fact of the matter is that when all these other measures were being negotiated at the time, the main Opposition party was in the position to include these conditions, such as the supply of factory bays in townlands which had been bereft of population or badly hit.  That was not included in any of the measures, but these and all the criteria were agreed by all the people at a roundtable conference. The only measure I can offer in that regard is that there will be a mid-term review, which will begin at the end of June.  Perhaps recommendations can be put forward in that mid-term review to alter some of the criteria already in place for the allocation of these funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because this is not my area.  I was struck by something Senator O'Kennedy said earlier in the debate, which has been reiterated to some extent by the Minister, that is, that both sides of the Border had suffered from the artificial division. That is true, but it is still the case and I have never seen an adequate explanation of it.  I do not know whether the work has been done to allow an adequate explanation to be given, but if you compare population movements directly on both sides of the Border either since independence or, more particularly, since 1980, you will find that the population has declined in virtually every area on our side of the Border. There is scarcely an area, including the most rural areas on the far side, whose population has declined.  Some of them have just stabilised and some have gained by 2 or 3 per cent, that is, small gains, but there is a very striking difference in the pattern so it is not a question of just one area being lucky, or a particular initiative or factory being in an area.  There must be something systemic, to use that horrible word, that is leading to population stabilisation at <Col N="773" /> least; and I would go a little beyond that in terms of the figures available.  There-fore, there has been a marginal increase in population on the Northern side and an absolute consistent decline in population on the Southern side the whole way from Dundalk, County Louth, to north County Donegal, in county after county.  I would like to see some inquiry conducted into why that is the case.</P>
      <P>I share many of the reservations expressed about consultants which one has heard here today and I have expressed them myself on other occasions, but if the right question is asked, consultants can be worth hiring. The problem with consultants when the wrong questions are asked is that it does not matter tuppence what blasted answer they come up with because it will not solve anything anyway.</P>
      <P>Population decline in Border areas is a very important issue and it has been greatly neglected, to the best of my knowledge, in the type of inquiries which are worth while from a policy-making point of view because it cannot only be due to location or the various handicaps which have been so eloquently expressed here today.  That is important, and trying to find out whether there is some reason for this would be more important than any number of debates. It may be exacerbated by the way EU funding is used or allocated, but I think it existed before the funding came on the scene at all so it is independent to some extent of the funding issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, I am a little depressed by the tone of the discussion, not by individual points made.  The Minister's document is fine as far as it goes, but let us just say that it is aspirational, to use that term in a neutral sense.  I am not complaining about that as such, because he has inherited the brief relatively recently, but we talk about an enterprise culture time and time again and if ever one hears of dependency psychology, it is in this type of debate.  Why are there not more funds for A, B and C?  Senator <Col N="774" /> Cotter said that an area was not getting its fair share.  Which area is not getting its fair share?  No area is getting its fair share.  Which area is getting more than its fair share somewhere along the line?</P>
    <P>Senator Maloney said there were 36 programmes.  The Telesis report of the early 1980s used a phrase about strong agencies and weak firms, and it seems there is a hint of that psychology developing here.  Any number of programmes are being developed, but who is in a position to actually use them effectively or even promote independent initiative in these areas?  I am loath to believe that there is less enterprise in these areas than anywhere else in the country but it seems the whole debate is focusing around what the Government is doing and who is operating EU programmes most effectively.  I am a strong believer in whatever can be got from Europe, and the more the better, but these funds will be used up at some stage.  They are not infinite.  They will lead doubtless to some improvement, but will that improvement be simply temporary?  Will it be palliated or will it vanish consequently once those funds decline, as they will inevitably?</P>
    <P>We need not just more balanced development within these counties but a better balance between what local initiative is doing and what is expected from outside.  I understand it in terms of party politics but I cannot see the Border areas gaining greatly in the long term from the virtual obsession with what funds are available from elsewhere to help us do things we apparently cannot do for ourselves.  We talk about £2 million being available for linkages between large firms and small and medium firms.  What are the large firms?  Are they incapable of themselves identifying where those linkages ought to be?  There is hardly a mention of business people.</P>
    <P>I suspect that I am beginning to sound like a Redemptorist preacher so I had better stop.  We must get away from the <Col N="775" /> assumption that it is the responsibility of somebody somewhere else to bail us out; if we cannot bail ourselves out, the Government, regardless of its composition, or somebody in Brussels is primarily responsible.  However legitimate the complaints about the disadvantages from which the Border areas suffer &mdash; and they are legitimate &mdash; the area will never pull itself out of its difficulties unless the psychology changes.  A dependency psychology will never solve its problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an all-party meeting of representatives of the southern Border counties and we highlighted to the Tánaiste the need to get <Col N="776" /> our act together.  The bottom line is simple: we cannot avail of all the funding and, as Senator Maloney said, there are 33 funds.  It has been made crystal clear by the Commissioner for Regional Development that we cannot draw down funds because this Government has not provided matching funding.  The Minister of State made heavy play of sewerage schemes in Musk and Ballybofey. After ten years of waiting the Minister of State is providing £2 million for the schemes out of INTERREG funding.  The funds should not have come from INTERREG and people know that.</P>
      <P>Senator Reynolds spoke about the opening of Border roads and the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  A four year old child would know that the roads were opened and the canal was funded and opened long before any member of his party was remotely associated with Government.  Let us be realistic. Senator McAughtry said that somebody had decried the brethren.  The word &ldquo;brethren&rdquo; was never mentioned.  For the Senator's information, the Northern Ireland economy has been based on a £19 million per day contribution from British funds for the past 26 years.  We are not even going to match them.</P>
      <P>Northern Ireland would not exist for a warm day if the British turned off the funds tap.  That is the reality and not simply a declaration dreamed up by me. I am not criticising them; I compliment them and their public representatives who have been more aggressive and more successful than we have been.  I can offer an example.  A conference was held in Washington and it was highlighted, sponsored and managed by the Tánaiste.  The feedback is that the Republic of Ireland was there socially but Northern Ireland was there on business.</P>

      <P>The current enrolment at the girls' school is 304 girls and 13 traveller children, giving a total of 317. The enrolment in the boys' school is 303.  At present, 70 children, boys and girls, are attending the remedial classes and the principal tells me this is totally unacceptable as the recommended number per remedial teacher is 40.  I am sure the Minister can confirm if that figure is accurate.</P>
      <P>The situation becomes intolerable when one considers that a large number of girls do not have any access to the remedial teacher.  I have information indicating the number receiving and in need of remedial support and I can make this available to the Minister. According to the criteria laid down by the Department of Education, Scoil Bhríde boys' and girls' schools do not fall into the disadvantaged area category. However, a large number of pupils attending Scoil Bhríde live in disadvantaged areas outside what is deemed its catchment area.</P>
      <P>The position as I understand it has changed since last week.  I submitted this matter for the Adjournment for a number of weeks and before it was reached, the Minister announced last week that all surplus teachers would be assigned to disadvantaged areas.  While I recognise the merit of that move, I am informed it will make the situation in schools, including some disadvantaged areas, much more difficult.  I understand no additional remedial teachers will be appointed this year and no extra teachers to deal with special needs will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scoil Bhríde has written to the Minister and made its case and it has asked me to support its request for a separate <Col N="782" /> remedial teacher for the boys' and girls' schools.  On her first day in office the Minister announced on a radio programme that she would ensure all children have access to the best quality education, particularly at primary level.  She must admit that the situation pertaining in Scoil Bhríde, and another school in Mulhuddart, a growing satellite town with a population of 60,000, means the children do not have access to the best quality education.  I ask the Minister to sanction the appointment of a second remedial teacher at Scoil Bhríde.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Education is not in a position at present to make remedial teacher posts available to the primary school sector.  As has been indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of under-achievement in primary schools. Substantial additional resources have been allocated to this area in recent years.  In 1995 an additional 55 remedial teachers were appointed to primary schools and 223 schools benefited from this allocation.  This brought the total number of remedial teachers in place to 1,188.  Of the 3,209 ordinary national schools throughout the country, approximately 2,285 now have the service of remedial teachers, either on a full-time or a shared basis.  Of the 408 ordinary national schools in County Dublin, 394 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis.  This includes 16 schools allocated a remedial service with effect from the commencement of the current school year as part of the distribution of 55 posts.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need following the collection and analysis of information <Col N="783" /> from the schools by the Department's primary inspectorate and also having consideration for data submitted by schools.  This means that 98 per cent of pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Dublin currently enjoy a remedial service.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has indicated to the House her intention to review the needs in this area and consider how best these needs can be addressed within available resources. When the Minister is in a position to further extend the remediation service, Scoil Bhríde boys' and girls' schools will receive every consideration.</P>
    <P>At this stage 87 per cent of the pupils in our primary schools have the possibility of access to a remedial teacher. This is a big improvement on the position when the Minister took office in 1993 when 77 per cent of pupils had the possibility of such access.  It is a matter of regret to the Minister that it is not possible at present to meet the needs of all pupils for remedial teaching as, unfortunately, she does not have unlimited resources.</P>

      <P>About 560 boys attend Scoil Cholmcille.  It is the town school in the parish of Conwell and Leck.  This parish has now divided resulting in a situation whereby all the local authority housing is in the school area of Scoil Cholmcille while the new church and the two associated schools have no local authority housing whatsoever.  In relation to the characteristics of the school going population, Scoil Cholmcille has an increasing number of children from dysfunctional families, social and financial deprivation, inadequate parenting and, in many cases, a poor home environment.  I am also concerned about the increasing number of children attending this school who are in need of remedial help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1995 the results of the micra T level that was administered to <Col N="784" /> the first classes showed that 17 children from a class of 36 had a standard score of 90 or below; in the second classes 12 children out of 34 had a score of 90 or below while in the other class eight children out of 33 had a standard score of 90 or below.  Two more children from this group need remedial help with specific learning difficulty.</P>
    <P>Up to 30 per cent or more of the children come from local authority housing with up to 10 per cent living in flats. About 20 to 30 per cent of the parents would have medical cards and up to 30 per cent would be in receipt of unemployment benefit.  A large number of the children come from single parent families and quite a number from broken marriages or families with alcohol problems and families in poverty. My figures are conservative as it is hard to get correct figures because people are not always prepared to speak about their circumstances.</P>
    <P>The town of Letterkenny has seen phenomenal growth over the past number of years and such unplanned and largely unforeseen growth has brought all the social problems associated with a major growth area.  We have our share of crime, vandalism, one parent families, poor housing, high rents, drug related problems, etc.  The school is one of the few with a resource teacher.  The resource teacher is burdened with children from other schools which do not have this service.  This places a great burden on the resource teacher who, because of the numbers, can only deal with children who have reading problems.</P>
    <P>The other schools in the town have seen huge increases in enrolment over the past two to three years but their intake has almost exclusively been from the better off families in the town.  As a direct result of this Scoil Cholmcille will be losing a teacher this year whereas, because of its changing status in the community I believe it should be entitled to an extra teacher.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to grant disadvantaged status to Scoil Cholmcille in Letterkenny and allow it to hold on to <Col N="785" /> the teacher it has rather than lose one at the end of the year.  The teaching staff has always given outstanding service to the local community and it is imperative that everything possible should be done to help.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the school in question has sought disadvantaged area status. The disadvantaged areas scheme was last expanded in 1994 when an additional 54 primary schools were included.  The needs of the school in question were considered on that occasion.  However, having regard to the level of competing demands from other schools at that time, the needs of this school were not considered sufficiently pressing to warrant its inclusion on that occasion.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, schools have been selected for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socio-economic indicators.  The indicators in question were developed by a working group comprised of representatives of the Department of Education, schools management and the INTO and have been in operation for some years. Factors taken into account included the incidence of unemployment; local authority housing occupancy and medical card holding among the parents of the children concerned.  Account was also taken of the views of the Department's primary inspectorate on the relative levels of need between applicant schools and the prevailing pupil-teacher ratios of the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1995, the Minister for Education commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency to conduct a detailed review of our current approaches to addressing the problem of educational disadvantage. The Minister's decision to commission this study arose from a concern to ensure that our supports were properly targeted and that children with real need were in a position to benefit from the scheme.  The criteria used in selecting schools for special support and <Col N="786" /> the nature of the supports provided were among the issues addressed in the study.</P>
    <P>The report presented by the Combat Poverty Agency was one of the most comprehensive studies of educational disadvantage ever undertaken in the State.  It examined the concept of educational disadvantage as it impacted on schools in the education system.  It reviewed the procedures in place to identify and address educational disadvantage. The report also evaluated the effectiveness of current approaches using a wide range of national and international research data.</P>
    <P>While the report recognised the very considerable advances which have been made in alleviating the effects of educational disadvantage, it also made a series of comments and recommendations aimed at improving current arrangements.  Among the key issues raised in the report was a concern that, under the current criteria, the scheme did not have due regard to rural and dispersed disadvantage.  It was recommended that the criteria be amended to better reflect educational disadvantage as manifested in rural settings as well as urban settings.  It also recommended that a more targeted approach be adopted whereby more generous resources would be directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>In response to the Combat Poverty Agency report, the Minister for Education recently launched a new targeted initiative which aims to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  Schools will be selected for support under this new initiative by reference to new selection criteria which have been developed by the Education Research Centre.  The new criteria take on board the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency and address educational disadvantage in both urban and rural settings. The initiative will have an urban and a rural dimension.</P>
    <P>For urban schools, a targeted programme of supports will be made available <Col N="787" /> to 25 selected large schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway urban areas.  In each of the selected schools there will be a maximum of 15 pupils in all junior classes.  The schools will also have access to special grant assistance for the purchase of books and materials.  Pupils attending these schools will attract enhanced capitation funding at a rate of £75 per pupil.  A newly appointed co-ordinator will support the development of the programme in the selected schools.</P>
    <P>It is also intended that a special initiative will focus on schools with fewer than five teachers and particularly schools in rural areas which are serving dispersed populations and which have <Col N="788" /> concentrations of disadvantaged children. In this case, supports will be made available to 25 clusters of schools.  Each cluster will be served by a newly appointed co-ordinator who will work with the families and teachers involved. Children attending schools in selected clusters will attract a special capitation rate of £75 per pupil.  The schools will also attract special grant assistance for the purchase of books and other materials.  The Education Research Centre has been commissioned to contact the target schools and invite applications for consideration for support under the new initiative.  It is expected that this exercise will commence in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 16 May 1996.</P>
