      <P>I have notice from Senator Maloney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to give written confirmation to Hydro Seafood, Fanad, County Donegal, relating to approval and grant assistance for the proposed processing plant at Fanad, in order to secure 35 jobs at present and allow for the creation of an extra 20 jobs.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to address the hardship caused to small milk producers because of recent changes in the mode of operation of the temporary milk leasing scheme.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGowan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to make a statement on the student summer jobs scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected <Col N="238" /> Senator Maloney's and Senator Kiely's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator McGowan may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business will be items 1, 2, 3 and 20, motion 30.  Item 1 is Committee and Final Stages of the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 1995, and will be taken until 1 o'clock.  If that Bill has not been completed by 1 o'clock, it will continue after Private Members' time this evening; it will be resumed at 8 p.m.  I am making this a fixed time of 8 o'clock in case Private Members' business finishes early.</P>
      <P>Items 2 and 3 will be taken between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.  Item 3 may be discussed with the Second Stage of item 2. The two items are linked.  I hope, if we can, to finish all Stages of items 2 and 3 today but, if not, I will make further time available on Friday to conclude those items.  There is no question of a guillotine.  Item 20, motion 30, is Private Members' time from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to items 2 and 3, we are keen for that Bill to be passed as soon as possible because it is in the interest of the three hospitals.  We have received correspondence from the secretariat of each hospital indicating that the legislation would be welcome and we will ensure that it is dealt with as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the amount of business that the Leader is trying to complete before we break, but I want to raise two important ongoing issues.  One is today's announcement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry from Brussels. We would welcome an opportunity before we break to discuss agriculture in general, but in particular various decisions made in Brussels in the last 24 hours.  The Leader will also be aware of recent reports on fisheries and today that task force will report to Government <Col N="239" /> and to the press on safety in the fishing industry and also on the major decisions to be made in Brussels soon about the fishing industry overall.  If possible, we would like the Minister for the Marine to come in and discuss the matters with us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright in stating that we would like to conclude all Stages of items 2 and 3 as quickly as possible and would be anxious to facilitate the Leader in that respect.</P>
      <P>It is important that we discuss agriculture and there is time available as far as I can understand from the draft programme of business that was circulated by the Leader.  I welcome the fact that heifers have been included in EU payments but there are other aspects of the package which could be dealt with critically and it is important that we would discuss it in detail.</P>
      <P>There are two other matters.  First, in view of the circulation yesterday of the Price Waterhouse report, when can we expect legislation on defamation, because it appears to be the case now that on a regular basis when reports are produced they are either incomplete or cannot be circulated to the public due to possible defamation actions.  There was a Progressive Democrats Bill to reform the law on defamation and the publication of legislation was promised before the summer recess.  Where are we in respect of the development of that legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter has to do with the Semtex and explosives find at Clonaslee, County Laois.  How is it possible for people on the one hand to say they want discussions and their peace process to continue while on the other they assemble bombs which can blow up in cities, such as London, and probably wreak devastation at home and in Northern Ireland?  This is about the fourth week running in which we have had reason to comment on aspects of the peace process, or the lack of it.  The Leader agreed with me last week that it was important to find some time <Col N="240" /> between now and the end of the session to comment on these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>A few weeks ago I raised the fact that the KPMG report on the financing of local government had been presented to the Minister for the Environment and I understand from media reports that he is likely to publish it tomorrow.  This House would be an appropriate place to lead the debate on the issue of the financing of local government.  We have a detailed collective knowledge of both the problems of and potential for local government.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis in what he said about the arms find in County Laois.  Clearly, an organisation which has been building up such a cache of arms had some intention of using them. I congratulate the Garda on finding the arms, which no doubt has prevented another tragedy.  I support Senator Dardis's view that we should have a debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to what Senator Dardis said, the argument advanced for not publishing the Price Waterhouse report does not carry total conviction.  There may well be huge problems about defamation, but I cannot imagine that they could govern the publication of the entire report.  It is surely not beyond the wit of the Minister or of man to find a way to publish the essence of that report and reassure the public at a sensitive time for so many students and parents that matters are under control and no possible repeat of this can occur.  The defamation argument is not sufficiently strong to prevent the vast bulk of that report from being published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>A press release from the Minister for Education accompanied the copy of the Price Waterhouse report which I received yesterday.  I note from that report that the Government has agreed to have this matter debated in the Dáil.  It is important that there be a debate in this House on the content of the report and, <Col N="241" /> indeed, on the desirability of having an independent appeals procedure established to restore confidence in the public examinations system.  Does the Leader intend allowing time for a debate on the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Sullivan on the matter of the publication of the report on the financing of local authorities.  I find it extraordinary that a report which had not reached the public domain could be discussed this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  It is also extraordinary that certain aspects of the report could be debated without it being in the hands of the public and that certain lines of thought were put forward to direct the manner in which the report would be received and implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis's call for a debate on Northern Ireland before the end of this session. Of course, the debate on the arms find would be linked to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand why we ask Sinn Féin to condemn IRA actions and still expect them to ask the IRA to carry out a ceasefire &mdash; it is impossible to do one without the other &mdash; but it answers a strong sense of outrage felt among democrats at physical force politics.  We need something different.  Sinn Féin should give Unionists something more than baleful threats alternating with honeyed promises of fair play when the British leave, if they leave.  Sinn Féin/IRA should loosen up.  If they cannot sit at the table, why do not they not begin ever so gradually to negotiate outside it?  Why do they not let us have their views?  Martin McGuinness hinted that he thought consent was just a negotiating position.  The consent principle for the North involves a minimum of 200,000 Catholics as well as Unionists. How firm is Sinn Féin on consent?  We would like to know that, and it would do no harm to tell us a little outside the table.  There are clues that Sinn Féin might move on it.  If so, why does it not release something from without the conference <Col N="242" /> table?  It would be bound to ease its way towards us.  What are its views of an Irish nation on this island with a culture secure and two jurisdictions with consent and a way open for political unity subject to the democratic process?  This might sound unorthodox but anything that can help to bring Sinn Féin into dialogue would be welcomed.  It is not before their time that it let us know it is are not absolutists entirely.</P>

      <P>The Senator got away with a nice speech on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Garda Síochána on the successful detection of the arms dump in County Laois.  People in general would be shocked at the range and extent of bombs and explosives at the site, which were obviously designed to wreak death and injury on probably thousands of people.  It is a serious state of affairs.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice to make some time available to give the House some indication of what further action will be taken, because there is an obvious array of bomb making equipment and explosives available to the IRA in this part of the country?  In complimenting the Garda Síochána, I urge the Minister for Justice to expedite this series of investigations so that any further materials of this nature can be found and taken into the possession of the authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the Price Waterhouse report, I, too, would welcome its full publication, whatever about the fears of the newspaper barons, who can well afford to be challenged on any item on defamation as they have enough money.  I would like to include in any such debate this fallacy &mdash; I say this in a non-partisan way &mdash; of a Minister being responsible for everything while highly paid people are apparently responsible for nothing.  It is high time in the public service that those who take the shilling carry the can. <Col N="243" /> People who occupy high positions within the Government should take responsibility for their actions, as we must &mdash; and we are paid substantially less than most of them.  We must be responsible for our actions and they should be responsible for theirs.</P>
      <P>On the question of the arms find, I join in the remarks of the other Senators.  In any debate on Northern Ireland at present it is distinctly unhelpful for the leader of Senator Dardis's party to continually call on the Taoiseach and others to cease contacts with Sinn Féin.  Nobody, either Government or Opposition, likes to be in contact with Sinn Féin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright and Senator Dardis in their call for a debate on agriculture.  As many Senators wish to contribute to such a <Col N="244" /> debate, I would not like to see a time limit.  I would not mind a time limit on the length of speeches but not on the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we should have a debate on Northern Ireland.  I congratulate the gardaí on the arms find last week.  Since nothing will happen in Northern Ireland until after the next British general election, it is important to use the time constructively.  I would welcome a debate in this House either before or after the summer recess.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Allen, on the publication of the code of ethics and good practice for children's sports in Ireland.  This issue was raised here on a number of occasions.  These guidelines are for adults who are involved in sport for children up to the age of 18.  There are problems as regards competitiveness and the pressure to which people are being subjected.  It is important to discuss this document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Senators who welcomed the arms find in County Laois.  I come from that area and people there were shocked at what happened. They do not support this type of activity.  We were all shocked at the capacity to kill so many people in Britain and Ireland.  If Sinn Féin is committed to the peace process, what will it do to ensure it continues?  The implied threat of violence is unacceptable to anyone on this island, including Senator Magner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to hear Senator Magner mention highly paid civil servants.  It is only a short time since the Labour Party said that Ministers were responsible for everything.  It is great to see a change of heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate the Garda Síochána on a good job.  I appeal to the public to co-operate with the gardaí so that they can solve some of the brutal murders in this country.  I fear what will happen if criminals get away with shooting people outside their homes.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the price of magazines.  The punt is worth more than the pound at present, yet magazines are almost 20 per cent dearer.  Why is there a difference in price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not VAT.  I am surprised the ladies are not raising this issue because there are more ladies' than men's magazines.  It is time something was done about this.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Irish and British ladies golfing team who won the Curtis Cup.  They are helping the peace process by showing unity between the two islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Garda on the arms find last week.  We must bear in mind that our security forces have always taken chances for peace.  I also congratulate the Minister for Justice. When something goes wrong, she is criticised but when something good happens, no one praises her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Garda on this find.  It is reprehensible that we still have armaments in our midst.  I agree with Senator Magner that the politics of condemnation will not contribute to the creation of peace.  Discussion, debate and negotiation and people willing to take risks for peace will contribute to peace on this island. There has never been peace in any conflict anywhere without discussion, debate and negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also agree with Senator Magner that we should have a debate on ministerial responsibility.  However, I remind him that it is normal to criticise the concept of ministerial responsibility when one is <Col N="246" /> in Government and to praise it when one is in Opposition.  I am consistent in both Government and Opposition in that I think it is a Victorian farce and the sooner it is removed from public administration the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Opposition parties for their co-operation on items 2 and 3.  I propose a limit of 20 minutes per speaker on Second Stage of that Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright, Senator Rory Kiely and Senator Dardis asked for a debate on agriculture.  As I indicated, there will be a debate next Wednesday from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  I would like to keep it as a regular feature so the debate will not finish next week.  I also want to ensure that Members get a chance to make substantial contributions rather than being limited by time.  The debate next week will allow the spokesperson for each group to put their case without a time limit being imposed.  I will see if it is possible to have a short series of statements on fisheries between now and the end of session.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis and others mentioned the Price Waterhouse report.  I am not sure at what stage is the defamation legislation; I suspect it has slipped down the list of priorities but it is being prepared. I will try to have a fuller answer for the Senator before the end of the session.  Colleagues will know that the report on the newspaper industry is due to be published shortly.  I have made a request to the Minister to debate it in this House if it is published between now and the end of the session.  Defamation is covered in that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Senators in congratulating the Garda Síochána on the arms find in Clonaslee.  The arms cache was obscene and chilling and if it had not been discovered we would probably be condemning atrocities and mourning loss of life day after day.  It was a frightening and chilling arsenal of death and destruction which &mdash; I am not into the politics of condemnation &mdash; puts a question mark over the credibility of people who talk about the peace process but <Col N="247" /> who are ambiguous about such activities. That is the stark reality underlying the peace process at present.  Few people are saying we should cut off full contact with Sinn Féin but it is difficult when we cannot believe people.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan mentioned financing of local government.  That report is not available but we should have a debate on it in this House.  It will probably take place in the autumn rather than before the end of this session.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators mentioned the Price Waterhouse report on the examination system which has been published. The Minister for Education acted promptly, openly and in a comprehensive way.  There may be substance in what Senator Lee said about the legal limitations.  I am willing to make time available between now and the end of the session to have a debate on the report.</P>
    <P>Senator McAughtry made an interesting contribution during which he drove a coach and four through the Order of Business.  I am still open-minded about a debate on Northern Ireland before the end of the session.  I will keep it under review with the leaders of the other groups.</P>
    <P>Senator Maloney mentioned the code of ethics for children's sports.  We will not discuss that between now and the end of the session.  Senator Farrell mentioned the price of magazines.  I am also amazed at the disparity in prices when the punt is worth more than the pound.  It might be worth raising that matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <P>Sections 1 to 5, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> In page 7, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) The Minister shall ensure that, in guidelines issued by the Board, the precise interpretation of the words &lsquo;misappropriate&rsquo; and &lsquo;being contemplated&rsquo; as set out in section 38, shall be detailed.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to seek clarification of the words &ldquo;misappropriate&rdquo; and &ldquo;being contemplated&rdquo; because they are slightly nebulous terms.  This amendment would provide an onus for a proper interpretation of those words.  Loose wording causes difficulties in any legislation.  This amendment is essential to ensure the guidelines issued by the board and the precise interpretation of the words &ldquo;misappropriate&rdquo; and &ldquo;being contemplated&rdquo; are set in stone.  It is a worthy amendment which would avoid any future difficulties resulting from the loose wording of the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes that the Pensions Board guidelines should define precisely the terms &ldquo;misappropriate&rdquo; and &ldquo;is being contemplated&rdquo;.  Following consultations with the Pensions Board, the Office of the Attorney General and the relevant organisations which made submissions on the Bill, as indicated on Committee Stage in the Dáil, the text of section 38 of the Bill has been amended and the words &ldquo;is being contemplated&rdquo; are no longer being used nor is the reference to guidelines.  Some concern was expressed about the legality of this approach.  In order to remove any doubts in this regard, the reference in the Bill to guidelines was removed.  Facilitative guidelines may be used by the Pensions Board under its general powers to make such guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not my intention, and I do not believe, that the board would have the right to interpret the precise meaning of a term used in legislation which is not defined in that legislation.  That would be a matter for the courts.  As I understand <Col N="249" /> it, there is a misappropriation when any of the scheme's assets are appropriated by any person who is not entitled to them under the provisions of the scheme or under relevant laws, or are appropriated for the use or benefit of any person otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the scheme and any relevant laws.  For this reason I am opposing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister of State's reply.  However, I genuinely believe that for everybody's sake guidelines should be laid down to ensure there is no loose interpretation of the wording.  If the Minister of State feels that is not acceptable, we have little option but to press the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, paragraph (d), line 15, after &ldquo;appropriate.&rdquo;  to insert &ldquo;The trustees of the scheme should be furnished with a copy of any such report or reports, as the case may be.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to give the board the power to prepare reports of any investigations it carries out and to have discretion over where and to whom such reports are sent. There is an obvious need for this amendment and it must be accepted.  It will create difficulties if it is not laid down exactly who should receive reports into investigations of misappropriations or any misdemeanours.  The trustees of the scheme should be furnished with a copy of any such reports because they are the guardians of the scheme.  While it is obvious they would receive a copy of any report, I cannot see why that should not be guaranteed in the legislation.  I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes that any Pensions Board report prepared in relation to an investigation should be furnished to the trustees of the scheme involved.  The issue has already been discussed in detail with the board.  It has indicated that its policy is that, where at all possible, reports will be available to all relevant parties.  I am in full agreement with this policy.  I am also aware that a case could arise where it would not be appropriate for some reason to furnish such a report to the trustees of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I am reluctant to put such a provision in the legislation at this stage.  However, I acknowledge the intent of the amendment and, while I am opposing its introduction, I intend to keep the matter under review.  If, for example, it transpired that reports were not being made available by the board to the trustees without sufficient good reason, the matter would be revisited.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister of State accepts the thrust of the amendment and my reason for tabling it.  I cannot see any reason for not accepting it. It would oblige the board to send reports to trustees.  I cannot see any reason for withholding a report from the trustees of a scheme if it is to be made available to other parties.  I believe that, in the interests of openness, transparency and accountability, the trustees should be furnished with a copy of any report.  That would assure the trustees.</P>

      <P>As I said earlier, this matter has already been discussed with the Pensions Board.  The advice was that it would not be appropriate to furnish reports in all cases, and that there might be situations where it would be better to make the relevant information available at a later stage.  In the circumstances, it is not proposed, unfortunately, to accept the amendment &mdash; well meaning as it is, as are all such amendments. We have been advised to not accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments made by the Minister to the original Act deal with the privilege and publication of reports.  In light of the experience of the 1990 Principal Act, to what extent have reports been issued by the board?  Has there been much activity in this regard? What has been the experience to date which made it necessary to include those amendments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The general practice of the board is to make reports available as necessary.  That practice has been found, so far, to be sound and there has not been any evidence to suggest problems in that area.  The practice is long established and the board automatically proceeds along those lines, for obvious reasons.  There may be circumstances where it may not be good policy to make available a report at the precise time for reasons that would be obvious only in the knowledge of the circumstances prevailing in respect of a specific case.  Such reports are automatically made available and this has been the successful practice for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Principal Act sets down a procedure for the issuing of a yearly report and that what is envisaged here are separate reports from the overall report of the board.  Is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the experience of the Principal Act, has a reason been found to make this provision necessary, for example, to make reports privileged?  Presumably there is an annual report while this section covers specific reports in individual cases that may or may not be published and ensures that such reports are privileged. Is there provision under the legislation that these reports would be carried in the normal way?  They should be made <Col N="252" /> available to the public by way of public documents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see merit in the amendment with regard to the issuing of reports to trustees.  The word &ldquo;trustee&rdquo; worries me.  I would prefer the word &ldquo;members&rdquo;.  Should not each member or contributor get the report rather than just the trustees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Circumstances may differ. From experience gained from difficulties that arose in other jurisdictions one can see where it may not be advisable to make reports available in all circumstances to everybody who may be involved.  For example, somebody may have an involvement which would leave them in a position where they would have privileged information at an earlier stage than may be necessary.</P>
      <P>There was no reason for introducing measures in this legislation other than to ensure against a repetition of what took place in other jurisdictions.  The essential part of our responsibilities must be to safeguard the rights of those who are covered in respect of a pensions scheme and to ensure that at no time should the assets there be put at risk by virtue of the activities of anybody, whether it be at one level or another.  To so do would be to create problems, as happened in other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>In today's world of modern technology things happen much quicker than they did 20 or 30 years ago when it was possible to undertake an investigation and have it complete virtually before it became public knowledge. That is no longer possible.  For this reason the legislation couched in this section is deemed to be adequate to meet all eventualities.  This is based on the best advice available to us.  In the event of something happening which may require a further change it can and will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure the House that pension schemes will not be used as bargaining tools to resolve other problems in companies?  It appears that <Col N="253" /> even in Packard Electric, an attempt is being made to use pension rights a bargaining mechanism in order to pay off workers rather than through strict redundancy procedures.  This would be a backward step.</P>
      <P>We should try to avoid a situation where pensions may be capitalised as a bargaining mechanism to enable companies to evade their responsibilities in other respects.  This is why I am anxious to ensure that reports would be published so that we may be satisfied that this practice is not one that will escalate.  If this were to be the case we may have to make further amendments to the Bill.  However, at this stage I would be satisfied if the Minister could assure me that this kind of practice will not be tolerated.  I have seen people sacked and their pensions capitalised on and closed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Daly. Pension schemes should never be used as bargaining tools for industrial relations.  The Minister has and can give assurances that this will not happen.</P>

      <P>The position regarding Irish Steel cost the State £690,000 to ensure that there would be proper tie up to sell off the company at a cost of £37 million &mdash; originally it was envisaged that the cost would be £17 million &mdash; and to leave 300 fewer people working there.  Was there intimidation by some people to the effect that they would not allow certain things to happen unless their contributions were brought up to date?  The State had to pay over £600,000 for the protection of 120 staff in Irish Steel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What protection has the ordinary member against the trustees of a scheme?  How are the trustees accountable and to whom?  Is there any provision in the Bill to hold trustees accountable where they have done wrong?  The Minister is right; in other areas the activities of trustees gave rise to difficulties.  For example, in Irish Steel they did not contribute and the State had to pay.  However, only 120 <Col N="254" /> gained from it, not the general work-force. We would not want this to happen in every company we wish to sell off.</P>

      <P>Once they are made available to all involved it is a matter for those concerned; they are no longer secret documents at that stage.  Everybody involved in the management of pensions funds has precise responsibilities. These are further emphasised in the context of this legislation.  The need for such care and protection arises from issues which occurred mostly in other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>It is in the interests of those who make contributions to a pension fund to ensure that, as contributors, their rights are not eroded.  It is also essential that people in a company who are charged with looking after the rights of contributors to a fund have special and particular responsibilities.  There should be no erosion of the assets at any stage without the clear agreement of everybody concerned.</P>
      <P>Members may have experience of dealing with another point on behalf of constituents.  It is not unusual for somebody who, for various reasons, leaves employment mid-term and goes to a different area, to find they have already capitalised or committed their pension entitlements in respect of a business arrangement.  This is not good practice because it may leave them and their dependants entirely reliant on the State at a later stage.  The practice is common, but it is not in the interest of contributors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some pension funds exist on the basis of contributions made by employees, but this is not the case for other funds. Particular care should be taken to ensure that the assets of funds to which contributions are made directly by <Col N="255" /> employees are safeguarded at all times. However, funds to which contributions are not made directly by employees should not be allowed to erode.  These employees have an entitlement as and from the time they become subscribers, although the contributions are made by the employer.  The purpose of the Bill is to enhance existing legislation with regard to difficulties which have arisen in Ireland and other jurisdictions and it is expected to be effective in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the board authorise a person to examine the position of State pensions, such as an Army pension? The Minister is aware from his constituency experience that, in the past, widows of Army personnel complained their husbands opted out of schemes and as a result they were not entitled to pensions when their husbands died.  This caused much anxiety.  Can the board authorise a person to inspect Army records?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. It is not provided for in the legislation because State pensions are a different area.  One presumes the State looks after that area and the contributions related to it.  In the ordinary course of events one would not expect difficulties to arise for contributors in respect of such pensions.</P>
      <P>Each pension scheme has an obligation to disclose all aspects of the operation of the fund on a regular basis by way of an annual report.  A responsibility is placed on the trustees, management and the contributors to have an ongoing interest in what is taking place in relation to their fund and any interventions which could have consequences for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the board have responsibility for any category of State pension scheme?  Can State pensions be included in its remit or is it confined solely to companies and private arrangements?  If so, there is a serious gap in the legislation.  Perhaps this area is covered by other legislation but it is <Col N="256" /> important to clarify this aspect.  The Minister is aware of numerous cases where women discovered on the death of their husbands that they had opted out of pension schemes.  Much concern has been expressed about the fact that people had opted out of pension schemes without telling their families and, following their death, the families found themselves seriously at a loss because they did not have a pension.  I want to ensure this cannot happen in the future.  People should be able to ask the State or the board whether somebody has opted out of a pension scheme which would leave them seriously disadvantaged when that person dies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, responsibility for State schemes does not fall within the ambit of the board. There may be cases where people have mixed contributions, State and otherwise, and they could fall between two stools.</P>
      <P>The Senator's fundamental point is whether a partner could liquidate their pension without full reference to beneficial advice.  Unfortunately, that applies in all pension schemes.  A person may decide to capitalise their pension and utilise the resources for legitimate business purposes.  This is fine provided the venture survives and flourishes. However, if things go wrong and the venture flounders, it could be said that the advice, if given, in the first instance to allow liquidation was wrong.  This can happen even with the best advice in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of cases &mdash; I am sure the Senator also has experience in this regard &mdash; where individuals sought advice on the best action to take in respect of such a venture.  Invariably, I advised against the capitalisation on the basis that the individual concerned may find themselves in need at a later stage. I also advised people not to capitalise in, total to ensure some provision at least was made for them in later life.  I gave such advice on the basis of the number of dependants to ensure they and the State were protected and to give the <Col N="257" /> individual peace of mind.  However, if the individual did not follow the advice, a difficulty may arise.</P>
    <P>It is possible at any time for people to ask a pension fund what the circumstances are likely to be for them in the event of capitalisation and it is the duty and obligation of the fund, State or private, to make that advice available. However, I emphasis that it is not possible to ensure the advice given is taken, and thereby hangs a tale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate if there is any official thinking in relation to bringing State pensions into line with the semi-State area and under the control of the board?  Such a move is desirable in view of people's anxieties about pensions generally in terms of retired teachers, gardaí or Army personnel and their widows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Pensions Act provision was made for compulsory preservation of benefits after a minimum period in the scheme.  Therefore, since 1991 compulsory preservation of benefits applies.  This relates to keeping the scheme intact, which I referred to earlier.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what purpose can be served by bringing State pensions under the same heading, because the State must apply rigidly the rules as they apply to other agencies.  There has not been any situation in Ireland whereby the pension schemes of the Garda, the Army or teachers or any other pension schemes have been eroded or put under threat from any source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> It is possible, however, to make arrangements of the nature referred to by the Senator individually and that may depend on the needs or requirements of the individual at the time. While it might not be good advice for the person to proceed along the lines I have indicated, capitalising their pension entitlements, there will be situations where people choose that option by virtue of the circumstances at that time and if the necessity arises in the future.  It is possible they are right.  Only with the benefit of hindsight will anybody be able to prove them wrong.  It should also be remembered that individual rights will vary.</P>
    <P>Generally, the Senator's suggestion to this legislation is of no benefit to the public sector.  It would have a bearing on the semi-State sector but not on State pension schemes.  If it transpired that the State mismanaged pension funds there would have to be a rethink of the legislation.  I cannot conceive of a situation where the State would misappropriate pension funds any more than it would withhold salaries payments to its employees or whatever the case may be.  If there are such situations, we would like to know about them.  It was not envisaged in the preparation of this legislation that there was a necessity in that area.</P>

The question is where State pensions have been opted out of without the knowledge of the pensioner's spouse and their only discovering it when they claim the pension.  Can the wife of an Army person go to this board and have that question clarified, whether her husband is in the pension scheme or has opted out, so that she will not discover it only when he dies?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  At the risk of repeating myself, this is what I said earlier: there may be instances where one or other of the parties in that situation can withdraw, liquidate, capitalise, etc. their pension entitlements.  There are other ways of dealing with that.  The courts have a right to deal with it, even retrospectively.  The advice normally available to any person wishing to do that is to cater for themselves both currently and hereafter in so far as it can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Senator might be suggesting is that in the event of capitalisation initiated by one party in the State sector, the other party be automatically informed.  There have been some instances where the other party was <Col N="260" /> informed and forgot about it or it became vague over time.</P>
    <P>This legislation deals essentially with private, not State, pension funds.  State pensions are currently being reviewed by the Commission on Public Sector Pensions.</P>

      <P>If the situation should arise where changes are necessary then that is the time to do it.  That is specific to all State pension funds.</P>
      <P>The situation referred to by the Senator and by myself previously would be best handled if it is ensured, in the cases of one or either partners wishing to capitalise or sell their pension entitlements, that both partners are informed of the decision at the time.  Under existing legislation you may find that provision is made for that in some cases and not in others.  For example, the courts may decide, in the event of separation or dissolution of a partnership, to allocate the potential entitlements to one or either party or to both parties equally. That is a matter for the courts and they have done that on several occasions. The problem may not be as serious as it appears.  Advice may be given by the operator of the pension fund, in this case the State, as to what to do in those circumstances; but my advice to those people would always be not to capitalise their pension entitlements.  Either way, it can have a negative impact on their livelihoods and quality of life at a time when they may be most vulnerable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of an oral hearing is to enable an inquiry to be made other than by a strict private inquiry by way of letter.  In this situation the oral hearing will allow the inquirer to make application publicly as, for example, with oral hearings pertaining to the Planning Acts and other regulations. In turn, it will enable a response to be given publicly and not by a direct response privately to the inquirer.  In such circumstances it is also possible for the inquirer to have advice or assistance which would not ordinarily be available through a private inquiry by way of telephone call or letter.</P>

This is permitted by Revenue practice, which also allows the payment of a marriage gratuity to female members who joined the scheme prior to that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preservation provisions of the Pensions Act only apply where a member leaves service; accordingly, in the event of a member leaving the scheme but remaining in service, a full refund of <Col N="263" /> contributions could be made.  This presents the following problems for such schemes.  First, it is a breach of equal treatment legislation and, second, there may be a requirement when the member subsequently leaves service to provide the preserved benefit under the Act to include service for which a refund of contributions has already been made.  This section deals with this anomaly by providing that no refunds can now be made in these situations.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 14, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(14) Forfeiture of a member's pension in respect of employers' claims arising out of criminal, negligent or fraudulent acts shall be provided for.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The problem here is that if an employee was dismissed from a company for criminal or fraudulent activity, the Bill as it stands would leave employers in an anomalous position whereby they would still be paying contributions as if the employee was still retained in employment. The amendment would clarify that position because it leaves employers in a precarious position.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to allow for forfeiture of a member's pension in cases arising out of criminal, negligent or fraudulent acts. Up to now, under the provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990, forfeiture has been totally forbidden.  The provisions contained in the Bill allow for forfeiture only in respect of situations where it would be to the benefit and for the protection <Col N="264" /> of the member that such forfeiture takes place.</P>
      <P>The provisions of section 36 of the Act and this Bill are designed with the interests of the individual members of pension schemes in mind.  The Senator's amendment proposes to introduce forfeiture in instances when it would not benefit the member.  While it may seem reasonable in the first instance in the type of case the Senator mentioned, I would be most concerned that it could be used against individual members where disputes arose with employers.  In certain circumstances it could be open to an unscrupulous employer to use such provisions against the individual member of a pension scheme.  It is my belief that the matters the Senator mentioned can best be dealt with through the courts but that it should not affect the pension of the individual member which the Pensions Act sets out to protect. Accordingly, I wish to oppose the amendment for the reasons already stated.</P>

      <P>This amendment would give protection in the event of a person being laid off for criminal or fraudulent activity.  I understand the Minister is concerned from a member's point of view, but surely we must be concerned for everybody's point of view.  I cannot see why, if there is protection on one side, one cannot have it on the other side.  The amendment is logical because it would protect employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of protecting the employer does not really arise because we are discussing the protection of the contributor or member, who in this case is the employee.  The forfeiture of entitlements because of a criminal act, which might or might not be associated with that employment, would militate first of all against the individual in a way which perhaps had nothing to do with the criminal act.  More especially, however, it would militate against that person's dependants and that, in turn, might militate against the State if it had to take the responsibility of catering for <Col N="265" /> those dependants.  That could be quite costly in some circumstances where the State had no responsibility in the matter and where responsibility lay solely with the individual who was erring.  If that error was committed fraudulently the courts will look after it.  It is a matter for the courts to appropriate the necessary retribution but it would not be either desirable or necessary for the State to introduce a system whereby the forfeiture of that person's entitlements, and those of their dependants, would be the penalty applied by the employer or by the State.  The amendment has the opposite effect to that which the Senator is seeking.</P>

      <P>They could.  I dealt with a case like this recently.  Where a manager of a pension fund or scheme is guilty of defrauding a company or fund, the company can seek retribution.  The individual can also seek a decision in the courts in those circumstances.  All such decisions would be subject to the approval of the courts.  The individual has the right to appeal to the courts. There have been circumstances in the private sector where an individual had a particular arrangement or had made contributions to the pension fund over a period of time.  On the death of that individual, the company might review the situation in a way which militated against the dependants.  In those circumstances <Col N="266" /> there must always be recourse to the courts to ensure what is done at that stage is not done in an arbitrary or vindictive fashion.  It is possible that a person guilty of perpetrating fraud in the semi-State sector would be liable to have their entitlements looked at by the company.</P>

I am interested in the preservation of the pension rights of the person who is in employment.  Where there are accusations made against the person, are the company entitled to seize their pension and entitlements even before there are any court convictions?

      <P>&ldquo;15.&mdash;(1) It shall be prohibited to deduct State pensions from private scheme benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where it is the case that pensions (other than State pensions) accrue over a 30 year period, the annual accrual rate shall be increased by a factor of 40/30, that <Col N="268" /> is, from 1.66 per cent. to 2.2 per cent., to reflect current labour market conditions.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In some cases promoters of occupational pensions deduct the social welfare pension from the benefits accruing. A person's typical work life is no longer a 40 year period.  The formula used for pensions is 40/60ths.  I propose this amendment to bring it down to a more appropriate factor of 45, rather than 60. This would be beneficial in terms of the changes in the typical working life of a person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment prohibits deducting State pensions from the private scheme benefits and changes the annual rate of accrual where pensions accrue over a 30 year rather than a 40 year period.  As outlined in the final report of the National Pensions Board, it is now a common feature of most defined benefit schemes that they are co-ordinated with the social welfare pension.  This type of co-ordination is aimed at giving the member two thirds of the final salary, based on a combination of social welfare pension, topped up by an occupational pension.  The amendment proposed by Senator Kelleher would be a radical one.  Occupational pension schemes are voluntary arrangements and employers do not have to introduce or implement such schemes.  The main result of such a proposal would be a change in the rules of each individual scheme, reducing occupational pension entitlement so the situation would remain unchanged.  A major survey of occupational pensions undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare and the Pensions Board, which will be available at the end of this year, will be significant in considering the development of pension systems and informing us of the present level of cover and current issues arising.  In the accrual amendment put down by the Senator, I am informed there is nothing to prevent such a rate of accrual currently applying.  It would <Col N="269" /> be a matter for the rules of each individual pension scheme.  We do not legislate for benefits in individual schemes, which would be the effect of the Senator's proposal. As far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned, once there is ten years service, there is nothing in their rules or practice to prevent a person from qualifying for a full pension, subject to the rules of the individual scheme to which they belong.  I oppose the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a point regarding the last paragraph of section 18, which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) In this section &lsquo;employer&rsquo; means the employer who undertakes the role of principal employer for the purposes of such scheme's approval by the Revenue Commissioners under Chapter 11 of Part 1 of the Finance Act, 1972.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>While the Pensions Board is making strong recommendations regarding the protection of trustees and members, there seems to be no policy or incentive provided for employees outside the self-employed, companies, management, staff or semi-State sectors or the Civil Service.  The general employees who comprise the vast majority of the PAYE sector do not have any avenues open to them to seek pensions elsewhere.  The Pensions Board is not selling anything to ordinary people who want to be well protected in their old age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kelleher stated that people may change jobs at least three or four <Col N="270" /> times during their careers and will no longer be in employment for 40 to 45 years.  Everyone recognises that reality. My point in this regard is relevant to the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and the Finance Acts. Is the board recommending that opportunities be provided to PAYE sector employees, as they are to their counterparts in the area of self-employment, to avail of paying an extra 15 per cent of contributions per year?  A self-employed person can avail of this provision and obtain tax relief of 48 per cent for doing so.  What options are open to ordinary people to do this?  Are avenues of opportunity being created?</P>
    <P>The Departments of Social Welfare and Finance and the Revenue Commissioners co-operate closely on provision of tax relief and tax benefits. People are now taxed on social welfare payments, and rightly so.  There is no reason that such payments should not be taxed.  However, we should also avail of the avenues of opportunity which exist in this area.  We are facing a situation where, in ten to 15 years, an enormous amount of money will be paid through State pension schemes.  Will we be able to carry that burden?  Why is the Pensions Board not promoting the idea that people should be allowed to seek alternative pension schemes?  Why are people not being given the opportunity to obtain 48 per cent tax relief on by paying contributions to a private pension fund?  Why are they not being given an opportunity to make extra contributions to the State pension scheme and receive tax relief as a result?</P>
    <P>I recognise that this is a radical suggestion.  However, the State is receiving extra money from young people who should be given tax relief in return.  At present, a self-employed person earning £30,000 to £40,000 can given a contribution of 15 per cent extra in one year and give a further 15 per cent the following year.  They can then obtain 48 per cent tax relief on the entire amount. An ordinary PAYE sector worker cannot do this.  I may be finding it hard to <Col N="271" /> sell my point, but people must be given tax benefits if they are to pay extra contributions on their pensions.  Under the new Finance Act, such benefits are given to people over 55 years of age. However, this again applies to the self-employed sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and the Minister for Social Welfare are responsible for ensuring that the Pensions Board promotes this idea.  I am not stating that the board is doing its job incorrectly. However, it should allow people in the PAYE sector to pay extra contributions and obtain tax relief.  It has not yet done so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cregan made a very important point.  The Pensions Board should be in a position to broaden its scope to sell more favourable pension schemes to PAYE employees.  Senator Cregan also stated that PAYE workers are not entitled to the same benefits as self-employed people in relation to pensions.  He made an excellent point about PAYE employees not being entitled to pay an extra 15 per cent of contributions which can be rolled over from year to year. The Minister of State should consider this avenue closely.  PAYE sector employees should be entitled to the same benefits as self-employed people. In many Irish families, husbands and wives are obliged to work to make ends meet.  These people pay a similar rate of tax as the self-employed who can avail of the opportunity to invest further money in other pension schemes. PAYE sector employees cannot do so.</P>

      <P>The Senators' points will be covered by the survey being conducted by the board in respect of pensions. There are also ongoing discussions between the Minister for Finance and the pensions industry at present which will deal with issues of that nature that have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will have experience of situations where inadequacies emerged in the pension system.  When a person <Col N="272" /> approaches me with a query in respect of a particular pension fund, I consider the matter myself and refer them to a specialist in life and pension schemes.  In those circumstances the person best placed to give advice is someone who takes full account of investment potential for the future.  They give advice based on a series of possibilities rather than simply giving it on the basis that it may be beneficial at a particular time.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan's statement about employees is correct.  It is obviously in the interest of employees to be able to avail of the best possible advice at a particular juncture.  It was suggested that the Pensions Board should perhaps become involved in that area.  That may transpire in the future, but at this stage the board has a presiding responsibility or role whereby it does not become involved in the daily operation of pension schemes.  It has an overriding responsibility to ensure that schemes remain within certain general criteria.  If it is seen as being necessary to improve, enhance or extend the board's role in the way that was suggested, I am sure this will be covered by the survey currently underway.</P>
    <P>There will also be circumstances where disputes may arise between consultants who specialise in particular areas.  In such cases an absolute decision cannot be arrived at&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's comments, he is well informed with regard to events taking place.  I appreciate that he answers questions <Col N="273" /> without consulting prepared briefs.  On Sunday last, <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> informed its readers with regard to a particular committee's actions from a social welfare point of view.  During our deliberations on the Social Welfare Bill, I asked whether PAYE and PRSI systems should be amalgamated.  The Department stated that this would never be considered under any circumstances because the pension schemes of the PAYE sector would not be protected. Yet, to my surprise, I read in the last issue of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> that the committee set up by the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, is considering the issue and is split about whether PRSI is needed.</P>
      <P>Civil servants and those in the State sector argue they would not have enough protection because their PRSI contributions are different from those made by private sector workers.  The Minister of State said it was the board, but the Minister for Finance is now speaking to pension representatives about the best way to protect the State &mdash; it must give everyone a pension but there are now more older people so we need to diversify.  I welcome that &mdash; what is wrong with diversifying? However, the Pensions Board, the Minister and the Department must also ensure that benefits are given to people who are prepared to contribute.</P>
      <P>At present not everyone is receiving the same benefits.  If a person earning £15,000 a year &mdash; only £300 a week &mdash; contributes to his pension he should receive 48 per cent tax relief and full contributions at whatever age he wishes to finalise the scheme.  However, PAYE workers do not get that, but the self-employed do.  I do not say that the self-employed should not get that, because not everyone should be carried by the State pension structure, but the avenue should be open to others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that at long last we are prepared to consider whether it is necessary that people should pay both PRSI and PAYE.  We should not forget that a person who pays PAYE and PRSI is taxed twice before he makes any contribution. <Col N="274" /> That is not the case in the self-employed sector &mdash; tax relief is provided when contributing to a pension.  The PAYE sector, which contributes to the State pension, is suffering twice and that is not fair.  We should not be afraid to diversify.  The Pensions Board, when in discussion with the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Welfare, must look at ways to give every possible opportunity to the PAYE sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Senator's dissertation on pensions generally and the possibility of advice to the PAYE worker as against the self-employed, we had this discussion here before and the PAYE/PRSI issue is not related to it.  All I will say is that, whether the deductions are for PAYE, PRSI or something else, they are still deductions and the net amount involved will have to be the amount required before, during or after any changes <Col N="275" /> which may or may not take place.  It is true that tax concessions, albeit of a limited nature, are available in respect of pension contributions; but tax applies in respect of the pension when payable. This is not an open-ended measure, although it was once.  It is no longer possible to receive a tax concession for contributions to a pension fund and receive payment for the pension regardless of income tax.</P>
      <P>I agree with the comments on the PAYE sector but I refer to what I said earlier.  The only way one can decide how best to utilise one's contributions to a private pension fund is to have regard to expert advice.  Since the introduction of modern telecommunications, the number of such agencies has mushroomed to the extent that advice is available in every town and village and almost at every street corner.  The advice may be good or not so good.  I suggest, given that the individual concerned is making contributions to a pension fund, that it is in his best interest to cross-check the possible alternatives so that his entitlements will be protected and he will get the maximum benefits available from a particular scheme.</P>
      <P>Having said that, with the best will in the world there will be cases where individuals will either not avail of the best advice or may make a decision which is not primarily in their interest.  There is little one can do in those circumstances but the guidelines laid down by the Pensions Board should direct people and, one hopes, protect their interests.  I think it will be found generally that the concerns expressed by the Senator are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, I refer again to the review and the discussions between the Minister for Finance and the pension schemes.  A multiplicity of such schemes are available, not just a small number, and the benefits vary depending on the degree of contribution &mdash; in some cases the employee makes no contribution.  Schemes to which the employee makes little or no contribution are often as beneficial as those <Col N="276" /> where substantial deductions are made. In those circumstances it is a matter for the employee to examine carefully, through whatever agencies exist in his company to pursue such matters, the degree to which the subscriber invests in the fund and to which he benefits from the investment.  He will thereby put himself in a position to decide which is the better value from his point of view.</P>

Trustees are such an important part of the pension scheme system that it is imperative that time be made available to them to attend training and educational sessions.  We put much emphasis on the integrity and ability of trustees and this amendment is designed to encourage employers to give them more time to attend training sessions.  It will be of benefit to the employers and the trustees.</P>

      <P>This amendment provides that time off for an employee during working hours for the purposes of attending appropriate training should be provided for on a statutory basis.  I support the idea of trustees being given time off for training.  Most employers realise it is in their best interests to have trustees trained properly and would accordingly make whatever provisions are necessary, including paid time off, to ensure this happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am advised there is no particular problem at present in this <Col N="277" /> regard and I do not see the need to put the arrangement on a statutory footing. It would be in the interests of all concerned if people were to make such arrangements.  I intend to keep the matter under review and changes will be introduced if they are considered necessary. I note the Senator's points.  This matter will be acted upon if it is found that action is necessary.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of employers and employees to ensure the best operational standards are applied.  If training is necessary provision should be made to enable that training to take place.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>There have been problems in this country with trustees. Senator Kelleher recommends that trustees should be allowed leave the work-place for training but I would see the matter differently.  The Pensions Board should recommend a training structure relevant to all trustees who should have to participate in the schemes.</P>
      <P>Situations may arise where particular employees would avail of the opportunity afforded by their being trade union or pension scheme representatives to absent themselves from the workplace.  If there is a demand for training we should be concerned about the type of training they receive.  Who recommends that a person is sent for training?  Is it the board or the pensions funds?  Who tells the trustees how the structures work?</P>

      <P>The board can and does provide the training.  It has a presiding responsibility and it certifies particular courses for training and it is for the management of the schemes to make the relevant personnel available for such courses.  The training prescribed by the board is made available by the board to a specific audience which wishes to avail of it.  It is in its interest to avail of the most up to date techniques in running pension funds.  The board has that responsibility and is carrying it out.</P>

      <P>Not at present.

That is under consideration and the survey referred to earlier will encompass it. The need for those operating a scheme may more readily be seen by those outside the scheme.  The outside view would be more informed.  In such circumstances, provision may be made along the lines I have suggested.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's reply.  Given our concern for pension schemes and that we have set up the Pensions Board, under no circumstances must we allow the board to be undermined and if it cannot make such demands, the board could be undermined.  It may claim it does not have enough authority if its recommendations are not accepted.  The trustees of schemes should be answerable to the Pensions Board for their level of expertise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employers may have a preference for certain employees and certain employees may be able to intimidate <Col N="279" /> others.  If the Pensions Board demands and ensures that people are properly informed about schemes, the members will feel much happier because they have the protection of the Pensions Board.  That is very important and I welcome what the Minister has said.  I would not have any hesitation in saying that demands rather than recommendations should go out from the board.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 19, before section 29, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;29.&mdash;Having regard to the <i>Barber</i> decision in the European Court, the ownership of all existing and future fund assets and surpluses shall be defined as belonging solely to the members of the scheme and such surpluses shall be apportioned between the members by increasing their benefits, subject to revenue limits and any balance shall be treated as a contribution holiday over a defined maximum period of 5 years.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The momentous decision in the Barber case in 1990 means that the funds are always in the ownership of the workers. The pensions are looked on as deferred payment.  Regardless of whether the worker or the employer pays into the fund, it is exclusively the property of the employees.  This amendment seeks to include that in the Bill, otherwise we could have difficulties in the future arising out of the decision of the European Court.  The amendment is essential for the purpose of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken considerable advice on this issue from a number <Col N="280" /> of parties, including the Pensions Board. The one issue that emerged very clearly from these discussions is that one has to be very clear about the definition and nature of a surplus and exactly how it can arise.  One needs to understand the nature of funding in a defined benefit pension scheme to understand how excess assets build up in a scheme year.</P>
      <P>Once moneys or other assets have been transferred into a trust fund they cannot be transferred except in so far as authorised by the trust deed or by law or unless all the beneficiaries agree or the trust is wound up.  There is a fundamental distinction between an ongoing fund and a fund in winding up.  As long as the fund is ongoing no beneficiary has any interest in particular assets. These are vested solely in the trustees and cannot be withdrawn either by the employer or the members unless authorised.</P>
      <P>In an ongoing fund the surplus is the amount by which the actuarially estimated value of the scheme assets at a given time exceeds the actuarially estimated value of its liabilities.  Valuation on an ongoing basis involves a number of long-term projections and assumptions. The actuary compares the present value of an estimated stream of future income with the present value of an estimated stream of future liabilities.  On this basis a surplus exists at any time when the present value of the future income exceeds the present value of the future liabilities.  It is as clear as that.</P>
      <P>In calculating these values the actuary has to apply a wide range of actuarial assumptions.  These include financial assumptions as to earnings increases, price increases and investment returns and demographic assumptions as to mortality rates, rates of entry into and withdrawal from pensionable service and rates of early retirement in good health and in ill health.  Since these are long-term assumptions it is highly unlikely that they will exactly match assets to liabilities at any particular point in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It follows that a surplus cannot be accurately identified by evaluation on <Col N="281" /> an ongoing basis for reasons of prudence. Given the uncertainties involved, actuaries tend to be conservative in their assumptions and this can be one of the factors which leads to over funding on an ongoing basis.  What may be shown as a surplus using one actuarial method or set of assumptions may appear as a deficit if a different method or set of assumptions is used.  Moreover, since the value of a surplus or deficit is normally small in relation to the value of the assets and liabilities, it can require only a modest variation in the assumption to make a substantial difference to the asset or liability equation.</P>
    <P>It follows therefore that from a legal viewpoint any surplus in any ongoing fund is purely notional.  The existence of a surplus cannot be finally determined except at the point when the scheme is wound up and the rights of the beneficiaries crystallised.  Unless otherwise provided by the scheme rules or authorised by all the beneficiaries, a trust fund must be kept intact for the purpose of the scheme until it is wound up.  The employer cannot withdraw assets from the fund.  The scheme member becomes entitled to a benefit only on retirement or after fulfilling other conditions laid down by the scheme documents.  In the context of an ongoing fund, ownership of the surplus does not arise in legal terms.  There is much more.</P>

      <P>It is easy to make a complaint if one does not have to put pen to paper.  If the complaint must be in writing, people will not make frivolous complaints. They will have to sit down and put it in writing.  The Minister should take this on board.  It was raised in the other House as well.  It is easy to make a complaint orally, but if it is put down in writing there is proof that it has been made and it also takes an extra bit of effort.  It could eliminate frivolous complaints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to limit the protection for people making reports to those who make such reports in writing.  Making reports by means other than in writing relates to voluntary reporting only.  If a person makes a telephone call or comes to the Pensions Board office to make a voluntary report and this report is made in good faith &mdash; the section specifies that it must be made in good faith &mdash; I see no reason why protection should not extend to that person.  The amendment seeks to limit the protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this reporting mechanism is to protect the pensions of individual members of pension schemes and encourage the making of voluntary reports where pensions could be in jeopardy. I therefore do not wish to limit it to reports in writing.  Any person making a malicious report, whether in writing or verbally, will not be afforded any protection.

      <P>This amendment seeks to provide that the board must publish guidelines and a methodology of employment in relation to what constitutes <Col N="284" /> an inappropriate investment for a specific pension scheme.  These provisions deal with applications to the High Court and it would be my hope and expectation that they would be used only in extreme cases and, hopefully, they may never be used at all.</P>
      <P>It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to set out in advance what precisely would constitute an inappropriate investment except in very obvious circumstances.  However, in most cases it may not be possible to be absolutely precise.  The trustee handbook, which will be published in the near future by the Pensions Board, will deal with the proper investment by trustees and should therefore be helpful in relation to the suggestion being made by the Senator in this amendment.</P>
      <P>This provision simply gives the board the right to seek a High Court order in relation to an investment.  Before the court grants such an order, it must be satisfied that the investment concerned is inappropriate and is likely to jeopardise the rights and interests of the members of the scheme.

As the Senator is aware, the Bill already provides for two new board members who will be trustees of an occupational pension scheme, which could, of course, include a pensioner trustee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have considered this amendment in depth since it was first proposed on Committee Stage in the Dáil and I still hold the view I expressed then.  The board has no specific function in relation to investment policy except for the limits imposed in the funding standard, the level of self-investment and <Col N="286" /> the concentration of investment that can be counted for purposes of funding standard and this is an actuarial issue. Investment policy itself is a matter for the trustees of schemes.  I realise, however, that there is a major issue of trustees training in this regard and this is being addressed by the Pensions Board in its trustee handbook, which will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>I have considered the proposal for a representative of the investment management industry in detail and have taken account of the representations made by the Irish Association of Investment Managers and the Irish Institute of Pension Managers.  I consider that the current make up of the board covers a reasonable spectrum of the pensions industry and that a new representative in this regard is not required.  I note, for example, that the Irish Association of Pension Funds, which has a representative on the board, published guidelines recently on investment management agreements for pension funds.</P>

Publicising the necessity for adequate pension provision for the future is one of the things that needs to be done.

      <P>The implementation of the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1996, is intended to amend section 76 of the Health Act, 1970 &mdash; which deals with the amendment by order of a hospital charter &mdash; and to amend the Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> The primary reason for bringing forward this Bill at this time is to facilitate the Minister for Health in meeting the wishes of the three voluntary hospitals, that is the Adelaide, the Meath and the National Children's Hospital, which are combining to form the new hospital at Tallaght.  The hospitals have agreed that the legal basis for the governance of the hospital at Tallaght will be an amended charter of the Adelaide Hospital in accordance with the draft of the order which the Minister has now laid before the Seanad and the Dáil.  The governing body of the Adelaide Hospital, in accordance with section 76 of the Health Act, 1970, has made an application to the Minister for an amendment to its charter.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has agreed to amend the Adelaide Charter, as proposed by the Adelaide, in agreement with the Meath and the National Children's Hospital.  The Office of the Attorney General has been consulted and an order has been drafted by the parliamentary draftsman's office pursuant to section 76 of the Health Act, 1970, amending the Adelaide Charter to give effect to the wishes of the hospitals. The Minister has also consulted with the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Attorney General has advised that certain amendments of a technical legal nature require to be made to section 76 of the Health Act, 1970, and to the Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961, to allow the processing of the order amending the Adelaide Hospital Charter in a manner which meets the needs of the three hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961, created a federation of seven hospitals, including the Adelaide, the Meath and National Children's Hospitals, and transferred certain powers and functions of the federated hospitals to the Central Council of the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals. The Bill ensures that the provisions of <Col N="290" /> the 1961 Act will not impinge in any way on the functioning of the new hospital.</P>
    <P>The new hospital at Tallaght is the largest hospital project ever commissioned in the history of the State and the people of Tallaght will have a hospital that will match the best in the world in terms of its design, quality and its state of the art technology.  I have no doubt that this hospital will make an invaluable contribution to the economic infrastructure of Tallaght as well as to its more specific health and hospital services needs.</P>
    <P>The provision of the legal framework for the new hospital at Tallaght has been complex and subject to protracted negotiations between all those concerned. It is, indeed, a credit to the commitment of the transferring hospitals that they have been able to agree, in conjunction with the Minister for Health, on the legal framework now being placed before this House.  You will note that the draft of the order contains provisions for the management of the three hospitals by a single authority prior to the move to Tallaght.  This is important in an organisational and logistical development of such magnitude.</P>
    <P>In 1993, the board structure and other issues relating to the new hospital were agreed by the three hospital boards and approved by the Government.  This represented a considerable amount of hard work by the three hospitals, but in the end a resolution was reached.  That agreement is the basis on which the legal framework is now being proposed so as to finalise these matters.  This detailed legal framework has also been agreed by the boards of the three hospitals who are integrating to provide the services so badly needed at Tallaght. I am happy to say these developments clearly indicate that, where goodwill exists on all sides, seemingly insurmountable problems can be overcome. In this regard, I welcome the joint statement made by the chairmen of the three hospitals which I understand has been issued to each member of this House <Col N="291" /> and which fully endorses the legislative proposals now being put forward.</P>
    <P>The people of Tallaght deserve a major hospital of the quality being provided, and it is important that we continue to proceed as quickly as possible to ensure the detailed arrangements for the management and transfer of the hospitals to Tallaght, and the establishment of services in the new premises in the middle of next year, will proceed without any delay or setbacks.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank the boards of the hospitals, and also the medical, nursing and other staff, for the excellent work they have performed over a very long time in treating many thousands of public and private patients. I am confident that this great work, together with the acute psychiatric services transferring from St. Loman's Hospital, will continue at Tallaght.  I have no doubt that the facilities at the new hospital will allow for an even greater enhancement of these services.</P>
    <P>This is a unique occasion where this House is facilitating the joining together of three historic institutions which for many years with their diverse backgrounds and history have provided health services to the people of Dublin and the country at large.  I feel privileged to be part of this process which I have no doubt will be seen by future historians as a most enlightened and progressive development of our hospital services.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill are quite straightforward.  Section 2 enhances the powers of the Minister for Health under section 76 of the Health Act, 1970.  Section 76 of the Health Act, 1970, empowers the Minister for Health, by order, to amend the charter of a hospital subject to the order in draft form being approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas following consultation with the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests.  Section 2 of the Bill expands the Minister's powers under section 76 of the Health Act, 1970, as the present section does not allow for facilitating the legal arrangements <Col N="292" /> now requested by the three hospitals, that is, it does not provide for the establishment of a new body corporate and the assignment of a title to it. Section 2 (1) (a) provides for this.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) (b) provides for the application of a charter which is being amended to the new body corporate established under section 2 (1) (a).  This allows for the Adelaide Hospital Charter as amended to be applied to the new body corporate.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) (a) provides for the transfer to the new body corporate of the functions, property, rights, liabilities and members of staff of the transferring agencies.  This provision will allow for the integration of the three base hospitals, of the Tallaght Hospital Board established to construct the hospital and of the Central Council of Federated Dublin Hospitals.  Section 2 (2) (b) allows for the conferral of such powers on the original body &mdash; in this case the Adelaide Hospital &mdash; as, in the opinion of the Minister, are necessary to enable it to wind up its affairs or otherwise to deal with any property, rights or liabilities of it.  This is to ensure that on the disapplication of the charter to the original Adelaide Hospital that hospital will still have powers to take care of its residual affairs.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (3) (a) allows the Minister on the application of the new body corporate &mdash; in this case the new Tallaght Hospital &mdash; established by an order under section 76 of the Health Act, 1970, to amend that order of the body corporate.  Section 2 (4) facilitates the circumstances of this particular case by allowing for the simultaneous movement of this Bill and of the draft order establishing the new hospital through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 3 provides that notwithstanding the provision of the Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961, in particular the provision of section 14 of that Act, the new hospital will be able to exercise all functions which are exercised by the Central Council of Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals in respect of the three base hospitals.  This provision is <Col N="293" /> required to ensure that the new hospital will be able to exercise those functions.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the draft order is to comply with the wishes of the three hospitals in providing for the governance of a major acute voluntary hospital at Tallaght.  The explanatory memorandum, circulated with the draft order, explains the various amendments.  Now that agreement has been reached on the details of the revised charter, it is urgent to provide the necessary legislative measures to give effect to the agreement. It is important to allow the hospitals to put a unified management structure in place for the three transferring hospitals and to do this as soon as possible, well in advance of the move to the new premises at Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the House will welcome the provisions contained in the draft of the order.  I do not propose to refer to each section of the order, but I would like to highlight some of the provisions which might be regarded as exceptional to the normal provisions needed to govern a major acute hospital.  These provisions have been incorporated in the draft order to reflect the agreement entered into between the hospitals.  These include section 5(c), which provides that the hospital will ensure the availability of all medical and surgical procedures which may lawfully be provided without prejudice to the rights of conscience of staff.  The order also provides at section 5(j) that the fundamental principle of the Adelaide Hospital as an essentially religious and Protestant institution will be maintained, while guaranteeing rights of conscience and providing that the hospital will have a multi-denominational and pluralist character.</P>
    <P>Also of note is section 24, which establishes a college of nursing at the new hospital but provides that for student nurse entry purposes the Meath, Adelaide and National Children's Hospital will have separate constituent schools of nursing.  Each of the schools of nursing will be autonomous for student nurse intake purposes and may take up to 40 entrants in the case of the <Col N="294" /> Adelaide, 60 in the case of the Meath and 21 in the case of the National Children's Hospital.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased with the terms of the order which provide for the composition of the board of the hospital and which allow for the appropriate representation from each of the base hospitals and the medical staff of the hospital.  The draft order also contains provision for industrial relations matters surrounding the transfer of services and staff to Tallaght to be addressed through a Protocol which has been agreed to by the Department of Health and the management and unions representing staff in the transferring agencies comprehended by the draft order. This is to ensure that best industrial relations and personnel practices are adhered to.</P>
    <P>In preparing the draft order the Minister and the Department of Health were conscious that the hospitals transferring to Tallaght were three different institutions, each having its own background and ethos.  It is important that each of the three hospitals is enabled to enter into an arrangement where they feel that their interests and their honourable traditions are repeated and acknowledged. I am happy that the draft order now before the House meets this difficult criterion for the integration of the hospitals.</P>
    <P>I consider this Bill, while it is essentially of a technical legal nature, to be most important legislation.  It is a necessary statutory measure to facilitate, where appropriate, the reorganisation and extension of the public hospital services. The immediate effect of the Bill will allow for the proper establishment of the much needed and fine hospital at Tallaght.  I commend the Bill to the House and I ask the Seanad to approve the motion in respect of the draft of the order which has been laid before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the order and the legislation and I recognise, as the Minister has done, that it brings an end to a difficult period of negotiations.  It <Col N="295" /> is important legislation not only for the three institutions involved but also for the life of the nation.  There is a lesson to be learned from the negotiations and the compromises that were reached in bringing us to this point today.</P>
      <P>The measures aim to bring together three historic institutions &mdash; the Meath, the Adelaide and the National Children's Hospital.  Each of these institutions has made a unique contribution to the life of the city and the nation.  It is, therefore, appropriate on such an occasion to briefly mention the history of these institutions.  I was privileged to be a member of the board of the Meath Hospital for some years, so I ask to be forgiven if I am a little parochial and if I recognise the unique contribution made by that hospital.  The Meath Hospital is an institution which has contributed in a unique way to the colourful history of this city.  I want to celebrate the lives of the men and women who contributed to the hospital, the city and to the development of medical life in this country.</P>
      <P>The turbulent and interesting history of the Meath Hospital goes back to the end of the 17th century.  At that time the Earl of Meath's liberty, the Coombe area of Dublin, was a prosperous community engaged in the wool trade.  That prosperity came to a juddering halt when William III banned the export of Irish woollens in order to assist the English weavers.  As a result, the Liberties, which had once been a prosperous area in the city, was plunged into poverty. In March 1753 the surgeons from the Charitable Surgery of Spring Gardens in Dame Street published an advertisement in the newspaper announcing their concern for the poor of the Meath Liberties and their intention to take a house in the upper Coombe for the treatment of these people.  Subscriptions were requested.  That is an interesting connection with the current state of the finances of health institutions in this country.  The nation has always contributed to charities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> The Meath Hospital moved from house to house until 1770 when the foundation stone for a custom built hospital in the Coombe was laid by Lord Brabazon, a man whose family retains connections with Bray.  Proving that nothing is new under the sun.  the new hospital was supported not by State funds but by funds from a lottery with a prize of £1,000, a considerable amount of money in those days, and a bequest. The new building was completed in March 1773.  For 50 years the hospital served the people of the area from its new headquarters in the Coombe.  After 50 years, however, the hospital building became inadequate for its needs and it had to look for another new home.  The Meath Hospital has a fine tradition of moving around the city.</P>
    <P>It chose a very interesting site off Heytesbury Street which was known as &ldquo;The Dean's Vineyard&rdquo;.  The land had originally been leased by Dean Swift shortly after he took over the deanship. It was not used as a vineyard but to stable his horses.  The land was transferred to the Meath Hospital by order in 1815.  Plans were put in hand immediately to build the new hospital but they ran into the inevitable difficulties with the Department of Finance of the day, when the Treasury announced it would not be capable of providing the funds for the new hospital.  A charitable donation was made by Thomas Pleasants, whose generosity is remembered to this day by the street named after him beside the hospital.  A grant of £6,000 was also received from the County of Dublin.  The building of the hospital commenced in 1815 and was completed in 1822.  On Christmas Eve 1822 the patients were moved from the Coombe to the Meath Hospital and were welcomed by the staff to their new home.</P>
    <P>Throughout the 19th century, and into this century, the Meath Hospital has been synonymous with medical innovation in this city.  Robert James Graves and William Stokes were two of the hospital's earliest physicians who distinguished themselves internationally. Graves was born in 1797 and was a <Col N="297" /> graduate of Trinity College, Dublin.  He took up his appointment in the Meath Hospital in 1821.  He developed a new system of clinical teaching there which is followed to this day in Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States. William Stokes, who was a student of Graves and was educated in the Meath Hospital, at the very early age of 21 years wrote the first major English language treatise on the use of the stethoscope. Stokes worked with Graves throughout his medical life and developed medical teaching in the Meath Hospital.  He later produced a major thesis on the diseases of the chest, heart and aorta.</P>
    <P>Richard Lane Joynt was a surgeon in the Meath Hospital who learned in 1896 of Rontgen's discovery of X-rays and felt this would be a useful thing to have in Ireland.  He built the first X-ray apparatus himself.  In 1897, only a year after the discovery of the X-ray, he produced the first Irish X-ray pictures, which are on view in the Royal College of Surgeons.</P>
    <P>There were also developments in the Meath Hospital in this century.  Money from the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes made it possible to develop a urological unit there.  This speciality will always be associated with a surgeon called TDJ Lane who, having returned from the United States, developed it in the Meath Hospital to the point where the hospital's unit in Heytesbury Street became one of the foremost urological units in the world.</P>
    <P>The Meath Hospital's history is not solely concerned with medicine.  It also has extraordinary and intriguing connections with Ireland's literary heritage. James Clarence Mangan died there.  He died in destitution and was rescued by his friend Stokes and taken to the Meath Hospital where he was cared for in his final days.  When Mangan died his face took on a wonderful new look and an extraordinary light shone from it. Stokes contacted the artist Sir Frederick Burton who made a drawing of Mangan which hangs in the National Gallery, a <Col N="298" /> copy of which hangs in the board room of the Meath Hospital.</P>
    <P>Oliver St. John Gogarty was a surgeon in the Meath Hospital from 1911 until 1939.  On his rounds in the hospital he was inspired to write the beautiful poem &ldquo;I have seen all the pictures&rdquo;, which celebrates the death of a simple Dubliner who was content to meet his maker having seen all that the Dublin cinemas of the day had to offer.  Patrick Kavanagh and Brendan Behan were also in and out of the Meath Hospital over a period of years.  Behan died there, having established a unique rapport with the nursing and medical staff.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is odd when dealing with dry legislation to dwell so much on history. I do so, however, to make the point that we are not just dealing with bricks and mortar when we talk about these three fine hospitals, but with living and breathing human organisations with proud traditions and with people who jealously guard those traditions.  The tradition in all three hospitals is rightly guarded by their medical, nursing and administrative staff.  Perhaps because of this the discussions on the amalgamation of the MANCH group have not always been easy.  There has been a good deal of fire and exchange of strong words.</P>
    <P>When one looks at charters, which were touched on by the Minister, one finds the original draft starts &ldquo;George V, by the grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the seas, King defender of the faith to all to whom these presents shall come, greetings&rdquo;.  It is rather strange in this day and age for us in a republican Parliament to be effectively endorsing such a charter.</P>
    <P>The reality is that goodwill, as the Minister said, has prevailed throughout these negotiations.  I am being partisan in this, but I think extraordinary goodwill was particularly shown by the nursing and administrative staff and the board of the Meath Hospital.  I recognise the fact that Councillor Brady, the chairman of the Meath Hospital, is here <Col N="299" /> today.  Good sense prevailed throughout those negotiations, out of which came compromise, which I welcome.  I particularly welcome the fact that the tradition of all three hospitals has, as far as is humanly possible, been protected in the legislative arrangements.</P>
    <P>I am particularly glad that the concerns of those associated with the Adelaide Hospital have been defended. I remember having discussions in 1992 with people who were concerned about the ethos of the Adelaide Hospital and who wondered how the various circles could be squared.  I think, as far as is humanly possible, goodwill has provided the answer to those very knotty problems.  I am delighted the nursing ethos of the Adelaide Hospital will be recognised.  I hope there will be generous recognition of what has been done in the formation of the board of the new hospital, which might spark a recognition among our friends, brothers and sisters in the Northern part of this country that compromise is often better than conflict.  I welcome the legislation and we will assist the Minister in every way to press the measure through today.</P>

      <P>The immediate object of the Bill is to facilitate the provision of a statutory basis for the establishment of the governing body of the new Tallaght hospital.  The three hospitals consigned to Tallaght &mdash; the Adelaide, the Meath and the National Children's Hospital &mdash; reached agreement some time ago that the most appropriate legal vehicle for providing for the new hospital is by way of an amendment to the original charter of the Adelaide Hospital.  In order to do this in a way which meets the express needs of the hospitals, it is necessary to amend section 76 of the Health Act, 1970, and the Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961.  The Bill enables the Minister to amend the hospital's charter and provides that the <Col N="300" /> Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961, will not impinge in any way on the governance of the new Tallaght hospital.</P>
      <P>As Senator Roche said, it is only right on an occasion such as this to pay tribute to the service which these three hospitals have given the city of Dublin over a long number of years.  I do not have the detailed history which Senator Roche has but I have made some notes in relation to the three hospitals.  I found their history most interesting.</P>
      <P>Tradition has it that the Adelaide Hospital was founded by Dr. Albert Walsh.  In his history of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1886, Sir Charles Cameron, who had been president of the college between 1817-71, wrote of Walsh, whom he probably knew personally: &ldquo;Walsh, while still a medical student, formed the idea and established a hospital.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That such a notion should occur to a medical student seems strange.  Stranger still that when only two years qualified he should, at the age of 26, establish an institution, see it flourish and continue to act as a senior surgeon in it for the next 38 years, then a consulting surgeon until his death three years later at the age of 65.</P>
      <P>The premises which Dr. Walsh established as the Adelaide Hospital was located at 39 Bride Street.  The hospital continued there until 1846, when it was closed, and in October 1858 the Adelaide Hospital reopened at Nos. 24 and 25 Peter Street.  In 1891, by the will of the late Ms Fetherstonhaugh, the hospital received over £5,000, a substantial sum in those days, for the specific purpose of building a convalescent home for the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thankful to Mr. Tim Delaney, secretary manager of the Adelaide Hospital, for presenting me with the history of the Hospital entitled <i>A Peculiar Place</i> by Mr. David Mitchell.  It was interesting to note in the history that in July 1894 the Fetherstonhaugh Convalescent Home was dedicated by the Archbishop of Dublin, The Right Honourable and Most Reverend William <Col N="301" /> Cunningham, Lord Plunkett.  A fine statue to the late Archbishop stands on Kildare Street.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of this Bill enables the Minister to amend by order the charter of the hospital.  According to David Mitchell's book, it is not true to say that the first reference to the charter is in the committee minutes of 6 January 1920, because in February 1876 Mr. J.B. Pim had handed in a notice of a motion, which he later withdrew, that a Royal Charter should be sought for the hospital.  This apart, Mr. Law, who had been recently appointed solicitor to the hospital, laid counsel's opinion before the committee on 6 January 1920.  This was approved on 30 March and Mr. Law produced drafts of the petition for the charter and by-laws.  There is a long minute instructing Mr. Law to take such steps as may be requisite for obtaining the same charter.  It is interesting to note that the charter was granted on 27 November 1920 and enrolled in the Consolidated Judgement Record and Writ Office of his Majesty's High Court of Justice in Ireland, Chancery Division, on 15 February 1921.  On 11 July 1921 the truce came into operation and on 6 December the treaty was signed conferring dominion status on the Irish Free State.  It would appear, therefore, that the charter for the Adelaide Hospital was the last Royal Charter granted in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Adelaide Hospital has been a general teaching hospital and has been in the forefront of many medical advances, including the development of antiseptic surgery and pioneering work in preventive medicine with children in Dublin.  In addition, it has been the first general teaching hospital to introduce a skin clinic, in 1866, a gynaecological clinic, in 1868, and a psychiatric outpatients unit in 1936.  Special wards were also provided for TB sufferers in 1938 and as late as 1965 it was one of the first hospitals in Dublin to establish an intensive care unit.  During its long and interesting history the hospital has served the people of Dublin with great dedication and care.  I know from looking <Col N="302" /> at its annual report that Senator Henry has a special interest in it.</P>
    <P>The Meath Hospital has its origins in an institution which was opened by four surgeons in the library of the house of the Earl of Meath in the Upper Coombe, near Meath Street, on 2 March 1753.  The premises proved inadequate and necessitated several moves of the institution &mdash; to Meath Street in 1760, Earl Street in 1766 and a new building in the Coombe in 1773.</P>
    <P>The building in the Coombe was inconveniently small and an Act of Parliament was passed in 1815 to facilitate the erection of a new hospital.  One of the main functions of the hospital was to provide prompt and surgical assistance to the poor, especially those in the manufacturing industry, whose occupations rendered them liable to serious diseases and frequently exposed them to accidents.  A new site for the hospital was purchased from the Dean and Chapter of Saint Patrick's Cathedral and the new building for the hospital was completed and opened in 1882 in Heytesbury Street.  Since that date the hospital has continued to provide medical and nursing care, especially for the poor and underprivileged and in more recent times has developed specialised services in a number of medical disciplines.</P>
    <P>The National Children's Hospital was founded as a hospital for sick children in 1821 by Mr. Henry March, later Sir Henry March, Mr. Charles Johnson and Mr. Philip Crampton, who at that time was also attached to the Adelaide Hospital.  It was the first teaching hospital in Ireland and Great Britain with the following objectives: first, to afford medical and surgical aid to sick children; second, to give students the opportunity of acquiring a knowledge of infantile diseases with clinical instruction; and third, to extend information in health care to mothers and nurses as regards the proper medical care of children.</P>
    <P>Like the Meath Hospital, the National Children's Hospital moved to a number of premises and was finally <Col N="303" /> established in Harcourt Street in 1887. It also assumed the paediatric services formerly provided by St. James Hospital in 1978, St. Ultans Children's Hospital in 1982 and the Adelaide Hospital in 1987.  It treats over 50,000 children each year and is involved in an extensive research programme into children's disease and health.</P>
    <P>The Adelaide Hospital, the Meath Hospital and the National Children's Hospital joined with four other hospitals to form the Federation of Voluntary Hospitals under the Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961, in the hope of replacing smaller hospitals with a large, modern, public voluntary teaching hospital.  This would require the amalgamation of the Adelaide Hospital, the Meath Hospital and the National Children's Hospital on agreed terms between the parties.</P>
    <P>In August 1990, the then Minister for Health established a working party, chaired by Mr. David Kingston, to consider possible future management arrangements for the new Tallaght hospital.  The working party was comprised of representatives of the three hospitals transferring to Tallaght &mdash; the Adelaide Hospital, the Meath Hospital and the National Children's Hospital.  In its report submitted to the then Minister for Health in November 1991, the working party stated <i>inter alia</i> that the three hospitals had agreed that the legal instrument governing the new Tallaght hospital would be an amendment of the existing Adelaide Hospital Charter of 1921.</P>
    <P>On 3 November 1992, the Government decided, subject to the transferring hospitals reaching agreement on the composition of a board for Tallaght hospital, to commence the construction of a hospital at Tallaght.  On 25 May 1993 agreement was reached between the boards of the three hospitals and approval by Government was obtained on the composition of the board and other issues.</P>
    <P>The legal route chosen by the hospitals to give effect to the establishment <Col N="304" /> of the new facilities at Tallaght is by way of a charter.  The new charter, which has been negotiated by representatives of the three hospitals, is intended to reflect the interests of the three hospitals and form the basis for the management of the new hospital.</P>
    <P>The Cental Council of the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals operates under the provisions of the Hospital Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961.  Under the proposed legislation the powers and functions performed by the central council in relation to the Adelaide, Meath, National Children's Hospitals and the new Tallaght hospital will pass to the Tallaght hospital board.</P>
    <P>The Tallaght hospital is designed to serve the needs of a catchment area of 250,000 people in west Dublin and to provide a range of speciality services from the transferring hospitals.  At present, people in the catchment area must travel long distances to receive acute hospital care in the city centre hospitals.  These facilities will now be available to the community in west Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the closure of the last three remaining hospitals in the inner city, an area I have represented for a number of years.  However, I am satisfied that discussions are ongoing with service providers in St. James', the Mater, St. Vincent's and James Connolly Memorial Hospitals and the Children's Hospital in Crumlin regarding the extent to which their existing services may be redirected to take account of the major development in Tallaght. The hospitals can expect fewer patients to attend from west Dublin than heretofore. Equally, patients from the city centre who traditionally availed of the MANCH hospitals will receive treatment elsewhere.  A vacuum will not be created in Dublin city hospital services as a result of the building of the new hospital in Tallaght.  The city centre hospitals look forward to being in a position to serve their area in a more focused manner under the new arrangement in addition to their national specialist responsibilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> I welcome the measures in the Bill. It is historic that the legislation has the agreement of the three hospitals concerned. This aspect was mentioned earlier and I will not dwell on it but I am glad agreement has been reached.  I congratulate the three hospitals for coming to that arrangement.  As the Minister pointed out, Members received a letter expressing the hospitals' wish that the legislation be speedily passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I hope that will be the case in the Seanad and I commend the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill.  I take a proprietorial attitude towards it because next year I hope to move from the Adelaide Hospital to Tallaght hospital.  I had a deep interest in the negotiations in bringing forward compromise proposals for the Bill and I congratulate all those involved on the satisfactory conclusion which has been reached.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the differences in terms of the background, and ethos of the hospitals.  However, I was a student in the Meath and National Children's Hospitals and I worked in the Adelaide Hospital and I hesitate to stress the differences.  There is a commitment among the staff of the hospitals to the treatment of patients not just from Dublin but from the country.  This is the important aspect of the move to Tallaght rather than any differences which may have existed.  The people of Dublin and Ireland will be served to the highest level because that is the essential ethos of all the hospitals and this will be maintained in the hospital in Tallaght.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister mentioned that St. Loman's Hospital is also moving to Tallaght.  I was a student in that institution and it is an important move for it also.  The integration of acute psychiatric care in the new hospital in Tallaght is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Tallaght and the board deserve enormous congratulations for pushing for progress on the new hospital.  The many meetings I attended <Col N="306" /> in Jobstown, Firhouse, Brookfield and Tallaght Square over the last five years were incredible in terms of the amount of energy and enthusiasm the Tallaght Hospital Action Group put into the drive for that facility.  We made many visits to the Department of Health and I met three or four Ministers for Health. The group's efforts were sustained. There is a lovely pyramidal sculpture in Tallaght village by Dick Joynt, featuring large people at the bottom supporting increasingly smaller people as it goes up.  This exemplifies the spirit of Tallaght. They support each other and they pushed for the various institutions established in the area &mdash; the regional technical college, the basketball arena, the shopping centre and the hospital.</P>
    <P>It is also important to remember the three hospitals will not just serve the area.  It will be a tertiary referral hospital for different specialities from all over the country.  This is an important point.  As Senator Roche and Senator Doyle said, there are hundreds of years' service behind the three hospitals moving to Tallaght.  I will not deal in depth with the hospitals' histories but interested people should buy the books of Professors Lyons, Coakley and Gatenby or Dr. Mitchell.  I am sure a small commission will come my way if the sales are good enough.  The books give a detailed history of the development of the institutions and a foreseeing person could start making notes for the first book on the Tallaght hospital.</P>
    <P>The hospital will have a bright future. The long association with the Trinity medical school will continue and the campus on the Tallaght site will have the same type of facilities as those at St. James Hospital.  Trinity has already started raising funds for the new university facilities required in Tallaght and I look forward to receiving further contributions from the State.</P>
    <P>The emphasis being placed on integrating general practitioners in the area in the working of the Tallaght hospital plan is important.  They are the life blood of any medical organisation in an area and they have put enormous work <Col N="307" /> into fulfilling the dreams of the people of Tallaght.  People in paramedical institutions established in the area over the years have also put in a huge amount of work.  Tallaght was a very problematic area when it was built.  There was little in terms of facilities and transport was poor.  I recall seeing pregnant women in the Rotunda Hospital who had travelled from Tallaght; this required taking two or three buses to cross the city.  The hospital in Tallaght is late in the day for the people of the area, but if everything goes according to plan the wait will have been worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill has all party support &mdash; all parties were involved in it &mdash; and that is has been processed so speedily through the Oireachtas.  I met numerous Ministers for Health from different parties who were involved in the planning of the hospital and the consideration of how changes to the charter could accommodate the views of the different groups.  It is good the negotiations have come to a satisfactory conclusion and the legislation is going through the House as swiftly as possible. This is important because, while the board designate is in place, legislation is required for the appointment of a chief executive officer and a management team and so that the formation of operational policies can begin.  These matters take time to organise and the building is well under way, as those who have visited the site are aware.  It is hoped the hospital will be up and running by this time next year.</P>
    <P>The Bill is historic in several ways.  It is a concrete example of the Republic taking care of the anxieties of minorities. It is important to point out the Bill does not just take care of the anxieties of a small religious minority but rather of a large number of people &mdash; it could be the majority nowadays &mdash; who want the Republic to go forward as a pluralist, multidenominational State.  I have seen far more support for such ideas within Ireland than any suggestion that the rights of minorities are not being looked after.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> The nursing school was of particular importance in this legislation and it was one of the most difficult areas to deal with.  Nursing schools of all three institutions have been incredibly important in training nurses in Ireland and it is good that a tricky problem has been dealt with satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Should anyone query what minorities wanted made available in the hospital, I am glad that the Minister said in his opening statement that section 5 will ensure that the hospital makes available all medical and surgical procedures which may lawfully be provided without prejudice to the rights of conscience of staff.  This is important because we have had problems over the years with procedures legally available in Ireland being unavailable in many hospitals within the State.  All procedures which are legal should be available within State hospitals.  This hospital differs from others only where such procedures are available in that the board is bound to provide these procedures, subject to the rights of conscience of staff.</P>
    <P>Rights of conscience are absolutely essential within all working conditions such as this.  I do not think it has been suggested anywhere within the State that this should not be so.  I was dismayed with the attitude of members of the Irish Medical Organisation who suggested &mdash; the motion was carried &mdash; that if one does not agree with a procedure, one does not have a duty to refer a patient to a colleague to discuss a procedure legally available in this State.  I was glad that the Medical Council firmly stated that one had a duty to refer people, because while we in the medical profession and associated disciplines have rights of conscience, it is important to remember that our first ethical duty is to our patients and that their rights must also be respected.</P>
    <P>This legislation is for ourselves within this Republic, but note will be taken of it in Northern Ireland.  A minority's rights are not dependent on its size and, as far as I am concerned, should not be. I was dismayed that a newspaper commentator suggested to the IRA that <Col N="309" /> there was no need to continue fighting because the Catholic population in Northern Ireland would shortly outnumber the Protestant.  At best this is sectarian triumphalism and at worst it is looking at Northern Irish women as two groups of brood mares, one out breeding the other.  This is disgraceful and any Northern Irish women I have met do not plan their families' sizes on demographic logistics.  It is a most insulting suggestion that anything like that should happen.  While people in Northern Ireland are inclined to say that they take no notice of what we do, I have a sneaking suspicion that they will take a good deal of notice of this and be pleased that it has happened.</P>
    <P>The establishment of this hospital is the establishment of the last of the six hospitals which were planned for the Dublin area.  They were first mooted nearly 30 years ago in the Fitzgerald report and they will be in place by next summer.  Having worked in small Dublin hospitals with such tremendous commitment to medicine within this State, it is sad to be moving out of these institutions into the bright new future of a big institution.  I welcome the formation of these hospitals.  I went from Sir Patrick Dun's to welcoming, open arms in the Adelaide Hospital.  I remember that I was warned not to unpack because we would be moving to Tallaght almost immediately.  I did unpack and it was just as well.  I have had the privilege of working there for some time and have enjoyed it enormously.  This is an important day, not just for the hospitals involved, but for medicine in Ireland.  The great emphasis in Tallaght will not be the differences in background or ethos of the hospitals, but the tremendous commitment of everyone within them to working in a spirit of service for the people of Dublin and of the country.</P>

      <P>I am sure that all Senators welcome this Bill as I do.  It is a short enabling measure to permit the Minister for Health to provide the necessary statutory basis for the establishment of the governing body of the new Tallaght hospital.</P>
      <P>In an understated way, it has taken a large and significant step forward in hospital provisions for the people of our capital city.  The new Tallaght hospital, when the Bill is enacted, will involve the amalgamation of three great institutions &mdash; the Adelaide Hospital, the Meath Hospital and the National Children's Hospital &mdash; which have given enormous service to the people of this city and country over many years.  These great hospitals will continue to provide service to the community in a new context and with enhanced facilities.  That is a vital and historical development which we all welcome.</P>
      <P>The new Tallaght hospital will represent more than an extrapolation of a most distinguished past into the future. This new hospital on the south side of Dublin, catering for a vast catchment area, has a unique opportunity to adopt a totally new and imaginative approach in the delivery of acute hospital services to the population in that catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the new Tallaght hospital which is historically important.  The opening of this hospital will fill in the last piece in the major reorganisation of acute hospital services in the greater Dublin area which has been taking place over the past 20 years. When one goes back a relatively short number of years, the centre of Dublin was served by relatively small, older hospitals such as the Charitable Infirmary, which was Jervis Street, St. Laurence's Hospital, the Richmond, Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, Baggot Street Hospital and Dr. Steeven's Hospital.  All of these are now closed and will soon be followed by the Adelaide, the Meath and the National Children's Hospital.  In place of these, we have a new flagship acute public hospital on the north side of Dublin, Beaumont Hospital.  We shall <Col N="311" /> soon have another state-of-the-art hospital in Tallaght.  St. James' Hospital has been hugely developed and is a crucial modern facility in the centre of our capital.  These are supplemented by general hospitals such as the Mater, St. Vincent's, St. Michael's in Dún Laoghaire, St. Columcille's in Loughlinstown, James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown, by specialist institutions such as the Coombe, the Rotunda and Holles Street, by the children's hospitals in Crumlin and Temple Street, by other institutions such as the Eye and Ear Hospital on Adelaide Road, where I had my tonsils taken out many years ago &mdash; I remember the day I was being discharged; the Dublin-Monaghan bombs went off, so I was kept for another day &mdash; and by Hume Street and other public and private institutions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to the movement of acute psychiatric services from St. Loman's.  I had the pleasure many years ago of working as ward sister in St. Conal's Hospital in the psychiatric end when the change was taking place from the psychiatric to the general end.  I remember the mayhem talked about at the time that would follow when this change took place.  I was also the union secretary for the nurses so I was in a catch-22 situation.  The present acute service now available within the general area is one that is most welcome.  It has been a great innovation.</P>
    <P>I do not think Dubliners can complain that they are not well-served in the provision of hospital facilities.  I was disappointed to hear that complaints are being made publicly by people from some of the hospitals going to Tallaght that not enough beds are being provided. I do not think you can ever provide enough beds for hospital doctors. A bed provided is a bed filled.  No matter how many beds the Minister provides, there will be complaints that it is not enough.  The new Tallaght hospital facility will be in a position to provide magnificent services to the people in the <Col N="312" /> catchment area.  The confidence in a facility should not be undermined by irresponsible commentary.  I am sure the Seanad will appreciate the Minister's assurances on this issue.  Doctors going to Tallaght should rejoice that they will be able to practice medicine in modern conditions by virtue of a massive Government investment in the hospital, which has been paid for by the people with a contribution from EU Structural Funds.  People in my constituency of Donegal North East would be delighted if a fraction of that investment was diverted to provide public services and infrastructure in their area.</P>
    <P>Rather than spending time worrying about the concerns of a small minority of hospital doctors, I look to this hospital as being patient centred.  Many of the people in this hospital's catchment area are relatively disadvantaged.  I am glad they will soon have access to modern acute hospital facilities of the highest standard the State can provide.</P>
    <P>In the last century the population of Tallaght was comparable to that of the city of Limerick.  Furthermore, as it is one of the fastest growing areas in the country, the provision of Tallaght hospital is timely.  In addition, account must be taken of the fact that when the Luas is up and running in a few years time the number of people to which Tallaght hospital will be accessible will be substantially increased.  By any standards this new hospital will be a major institution serving the community into the next century.</P>
    <P>Tallaght will be a major teaching hospital.  It has concluded an academic agreement with Trinity College medical school.  This will enhance the hospital's attraction for the best medical and nursing staff and will ensure that the quality of medical care available to patients is second to none.</P>
    <P>Trinity College medical school has academic agreements both with St. James' Hospital and Tallaght hospital. In considering the amalgamation of the three hospitals going to Tallaght and the agreement reached between the <Col N="313" /> hospital and Trinity College, it is evident that we owe a debt of gratitude to all the institutions concerned for reaching an agreement which has allowed this development to go ahead to the point where the Bill is before the Seanad today.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years one heard of disagreements between the base hospitals on some aspects of the amalgamation. Happily, these difficulties have been resolved to everyone's satisfaction. I congratulate the base hospitals and the Minister for the constructive role played in bringing this development about.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the different approach to the provision of acute hospital services which the new Tallaght hospital can provide if it is of a mind to do so.  I was thinking about a community centred approach, where the hospital reaches out to the community it aims to serve and makes itself more amenable and less forbidding to people in its catchment area.  There is a pressing need for an integration of services between the health boards and the larger health care institutions in so far as community care is concerned.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago care in the community, as opposed to care in institutions, was flavour of the month, but it now seems to have fallen out of fashion. I am firmly of the view that it was a worthwhile concept provided it is fully recognised that it is not an inexpensive option.  Older people who live alone are being discharged from acute hospitals, in some cases without health board community care specialists being notified. Such people are frequently unable to look after themselves without a minimum level of support and they will inevitably revert to hospitalisation if they do not receive community care.  I cannot understand why health boards and the larger institutions have such difficulty liaising on this aspect of medical provision.</P>
    <P>The other dimension to innovation in the medical care of patients pertains to the integration of services between primary care providers, general and family practitioners and hospital medical nursing <Col N="314" /> staff.  There is a strong case to be made for general practitioners to be given greater access to hospital facilities, such as laboratories and X-ray units, without having to go through long-established and relatively inefficient channels.</P>
    <P>There is a substantial degree of restrictive practice at work in the medical area which will have to be tackled sooner or later.  The Bill provides an occasion for congratulations to all concerned in this great Tallaght hospital project.  It is also an occasion for celebration of the birth of a new institution whose role in the years ahead could not be clearer or more vital.  I am pleased to have been involved in debating this landmark legislation and I warmly welcome the passage of this Bill through the Houses of Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Maloney for sharing his time with me.  Many Senators have taken this opportunity to discuss hospitals and the general area of health.  However, that is not what we are celebrating today.  We normally do not have a Bill or charter to mark the opening of a new hospital or an extension of hospital beds.  We are celebrating an historic occasion &mdash; the end of a long battle which was fought principally by the Adelaide Hospital for the protection of its ethos.</P>
      <P>To some extent people have been dancing on pins in the debate but that is what the Bill was about.  It was about a battle for protecting the rights of minorities and their ethos in the Republic of Ireland.  It was about a special relationship between doctors and patients which the Adelaide and many others thought was threatened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not be triumphalist, but what has happened today is a great victory for pluralism in this part of the country. It is a day which many of us feared we would never see.  Those of us who were involved only in a peripheral way in this House sometimes came close to despair about what would happen on this issue. Senator Henry and Senator Norris are aware that time after time this issue was <Col N="315" /> raised in the House, at the instigation and with the support of many people in the Adelaide; Ministers promised the world, but delivered nothing.</P>
    <P>The Minister today is, thankfully, delivering at long last what over the years people pursued with hope rather than with total conviction that it would happen.  I congratulate the board of the Adelaide Hospital, the Minister and all involved for overcoming what appeared at certain stages to be insuperable obstacles.  We have now got a protection for the rights of minorities in medical matters in this country.  Everybody who is in favour of that should be congratulated, but I see no reason for apologising for this.  People have been fairly reticent to mention that it is about the protection of the Protestant ethos.  Let us read clause 5 (j) of the explanatory memorandum, which unequivocally:</P>
    <P>ensures that the hospital will maintain the fundamental principle upon which the Adelaide Hospital, Dublin, was established, that it should be an essentially religious and Protestant institution and that it would maintain the hospital as a focus for Protestant participation in the health services and thereby preserving its particular denominational ethos.  The clause also provides for the freedom of conscience and free profession and practise of religion by all within the establishment. It states that the hospital will therefore have a multi-denominational and pluralist character, it further recognises that religious welfare is part of the total welfare of the patient and that the support of such religious welfare by chaplains of each major denomination is essential to the attainment of that object.</P>
    <P>This means that people of all denominations, whether they are Presbyterians, Church of Ireland or Roman Catholics, have that protection.  The fear was, however, that the Protestant minority would not have that protection in the Adelaide's new status within the three hospitals in Tallaght.  That fear has now <Col N="316" /> been removed and when this Bill is passed that fear will be gone forever. That is why this Bill is significant.  The rest of it is peripheral and insignificant compared to what the Minister has achieved.  Of all people, the Minister knows that in Northern Ireland this issue was seen as a litmus test and was quoted as such time and time again.  As we equivocated over it, people of a non-liberal, narrow outlook in Northern Ireland would say, &ldquo;There they are, at it again.  They will not give the Protestant minority the sort of rights and liberal treatment they feel they need&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister has passed that test and I congratulate him.  The late Senator Gordon Wilson confirmed in this House that this issue was so important it was vital we passed a Bill of this sort.  There was resistance.  That is why it is historic and why it is a case for congratulation. There is no point pretending there was not fundamentalist resistance to this Act and the thinking behind it.  That is why the battle was so long and the Adelaide had such difficulty in getting it through various Ministers.  It was a Herculean test, an extraordinary achievement, over enormous obstructions.</P>
    <P>It could be said, and resented, that too much protection has been given to the Adelaide in the Board's structure.  I do not think it has.  It is absolutely essential to convince ourselves and others outside this island that we are liberal and pluralistic.  The Board consists of six representatives from the Meath, six from the Adelaide, three from the National Children's Hospital and eight nominated by the Minister &mdash; six of whom are nominees of the Archbishop of Dublin and two from the Eastern Health Board &mdash; will protect that minority and the medical practices which they believe it is their right to have the option to take.</P>
    <P>Nobody wishes to interfere with the medical practices or medical conscience of Roman Catholics, Jews, Presbyterians or any other religion but we have to create a system in the medical services where everybody feels that their right to a particular and confidential <Col N="317" /> relationship with their doctor and to their own ethics where their bodies are concerned, is there and established. What the Adelaide has done in pursuing this matter with such vigour, courage and determination is an enormous triumph for it, the Government and the Republic of Ireland.  I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a triumph for common sense and pluralism. I am delighted the three hospitals have come together.  In north Sligo, Catholic and Protestants have lived together for years.  At funerals there Catholics went into the Protestant church and <i>vice versa.</i>  About ten years ago my Protestant neighbour's father died in Belfast.  A group of us went to Belfast, one of whom was the local curate. They were amazed when they saw Catholics, particularly a Catholic priest, going into a Protestant church.  We felt nothing about it because it was common practice.  The parson and the priest got on very well.  I could never understand why there should be any trouble because we always respected the Protestant ethos and they respected ours. No country or society is healthy if they do not respect each other's views.  We all adore one God &mdash; there are not two of them up there.</P>
      <P>These hospitals not only gave a great service to the people of Dublin, but to all the people in Ireland.  Long before the health boards, regional hospitals and special services, these hospitals were known in rural Ireland.  When children were seriously ill, they were sent to Dublin &mdash; to the Adelaide, the Children's Hospital or the Meath.  These hospitals were known outside Ireland for the great training and teaching of their staff, who gave great patient care, comfort, etc., wherever they went to work.  These hospitals have a long and proud history of caring for people.  They did not ask whether people were Protestant or Catholic, they just asked what the medical problem and then tried to solve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> It is sad to see hospitals closing but, in the world we live in, science and services move on.  We have to move on to bigger and better services.  It is great that these three hospitals have come together.  I believe when they are all working together in Tallaght, the result will be greater than the total of the three parts; it will be a more cohesive and better unit.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to set up a three person committee to monitor the daily working of the hospital.  We are bringing three groups together under one roof.  We know what happened in Beaumont where eminent surgeons and professors were dragged into nitty gritty problems and, like the fly getting into the spider's web, the longer that continued the more they got entangled. That is why there should be a good monitoring service to deal with these different problems from the start.</P>
    <P>I also appeal to visitors and families of people in the new hospital to be patient for the first year or so.  Every new undertaking has its teething problems. In my 20 years on the health boards I rarely had complaints from patients. However, we always had complaints from members of the family who thought things were not moving fast enough or were not being done well enough.  I often asked them if they were patients themselves and if the patient has complained.  They would say no but that they had seen it for themselves.  I told them they had seen nothing as they had been there for only five or ten minutes while the patients were there all day.  I appeal to people to be patient with the new hospital.  Tallaght needs a hospital.  Tallaght is bigger than the city of Limerick and has long been in need of a hospital service.  I believe it will provide better service than the three old hospitals.  There should be a good direct bus service from the city centre to the new hospital to help visitors get to the hospital.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear Senator Maloney say he was delighted with the psychiatric services in the North-Western Health Board.  It is a pity he is not <Col N="319" /> here because, when we were trying to bring in those good services, Senator Maloney was one of the great opposing forces in the local media and wherever he got a platform.  He gave us a lot of hassle.  We are pleased he is now satisfied we were going the right road and that the services were good.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt this will be a good hospital and that the three hospitals will work together in unity and harmony.  I hope there will be a small monitoring committee to ensure we do not have any of the problems that arose in Beaumont. I will cut my speech short as I understand there are important statements to be made.  I welcome the Bill and give it our full support.</P>

    <P>The foul, callous and calculated murder of Veronica Guerin robs a husband of his wife, a small boy of his mother and journalism of a brave, fearless and courageous writer.  This is the first occasion in the history of the State that a journalist has had to make the supreme sacrifice in the pursuit of their vocation.  In a long series of atrocities, this is the most vile.  There can be no mercy, hiding place or forgiveness for the perpetrators of this act nor for those upon whose behalf it was carried out. This was an attack on our society by those who believe themselves to be <Col N="320" /> above the law.  These men know no decency and have no humanity: they are the enemies of our society and must be treated as such.  They have declared war on society and we owe it to the memory of Veronica Guerin to ensure that they never win.  Anything which can be done by way of legislation, extra effort or resources must be devoted to tracking down these killers and their extirpation from our society.</P>
    <P>Like other Members, I knew Veronica Guerin.  I first met her when she was part of the Fianna Fáil secretariat at the New Ireland Forum.  I knew Veronica from canvassing for votes in Dublin North-East and I also knew her socially. She was a warm, vivacious, friendly person. More than that, however, she was a fearless person who, on many occasions in the past, had been threatened and bullied by those who wished to prevent her pursuit of truth.  On every occasion she resisted the bullies.  Sadly, she has now paid the supreme price for her courage.  The sympathy of all Members goes to her husband, son and her family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very difficult because I have been a personal friend of Veronica and her husband, Graham, for 20 years.  I attended school with Graham and his brother Jimmy.  I also had the pleasure of attending Veronica and Graham's wedding.</P>
      <P>I am deeply shocked at the news of Veronica's unwarranted death.  Two weeks ago I spoke about the callous murder of Detective Garda McCabe and, as the Leader of the House stated, no effort, time or resource should be spared to ensure that those who carried out this murder are brought to justice. Veronica had an independent mind and was a professional journalist.  She made every effort to expose the perpetrators of crime and wrongdoing in our society. I hope that others will take up where she left off to ensure that those responsible for carrying out, or ordering, such activities are brought to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I extend my deepest sympathy to Graham, their son Cathal and Veronica's <Col N="321" /> family.  I sincerely hope this House will ensure that those who perpetrated her murder are brought to justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Words are inadequate to describe one's feelings on an occasion such as this.  I find myself unable to articulate words to measure the situation. The word &ldquo;sympathy&rdquo; seems inadequate and the term &ldquo;expression of condolence&rdquo; seems banal.</P>
      <P>I knew Veronica quite well and I was a member of guest panels on television and radio programmes with her on a number of occasions.  I also met with her on a professional and social basis.  She was a fellow resident of north Dublin and was held in the highest regard by many people.  Veronica went where angels fear to tread in the pursuit of her work.  She articulated the things people felt and took a risk in order to expose what was happening.  In her most recent newspaper column she protrayed an extremely horrific picture of latent and everyday violence which would send a shiver down anyone's spine.</P>
      <P>Our democracy is very clear about the importance of the press and the media. As public representatives, we are more aware of this than most people.  We are forever at the sharp end of the work of good journalists.  It is an important part of the democratic process that this is encouraged and allowed.  The Constitution requires that access be provided to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the mechanisms of power.  Therefore, this terrible murder threatens democracy and undermines freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members knew Veronica Guerin in her role as a professional journalist. Two years ago she was shot and assaulted in her home which was no longer inviolate to these people of violence. As a journalist and a parent, the State has failed to protect her.  I say this in an inclusive manner; this is a problem of society, not one of Government or political parties, and it requires the most determined and certain response.  We must ensure that no stone is left unturned in pursuing those responsible <Col N="322" /> for this dastardly act.  We must also ensure that our response is rooted in the democratic structure of the Constitution and in the system of justice to which we subscribe.</P>
    <P>I can find no other words.  Every worker, parent and citizen has been diminished by this attack.  It seems inadequate and banal to express our condolences, but we must do so.  I hope that Veronica's family can recover to some extent; they will never recover fully from this tragedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to find the right words to respond to this desperate act of violence.  A young woman in the prime of life has been murdered while carrying out her job.  Veronica Guerin belonged to a category of people, of which there are few, who take extreme risks for the sake of others in doing their jobs.  Journalists comprise one of those categories and, through her work and fearless pursuit of information for the public, Veronica Guerin was the bravest of them all.  She took extreme risks to legitimately investigate the activities of very destructive and heartless people.  She has paid a terrible price in doing so and, as Senator O'Toole stated, society has also paid that price. The only way we can respond is to assert people's right to go about their legitimate business in a peaceful way. We must do everything to bring the perpetrators of this act to justice.</P>
      <P>I join with other Members in conveying our sympathy to Veronica's husband, son, family and those who have been shocked by this horrific act.  It is very difficult to add anything further but Members should express their horror at what has occured.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I extend our sympathy to Veronica Guerin's husband, son, family and her colleagues in journalism. Everyone has been in a state of shock since the news broke at 1.30 p.m.  This represents an attack on society and democracy.  As someone who fearlessly pursued the truth during her career, <Col N="323" /> Veronica Guerin was determined to expose the perpetrators of crime in our society.  We all are in her debt because of it but none of us expected her to pay such a high price.  We can only hope that others will not be intimidated by this atrocity from continuing to report the truth and to expose these people, whom no one wants to see gain control of our society.  They cannot be allowed to continue to do this.  All the resources available to the State must be used to pursue them so that they know this is not acceptable in Ireland.  None of them has our support.</P>
      <P>We want to ensure that people like Veronica Guerin can continue to speak the truth.  The press is an organ of our democracy on which we have relied through the years.  No one in the press, the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social Welfare should be afraid to do their job.  We cannot allow the men of violence to believe they can gain the upper hand.  Members of both Houses are shocked and feel totally inadequate in speaking about how horrific this act is, but it is important that we tell these people that we do not want them in this country, do not accept this behaviour and will ensure they are sought out and brought to justice.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my party, Democratic Left, I join with the Leader of the House and other speakers in condemning the murder of Veronica Guerin.  If a journalist who had gained the admiration of the people for her courageous investigation and reporting of crime can be gunned down in our capital city, our country is in a serious position.  I sympathise with her husband and family and hope the perpetrators will be brought to justice.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to find words to condemn those who perpetrated this terrible act.  When they were younger Veronica Guerin and her husband, Graham Turley, spent a lot of time in my house in Dingle and they <Col N="324" /> also returned on holiday after they were married.  I subscribe to everything my colleagues have said.  This must stop and we must appeal to any member of the public who knows anything to come forward to the Garda in confidence, so that we can remove these people from our society.  I sympathise deeply and sincerely with her husband and family on their great loss.  She was a nice person and a brave woman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Veronica Guerin was a woman of outstanding courage who pursued her job in an extraordinarily professional manner and in doing so took huge risks in establishing facts about serious crime.  Her research often unearthed astonishing facts.  She did great work for this country and was one of our most important investigative journalists.  Her gunning down is a cowardly, evil act, committed by people who have no regard for law and do not want to work in an orderly society.  They have total disregard for life, freedom and property.  This is an attack against the fundamentals of democracy, the principle of free speech and communication and the freedom of journalists to do their business in a professional manner.</P>
      <P>It is fine for us to extend our sympathy to her husband, son and family, but it is imperative that those who committed this crime be ferreted out and that the communities in which they live come forward with information about them.  We can tolerate these people no longer.  All of us have a responsibility and duty to come forward with the information necessary to bring these people to justice.  I extend sympathy to her husband, child and extended family and to all her colleagues in journalism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the expression of sympathy to this shattered family, but we cannot leave it at that.  The strong condemnation from all sides of the House will have been anticipated and will be disregarded by those who carried out this calculated and planned act.  This is not the country in which I grew up 40 to 50 years ago.  In those days an event <Col N="325" /> like this would have been completely unheard of &mdash; when two old ladies running a sweet shop in Harcourt Street were attacked without even being seriously injured, it was headline news for days.  We have become accustomed to a climate of violence and we owe it to the memory of Veronica Guerin to start an analysis of where this violence has come from, why it has emerged and what can be done to stop it.  I lay the blame firmly at one principal source, the Provisional IRA, which created a climate of violence, an ethos in which murder for political motives was acceptable and we became used to the abuse of human values.</P>
      <P>It also helped start the drugs problem. It may disclaim that now, but in the north inner city 15 years ago one of the first major machine gun battles took place at the employment exchange around the corner from my house. When the dust had cleared, one of those who died was a well-known member of an extreme republican fringe group, so the IRA assisted in the introduction of drugs.</P>
      <P>We recently saw the murder of a drug addict and it has been said in this House that the elimination of criminals in arbitrary acts by citizens is a good thing.  I remember warning that in accepting those values, we go down a dangerous path.  This appears to have been a contract killing, carried out by two men wearing helmets, sitting on a motorcycle. They calmly and coldly executed this young woman, presumably for a price &mdash; I am reliably informed that in this pro-life society £2,000 is the cost for taking another person's life if one secures the services of a professional killer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have allowed this to start with the brutal murder of drug addicts and dealers &mdash; we do not approve of those people, but that is where it started.  Perhaps there was not enough outrage at that point and there may have been a degree of sympathy with the idea than an unpleasant, noxious element was being eliminated.  Our friends in the Provisional IRA have started murdering <Col N="326" /> members of our unarmed police force, not that it would matter if they were armed.  Now we have moved on to journalists.  Even if we act only from a sense of self interest, if we do not work strongly to prevent this development, politicians will be next, because some of the things we take the freedom to say in this House are deeply unpopular with certain elements.  In addition to expressing sympathy with this family in this tragic situation, I hope we will work to eliminate this evil and these evil people from our society.  I do not fool myself that it will be easy or that it will be done without restrictions on the general liberty of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>As a colleague of Veronica Guerin, I would say that she was one of the finest journalists who worked in Middle Abbey Street.  She has been murdered because she was a fine journalist, because she did what she had to do to expose what she felt she had to expose.  It was not the first time she had to endure such an attack.  Unfortunately, this time she was not as lucky as in the past.  It was a tribute to her that, although intimidated before, she continued with her work.</P>
      <P>This is a time for expressing sympathy to the family.  However, I cannot but echo the words of Senator Norris &mdash; it is a grim time for Irish society.  It is not an exaggeration to say we are drifting close to anarchy.  A garda was murdered recently and today a journalist was murdered. We are developing an immunity to such activity and it is becoming acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who perpetrate murders of this sort, who are not prepared to afford others normal democratic rights and take the law into their own hands, are not deserving of normal democratic rights themselves.  Such is the seriousness of the situation that confronts us.  I will not be specific, but everybody knows what I mean.  The seriousness of this matter merits much more than the Seanad paying tribute to Veronica Guerin and condemning her killing &mdash; it has gone beyond that.  I hope the <Col N="327" /> Government will take action in response to this event and will not restrict itself to words of condemnation. This is a deep and historic tragedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more difficult when one knows the person to condemn what has happened.  I had known Veronica Guerin since the early 1980s.  She was a vivacious, lively and courageous woman.  What happened today is an unspeakable crime against democracy. The ruthless killing of a young mother is an outrage against life itself.  This contract murder is an attack on freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>Everybody who values free speech and the other freedoms we enjoy owes a debt to Veronica Guerin's memory to do more than engage in ritual hand-wringing in this House or in the other place.  I seldom agree with extreme statements because I consider civil liberties to be very important.  We have reached a stage where democracy itself is under siege, and when democracy is besieged it is time to consider the extreme measures hinted at by the previous speakers.  I do not like to be associated with the thought, but the reality is that if these thugs can gun down a young mother doing her duty, courageously fulfilling the task of exposing the underside of Irish life, then we must consider extraordinary measures.</P>
      <P>I express my sympathy to Graham and Cathal and to the Turley and Guerin families.  Words are entirely inadequate on this occasion.</P>

In doing so she was trying to expose the evil people in our society, yet for doing that she has paid with her life.  That is a sad reflection on our society.  I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that the public must support the Garda in eradicating these evil people.  If we start to do that perhaps Veronica Guerin's death might not have been completely in vain.</P>

To that extent we could venture into Provisional IRA and UVF areas with some consolation.</P>
      <P>Nobody admired Veronica Guerin's work more than those journalists who put themselves in danger.  Her memory will be honoured and the nature of her death will be marked by journalists wherever there is a free press and journalists try to correct evil.

      <P>I am personally devastated by this obscenity.  It is outrageous that such an event could have happened. Only a few weeks ago Detective Garda McCabe was shot dead in cold blood and his partner was seriously injured.  I returned from a trip to Russia last week.  Murders such as that which took place today happen regularly in Russia.  A couple of noted journalists were killed there for the same reason that Veronica Guerin was killed &mdash; they were getting too close to the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not know Veronica Guerin well, although I had met her on a number of occasions.  She was a lovely person and as an investigative journalist she had no <Col N="329" /> peer.  It was a pleasure to read her articles in the newspapers.  Where will it all end?  If gardaí and journalists are being murdered, perhaps politicians will be next in line.  Successive Governments have allowed this problem to grow out of control.  The Government should act swiftly on this occasion.  If certain rights have to be trampled upon, then so be it; but let us take those people off the streets and put them away.  The people of this country deserve it.  I express my deepest sympathy to her husband and young child.  This country will be worse for having lost such a wonderful person.</P>

Her life was threatened before and she was shot in her own home.  Today she has paid the supreme price for telling the truth and being sincere, honest and dedicated in her work.  I did not know the lady personally but I admired her for the stand she took and I believe she was perfectly right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to society, every man, woman and child who knows anything, to come forward and help the Garda. We must put those criminals out of business but we cannot do it unless we get the support of the general public.  We need that now more than ever.  I do not believe Detective Garda McCabe's killing was a robbery which went wrong.  I believe he was getting too close to the <Col N="330" /> truth.  Veronica was also getting too close.  People were worried about what she knew.  All they have is one remedy and that is to eliminate.  We must ask society to come forward, not with the gun but with their voices to ensure that the legal process can put those people in jail where they will be out of society's way.</P>

Last night on television we heard a young girl from County Limerick making a plea to the nation to help track down the murderers of her husband.  She said she would put up £10,000.  That is a cry from ordinary people and a family which has suffered great sorrow for many months.</P>
      <P>The institutions of the State, including Dáil Éireann, Seanad Éireann, the Garda, the free press and the Army, are all being challenged.  It is time the Irish people stopped this double think.  We owe it to the people who fought for the freedom we enjoy today.  This double think will not get us anywhere; it will only allow gangsters to prosper.  Some of them have no interest in unity or peace &mdash; north, south, east or west.  It is sad to see this happening when so many people are working to bring peace.  It is a spillover from the sad situation in Northern Ireland where life has become so cheap.  However, these people could not operate without the double think and that must stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must support the Garda in every village and town.  These people will be tracked down and made pay for the terrible tragedies they have brought to many families, especially the family of this young woman.  There should be no more double think because these people do not recognise the Constitution, the Garda, the Army or the Houses of Parliament. We owe it to those who fought for the freedom we enjoy today to stand up to these people and co-operate with <Col N="331" /> and support our Garda.  May God rest her soul.</P>

Will it be the people who speak freely about the way they want people to live?  The peace process is going through a difficult time at the moment.  We would all love to see peace and harmony.  People like Detective Garda McCabe and the late Ms Guerin were getting too close. It is time for us to stand up and be counted.</P>
      <P>I would not blame the IRA or republicans for the all the ill deeds in this country.  We must look deeper to the drug barons and examine where the real money, evil and problems lie.  Unless we tackle that we will be in serious trouble in the future.  We must take this and other serious issues on board.</P>
      <P>I extend my sympathy to Graham, his son and all the family.  People in this country died for freedom of speech.  Now when a person exercises the freedom of the press and the freedom to live in a society, she gets gunned down.  It is easy for us to say that something will have to be done, but we cannot expect the people to do it for us.  We must do it here because we are the legislators and we must do the right thing and put justice in its rightful place.</P>

      <P>It is devilled in a sense to get back to this positive business after such a sad and regrettable interlude, but the life and the health of the nation must be catered for and things must go ahead.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I was one of those who raised the issue in the House when it appeared that the so-called ethos of the Adelaide Hospital might be threatened. I tried to deal with that matter with a certain degree of delicacy, because on the one hand there appeared to be what was called the Roman Catholic ethos.  This was correctly seen in some circumstances as limiting in terms of the degree of choice regarding the relationship between patient and doctors and in terms of the availability of certain legal procedures which were frowned upon by the Roman Catholic Church for theological reasons.  Yet because of the prevalence of the so-called ethical committees within most of the major hospitals here, citizens were not often in a position to make a choice in conscience to avail of those procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I did not terribly like the idea of the Protestant ethos because it seemed to veer from one sectarian label to another, simply assisting the notion that we were a sectarian society.  The method I used to justify it was that because the Protestant ethos incorporated the notion of freedom of choice, it incorporated the freedom of Roman Catholics to choose to be limited in this way; and whereas the Protestant ethos could encompass a respect for the Catholic ethos, it was not necessarily true the other way around.  It was restricting and negative for people who did not subscribe to the Roman Catholic ethos to be brought in exclusively under its jurisdiction.  I would, however, have <Col N="336" /> much preferred if it could be a liberal ethos.</P>
    <P>With regard to the composition of the board, the Minister has acceded to the wishes that were strongly expressed from members of the various Protestant communities North and South.  The board has been established and reflects the historic derivation of this splendid new hospital and it is nominated by the members of the Adelaide Hospital Society, the Meath Trust and the National Children's Hospital Company Limited, in addition to which there are six nominees of the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin.  As a transitional arrangement, this is satisfactory. However, had it been six nominees of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, I would have been unhappy and it would have better if it were found to be possible to make this a transitional arrangement and not to lock the hospital in perpetuity to this arrangement.</P>
    <P>Instead of having each individual hospital element endlessly repeating its own particular flavour on the board and the very worthy Church of Ireland Archbishop endlessly emitting six representatives reflecting his beliefs, I would like to see that as our society becomes more pluralist, more complex, more liberal and more tolerant, this necessity would automatically wither away and those of us who support choice, who support what is vaguely known as the Protestant ethos, would no longer find it necessary to put this particular sectarian label on it and would instead trust the hospitals to act in their own liberal way.</P>
    <P>I know of a number of consultants and eminent persons in the medical world who are devout Roman Catholics but who in their professional lives respect what is vaguely known as the Protestant ethos.  That is my first little caveat.  I do not imagine that it will have any huge practical effect; but it is important that as a member of the Church of Ireland community who has always striven to be non-sectarian, I welcome the establishment of the board <Col N="337" /> in its present form and I hope that it is a transitional situation that need not necessarily remain for perpetuity as our society develops and matures.</P>
    <P>This is a fine facility architecturally and in terms of medical equipment. However, it is not the best that could possibly have been done.  This is not a case of saying we are spoiling the ship for hap'worth of tar.  This is a good ship and it would be at least ten bob's worth of tar that would be necessary to make it into the kind of vessel that I am thinking of.  After the 1991 Kennedy report there were certain cutbacks built into the plan in terms of facilities.  The present size of the hospital is less than what was originally envisaged.  There are not enough operating theatres.  The outpatient space is less than the existing space in the Adelaide Hospital which is already inadequate, although they are expecting greater usage.  The number of beds is less than the projected need and, at a mundane level, there is a serious question with regard to car parking.</P>
    <P>I want to put this into a particular context. If you look, for example, at the ratio of beds per head of population in Beaumont Hospital, the ratio is one bed per 300 head of population; in the Tallaght hospital it is one per 600.  In today's <i>Irish Times</i> there is a report by Padraig Ó Morain, social affairs correspondent headlined &ldquo;Tallaght survey finds high level of illness.&rdquo;  The report says:</P>
    <P>An extremely high use of health services and high levels of ill-health and disability have been found in a survey in the Jobstown area of Tallaght, Dublin.</P>
    <P>It was carried out by the Jobstown Integrated Development Project, funded by the Department of Social Welfare, in conjunction with the Department of Community Health and General Practice at Trinity College, Dublin.  The survey of 400 households found that: More than half of all households reported having at least one member with a chronic illness or disability. The most common illness was respiratory; A third of households had <Col N="338" /> at least one member in hospital in the last year; Almost one-fifth of households had a family member on the waiting list for hospital treatment.  Of these, half had been on the waiting list for more than six months.  Almost all (96 per cent) households had at least one member who visited a family doctor in the past year.</P>
    <P>The rest of the article is not directly relevant to this afternoon's argument, but it does show that there is a high level of demand upon health services in this area; and when you add that to the fact that there are proportionately fewer bed spaces available, that does make the case that perhaps the provision of extra facilities would have been a good thing. This point may appear to be begrudging and I would ask the Minister of State to accept that it is not.</P>
    <P>What is being done here, the enabling of the hospital which will be commissioned in July or August 1997, will make a major contribution to the health care provisions of this city and State.  It will be a fine facility, but I have no doubt that in the coming years there will be demands from that source for extra facilities by virtue of the fact that unquestionably there will be extraordinary pressures upon that fine facility.</P>
    <P>It is important to put down a marker now and say that some of us at least, even before the hospital goes into operation, are aware that there will be these requirements further down the line so that no Minister will be able to say &ldquo;We gave you a wonderful hospital and you said 'thank you, this is marvellous and it is one of the greatest things that ever happened but you are never satisfied.&rdquo; It is not a case that we are never satisfied; it is a case that, as this survey appears to demonstrate, there is already a particularly high demand for health care services in this area.  Some of us at least believe that, however excellent will be the facilities, services, plant and equipment at Tallaght, nevertheless, they will unfortunately prove to be inadequate.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill which provides the necessary statutory basis for the establishment of the governing body of the new Tallaght hospital.  All of us would accept that there has been a long process of discussion and debate to date leading to the establishment of a single board for the new Tallaght hospital.</P>
      <P>This Bill has the support of all the three hospital boards, and the board designate has been working since January last.  It now needs this legislative power to proceed with the integration of services which are essential for the transition to the new Tallaght hospital. The board designate urgently wants this legislation passed so that it can proceed with the work it needs to do.</P>
      <P>This project began in 1990 when a working group was established under the chairmanship of Mr. David Kennedy. The heads of agreement were reached three years ago and agreement on the draft charter, which formed the basis for this Bill, was finally reached last August.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that there is all party support for this Bill.  The agreement between all three boards shows there is unity among all the parties involved and that augurs well for the working of the new hospital.  When the new hospital was built at Beaumont and hospitals of different traditions came together, there were many difficulties which have persisted to this day, so I hope that, because of the long process of negotiation and discussion which has taken place between the three boards who are moving out to this new site, there well be a much smoother transition to Tallaght.</P>
      <P>This is a practical example of tolerance and respect for the role of minorities in this State.  It acknowledges the contribution which minorities can make, and they have a responsibility to make that contribution to society as a whole and not just to their particular group. The Tallaght hospital will be a new experience.  It will be a challenge to all the parties involved and no doubt they will rise to that challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> When this Bill is enacted, one board will take over the operations which are now being carried out by the three separate hospital boards, the central council and the Tallaght planning board. This move will enable good management and a smooth transition to Tallaght.</P>
    <P>The building of the Tallaght hospital is on schedule and it is expected to open this time next year.  We could all be critical of what is and is not being provided. The State's health budget is about £2.4 billion and we would all probably ask for more resources to be made available. The health area is like a bottomless pit.  If all the Exchequer's funds were made available to the health services throughout the country, we probably would still not be satisfied with the services provided.  There is obviously a huge demand in this area and as technology and developments in the health services improve there is a greater demand on the Exchequer for health service funding.</P>
    <P>The new Tallaght hospital is the largest hospital project ever commissioned in the history of this State.  It is a great development for the people of Tallaght who have been waiting for it for almost 15 years.  With the passage of this Bill, the opening of that hospital is moving ever closer.</P>
    <P>The charter of the new hospital is the amended charter of the Adelaide Hospital.  It assures patients of all denominations that the hospital will be managed in the interests of patients.  It assures patients of the availability of every lawful surgical and medical procedure, with the privacy of the doctor/patient relationship protected without the intervention of any moral big brother.  That is important and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the staff can exercise their rights of conscience to opt out of procedures with which they do not agree.  The staff's freedom of conscience and freedom to practise their religion is guaranteed; this is also important.  It is very important to assure society that the Tallaght hospital has a <Col N="341" /> multidenominational and pluralist character, and that is something I would like to see in every hospital.  It is unfortunate that certain procedures are not carried out in some hospitals because of their ethos to date.  It is also unfortunate that many of these procedures always seem to affect women.  My party believes it is regrettable that any particular ethos would have to be enshrined in the public health service, but, if one looks at the overall state of hospital services the Catholic ethos is so extensive that the Adelaide needed this guarantee because it was so vulnerable.  I know they fought for this guarantee which involved much protracted negotiations and they had to follow a long hard road. I pay tribute to the members of the Adelaide board and to the boards of the other hospitals who were generous and accepted the Adelaide's legitimate call for a guarantee in this charter.</P>
    <P>From the Minister's point of view, much work has gone into bringing this Bill to this point.  I pay tribute to the work done in the Department of Health and to the Minister and the Minister of State.  Getting to this stage has not been easy.  I accept that many people had fears and reservations.  It is great that all the members of the boards are in agreement as are all the parties in this House.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to one of two important issues, that is, that the fundamental principle of the Adelaide as an essentially religious and Protestant institution will be maintained guaranteeing the rights of practice and providing that the hospital has a multidenominational and pluralist character.  Another important issue is the fact that each of the colleges of nursing will be autonomous for student nurse intake.  This was necessary because the Adelaide hospital was the only Protestant training hospital for nurses and the guarantee in section 24 was essential.</P>
    <P>We are witnessing something historic. The voluntary traditions of the three separate hospitals will continue in the new hospital at Tallaght and the people of Tallaght will benefit from being served by the traditions which each of <Col N="342" /> the three hospitals will bring to them.  It is a difficult time for each hospital which is moving from where they have been for so long, but they will face the challenges ahead.</P>
    <P>The people of Tallaght will benefit greatly from this new hospital.  Senator Norris and others said this hospital may be the most up-to-date in the country but it will still not be sufficient to meet the demands.  It will be difficult to ever meet the demands on the health service, although the resources of £2.4 billion are substantial.  I welcome this Bill and I hope it will pass quickly through the House.</P>

      <P>I appreciate Senators' unanimous welcome for the Bill and I will attempt to deal with some of their comments.</P>
      <P>I welcome Senator Roche's support for this legislation.  I thank him for his commendable but slightly lengthy history of the Meath Hospital.  I remind him that the Meath Hospital's history will continue in the new Tallaght Hospital under the name as set out in the order &mdash; the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, Incorporating the National Children's Hospital.</P>
      <P>I endorse Senator Doyle's views and pay tribute to the contribution which the Meath Hospital, the Adelaide Hospital and National Children's Hospital have made in providing hospital care over the years.  I am happy this contribution will continue at Tallaght hospital and that each of the hospitals' interests and honourable traditions will be respected and acknowledged. The catchment areas of the three hospitals will be served by St. James' hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful to Senator Maloney for his support for these important measures and for his encouraging outline of Dublin hospital services.  As regards beds in Tallaght.  it is the Department's opinion, following a detailed analysis, that none of the scare stories to which the Senator referred have any foundation.  The emphasis, as <Col N="343" /> set out in the health strategy, will be to consolidate acute services and, in particular, to provide new strong links with GPs and to continue care programmes in the interests of high quality patient care.  Negotiations and discussions are already taking place with GPs in the Tallaght area and the hospital will reach out into the community.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to what he described as the battle for the Adelaide Hospital and the rights of minorities. Today is a historic day because it is the culmination of a process which has led to the legislative proposals before the House.  It is not just a battle won by the Adelaide Hospital but a battle won by the Meath Hospital and the National Children's Hospital.  The traditions of each hospital are respected and acknowledged by the legislative framework before the House.  The provision of all lawful medical procedures at the hospital is enshrined in the draft order, as are the rights of conscience of staff and others.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator Farrell's support for the Bill.  He said it was a triumph for pluralism.  I am glad he acknowledged that the three hospitals have an excellent reputation not only in Dublin but in Ireland.  The Senator proposed a committee structure to monitor the hospital's functions so that we can avoid some of the problems experienced in Beaumont Hospital.  I assure the Senator that we are facilitating a unified management structure for Tallaght hospital before the hospitals merge.  The Department is confident that the board designate, which will have a statutory basis after the order has been signed, will have the competence and commitment to ensure the smooth running of the hospital.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry was right to congratulate all those involved in this process.  I am glad she acknowledged that the essential ethos in each hospital is a caring attitude to patients.  It is good that the Senator referred to the transfer from St. Loman's hospital to Tallaght hospital.  I, like her, have a particular <Col N="344" /> interest in St. Loman's in that she worked there and I worked for it because it is in my constituency.  Tallaght hospital will have 56 acute psychiatric beds, with particular emphasis on services for elderly mentally ill patients. I have already said this will be a fine hospital, providing all procedures which are legal.  However, it will also be one of the few hospitals in the country providing a full range of services, including paediatric, geriatric and psychiatric services. I am glad the Senator reminded the House that this day is important in the medical history of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator Norris's positive comments.  I do not propose to turn this debate into a general debate on our hospital services.  I assure the Senator that I do not consider him to be begrudging; I doubt if his opponents would describe him as a begrudger.  I have no doubt that Tallaght hospital will be well utilised.  I cannot accept that it will prove to be inadequate.  Theatre space, an outpatient department and bed numbers are being considered by the Department.  A recent study has shown there are adequate beds in Tallaght hospital.  There has been an enormous move recently by acute hospitals towards day procedures.  I am aware that the provision for day theatres is being looked at in Tallaght hospital which may not be fully provided for because of changing medical practice. Any project of this size merits continuous review and this is happening in relation to Tallaght hospital.  I assure the Senator that it will be carefully monitored.</P>
    <P>I welcome the comments about the historic nature of this Bill.  Senator Roche told us there was a lesson to be learned from the negotiations and the compromise.  I am not unaware of the parallels between this problem and the controversy over the Mater Hospital in Belfast, which went on for many years but which was finally resolved.  Senator Henry said this was the historic resolution of a tricky problem.  I agree with her that all sides deserve to be highly commended.  Senator Ross told us we <Col N="345" /> were celebrating a historic occasion, the ending of a battle for the protection of an ethos and a great victory for pluralism. I will convey the congratulations of the House to the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  A number of Ministers for Health have been involved in this over the years and he has successfully brought it to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>In personal terms, I am not unaware of how privileged I am, because of the Minister's absence, to be the one to bring this Bill to the House this afternoon. I assure Senators that because of my background and experience I greatly appreciate this.  I thank Senators for their welcome for the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Health to</P>
      <P>&mdash;establish by regulation a contact register to facilitate adopted persons and</P>
      <P>their birth parents in re-establishing contact with each other;</P>
      <P>&mdash;provide adopted persons with the basic right of access to their birth certificates;</P>
      <P>&mdash;provide sufficient resources to bring about an early collation and reconciliation of National Archive material with information from birth records and adoption societies with a view to establishing a comprehensive database of all relevant material; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;establish an independent appeals mechanism to end as a matter of urgency the situation where voluntary agencies have total control over information on adopted persons and to ensure that adoption agencies are made accountable by obliging them to co-operate with statutory bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the first time I have raised this issue the House.  On each occasion the Minister of State has closed his ears, his mind and, more regrettably, his heart to the practical proposals which I have tried to encourage him to put in place.  I have only heard him react when the issue of adoption has been raised by the media and when there is the opportunity for publicity.  On such occasions he has made a series of promises.  He has committed himself to helping those is these difficult circumstances and has <Col N="347" /> appeared compassionate and committed. However, unfortunately, he has done nothing.</P>
    <P>The first part of the motion calls for the establishment of a contact register. This is a prime example of the track record of the Minister of State on this issue &mdash; all promises and no delivery. On at least two occasions I have heard him promise publicly to establish such a register, yet in the more than two and a half years since I first raised the issue in this House we have seen no action.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State had identified legal constraints to the establishment of a contact register he should have made them clear long ago and taken action to deal with them.  It is unacceptable to hide behind these excuses while thousands of people suffer the frustration of being denied basic information on their origins.</P>
    <P>Contact is simply and solely about facilitating parties on both sides of an adoption to make contact.  At present the obstacles in the way of such contact are almost insurmountable.  We must break this cycle of obstruction and secrecy and set in place an open and accessible system.  The key elements of such a register are that it must be active and widely promoted in Ireland and abroad in such a way as to encourage all parties to register.  It must also be backed up by proper resources to ensure its success.</P>
    <P>The adoption agencies are not the appropriate bodies to administer this register.  Regrettably, they have consistently failed to appreciate the importance of the rights of the adopted persons and their families in this regard.  I ask the Minister of State to establish this contact register immediately.  In tandem with the establishment of a contact register he must also put in place adequate counselling for those who seek to make birth contact, either the birth mother or adoptee.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion calls on the Minister for Health to provide adopted persons with the basic right of access to their birth records.  The refusal <Col N="348" /> to supply adoptees with their birth certificates is a breach of their fundamental human rights.  I do not accept there are legal constraints in this regard.  Most other countries issue original birth certificates to adoptees.  Will the Minister explain why Ireland is different from countries which have established contact registers and which issue original birth certificates to adoptees?  Are there specific conditions in Ireland which do not exist in other countries?</P>
    <P>The placing of a child for adoption is usually the result of a crisis pregnancy. In my experience actions surrounding adoption have been as a result of crises. It was suggested that the recent find by the National Archives of a significant number of files was a huge resource which would be made available to those who may not otherwise have access to that type of information.  These files could be referred to in the same manner as the popular television series, &ldquo;The X Files &mdash;&lsquo;the truth is out there&rdquo;&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>Public announcements by the Tánaiste, the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, and the Minister for Education, who stated she would make available files discovered in her Department, only serve to further confuse people who assumed that anybody who sought information could get it freely.  This is not the case and I told people who telephoned me after the Ministers' announcements that the files made no difference to their positions.  Adoptees or birth mothers are not entitled to the information on the files and there is no way contact can be made voluntarily.  I reiterate that I am discussing voluntary contact; I do not seek to breach the right to confidentiality of either party.</P>
    <P>However, it is time there was honesty on all sides, particularly in relation to various Ministers who made announcements in the past.  It is dishonest and misleading to suggest there has been a fundamental change or that the discovery of files would make a difference to those who were adopted or to birth mothers seeking to make contact with the children they gave up some 20, 30 or 40 years ago.  There has been no change. <Col N="349" /> Thousands of files exist in adoption agencies throughout the country and many others were destroyed by agencies which went out of business.</P>
    <P>The third part of my motion calls on the Minister to provide sufficient resources to bring about an early collation and reconciliation of National Archives material.  The existence of files, whether in the National Archives, Department of Education or elsewhere, makes no difference.  The archivist requested that sufficient resources be made available because the National Archives could not cope with an additional burden of work.  She said it needed the services of two archivists up to three days a week to compile and format the information scattered around the country.  I ask the Minister to immediately provide resources for such a data base.</P>
    <P>The fourth part of the motion is probably the most contentious.  It calls for the establishment of an independent appeals mechanism to end as a matter of urgency the situation where voluntary agencies have total control over information on adopted persons.  Given my position, I receive many telephone calls and letters from individuals and groups, such as Barnardo's, the Adoptive Parents' Association and adult adoptees.  The bulk of complaints I receive relate to the way in which adult adoptees and birth mothers are treated by adoption agencies.  This is a common thread in all the contact I receive.  I do not suggest all adoption agencies treat birth mothers or adoptees callously, but the majority appear to be unhelpful and obstructive to children and mothers.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree it is unacceptable that voluntary agencies have such arbitrary powers.  The heads of agencies, which in the main are nuns from religious orders, behave in a totalitarian manner.  In my case I was told it was probably unwise to seek this type of information and asked did I not have a life of my own.  There appears to be no understanding of the needs of birth mothers or adult adoptees at that point. <Col N="350" /> Far from being helpful, the agencies tend to be obstructive.</P>
    <P>After two and a half years of constant telephone calls to the head of the institution, I received no news.  Yet, when a lay social worker took over, she was in a position to tell me within six weeks that she had traced my natural mother and was about to try to make contact.  I accept, as was the position in my case, that the line should be drawn when the natural mother does not wish to make contact.</P>
    <P>However, it is unacceptable to birth mothers and adoptees that somebody unconnected with their lives &mdash; except in some cases where they are the same person who handed over the baby to the adopting couple &mdash; can decide arbitrarily there is no way of tracing the mother or child.  This aspect should be addressed.  An ombudsman deals with queries as a final arbitrator in relation to social welfare, health and telecommunications matters and such a person is urgently required to arbitrate in adoption related matters.  It is unacceptable that adults are treated in the manner to which they are subjected.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat a number of points I raised when the House discussed this issue in 1993.  Adoptive parents give enormous love to their children.  Adoption situations do not always involve somebody searching for a love they did not receive in their adoptive families.  In my case I could not have been placed with better parents.  However, this does not invalidate the points I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a number of remarks on behalf of adoptive parents, including the issue of reclaim cases which received coverage in the media recently.  I made the same case to the previous Minister for Health in relation to the recoupment of costs.  I am not sure if the Minister is aware &mdash; the public is probably not aware &mdash; that under the 1988 (No. 2) Act, a health board will meet the cost of a legal challenge to reclaim a child if the child was born in wedlock.  However, I understand that if the adoption case refers to an illegitimate child, the adoptive <Col N="351" /> parents must pay the costs of the High Court challenge brought by the third party, the natural mother.  This is unbelievable and it only came to my attention recently.  Couples who want to give their love to a child are penalised probably for the rest of their lives because the cost of High Court actions is phenomenal.  The old Attorney General's scheme used to give approximately a third of the cost back, but that scheme has gone by the board.</P>
    <P>Adoptive parents also asked me to mention the delay in consent.  I do not suggest a return to the days when a baby was taken from a mother's arms while she signed papers and was still psychologically distressed.  However, I am aware of a case where consent was withdrawn ten years after a child had been placed with adoptive parents.  In 1994 a committee recommended to the then Minister that there should be a defined period of consent.  However, nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>There is another case of the right of inheritance of adopted children and that is where Mr. Justice Lardner in 1992, in the Stamp <i>versus</i> Stamp, Stamp and Redmond case, ruled that adoptive children were not issue and therefore did not have the same inheritance rights as natural children.  The whole area of adoption and children born outside wedlock has not changed.  They are still stigmatised.</P>
    <P>I will finish by quoting the final sentence in a piece by Nuala O'Faolain where she states, &ldquo;Could not the Government match this natural energy,&rdquo;&mdash; she is talking about spring &mdash;&ldquo;with some energy of its own?  Could it not move to honour, for the first time, the deep bonds of physical relationship &mdash; bonds which our country treated with such cruel contempt in the past?&rdquo;  The Minister had an opportunity to do a lot of the things which I have raised in this motion in the Adoption Bill which he published last week or the week before. He did not include any of the points which I have raised.  If he is replying tonight and there is no amendment, I <Col N="352" /> want him to state when he is going to do the things I have asked.  The people who are affected and who asked me to raise this issue do not want another statement saying it is going to be done. They want a defined period in which it will be done and done in the way they have asked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuireann sé áthas an domhain orm gcuidiú leis an rún seo.  I am delighted to second this motion.  It is a breath of fresh air to hear Senator McGennis speak and it is seldom we have somebody in the House speak who has personal experience and who knows exactly what they are talking about.  I appeal to the Minister to think and ponder on every word she said because she is speaking from the heart.</P>
      <P>Voluntary organisations did a good job in the past.  I will say this much in their favour: all adopted children were put into good homes.  I did not hear of any child in an adopted home who was not well-cared for and educated.  Maybe there were some who were fostered who were treated differently, but adopted people did very well.</P>
      <P>As is the case now, the Governments of the day took absolutely no interest. So long as voluntary organisations and nuns did the job, they did not care what happened.  A Government should always care and see that any agents they appoint are doing their job.  That is where our Governments fell down in the past and are doing so now.  Unfortunately, there are not as many children being adopted today, but we have a worse situation.  I referred to it before and I will refer to it again: our Government is doing nothing to stop the abortion trail to England.  It is terrible and should be stopped and our Government should be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is heartbreaking for some adopted person tracing their roots, wanting to know who their parents, or at least their mothers, were, that they do not get the co-operation or help they should.  It is terrible that voluntary organisations are still adopting an authoritarian, dog in the manger attitude &mdash; we have it, it is <Col N="353" /> no good to us, but you will not get it. That is wrong and the Minister must move to ensure that all files are taken out and put somewhere.  As Senator McGennis said, there should be an ombudsman, or it should be part of the ombudsman's brief to get the necessary information.  We have seen a lot of cases on television and heard them on radio where people spent years searching and at the end of the day the information could have been given straight away in the first instance.  No voluntary organisation should have the right to deny someone the facts that tell them who their mother is, where they were born and what the circumstances were.  That is what this motion is about: to ensure that adopted children, if they want to trace either of their parents, but particularly their mothers, should have access to files, if files are available.  Why should we be held up by some voluntary organisation? Why should files be kept in archives?  All are entitled to full information. Just because one is adopted does not make one less of a person.  We must get that information and the only one with the power to do so is the present Minister.</P>
    <P>I appeal to him to listen, think and ponder on every word said and even ask for further advice from Senator McGennis, because she is one of the few people in this House speaking from the heart and from experience and who knows exactly what she is talking about. People and adoptees confide in her because they know she has the information. She knows how to go about it. They know she can help them in this very important aspect of their lives.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister to act now.  He should not tell us he is looking into it.  He should not tell us what he intends.  He should tell us that he will do it within the next three months and put a time frame on it, to use modern terminology. In doing that, he will go down in history as the Minister who acted positively on a problem that has been with the people of Ireland for many years and about which nobody did anything. <Col N="354" /> Let the Minister he the man to break the vicious circle and he should do it now.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator McGennis and her colleague for tabling this motion, which I know is of personal interest to her and to a number of people.  The first line of the motion reads, &ldquo;establish by regulation a contact register to facilitate adopted persons and their birth parents in re-establishing contact with each other,'.  It is my understanding that there are times when natural parents are guaranteed anonymity and one would have to establish whether they wanted to make contact with their natural child at a later date. The State would have to provide a mediator between the two parties to clear that hurdle before the adopted children and their natural parents could meet.  That is one problem I would like everyone to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk of providing adopted persons with the basic right of access to their birth certificates.  I have some experience in this issue because I worked for some time in related adoption work. The society we live in today is quite different to that of the 1950s and 1960s because there was a stigma attached to children born outside wedlock and to their mothers.  We had the term &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; which we removed from our Statute Book at a later date in my time in the other House, and rightly so. There was always that problem.  Girls who became pregnant were anxious to go to a voluntary organisation, whether <Col N="355" /> it be religious or non-religious, have their baby and walk away.  That was their attitude and was respected.</P>
    <P>Up to 1952 the extraordinary thing was that if a child was adopted, there was no mechanism for amending or making an alteration to the natural birth certificate.  The 1952 Act provided for that, whereby An Bord Úchtála, the Adoption Board, could make an order or, for that matter, some court outside the jurisdiction could make an order for a legal adoption.  When the order was granted the certificate or record, whether it be of Church or State, was amended to provide for the adoptive parents' names.  However, the natural parent's name was never removed, so it remained on record.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of information in these records is not accurate because a young mother who wanted that kind of anonymity might not have been prepared to give her full name and address. That was a problem and, consequently, there is some doubt wherther certificates dating back to the 1950s and 1960s are totally accurate or not.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the third proposition.  As regards the fourth item mentioned in the motion, I pay tribute to the voluntary organisations who played an important role in society in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, even though we may now see them in a different light.  At that time many young girls were anxious to be free of their babies after giving birth and a number of organisations facilitated them by providing the best homes that could be found for the children in question.  Of all the voluntary organisations I was in contact with I have no doubt that their one priority was the interest of the child. That was to the credit of such organisations and we should remember them for their good work.  Many children were adopted into happy homes and lived full and productive lives.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McGennis that both Church and State have come around to accepting that adopted children have a right to know.  Whatever <Col N="356" /> information is there should be made available to them and it is only reasonable for that to happen.  If some regulation has been made to provide for that, so be it.</P>
    <P>Society has come a long way in caring for adopted children.  In fact, the word &ldquo;adoption&rdquo; has gone out of fashion in our society which has changed its attitude to the unmarried mother, who can now keep her child.  The State now provides an allowance which it did not do in the 1950s and 1960s and that made it difficult for single mothers who could not afford to keep their children.  All that has changed, however, and we live in a different society with different attitudes to unmarried mothers, which is a good thing.</P>
    <P>Earlier today we discussed the change in regard to the Adelaide Hospital's ethos being transferred to the Tallaght Hospital.  However, the ethos of the unmarried mother in society has also changed.  With the single amendment I have moved, I welcome the motion before the House.</P>

I feel a bit abashed about entering this area because my motivation is considerably less strong.  I pay tribute to Senator McGennis and wish to say, if it is not patronising, that she is a great credit to her adoptive parents who can feel extremely proud that somebody so emotionally mature and well balanced has emerged from this system and is able to put such a coherent argument for the establishment of this kind of register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from a natural human sympathy with people who find themselves in this situation, my only reason for contributing to the debate is because last year I stayed in a small hotel in southern Ireland.  After dinner the proprietress of the hotel explained to me that she had been adopted and that this was a matter of some difficulty for her in various ways.  In particular, she was finding it almost impossible to trace her natural mother.  This was a continuing, niggling difficulty at the back of her mind, even though she had established a successful business and had a happy family life with three or four delightful healthy children.  There was still this uncertainty and a natural human desire to find her biological parents, in particular her mother.  She believed it was possible to find them, but a number of things prevented her from doing so.  One was the absence of a national register.  She asked me to speak out at every opportunity I got in support of such a national information register to facilitate contact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second thing was that, from the experience of this woman, it seemed there was an extraordinary presumption and arrogance on the part of some agencies, at least, who took it upon themselves to decide in what circumstances and to whom they would dispense information concerning private and intimate areas of a life.  If anyone has the right to know it is the person directly involved, the natural child.  In certain circumstances that has to be hedged around with safeguards and guarantees.  One of the problems is that in the past when it was regarded as shameful &mdash; not all, but a large number of these children emerged in situations where the parents were not married &mdash; it was something that was concealed.  The natural mother subsequently went on to marry in a situation where her husband and second family produced within wedlock were unaware of the situation.  It was felt it might cause considerable trauma if an unanticipated natural child suddenly erupted into this tranquil domestic scene.  One has to be aware of the natural <Col N="358" /> child's rights as well as those of the natural mother and the family that has grown up since.  It is a question of balancing rights.</P>
    <P>In the light of the discovery of archival material that illustrates the mass export of adopted children to the United States during the 1940s and 1950s, it is important that financial resources are made available so that the historical records can be collated and reconciled.</P>
    <P>An independent appeals mechanism should be established so that it is not left to the whim of particular agencies. It can be argued that some of these agencies, many of them run by religious orders, did a fine job.  So they did, but others did not.  Where the information is directly personal it is incumbent upon us to ensure that an independent view is taken so that access can be made available.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this matter was not turned into a political football, although occasionally there were suggestions of that.  I would not like this to happen and it would not be in the interests of this important debate.</P>

      <P>I am currently reading the autobiography of the American swimming champion, Greg Louganis, who won four Olympic gold medals.  He was adopted and for a long time he wanted to discover who his natural parents were because, unlike some people who have been able to mature in a family where they were cherished, he felt he had been rejected by both his parents.  When he eventually managed to get access to the archival records it turned out that his father was a 15 year old of Samoan origin and his mother was a 15 year old of North European origin, although both were Americans.  The father wanted to keep the child and have it reared as one of his brothers, but the mother objected because she knew the family did not have adequate resources.  Together they decided in the interests of the child that <Col N="359" /> it should be put up for adoption.  Having had access to that information it reconciled the psychological doubt, the wound and the fear of rejection he had. This kind of register would provide precisely that kind of material.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Senator McGennis on her admirable motion and on her persistence; I congratulate the Minister on accepting the motion and I congratulate Senator Norris on an exceptionally balanced speech.</P>
      <P>This is a good day in terms of the contribution to civilised behaviour in this society and the Minister has been at the centre of it on both occasions.  It has been a sad day in terms of the murder of Veronica Guerin, which shows how Irish society has changed for the worst in some ways.  However, it is changing for the better in this particular way.</P>
      <P>I do not have to urge the adoption of the motion, but I impress on the Minister the importance of the time scale. The motion proposes to facilitate adopted persons and their birth parents in re-establishing contact with each other.  This should be done as quickly as possible.  Senator McGennis mentioned the importance of adequate counselling. We all know the problems that can arise in this area, even when it is voluntary on both sides.  There is now a host of international experience in this area about the disappointments that can emerge from high expectations when things do not work out precisely as the parties involved anticipated.  I hope every attempt would be made to provide adequate counselling for the people involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the time factor, the motion proposes providing sufficient resources to bring about an early collation and reconciliation of National Archive material.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us some idea of what &ldquo;early&rdquo; means, now he has adopted the principle of the motion.  The motion also proposes to &ldquo;establish and independent appeals mechanism to end as a matter of urgency...&rdquo;.  &ldquo;A matter of urgency&rdquo;<Col N="360" /> can often be a protracted time scale in our political culture.  I do not doubt the Minister's goodwill and commitment but I hope he will give some indication of the time scale he has in mind for the implementation of the appeals mechanism. I do not think it would be a good idea to impose this function on the Ombudsman, not because he will not do an excellent job but because this is an area requiring specialised expertise.  It requires the building up of case experience and this is better done by a specialised agency which can concentrate entirely on this particular type of issue.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Doyle that marvellous work was done by voluntary agencies in unfortunate circumstances. The motives involved, in so far as one can speculate on human motives at any time, were of the best in the circumstances of the time.  However, those circumstances have changed.  There is a different ethos, in many respects a much improved ethos.  There may be counselling necessary in the context of putting pressure on whatever agencies may still be resistant but, if counselling does not suffice, then I would have no hesitation in putting on whatever pressure is necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is desirable to probe origins.  We are in a different situation and we must try to provide justice for those who have suffered injustice. Expectations are being raised now by this announcement and the Minister's adoption of it.  This puts an even greater onus on the Minister to ensure the issue is resolved as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to Seanad Éireann on the very important and complex area of adoption and access to birth records. It is a deeply sensitive issue with a broad scope in both human and administrative terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our society has changed in recent years.  Old truths and values which were once held sacrosanct are now being questioned and re-evaluated in the light of new information and our evolving <Col N="361" /> understanding of the human condition. The question of our society's attitude to children has dominated public debate to an unprecedented degree.  The issues raised in that debate go to the core of our values and raise questions about our sense of community.  We measure ourselves by the treatment of the most vulnerable among us and we have found that our attitudes fall short of our ideals. However, our attitudes continue to evolve and progress as our understanding grows of the needs and vulnerabilities of the weaker elements of our society.</P>
    <P>These changing attitudes have been reflected in the area of adoption.  Our treatment in times past of children born outside of conventional relationships is difficult to reconcile with the ideals of a State founded on the principle of cherishing all children equally.  It is also hard to reconcile with our image of ourselves as a caring and compassionate society.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, legal adoption was introduced here by the Adoption Act, 1952.  This enlightened social legislation was brought forward by the Minister for Justice who, until 1983, had ministerial responsibility for adoption matters.  It is the cornerstone of adoption legislation in this country and provided couples seeking to adopt a child with a legal framework and clarified their rights and responsibilities.  Prior to the passing of that Act, children were informally adopted by couples here or went abroad for adoption.  It is well known that many children were legally adopted in the United States and other countries.  Indeed, this practice provided some of the impetus for the introduction of our own legal adoption system.</P>
    <P>Section 40 of the Adoption Act, 1952, imposed, for the first time ever, a statutory restriction on the sending of children abroad.  It became an offence for a person to remove outside the State a child born outside marriage under one year of age who is an Irish citizen or to cause or permit such removal, except for the purpose of the child residing with the mother or a relative outside the State.  The purpose of this restriction on <Col N="362" /> sending children abroad, as I understand it, was to ensure that children who were available for adoption would be adopted within the State by Irish people.</P>
    <P>However, the provisions of section 40 of the 1952 Act that related specifically to children born outside marriage were subsequently declared unconstitutional by the High Court in the late 1970s.  The effect of this decision was to permit the sending abroad of young children for adoption with the approval of a parent or guardian.</P>
    <P>There are few areas in the field of human relationships that involve the same degree of heart searching, anguish and, ultimately, happiness as the adoption of a child.  It affects those who are a party to it in different but deeply felt ways.  For some it means parting with a child; for others gaining a child.  Difficult and agonising decisions have to be taken since the consequences are lasting and irrevocable.  Perceptions of the role of legal adoption have evolved over the years.  When adoption legislation was initially framed, an important motivation was the introduction of provisions which would, on the one hand, alleviate the problems of the unmarried mother and, on the other hand, enable the childless couple to acquire a child that they could call their own.</P>
    <P>Therefore the actions taken by those working in adoption in the 1950s, 1960s and even the 1970s must be looked at in the context of the social values prevailing at the time and what were then considered to be the best interests of all parties.  The underlying belief in relation to adoption was that birth ties could be severed, that the child's true origins could be erased as if they never were, and that everyone affected by this process &mdash; the adopted child, the birth parents and the adoptive parents &mdash; benefited from this step.</P>
    <P>However, we are all now aware of stories of babies who were removed from their young and frightened mothers at the most vulnerable time in the life of the mothers.  Many such young mothers were traumatised by the <Col N="363" /> secrecy and shame surrounding their pregnancy and again in having to cope with the anguish of having to give up their child.  We have no way of knowing the emotional and psychological distress mothers must have suffered.  We had hoped at least that the children involved went on to happy and fulfilled lives. However, we now know that this was not always the case and that many adopted children have spent years trying to find out why they were abandoned, as they saw it.</P>
    <P>Irish society today has a less censorial and more sympathetic attitude towards unmarried mothers.  This less hostile environment has encouraged many mothers to rear their children.  At the same time, there has been a growing public concern for disadvantaged children, who may require the care and protection of society.  We have a greater understanding of the anguish felt by birth parents years after they had relinquished their child for adoption and the severe emotional trauma they have suffered. In addition, adopted children have a strong and natural desire to know their true identity, family lineage and health history.  However, we must also recognise that many birth mothers in the 1950s and 1960s in Ireland gave their children up for adoption in the climate of secrecy and stigma attaching to unmarried mothers at that time.  They may have created new lives for themselves and raised new families, without informing anyone about having given a child up for adoption.  I have received letters from birth mothers indicating their deep anxiety and, in some cases, threatening suicide, if their identity is revealed to the child they gave up for adoption.  It is an extremely difficult balance to strike between the genuine and heartfelt desires of an adopted child to know his or her true identity and the desire of a birth mother to remain anonymous.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks I consulted widely with statutory and voluntary adoption agencies and adoption support groups such as Treoir, the Council of Irish <Col N="364" /> Adoption Agencies, Barnardo's and the Adoptive Parents Association.  I will shortly be meeting the Irish Birth Mothers Association.  I have sought views in relation to the issue of access to birth records and how best to strike a balance between the needs of an adopted child to know his or her natural parents and the right to privacy of the birth mother, who was given strict undertakings on the confidentiality of adoption when giving her child up for adoption.  There is a general consensus, among those organisations whom I met to date, towards the view that the right of the child to know is more important that the promise of confidentiality given to a birth mother many years previously. I also sought legal advice on the question of access to birth records to which I will refer later.</P>
    <P>My Department has also looked closely at the establishment of a national contact register which would facilitate contact, where such contact is desired by both parties, between the adopted child and the birth parent.  In addition, I asked my officials to look at the situation in other jurisdictions where the question of access to birth records and a contact register have arisen.  In the United Kingdom any adopted person over the age of 18 years has access to his or her birth records, accompanied by counselling.  In Northern Ireland such counselling is mandatory for adoptees who were adopted before 1987 and is optional for those adopted thereafter.  A contact register has been operating in England and Wales since May 1991.  I understand that, as of May this year, 6,820 adoptees had registered, as had 3,892 birth relatives.  To date, 112 matches have been made.  In New Zealand the approach has been that if a birth parent or adopted child place a veto, their confidentiality is respected and identifying information is not released.  However, the New Zealand experience seems to suggest that a birth mother placing a veto may be putting herself in greater danger of being traced.  It may act as an encouragement for an adopted child to search more <Col N="365" /> intensively using alternative information sources.</P>
    <P>Concern was also expressed that some adopted people who receive a veto take this as an indicator that it is the birth mother who does not want contact.  Therefore, when they embark on a search and trace her whereabouts, rather than making contact with the birth mother, they make contact with other members of the family.  This is likely to be much more of an upheaval to the birth mother than if she had met the adopted child herself.  As Senators are aware, this is a complex and sensitive area of human relationships where the emotional needs of the adopted child and the right to confidentiality of the birth parent are difficult to reconcile to the satisfaction of both parties.</P>
    <P>Senators McGennis and Norris referred to archive material.  Extensive work was undertaken in my Department in relation to children sent outside the State for adoption.  My Department has been trying to ascertain the extent of the practice and the status of the records held by adoption agencies.  The preliminary indications are that approximately 1,800 children were sent abroad for adoption between 1941 and 1968, when the practice effectively ceased.  These children were sent primarily to the United States.  Although the information is as yet incomplete, a number of features have become apparent. These are as follows: the cases in the records of the Department of Foreign Affairs appear to be largely duplicated by those held by the adoption agencies; the vast majority of children sent abroad for adoption went to the United States; and those who underwent the visa/naturalisation process there would have full access to the related documents under the United States Federal Freedom of Information legislation.</P>
    <P>The work in this area is continuing and if further resources are required I will ensure that they are made available. My Department is also liaising with the Department of Education in relation to its records in respect of children placed <Col N="366" /> in industrial schools in the past.  I sought legal advice on a number of issues in relation to the adoption records held by adoption societies regarding the adoption of Irish children abroad.  Questions on which I sought advice on included: &ldquo;What is the respective standing of natural mothers and their children, who were adopted outside the State, as regards access to, or privacy of, information of the kind involved?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Is there any legal impediment to the various bodies concerned sharing or pooling their information in the event of it being decided to create a central reference point to which individuals could address inquiries and be referred to the relevant body?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have been advised that the question of access to birth records gives rise to many complex constitutional and legal issues in relation to the disclosure of information on one hand, and the confidentiality of the information on the other.  The Circuit Court recently stated a consultative case to the Supreme Court dealing with the right of children who were informally adopted in this country, prior to the enactment of adoption legislation, to know the identity of their natural parents.  The judge in the case referred a number of questions to the Supreme Court for decision, such as whether the natural child has a constitutional right to know the identity of his or her natural parents and, if there is a constitutional or legal right to the information sought on the part of the child on one hand, and a constitutional or legal right to non-disclosure on the part of the birth mother on the other, which right prevails?</P>
    <P>It would be prudent to await clarification of the constitutional and other legal issues surrounding the question of access to birth records before proceeding with any initiatives in this area.  Such considerations also apply to the establishment of a comprehensive database of relevant material from the National Archives, birth records and adoption societies.  Issues which must be considered in relation to such a database include, for example, the application of <Col N="367" /> the provisions of the Data Protection Act, 1988, which sets out stringent restrictions on the disclosure of personal information held on computers.  I have been advised that until the legal issues have been clarified by the Supreme Court, it would not be prudent for the various bodies concerned to share or pool their information.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate the complex legal and emotional issues which arise in relation to access to birth records. Ill considered actions which may later prove to be constitutionally or legally untenable would only exacerbate the pain and trauma which may have been suffered by birth parents and adopted children.  Clarification of the legal and constitutional position is, of course, essential.  I have no option but to wait until that clarification is available to me. However, I am determined to proceed as quickly as possible in the circumstances to facilitate contact between adopted children and birth parents, where it is desired by both parties.  I have, therefore, decided to establish a contact register which will allow for the registration of birth parents and adopted children who wish to contact each other.</P>
    <P>I hope this will meet the needs of adopted children who wish to know of their identity, while also respecting the privacy of birth parents.  The register will provide a safe and confidential way for birth parents to assure an adopted child that contact would be welcome. Such a contact register will be established on an administrative basis pending clarification by the Supreme Court of the legal issues relating to access to birth records.  Senator Lee asked for a time scale &mdash; I intend to establish a contact register as quickly as it can be done and will bring a set of proposals about the continued development of child care services in the near future.  This package will include proposals about the operation of a contact register.</P>
    <P>Senators have referred to voluntary agencies' control over information on <Col N="368" /> adopted persons.  The position concerning the ownership of adoption information is unclear at present.  The absence of a legal framework has given rise to differing practices among adoption agencies.  I assure the House that in preparing proposals, once the legal position has been clarified, we will ensure that a uniform approach concerning access to adoption information is provided for.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to assure the House that the Government is committed to a programme of legislative reform to reflect the changing nature of adoption and to take account of developments at the international level.  My immediate priority in this programme of reform has, of necessity, been the preparation of amending adoption legislation to address the issues raised in the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of <i>Keegan v. Ireland</i>, which held that Irish adoption law discriminates against the fathers of children born outside of marriage, in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government's legislative response to the judgment is contained in the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996, which I presented to Dáil Éireann on the 13 June.  The Bill gives statutory recognition to the position of the father of a non-marital child in the adoption process.  It provides for the introduction of a new statutory procedure for consulting the father before the child is placed for adoption.  A father who objects to a proposed placement will be given an opportunity to exercise his right to make an application to court for guardianship and/or custody of the child, if he so wishes.  Provision is made for exemptions from the requirement to consult the father in certain circumstances &mdash; for example, in the case of rape or where his identity cannot be ascertained.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for certain amendments of the current law on the recognition of foreign adoptions.  The main purpose of these is to facilitate the recognition here of adoptions effected in countries, such as the People's <Col N="369" /> Republic of China, whose adoption laws permit the termination of adoptions in particular circumstances.  The measures in the Bill relating to foreign adoptions are designed to introduce greater flexibility into our statutory recognition system. The Bill represents a major development in our adoption legislation. Second Stage will be taken in the Dáil next week and I look forward to bringing it before the Seanad in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Government is also committed to ratifying the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Inter-country Adoption.  This convention was prepared under the auspices of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, of which Ireland is a member state. The primary objectives of the convention are to provide safeguards to prevent the abduction or sale of, or trafficking in, children and to establish a system of co-operation among countries in order to ensure that inter-country adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned.  It takes full account of the principles set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland has ratified.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully supportive of the Hague Convention and its objectives. It has authorised the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to arrange for the signing of the instrument in order to signal our intention, both domestically and internationally, eventually to ratify it.  I understand we signed the convention on 19 June.  Ratification of the convention involves making certain changes to our domestic adoption laws in order to bring them into line with the provisions of the instrument.  This will be done in due course as part of the Government's programme of legislative reform in the adoption area.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis raised the legal costs of High Court actions where a child is being reclaimed by a natural mother.  I discussed this matter as recently as yesterday with the Adoptive Parents' Association.  I listened with <Col N="370" /> great interest to what was said and have sympathy with the position stated.  My Department has written to the Department of Equality and Law Reform, which has responsibility in this matter and for the Attorney General's scheme to which the Senator referred.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amended motion before the Seanad and the concern and sympathy which it shows for adopted children and their birth parents. However, until the many complex constitutional and legal issues relating to birth records and confidential adoption information have been clarified by the Supreme Court, it would not be prudent to proceed with any legislation.  I am aware of the anxiety of adopted children and birth parents who wish to contact each other that a mechanism be put in place to facilitate such contact.  It is for this reason that I intend to proceed with the establishment of a contact register which will allow those who wish to make contact to do so.  I hope the operation of such a register will also further develop our understanding of the emotional needs and support which may be required by both birth parents and adopted children and allow us to respond in a caring, sensitive and sympathetic manner to those needs.  As I stated earlier, the true values of a society may be measured in its response to its most vulnerable and needy members.  I hope that when future generations come to pass judgment, the response we have shown in recent years, and continue to show, to the needs of children will reflect well on the values of our society and our sense of community.</P>

      <P>I support the motion of my colleague, Senator McGennis, which is especially apposite and we should congratulate the Minister for giving his blessing to it.  As another speaker said, it is civilised that we all speak the same language.  When one sees a motion like this one wonders why it was not done before, but it requires someone like Senator McGennis to bring it forward, as she has personal experience and spoke with passion, commitment and <Col N="371" /> sincerity.  We will name her &ldquo;<i>L'Appassionata</i>&rdquo; from now on.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply was measured.  As he said, the old truths and values we once held sacrosanct are now being questioned and re-evaluated in the light of new information and our evolving understanding of the human condition.  I hope that continues.  It was said earlier that today was a bad day, which it is, but it is good that this has come forward.</P>
      <P>The Minister has shown a good deal of understanding in his pronouncements. He mentioned the Supreme Court decisions and balancing the rights of the mother <i>versus</i> those of the child in relation to information.  I have dealt with many people whose children were adopted and people who were adopted and put their own children up for adoption. I know the importance they attach to being able to contact their real mother, no matter who she is, and even to meet her only once.  It closes the <i>Gestalt</i>, provides finality and allows a person to get on with the rest of his or her life.</P>
      <P>Having given the child's viewpoint, we must remember that many mothers do not want to be contacted.  That is not the thrust of the motion, as Senator McGennis would agree.  Many women who became pregnant and had a child do not really want to be reminded of it and that right must also be respected. This is a minefield through which we have to tread carefully and, consequently, the Supreme Court decision to which the Minister referred will be important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many issues could be agreed readily &mdash; for example, the establishment of a contact register, an issue on which the Minister of State has looked favourably. Senator McGennis has told me this is one of the few countries which does not accord the right of access to birth certificates. If one has a right to one's birth <Col N="372" /> certificate one then has a right to one's mother's name.  The birth certificate may also give information about the mother which may make a trace easier. I have met people who wanted to be traced and people who did not want to be traced.</P>
    <P>In general, the motion is to be welcomed. I congratulate Senator McGennis on having brought it forward.  I am surprised such a motion has not been put forward before and perhaps it is her personal experience which dictates that it should happen at this time.  The Minister of State is to be congratulated for his measured contribution.  He has given the ideas of the motion a fair hearing. Senator McGennis may be pleased that she has received so much support for the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Fianna Fáil Senators for this motion.  The four elements of the motion seem to have one aim, that is, to render more open and transparent the adoption system as it operates and has operated in the State. The Minister of State has addressed the issues.  I welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs's commitment that files in his Department relating to foreign adoptions will be made publicly available through the National Archives. That is now taking place and I congratulate the Tánaiste on his speedy action in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am aware the Minister of State has indicated in the past that his priority is to secure through legislation a recognition by law of the rights of non-marital children.  I appreciate his concern in this regard.  However, if it is intended to make changes to adoption law we should include all the outstanding issues surrounding adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has indicated that he is prepared to contemplate the changes outlined in the motion.  The most significant element of the motion is its call for the establishment of an adoption register.  I support such a development.  When completed it will resolve the difficulties in relation to the hold of voluntary agencies over all <Col N="373" /> information relating to adoptions referred to in the motion.</P>
    <P>We should be wary of the problems relating to adoptions.  The public is alarmed about recent revelations and we should be careful about stoking such concerns.  The abuses which have come to light recently took place decades ago and do not mean that similar problems exist today.  The adoption process is regulated by the Adoption Board and its responsibility include regulating the actions of the adoption societies.  The Adoption Board makes an annual report which is presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas for scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Difficulties in relation to confidentiality may arise with regard to the fourth element of the motion.  Some people who give up children for adoption may not wish to be contacted by their child at a later date.  The right to confidentiality has to be counterbalanced by the right of a child to know the identity of his or her original parents. The right to see one's own birth certificate is an absolute right and outweighs all other rights in this area.  The law should be changed to recognise this point.  While I recognise the right to consult the adopted children's register under section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952, exists, in many cases it is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>I thank the Fianna Fáil Senators for raising this matter.  I welcome the Government's commitment to consider legislation.  In a recent statement the Tánaiste acknowledged that the law as currently formulated makes it difficult for the Department of Foreign Affairs to aid fully those seeking information about the recently revealed foreign adoption cases.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board the concerns expressed by Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator McGennis for her tenacity in pursuing this matter because it is of vital interest. There is nothing like having a personal interest in a topic to make others see how important it is.  I support the motion.  I would like to see the idea of <Col N="374" /> the contact register expanded.  It is vital for those adopted that the birth mother and the adoptees can be put on the register voluntarily to facilitate contact. In the light of the Keegan judgment I wonder if the natural father will have rights with regard to the register.</P>
      <P>The register needs to be expanded to include people who are not adopted, although that is less common nowadays. We need to include those who were in industrial schools, those who were in long-term fostering and those who were in foreign adoptions.  The Bill which will come before us shortly will make provision for adoptions from China and other countries.  I would like to see the legislation cover more than is proposed by Senator McGennis, to include not just people who were adopted but all those who lost contact with their natural parents shortly after birth.</P>
      <P>The right of access to birth certificates is important from a medical point of view.  Many diseases have a genetic foundation and it may be important for those with inherited conditions to find out about their families.  The present situation is unsuitable.  I am aware of people who have employed private detectives to try to trace their parents and, regrettably, the detectives identified the wrong person as the birth mother.  Legislation should be brought in as soon as possible.  It is a pity that the Bill which will be introduced shortly will not consolidate the six or so Acts which deal with adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGennis is right to say that it would not be suitable for the Adoption Board to keep the register.  I do not think it would want to keep it.  It is regrettable that so many of the voluntary agencies have not been forthcoming in giving information to birth mothers or adoptees.  Registers have been set up in many other countries &mdash; Britain, Northern Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Ontario in Canada. We could learn from the experiences in those countries.  I know people in their sixties who spent years trying to find out who their mothers were but they were unsuccessful and that has caused them <Col N="375" /> considerable distress.  The sooner we establish the register, as suggested by Senator McGennis, the better. However, I would like to see it extended to people other than those who have been fortunate enough to have been involved in happy adoptions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the thrust of Senator McGennis' motion and congratulate her.  In the past I have discussed this issue with her in the House when debating Adoption Bills.  I have come to know her interest, sensitivity and deep personal commitment to improving the situation for adoptees, adoptive parents and natural parents.</P>
      <P>The modern approach is that as much information as can be made available should be freely available and the system for obtaining that information should be transparent.  There should not be different approaches by different agencies.  The Minister's commitment to setting up the contact register is very welcome as is the thrust of his speech identifying the difficulties and sensitivities surrounding the adopted person particularly and their need to know their natural parents and background.</P>
      <P>I fully understand the sensitivities with regard to confidentiality for the natural mother.  That is being researched and hopefully a balance can be struck to ensure that the confidentiality of the mother is maintained while also ensuring that as much information as possible can be given to the adoptive parents.  I also hope that a system can be devised which will encourage natural parents to see the advantage and contribution they can make to their child's life by allowing and facilitating information and a meeting.  The authorities should give proper counselling to both sides and ensure the situation is treated with the sensitivity and confidentiality required while giving as much information as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also be sensitive to the position of adoptive parents.  I know of a case where an adopted child of 16 was being approached by her natural mother <Col N="376" /> without the consent of the adoptive parents. The adoptive parents believed that the child was not prepared or ready for this and that it would be psychologically damaging, but that it could be facilitated at a later and more mature stage.  There are sensitivities involved and it is important that the area of counselling is examined; the Minister of State mentioned proper counselling for all the people involved.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis and others referred to voluntary agencies.  There are inconsistencies in the approaches of voluntary agencies.  I accept what Senator Doyle and others said about the excellent work done by voluntary agencies at different times.  They must be commended for that but I have some difficulties with the secrecy surrounding their work.  It may be valuable, but when work is done in secret one has problems with it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about how they place adoptions at the moment.  People, including married women, seem to have difficulty obtaining adoptions.  We do not know if they have difficulty, but it would appear from the way adoptions are placed that there may be a bias against certain people and certain occupations. I may be wrong about this, but the secrecy surrounding much of what is happening in the voluntary agencies creates this doubt in our minds.  We have questioned it in this House on previous occasions.  It would help the work of the voluntary agencies if there was more openness, understanding and consistency in the excellent work they do.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed three or four years ago about inheritance.  A difficulty arose in Wexford in a case known as the Stamp case.  An elderly farmer willed the family farm to his son and, if he did not have an issue, to a grandson of another child.  The son married two years after the father's death and after 11 years adopted two children.  When the will came to be clarified by the High Court, it decided that the original owner of the farm intended that the land would be transferred to a natural born child of the family and not the adopted child.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> A very small number of people in Ireland would be affected by that, but it is an important matter.  The word &ldquo;issue&rdquo; is always used in wills when somebody wants to pass property beyond the immediate generation.  We have asked on a few occasions that a small Bill would be introduced to clarify the meaning of the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo; or change the interpretation to include adopted children.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Senator McGennis on bringing forward this motion.  I fully support the thrust of what the Minister and Senator McGennis are endeavouring to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that this motion is before us this evening and that the Minister is with us.  I also congratulate Senator McGennis.  On numerous occasions she has raised this issue in this House and has contributed from her own personal experience in a special way to the debates we have had on adoption.  We have all benefited from the experience and knowledge she brings to this area.  It is to her credit that she has persisted.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that a contact register is being established to facilitate adopted persons and their birth parents, but like Senator Henry I would like to see it extended to include children who were fostered and children who were in industrial schools.  This was referred to by the Minister this evening.</P>
      <P>The second part of the motion asks that adopted persons have the basic right of access to their birth certificates. This issue seems to be agreed by everybody except the Department of Health which disagrees on the basis that there are birth mothers who are concerned about children whom they gave up for adoption a number of years ago gaining access to information they believed would be confidential.  I ask the Minister for Health whether there is great evidence of this or is it something that is perceived by the Department of Health to be a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is most important is the way in which information is given to people. We do not have a policy on this at the moment and as a result people, particularly <Col N="378" /> birth mothers, are concerned about inappropriate approaches from children trying to trace them.  By not having a policy and by not doing something about it we are in effect exposing birth mothers to being approached in this way.</P>
    <P>It is important that children have the basic right of access to their birth records.  That is paramount and it is something to which they should be entitled and which we should provide. The Minister has said he is taking legal advice on that matter and is awaiting a decision from the Supreme Court.  Until that has been clarified he believes it is not prudent to proceed with any legislation. However, that is a basic right. Counselling should be available for both parties.  This must be done in a proper way and not willy nilly.  We cannot expose the adopted person, the birth mother or the adoptive parents to difficulties they would have if this was not regulated.</P>
    <P>We must look at our society and our attitudes towards adoption in the past and children born outside of marriage. Thankfully, society has changed its attitudes over the years and the situation is different today.  However, since we are so concerned with the rights of children we should examine the situation seriously and not continue to put it on the long finger.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the collation of the National Archives material is going ahead and that resources have been allocated for it.  Those who have seen it have said there is excellent material available and it gives a lot more information than would normally be expected.  I hope that sufficient resources will be made available, as Senator McGennis' motion says, to bring about an early collation of these records with those of the Department of Education.  We need a policy on this matter and as long as we continue to have none, we are exposing birth mothers and adopted children to greater and unnecessary concerns.</P>
    <P>An independent appeals mechanism should be put in place and a mediation service is also necessary.  Many agencies are taking the view that their records <Col N="379" /> belong to them rather than the individual involved.  There should be more openness and co-operation.  Some of the voluntary agencies are acting like power brokers.  They should promote co-operation between themselves and the people with whom they are dealing rather then, as Senator Neville said, shrouding themselves in secrecy and none of us want that.  When we establish a contact register and if we provide access to birth certificates to adopted persons, resources should be put in place to support agencies like Barnardo's etc.  because they are dealing with the people involved.  They cannot do the work expected of them without the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>I fully support the sentiments expressed in Senator McGennis' motion and I urge the Minister to continue the work he outlined in his speech.  Within the not too distant future, we may see the demands in this motion being implemented and regulations and legislation introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I first want to thank all those Members who supported my motion.  I do not wish to appear to be nitpicking but I am not at all convinced that what the Minister said will lead to an immediate establishment of a contact register.  I would like to deal with a few of the points the Minister raised in his speech.  As we have time, perhaps the Minister could clarify them.</P>
      <P>All the items I referred to in my motion, specifically the right to a birth certificate database and the establishment of an independent appeals mechanism, have been put on the long finger by the Minister because of legal constraints. It appears there are no legal impediments in setting up the contact register.  However, I still want to refer to the Minister's speech because I do not want to leave this room thinking the Minister is about to set up a contact register when I fear that will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister mentioned a Circuit Court case, which has been referred to the Supreme Court, dealing with the right of children who were <Col N="380" /> informally adopted in this country prior to the enactment of adoption legislation to know the identity of their natural parents.  The Minister said that</P>
    <P>It would be prudent to await clarification of the constitutional and other legal issues surrounding the question of access to birth records before proceeding with any initiatives in this area.  Such considerations also apply to the establishment of a comprehensive database of relevant material from the National Archives, birth records and adoption societies. Issues which need to be considered in relation to such a database include, for example, application of the provisions of the Data Protection Act, 1988, which set out stringent restrictions....</P>
    <P>That is perfect.  If there are stringent restrictions, there is no problem. However, if there are not, the Minister has a problem.  Before announcing a contact register, the Minister says that</P>
    <P>Clarification of the legal and constitutional position is, of course, essential. I have no option but to wait until that clarification is available to me. However, I am determined to proceed as quickly as is possible in the circumstances to facilitate contact between adopted children and birth parents, where it is desired by both parties.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister waiting for that legal clarification before doing that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>

    <P>When will the register be set up and by whom?  The Minister is saying that <Col N="381" /> such a contact register will be established on an administrative basis pending clarification by the Supreme Court of the legal issues relating to access to birth records and that he will bring it before Government.  The Minister has already said that he would bring it before Government at least twice in the media but he has not yet done so.</P>

      <P>As much of this package has still not been brought before Government, why will it be brought in the context of child care proposals? We are talking about adults, not children.  Even the Minister's speech says that people over 18 years of age are allowed access to birth certificates in other countries.  I do not see the reason <Col N="382" /> for linking the introduction of a package of proposals on adults to a child care package.  The Minister has not done it yet.  When the child care proposals are ready, it will then be brought to Government.</P>
      <P>There is some sleight of hand here. This contact register is no nearer than it was 20 years ago when some of the groups in this House today began their campaigns.  The Minister was able to introduce legislation on the horrific situation with Chinese children.  No legislation on this matter has ever been brought into this House.  It is always as a result of High Court, Supreme Court and European cases taken by adoptees or natural parents.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for being present in the House to respond to this matter, which is of serious concern in rural areas.  Smaller farmers are baring the brunt of a series of hammer blows to farm viability.  That the latest blow is coming from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in the form of revised rules for temporary milk leasing is a disgrace.  Family farms, some of which depend on temporary leasing for up to half and more of their quota, are now in a super levy situation in this only the third month of the milk quota year.  Excuses about the outcome of the rule changes being unforeseen are unacceptable and are a damning indictment of the capacity of the Department to monitor the milk quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil wants the changes in the leasing regime reversed now.  The temporary milk leasing scheme has been in existence for a number of years and was available to milk suppliers with up to 30,000 gallons.  Many small farmers with herds of 15 to 20 cows availed of the scheme to top-up their small quotas. Last year the Minister issued a notice informing farmers that the guidelines would be changed.  He increased the quota to 35,000 gallons for 70 per cent of the milk pool, to 35,000-55,000 gallons for 20 per cent of the milk pool and in excess of 55,000 gallons or the remaining 10 per cent of the pool.  I do not understand why the quota should be increased for farmers with more than 55,000 gallons.  I know farmers with quotas of 70,000 gallons, which is the equivalent of 70 to 75 cows.  With improvements in cattle breeding, you could get a herd of 60 cows to produce 70,000 gallons.  The average milk yield of cows has been increased since the introduction of quotas in 1984.  An <Col N="384" /> increase of 1,000 gallons is of little use to these farmers.  However, small farmers with quotas of between 6,000 and 9,000 gallons have had their quotas reduced to 1,000 to 1,500 gallons and they are being put out of business.  That is because of the new regulations.</P>
    <P>Many young small farmers in my constituency had quotas of 10,000 to 12,000 gallons when they started in business and could secure an additional quota of up to 10,000 gallons through the temporary leasing scheme.  In recent weeks these farmers have been told they will get extra quotas of 2,500 gallons which means a reduction of £8,000 in their annual income at a time when they are trying to build up their businesses.  Small farmers have put a lot of expenditure to keep in line with EU regulations with regard to hygiene, etc.  to ensure that they will stay in business.</P>
    <P>This is a retrograde, insensitive, treacherous and barbaric decision and it is further evidence, if it was necessary, that the Minister is not in control or does not know what is happening in his Department.  If this is not the case, then the Government must have taken a decision to do away with small farmers. It is absolutely outrageous that such a decision could be taken by a Government which includes so-called socialists.</P>
    <P>In 1984, at the start of the milk quota regime, it was recognised that Ireland would have a case to seek an increase of quota at a future date.  We did get concessions at the time because Ireland was a peripheral and developing country, but there was also a promise that we would get a quota increase at a future date.  Both Italy and Greece have got significant quota increases.  The reluctance of this Government to pursue extra quota for Ireland is inexplicable. The Minister has been in Brussels many times dealing with various agricultural matters and I want him to pursue a proactive agenda for dairy farming.  We need to get increased quota from the EU.  What we have at the moment is crisis management.</P>

      <P>The Minister has no plans to tackle stagnancy in the dairy sector.  Young farmers have not got any chance to get a viable milk quota and the Minister of State is from a constituency that has many young farmers with small quotas.  An increase in national quota, directed specifically at new entrants and small holders, would do more for rural development than any other development measure.  A viable rural policy demands that we target small family farms and young farmers with a concerted development policy.  In an ICOS report on the temporary leasing scheme, the total pool for temporary leasing has not been reduced as had been projected by Department officials. It is only down a little.  The announcements that were made after the milk quota regroup, which the Minister referred to, do not help the small farmer sufficiently.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Kiely for giving me two minutes of his time.  I will not be long.  I support Senator Kiely. The situation would not be as serious but for the fact that since milk quotas came in, the small producer has been treated shabbily.  A man with a cheque book could buy the quotas he wanted and he might have 100 cows already.  It was very unfair from day one, but the latest blunder has added insult to injury. Then a Government spokesman and Government Deputies and Senators on local radio tried to justify it and passed it over to this review body in the past ten days.  The buck stops at the Minister's table.  It is a thundering disgrace the way this matter has been handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people, many of whom are young and starting out, have been treated shabbily.  I appeal to the Minister of State, who comes from a county with many small producers, to do what he can to urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to give these people some hope of making a decent living.  They were hoping against hope and now there is all this buck passing.  I hold the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, solely responsible for the way in which this matter was dealt.  This <Col N="386" /> country is cursed with review committees and commissions, but the buck stops at the Minister's desk.  If he did not take time to read it, he should consider his position because the people's livelihood is at stake.</P>
    <P>I received many telephone calls from people who were hoping they might get something.  What do they get?  They get contradictory statements in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> and on local radio, and attempts by Government Deputies and Senators to justify what is happening.  It is disgrace, and I appeal to the Minister of State to do something for the many young people who are caught.  They are as entitled to make a living as anybody else and to give their families a chance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this early opportunity to clarify the situation regarding the outcome of the first stage of this year's temporary leasing scheme and to outline the decision that I have taken on the operation of the second and third stages of the scheme.  On the outcome of the first stage of the scheme, there has been much dissatisfaction expressed that the inadequate level of allocations to individual smaller scale producers under that stage was due to the changes which were made in the operating rules for the allocation of the leased quota.</P>
      <P>The major change introduced on the recommendation of the milk quota review group in this year's scheme was that a fixed percentage of the pool was made available for allocation to certain categories of producers with the vast bulk of the pool, that is, 70 per cent, being made available for allocation to smaller scale producers.</P>
      <P>The changed rules for the allocation of the temporary leased quota were not a major factor in the reduction in the quantities allocated to individual small scale producers.  The primary factor was that the demand for temporary leased quota greatly exceeded the supply. While the quantity available for allocation amounted to 42 million gallons, the demand exceeded 130 million gallons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> Contrary to the comments that the temporary leasing scheme was not biased in favour of smaller scale producers, I can confirm that the quantity already allocated to such producers has increased from 23 million gallons last year to 29.6 million gallons in the current year.  This quantity represented 71 per cent of the total pool as against the 59 per cent of the pool which was allocated in the first stage of the scheme to the first priority category last year, so the category of smaller producer, to which the Senators referred, received more milk this year than they did last year under this system.</P>
    <P>When the Minister announced the first stage of the temporary leasing scheme last April he indicated that he would review the situation for the second and third stages based on the outcome of the first stage.  At my request, that review has now been urgently undertaken and completed by the milk quota review group.  The review group concluded that while smaller scale producers as a whole benefited to a greater extent this year, there were producers who depended significantly on temporary leasing to cover their excess production, and who were now facing difficulties because of the reduced allocations due to greater overall demand.</P>
    <P>Arising from the recommendations of the review group, the Minister has now decided to give total priority in the second and third stages of this year's temporary leasing scheme to producers with an available quota of under 35,000 gallons.  Furthermore, within this category total priority will be given to those producers who were allocated quota under the first priority category of the 1994-95 and 1995-96 schemes, that is, producers whose available quotas in those years were less than 30,000 gallons. These producers' entitlement to quota will be based on the average of their allocations in those two years, subject to sufficient quota being available. It is only when the needs of these producers have been fully satisfied that <Col N="388" /> applications from others in the smaller scale bracket will be considered.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that this decision will ease the situation of those smaller scale producers whose needs are greatest. However, I would have to urge caution in that the final allocation over the two stages will depend on the amount of quota available.  I would also urge all those producers who do not intend to fill their quota in the current year to participate in the temporary leasing scheme.  This will enable them to continue to utilise their land for other purposes. For my part, the Minister has asked our officials to intensify their examinations of land and quota transactions between individual producers to ensure they are valid.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important to emphasise that each individual producer is responsible for the management of his or her quota.  Furthermore, it is also important to emphasise that the extent to which any individual producer can benefit from any of these schemes is totally dependent on the amount of quota which becomes available for distribution and the demand for that quota at any given time.  We are also operating in an environment where demand under this scheme greatly exceeds supply. However, I want to reaffirm the Minister's intention to ensure that the operation of the milk quota system in Ireland will continue to be biased in favour of smaller scale producers.  For example, the Minister has recently announced the introduction of a further scheme subsidising the purchase of quota by small scale producers under this year's restructuring scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister intends to review the outcome of the second stage of this year's scheme in September to see whether any further modification is called for in its third and last phase next December.  I thank the milk quota review group and the Minister for responding so rapidly to the dissatisfaction among the smaller producers. The news should be welcomed by the Senators.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27 June 1996.</P>
