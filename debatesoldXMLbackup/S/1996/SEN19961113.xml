      <P>I have notice from Senator Fahey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for the Environment if he will meet a deputation from the Knocknacarragh combined residents association, Galway, with a view to providing £1 million to Galway Corporation for the Western Distributor Road.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for the Environment to provide special funding to Dublin Corporation for the reconstruction of Beach Road, Strand Road, Sandymount, Dublin 4.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide a new classroom, toilet block and ancillary accommodation at Kilmurry national school, Ennis, County Clare; and if she is aware of the very real necessity of having the finance for this project included in the capital building programme.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Kelly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to outline the reason so few agricultural projects are being funded under the Leader II programme.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Farrelly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education if funding will be made available this year to ensure that the extension to St. Oliver Plunkett's school, Oldcastle, County Meath, can go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senator Fahey's and Senator Doyle's <Col N="438" /> matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2 and 3.  Item 1 will be taken from after the Order of Business until 6 p.m.  Item 2 will be taken without debate, unless someone wishes to speak, because there is little involved and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has already discussed it in some detail.  Item 3 &mdash; statements on the proposed legislation on food safety &mdash; has been included in response to requests from all sides for consultation on and input into that area.  I propose 15 minutes per speaker.  This item will not conclude if the two hours allocated this evening are filled, it will remain on the Order Paper for further contributions.  The sos will be from 1 p.m. until 2.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>I had hoped to take the Milk Regulations Bill this week but it has not completed its passage through the other House, as I had been informed it would, so it is not possible to deal with it today. It will have to take a place further down the queue.</P>
      <P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges had a long discussion on the constitutional report, with particular reference to the role of the Seanad.  It has been agreed that we should have a fairly structured debate on this House so that the considered views of Members can be expressed and will be on record when the committee meets.  In consultation with all sides of the House, I hope to start that debate in the next few weeks and to see how it will be structured. We will probably have weekly discussions on it between now and the end of this session.  It is important that Members be given notice that this debate is coming up and that Members who have direct experience of the strengths, shortcomings and potential of this House should be able to make their views known, otherwise the process will be left to outside experts and we would have a grievance.  It is in order to ensure full participation that this debate has been organised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Leader said and my colleague Senator Fitzgerald, who made the request last week, will respond to him.  The House will welcome an opportunity to contribute. As the Leader rightly said, there is tremendous experience on all sides and if there is to be a review of the House I welcome the fact that those who have been elected here will be afforded an opportunity to state their views.</P>
      <P>What are the Leader's intentions for the week of the bail referendum?  As all parties are supporting a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote, perhaps he would consider different sittings to allow those of us who are actively campaigning an opportunity to be further involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business last Thursday I mentioned the news which had just emerged <Col N="439" /> about the Department of Justice.  Those issues have taken a particular course in the Lower House and if the need for a debate or statements in this House should arise from the Dáil motion of no confidence, I ask the Leader to provide time next week.  In the context of the decisions announced in the Taoiseach's speech yesterday, the Whips may feel the issue is worth discussing.</P>
    <P>A request for a debate on the estimates for local authorities has been made several times.  We have heard in the corridors of this House and read in interviews in newspapers &mdash; for example, the Tánaiste's interview on 6 October in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>&mdash; that a radical reform of service charges is needed.  Those of us involved in the preparation of the estimates of local authorities find that the estimate may need to be radically changed when the Minister for Finance introduces his budget in January and sets out the amount provided for local authority funding.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to state his position on local authority funding because it is my view that the estimates are impossible to achieve within the 21 days statutory notice as there is no certainty where and how local authorities are to be funded in the new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Níl deacracht againn le ordaithe an lae.  I warmly welcome the proposal to have a debate on the role of the Seanad.  I ask the Leader &mdash; I know he is making Herculean efforts in this direction &mdash; to improve the efficiency with which we transact our business by giving as much notice as possible of the date on which that debate will be held.  Is the Leader in a position to give a response to the question raised by Senator Quinn last week as to when we can have a debate on the White Paper on science technology and innovation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the indication from the Leader that we are to have a debate on the Seanad.  I welcome the fact that it is to be a structured debate and that there will be discussion among the various parties as to how it should be organised.  I also support Senator Wright's call for a discussion on local government and its financing.  There were several calls over the last couple of weeks about that and the Leader has indicated that he will organise such a debate.</P>
      <P>On the last point raised by Senator Lee, I would welcome a debate on the White Paper on science and technology.  I am sure Senator Daly joins with me this morning in welcoming the announcement of 750 jobs in Dell&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?  We have lost the Gilogue jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to that in a moment. A few weeks ago, Senator Daly raised the question of the loss of jobs in Verbatim and I too am concerned.  He made the point that local <Col N="440" /> public representatives had a role to play.  That is true but whether we are talking about good or bad news, their role is small when it comes to decisions by multinational companies.  We too are concerned about the American Power Corporation.  We do not know for sure yet whether the jobs in south-east Clare will go ahead.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for a wider debate on science and technology and on regional specialisation in relation to job creation, specifically in relation to multinationals.  Last week I attended a conference where delegates from a number of European countries raised that issue.  I believe it would be useful to broaden the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my Leader's call for a debate on local authority funding.  The estimates of my local authority in Donegal are now being considered.  I will not make a speech about these estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call that the debate on local authority funding take place as soon as possible.  Most Members of this House are elected by local authority members and it behoves us to be seen to be concerned about their problems.  I wish to highlight one such problem. The estimate states that &ldquo;£100,000 will be available for a Ballybofey and Stranorlar sewerage scheme&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That sewerage scheme was announced in 1995 from INTERREG funding of £1,900,000; it was announced about ten times during the Donegal by-election in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>INTERREG funding of £1.9 million was announced in 1995 and according to the local estimate, a sum of £100,000 has been approved.  This is not enough to mark out the site.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When can we have a debate on the funding of local authorities?  There is no point in having that debate when the Estimates have been finalised.  Confusion prevails in rural Ireland today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This year has been designated as the European Year of Life Long Learning.  In that context, will the Leader impress upon the Minister for Education the need to establish in the forthcoming legislation a statutory body to deal with adult education?  One third of people in the EU find it very difficult to make the transition from school to employment.  This matter must be looked at and I appeal to the Minister to set up a body to look after that facet of education.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader also impress upon the Minister the importance of providing extra funding for the ALCE budget, that is, the adult literacy and community education schemes run by vocational education committees throughout the country? They do marvellous work with limited funds.  I appeal to the Minister to provide extra funding in the Estimates for this section of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the indication that we will have a debate on the Seanad.  It is timely for this House to discuss its future composition, role and so forth in the light of the various comments and reports issued about it.  Some of those comments have been quite irritating, such as the suggestion by Deputy Jim Mitchell that my constituency should be abolished, with which I am naturally scarcely inclined to agree.  It is important for us to be involved in the consultation.  Most of us have received letters from Deputy Jim O'Keeffe seeking our views.  I had intended to send him copies of a previous debate on reform of the Seanad but it would be far better if I could send him an updated one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Senator O'Toole, has consistently mentioned over the last month his irritation at traffic being held up by motorcades for European bureaucrats.  I did not join in at that stage but I would now like to make the House aware that this does not only involved Eurocrats. Last week I was prevented from attending a vote of the House because it took me an hour to get <Col N="442" /> from North Great Georges Street to Leinster House.  I thought it was because of a bomb but it was the premiere of the &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo; film. Whatever about European parliamentarians, it is a little odd that the main thoroughfare of a capital city was blocked off for several hours simply to facilitate a film premiere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a matter for the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris should not be such a spoilsport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Following in the wake of my good friend and colleague, Senator McGowan, I regret to tell the House that I have no update on the sewerage system in North Great Georges Street, but I will do my best to amend that for the Order of Business next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope item I will conclude today.  The Minister has accepted a number of amendments for Report Stage.  In view of this, should there be a sos between Committee Stage and Report Stage?</P>
      <P>On the question of the proposed debate on the review of the Constitution, is it the intention to consider solely the Seanad or the entirety of the report?  We all received letters from Deputy Jim O'Keeffe requesting that we submit our comments in writing; he suggested a deadline for the end of the month.  This is too little time. Perhaps it should be extended as far as the Christmas recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education attend the House to debate the position regarding the young disabled, especially in rural areas?  The debate should cover the funding and staffing of special classes and transport for the disabled in scattered rural areas which is causing a big problem for parents.  The question of domiciliary care allowance, entitlement to medical cards and tax free allowances for the disabled has been neglected and we should debate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister for the Environment attend the House to explain service charges because the situation regarding estimates around the country is a shambles and the matter must be resolved.  We cannot have members of the parties in Government telling the people in cities that there will be no service charges while others must impose charges to carry out the functions of the local authorities.  Surely there is a responsibility on the Minister here?</P>
      <P>I compliment the Taoiseach on his vote of confidence in the Minister for Justice by emasculating the Department of Justice and making it a Department that deals with land registry and mitigation of fines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Health the figures produced by the Western Health Board this week indicating that 20,000 people are on waiting lists in its area?  This represents a crisis in Counties Galway, Roscommon and Mayo and it is a matter the Minister must address shortly.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on mental health was published 12 months ago but the Minister and the Minister of State have failed to bring it to the House although I have requested a debate for the past ten months.  It is time the Minister debated it or introduced legislation.  The White Paper identifies problems in the mental health&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been seeking a debate for ten months.  Mental treatment and mental health are dealt with under legislation that has been in existence for 50 years.  The Minister has the White Paper on mental health and it is time it was discussed.  Will the Leader arrange for a debate in the House or ask that legislation be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Members in welcoming the Leader's announcement that the House will have an opportunity soon to debate its role.  This is a necessary development.  There was constructive debate in 1991 during which positive proposals were made, but only a few were eventually implemented.  There was a more recent discussion on the role of the House and the level of interest at that time was far below that which prevailed in the earlier discussion.  It is our fault if we have allowed outside experts to comment on the performance of the House.  We live in an evolving society and we should measure and recommend the adaptations, progress and changes which should be made in the House.  A debate on the role of the House is timely and anybody with knowledge of its performance will recognise that its role over the years has been effective and honourable.</P>
      <P>Three and a half years ago the House unanimously agreed to call on the Department of Enterprise and Employment to review the Copyright Act, 1963.  This decision was accepted by the then Minister, Deputy Séamus Brennan. Will the Leader outline what progress has been made on that undertaking to the House?</P>
      <P>The debate on the single currency cannot be soon enough because business is being distracted by confusing signals from so called experts in this field.  The net effect is that business has sat back and failed to prepare for what will be inevitable between 1 January 1997 and 1 January 1999.</P>

If water charges are abolished, we hope we will get full credit for the level of charges which were assessed for the county and that we will not end up carrying the can.  This is a hot issue and I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to state whether he will abolish water charges.  It does not affect my authority this year because it has adopted its estimates.</P>

However, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, invited Fianna Fáil to sit down with him to draw up a radical proposal to restructure local authorities, including their financing but it declined.  If Fianna Fáil Senators want a debate, perhaps this time they will help solve the problem.  This Government will not take any action which will jeopardise the interests of this State at local or national level.</P>

Another problem has arisen with the firm of Reynolds and Company, who are investment brokers.  This too was in the newspapers.  I ask the Leader to allow a debate on this problem that would lead to legislation.  The problem is twofold.</P>
      <P>First, there are insurance brokers.  Some of them have bonding but a number who were acting as insurance brokers have moved into the investment areas and they are investing large sums of money.</P>

      <P>That is why I hoped I would be allowed to discuss this.  I am seeking a debate to see how those involved in insurance brokerage conduct their business and how those who invest with them can be happy about their investment. There are two firms already in difficulty and those involved in this business are anxious that their good name is upheld.  It is also essential to have proper safeguards for the general public if they are investing in these firms.</P>

I ask the Leader to have the Minister come into the House to debate the recommendations in that report, if she has not lost it.</P>
      <P>Second, on the Defence Forces, there were recent newspaper headlines suggesting there were not enough Army personnel to serve on UN duties.  When he comes into the House the Minister for Defence should address the issue of women soldiers who have been refused permission to serve on UN duties.  There seems to be a contradiction there.</P>

Approximately 35 per cent of milk is produced by dormant milk producers, that is, people who do not keep cows, and that number is rising.  At the same time, young people are <Col N="448" /> paying 50p a gallon for the producing milk.  This affects the consumers.  They are paying more for milk than they should because of all the systems that have been built in.  If the quota system collapsed the effects would be worse than the BSE crisis because many who have invested heavily in dairy hygiene would have serious problems.  We should discuss that in this House because the situation is getting worse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support calls for the Minister for the Environment to bring forward his proposals on local government funding.  I am glad this has been raised because the county manager of Leitrim County Council is attempting to introduce an extra service charge on sewerage as it does not have sufficient finance.  Councillors on all sides of the political divide are confused and doubt whether there is a logical reason for allowing the county manager to introduce this charge in light of the current debate.  Confusion will be widespread until the Minister for the Environment brings forward proposals, even if they are only interim proposals.  I appreciate it is a complex issue but if he has the proposals ready, he should come here first as Members of this House are in closer contact with county councils than those in the other House and there will be a much more positive debate here.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Howard's call for copyright reform.  Will the Leader ask the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, not to forget the copyright Bill despite his heavy legislative load?  He gave commitments here in July and said that he was aware of the concern in the industry.</P>
      <P>There is much concern about the lack of availability of Teilifís na Gaeilge despite the hype associated with its introduction.  It is increasingly difficult to obtain its signal because of the location of transmitters throughout the country. Will the Leader convey this concern to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht?  He may be able to initiate a scheme if there is a necessity to purchase new aerials whereby a subsidy could be introduced so that the majority of the general public will receive this excellent service.</P>

      <P>The House will sit during the week of the bail referendum, but if Members wish to have time off to canvass that can be arranged between the Whips.  I will discuss the possibility of a further debate on the Department of Justice next week with the Leader of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators raised the question of local authority financing.  I promised a debate on it and I will try to have a date for it tomorrow or at the beginning of next week at the latest.  I agree that the points raised are valid and in some cases urgent.  The debate on the role of the Seanad has been generally welcomed and I will give Senators notice on a timetable for that.  Senator Fitzgerald raised the question of a debate on the Constitution.  That will happen in the new year and not before the end of this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" /> I will arrange a date for a debate on the White Paper on science and technology.  I will convey Senator McDonagh's points to the Minister as they are worth discussing.  Senator Norris, as ever, took a broad view on the role of Seanad reform and I am glad he will not be giving the House a weekly update on the sewerage scheme in North Great George's Street.  Senator Fitzgerald had a question on item 1.  It is proposed to finish Committee Stage today and Report Stage is provisionally scheduled for 27 November.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald also raised the question of the timing of our debate on Seanad reform.  It would be right that the contributions sought should not be made until after we have had time to reflect on and discuss the issues, and I will convey that view to Deputy O'Keeffe.  There will be no Minister present obviously because it is a matter for ourselves but it might be appropriate, with the agreement of other parties, to invite Deputy O'Keeffe to sit in on that debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Calnan raised the question of young disabled.  It would be an important subject for a debate and if I can, I will facilitate him.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran raised the question of local authority funding and I will have a date for that debate.  He again raised the question of a debate on mental health.  If the legislation is not about to appear fairly soon, a debate on the White Paper would be reasonable and I will try to arrange that.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard raised the question of the Copyright Act, 1963, and I will seek information on that matter.  As I said before, the debate on the currency issue is provisionally scheduled for 4 December.  Senator Farrell's proposal for a short debate on alcohol abuse is worthwhile and a series of short debates on issues of this kind would be useful.  I will see what can be done about that.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly wants a debate on industrial policy.  That is reasonable.  Perhaps he can find a suitable form of wording for it.  He also wants a debate on current developments within the Defence Forces.  I will contact the Minister to see if that can be arranged.  I am sure it can.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright raised the question of brokerage and the investment industry.  I would be very happy to make my party's next Private Members' Time available to the Senator so he will have plenty of time to explore the issues and get answers.</P>
    <P>Senators are raising important topics which are worthy of debate on a regular basis.  At the Committee on a Procedure and Privileges, I may be able to find some procedure to facilitate short one hour debates on important issues, such as the matter Senator McGennis raised.  The report on domestic violence and sexual abuse is worth a short focused debate and I will see if we can find some procedure whereby such debates can be taken on a regular basis because these reports should be debated in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> There will be a debate in the next couple of weeks on the dairy industry.  I expect it will be fairly wide ranging and Senator Townsend could raise his points then.</P>
    <P>On the question of the signal for Teilifís na Gaeilge, Senator Mooney is in a good position to raise that directly with the people who are responsible, RTÉ, but I will convey the Senator's disquite to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 30 relates to the transfer of staff of the Minister to boards.  Will the Minister clarify the position of the staff of the Genealogical Office in the context of this section? I raised this matter on a previous occasion and perhaps the House might benefit from the Minister's elucidation on the historical context of the Department of Education's involvement in this regard.  From further research, I discovered that those involved are effectively library staff.  Is there any prior claim by the Department of Education on Genealogical Office staff?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be useful were I to clarify the purpose of the section which does not address the issue in relation to the parallel thrown up by the nomination of the Department of Education by Government decision as the administrative Department.  Section 30 empowers the Minister to designate members of his staff, not currently employed exclusively as staff of the National Museum and National Library, to become members of the staff of the board on the basis of conditions not less favourable than before the transfer, except as might later be agreed otherwise, and on the basis of continuance of the <i>status quo</i> in relation to superannuation benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a person who is not working full-time in the two areas.  This section provides that they can become a member of the board on foot of the conditions to which I referred.  I met the staff of the library and the museum to discuss how the Bill would affect them.  In that context, I stress the relevance of the phrase &ldquo;on the basis of conditions not less favourable than before the transfer, except as might later be agreed otherwise, and on the basis of continuance of the <i>status quo</i> in relation to superannuation benefits&rdquo;.  This important section provides a facility for general Civil Service staff who might wish to remain staff of the National Museum and National Library following their establishment and it covers clerical and administrative staff, whose numbers are very small.  It is envisaged <Col N="451" /> that this provision will be utilised only when the agreement of the person proposed to be designated has been obtained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to support staff, I understand that, apart from those who are strictly staff of the Genealogical Office, this section also covers two clerical assistants involved in typing, secretarial and reception work.  These people are usually recruited from the general service and often return to the parent Department after a brief period, which in this instance is probably the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. I further understand the present incumbents have worked in the office for three years and six months, respectively.</P>
      <P>Work involving access, cloakroom, security and other matters is dealt with by the science and art attendant grade.  Does responsibility for this grade come within the remit of the Minister's Department?  I understand there are seven such staff and each is rostered for a variety of duties throughout the library.  Who will be employing the support staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me clarify by means of analogy.  I was a statutory lecturer in political science and sociology of the National University of Ireland and I worked in University College Galway.  I worked within a particular building and department at UCG but I had a specific employer.  In the event that the Senator misunderstood the position, we are discussing library staff.  No one is exclusively employed by the Genealogical Office.  It is library staff who work there &mdash; there is no argument on that point. The staff are employed to work exclusively in the library so no professional staff will transfer under section 29.</P>
      <P>Under section 30 the Minister will designate clerical and administrative staff.  The professional staff in the Genealogical Office would transfer automatically and the clerical staff would be designated to transfer it they wish or if they are on loan.  The categories the Senator mentioned are covered and the provisions will lead to an orderly and reasonable arrangement by agreement.</P>

      <P>Section 31 agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 32 refers to superannuation.  Subsection (6) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No superannuation benefit shall be granted by a Board nor shall any other arrangements be entered into by the Board for the provision of such a benefit to or in respect of a member <Col N="452" /> of staff of the Board otherwise than in accordance with a scheme under this section or with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Will the board be able to make a special payment with the consent of the Minister?  Subsection (6) seems to indicate such a possibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (6) attempts to achieve two competing principles &mdash; first, consistency in relation to the public service superannuation provisions, the role of the Minister and the Minister for Finance and, second, flexibility.  In respect of the first principle, subsection (6) provides that the superannuation benefits shall only be granted by a board on the basis of schemes approved under the section or as otherwise approved by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The reference to &ldquo;otherwise approved by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo; is a new provision for legislation such as this.  Hitherto is was assumed that all pensions would be through schemes laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas but this may be seen as a way of reaching specific deals with members of staff, particularly senior staff, in particular situations without Oireachtas involvement.  It is to achieve the second principle of flexibility in particular cases which might be negotiated for reasons which could not be envisaged by legislation.  It will allow for exceptional cases where special circumstances have to be taken into account, for example, hardship or unusual circumstances &mdash; I do not wish to give specific or personal details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to discuss personal cases.  I referred to clerical, professional, administrative and other staff.  In the nature of movement between jobs in one institutions or in a slightly different professional capacity in another institution and the acquisition of credit and protection, including health protection in terms of superannuation, circumstances may arise which should be taken into account.  A person may give excellent service but may, for an unusual reason, fall foul of a particular condition. The advantage of this provision is that while it is expressed that the schemes in general should be consistent and be approved by the Minister in the usual way, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, it allows that if the board heard a particular case and wished to enter into negotiations on a reasonable basis, it would have the power and flexibility to do so, subject to approval, which is only right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>

      <P>I want to be careful about this. It is not a principle; the principle is that the superannuation scheme will be approved by the Minister in consultation with and with the approval of the Minister for Finance.  Having said that, the board will be able to listen to special cases.  It is an exception rather than a principle and the board, with the consent of the Minister, will be able to respond to exceptional cases based on hardship or compassion.</P>

      <P>It does allow flexibility. However, I want to make it clear that it will be the exception rather than the rule.  It would be inoperable if this were seen as a discretion which stood as an alternative to the operation of superannuation schemes.  It allows flexibility to respond to exceptional human cases.</P>

      <P>We are all sadly aware of publicised cases where civil servants, for whatever reason, have felt that the system has not responded fairly or sympathetically to their situations.  This is why I have asked the Minister to go down this road and I am glad that he has had this opportunity to clarify the meaning of this section.  I hope it would act as a benchmark for future legislation regarding civil servants.  The system does not always work in their favour and, because of a lack of flexibility in the past, people have felt a grievous wrong was done to them.  I do not wish to go any further on this but I felt it important that the Minister and I should tease out the implications of this subsection.  I am grateful to him.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 56:</P>
      <P>In page 25, subsection (5) (b), line 15, to delete &ldquo;6&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;3&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am attempting to steal the clothes of my colleague Senator Quinn who, on occasions such as this, refers to what he calls best practice.  These amendments are of a technical nature relating to the timing of publication of accounts and the financial obligations which are being imposed on the boards.  In that context I would be interested in the Minister's response.  I appreciate that I am reducing his proposals in the case of publication of annual accounts from six months to three months.  I am also suggesting a tightening up of the language on subsection (5) (c) which says that &ldquo;A copy of the accounts and auditor's report thereon shall be presented to the members of the Board and to the Minister as soon as may be...&rdquo; I am asking that this would not be later than 12 months after the end of the financial year.</P>
      <P>The reason for this is self-evident: in the commercial sector these accounts are made available in the shortest possible time after the end of the current financial year.  I appreciate that there has been an intellectual argument about the altruistic nature of these institutions and that their integrity in that regard should not be attacked.  However, we are attempting to put these boards on a semi-commercial footing and they are being given sweeping powers.  Section 33 refers to their ability to borrow money and we are attempting to not only focus their minds on the issues at hand, but we are also expecting them to raise finance and generate income for themselves.  Whether they like it or not, and some of them may not like it, they are moving into the commercial arena and I see no reason they should not be required to conform to the norm in that environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

      <P>I support these amendments.  I have raised this matter during debates on previous Bills.  I can never understand why, in today's computerised business world, we have to wait six months for accounts and reports. Throughout the year we receive reports from organisations dated a year or 18 months earlier. This is ridiculous.  When the small airport in County Kerry calls its annual general meeting it presents its report for the year.  Every pound, shilling and penny is accounted for at the end of the year.  My brother has a business in Dingle and, at the press of a button, he knows his debits and credits through a computerised accounting system.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House, have been very generous in our support of this Bill.  As Senator Mooney suggested &mdash; and the staff in the relevant institutions may not like this, but, in our opinion, this is the normal and correct procedure &mdash; the reports should be available as soon as possible. The Minister has been generous in accepting amendments and I urge him to accept these as well.</P>

      <P>I support the approach adopted by Senator Mooney and Senator Fitzgerald.  I would be strongly supportive of reducing the timescale for reporting from six to three months. This conforms with best management practice for this type of report.  We put off compiling reports until the last possible moment because it intrudes on the daily rush of business.  By far the best way is to compile it as one goes along and keep in mind during the year that a report must be furnished close to the end of the year, rather than allowing everything to pile up.  If the deadline is brought closer to the end of the year, the attention of those responsible for the report will be more focused on the need to issue it quickly. That strengthens the board <i>vis-a-vis</i> the director and <i>vice versa.</i>  In terms of good management practice, a three month deadline will assist not just those outside the body to know what is happening but also those inside to organise their affairs in a more focused manner.</P>

      <P>The Minister may be surprised to hear that I sympathise and empathise with the principle of Senator Mooney's amendments.  At this time of year we are receiving public sector annual reports for 1995; sometimes they are issued up to a year and a half after the expiry of the period concerned.  That is by no means satisfactory and, at a time when we want greater accountability, this position must be examined.  The Minister may not be able to accept these amendments but the principle must be pursued by Departments and semi-State bodies as a matter of national policy.  A retail, commercial or manufacturing outlet could not conduct its business effectively in this manner. The very Departments, such as the Department of Finance, that demand accounts from businesses do not do what they want the private sector to do.  The Minister may not be able to accept the amendments as worded but the principle must be taken on board in the public sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me to decide that point and I will try to restrain myself from dealing with amendment No. 59 in anticipation of our discussion.  Senators have shown a great anxiety that the cultural institutions be run efficiently and an even greater sensitivity for their character, so they will appreciate that two kinds of report are envisaged in the amendments.  I will continue with my pragmatic response but let me make one prefatory remark.  Both this Government and its predecessor were anxious to tackle the <Col N="456" /> unacceptable practice whereby semi-State bodies would report up to two years late.  The Government is dealing with it and the reporting is now fairly up to date.  It is not a case of public sector <i>versus</i> private sector.  In my experience, many private sector reports are less concerned with giving information than promoting the image of the company.  There is a huge variation in the amount of hard information, even as regards the accounts and the relative emphasis given to a profit and loss account and a balance sheet.</P>
      <P>These institutions produce two types of report, one on matters of finance, made to the Minister and to the Comptroller and Auditor General, and one on activities.  I appreciate that a report on activities would contain more information about policy than would a financial report.  One problem is that, if the time for submitting the report is shortened, people may meet the deadline with an inadequate report whereas if the time allowed is reasonable and standardised, the dead line can be met with a good report.  One does not want to defeat the intention by allowing too short a time.</P>
      <P>I can accept that reports of accounts and of the auditors should be presented to the board and the Minister within a set time frame as suggested by Senator Mooney.  He suggests replacing the words &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; with a definite period.  I will return on Report Stage with a form of words to replace the current provision.</P>
      <P>However, that exhausts my generosity and I am inclined to retain the period of six months rather than change it to three months.  I suggest this period because it also applies to the National Treasury Management Agency and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, both of which deal with urgent matters.  Even the Irish Horseracing Authority, which is on the periphery of cultural activity, is allowed six months in which to produce a report.  I suggest that six months meets the requirements.</P>
      <P>I am disposed to accept the spirit of amendment No. 57.  I accept the phrase in the Bill is too general and I will return to it on Report Stage.  However, I am anxious to keep six months rather than three months for another practical reason, which touches on a point made by Senator Fitzgerald.  If the accounts were available on new technology a three month deadline could be easily met but that is not the case in these institutions, although I do not say that they should not move to that position.  I would prefer to have a good report after six months rather than a rushed report after three months.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the discussion on amendment No. 59, we have accepted that the Genealogical Office is part of the National Library and is recognised and regarded within it.  Therefore, it would not make much sense to have a separate report, as the office's report should be part of the overall report of the body which has administrative responsibility for it.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's concession on amendment No. 57, which relates to section 34(5)(c) and states:</P>
      <P>A copy of the accounts and the auditor's report thereon shall be presented to the members of the Board and to the Minister as soon as may be [.]</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes that &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; would be changed to &ldquo;not later than 12 months after the end of the financial year&rdquo;.  The Minister accepts the spirit of that amendment.</P>
      <P>He made a distinction, of which Members are aware, between financial accounts and policy reports.  Section 34(5)(a) states:</P>
      <P>The accounts of a Board for each year shall be prepared in such form and manner as may be specified by the Minister...</P>
      <P>while section 34(5)(b) states:</P>
      <P>The accounts shall be submitted as soon as may be but not later than 6 months after the end of the financial year [.]</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify this?  Neither paragraph appears to refer to a policy document as such but to accounts and auditor's reports, in other words, a financial statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope this is constitutionally correct.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has recently prepared a report on this and I have a personal view on what appears in reports I have read over the years.  For instance, the report of a semi-State body may mention travel expenses. When a return is made at the end of a year, if there is a difference between the amount vouched and the amount paid this shows up in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report as a matter for which there must be an explanation.  It may be best practice to send in vouchers or receipts on a daily or a weekly basis, although I think a certain type of mind is attracted by such a system and it is not necessarily the same frame of mind that is moved to excellence in aesthetic or cultural matters.  I did not mean to mislead the Senator.  He was right when he said I had to make my point about policy because it is a cultural institution.  The Senator is right to say that other issue are involved, but why should the library and the museum have to satisfy the Comptroller and Auditor General within three months when even financial agencies have six months to do so?  I thought six months was a more reasonable period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that I was inclined to be pragmatic and frank in any legislation I am introducing.  I am not interested in putting in things for gestural reasons.  It is much more important to put in a reasonable time period and make it happen rather than to impose an excessive statutory burden.  I am open on this amendment.  I accepted amendment No. 57 because, as worded, it is too loose.  I will come back to it on Report Stage but I would prefer to keep to six months, even if only <Col N="458" /> to ensure consistency between these institutions and the others I mentioned.</P>

      <P>The Minister and I are not all that far apart; millimeters rather than inches.  I was attempting to ensure that the new boards would be aware from the beginning that they have obligations other than directly to the cultural institutions over which they will have power.  There are wider issues of public policy here and certain obligations will be placed on them.  As Senator Fitzgerald, Senator Lee and Senator Taylor-Quinn said, we have all had the experience of semi-State bodies which have not adhered to deadlines for publication and when they eventually arrived they were irrelevant and out of date.  I will not press the first amendment in light of the Minister's comments.</P>
      <P>In the context of expenses, I presume the Minister means that the three month period might not allow sufficient time for receipts to be forwarded.  I am not being mischievous but the Minister is aware that Members of the Oireachtas forfeit expenses not claimed within 90 days; that is a three month rather than a six month period. I could not help thinking about it when the Minister was speaking.  However, I take his point. It is a different scenario and a different environment.  The Minister might use his good offices to extend that claim period for Members to six months in line with all the other institutions.  In relation to my other amendment, I am grateful to the Minister and await his wording.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 59:</P>
      <P>In page 25, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Minister shall request the Board of the National Library to prepare and submit a report in writing in both the English and Irish language by the Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer on the activities of his or her office at the end of each year and the Minister shall cause copies thereof to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware where I am coming from in this regard.  This might be referred to as the thread that has been running through this debate in relation to the status of the Genealogical Office and of the Chief Herald's Office.  It is an attempt to emphasise the uniqueness of the office and to convey yet again to the Minister the concerns which have been expressed outside of this House by those working in the genealogical and manuscripts area.</P>
      <P>I reflected for some time on whether I should place this amendment before the House because I was aware of its implications.  I felt it was important to have it debated at least and to put forward a view on it.  I read the reports of the National Library over the last number of years.  I appreciate that the reports &mdash; and this goes back to the Minister's earlier comments about the distinction between accounts and policy documents &mdash; are not only about the activities of the previous year but about the mission statement, future policy and so on.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the activities of the Genealogical Office and the Office of the Chief Herald.  If a separate report cannot be produced, perhaps there could be an addendum to the existing report or an assurance from the Minister that the board would be directed to ensure sufficient reference to the Genealogical Office and the Office of the Chief Herald in its annual report.  The Minister has now established the separateness of the Genealogical Office and the position of Chief Herald as a branch of the National Library and it is the only branch of the library which is now covered in legislation.  No other area of the library is included in statute.  As the position of Chief Herald and the Genealogical Officer and by implication his or her office is now a separate branch within the library, it seems to me that the separateness of the activities of the Chief Herald and the Genealogical Officer should be recognised in the annual report rather than having it listed as yet another activity of the National Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that there was a separate report by the Chief Herald prior to this. If it did not exist prior to this, why should we ask for it now?

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>My main concern is the quality of service to the users.  I assume that in the annual report of the activities of the National Library there would be a specific section on the genealogical branch.  That would be essential and would, I hope, go some way towards meeting the concerns expressed.  A specific section on the genealogical dimension of the library's activities is necessary in its annual report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can ask the board to ensure that in its report there will be an appropriate section dealing with the work of the Chief Herald and the Genealogical Office.  However, I want to make one point perfectly clear so that there will be clarity where confusion and some mischief has prevailed, which is that the report is the report of the board.  The director of the library appointed by the board is in charge.  A person allocated an office and a function is responsible to that director and does not have an autonomous existence whereby he or she can tell the director to &ldquo;get lost&rdquo;&mdash; it is my habit to speak plainly.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there is a structure of accountability, administration and reporting.  For the first time, the Office of the Chief Herald will be properly and legally recognised, and we have negotiated on the best way to do that.  There is appropriate recognition of the Genealogical Office.  They are perfectly mentioned in the primary statute.  No other description of it is truthful.</P>
      <P>Having taken care of the office and its functions, it is perfectly reasonable for Senators to request an assurance from me that there will be recognition of that in the annual report.  I give them that assurance.  The amendment seeks to have a separate report.  If I accepted the amendment and there were a separate report in addition to the report of the board, one would have fallen into the trap set by those who want confusion to continue for their own strange reasons.  The confusion has been ended.  The office's functions and the professionalism, quality and standard of the work are recognised and I assure Senators it will be an identifiable part of the report.  A separate report would be an invitation to continue to have a mixture of bogus history and archaic argument masquerading as fact.  That is now over because it is in everybody's interest to have clarity.</P>

That will encourage others who might not appreciate its significance to become more aware of it.  I take it that the Minister is willing to convey to the board of the National Library our understanding that it should be an appropriate and substantial section, although I do not want to say how many pages or words it should contain.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to my colleagues and the Minister.  I believe I have largely achieved what I attempted to establish by tabling this amendment.  I would like to go a little further than Senator Lee, although our shared aspiration is for an identifiable separate section within the report.  Annual reports are becoming increasingly elaborate.  They are so creative in their presentation and content that they must be aiming to win awards.  They are sometimes over elaborate, which returns to the Minister's point or obfuscation; there is a great deal of shadow but not much substance in these highly colourful reports which are produced at enormous expense. I am staggered by the amount spent on the printing of annual reports, mainly in the commercial sector.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, we could turn that to our advantage. When the Minister issues something short of a directive to the board as part of its guidelines, could he ask it to inject a certain degree of creativity and to enhance the presentation and content of this section in an unrivalled way?  I am reluctant to use the word &ldquo;majesty&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some matters have been drawn to my attention since the last day of this debate by people whose dedication to archival activities <Col N="462" /> cannot be doubted.  They are disturbed by the lack of specific reference to archival material throughout much of the Bill.  In section 2 &ldquo;library material&rdquo; is defined as including any manuscript or book.  I presume &ldquo;manuscript&rdquo; stands, in effect, for archival material throughout the Bill, and that any reference to &ldquo;library material&rdquo; incorporates and includes archival material, where appropriate.  Questions were raised about vesting but I think that covers it and that the fears are unwarranted.</P>
      <P>Questions were also raised about the fate and status of archival material which is not yet 30 years old but will come to maturity under the tenure of the nominated boards.  I am not sure if the Minister can answer that question on the spot. I do not know what its implications are but perhaps it is worth thinking about for later in the discussion if there is not an instant answer to it.</P>

      <P>I can take the point between now and Report Stage.  I am happy that the use of the word &ldquo;manuscript&rdquo; covers the material. However, I take the point made by Senator Lee and I will examine it between now and Report Stage in order to assure myself that the archival dimension is properly incorporated.</P>
      <P>The question of material which is less than 30 years old relates to the definition of what constitutes an archive.  I am reminded of a distinguished librarian who told me when we were passing the National Archives legislation that there was a big difference between the National Archives and the national attic.  If the cut off point is below 30 years there is a difficulty that everything will be included.  However, I will look at it.  I want the Bill to be as flexible as possible rather than to be dependent on definitions and other legislation.

      <P>When I read one of the files of the 1940s on this it was apparent that there was much greater concern about the furniture than anything else.  The memorandum to the Government raised the question as to what the then office holder was doing in Dublin.  Nobody could answer the question as to how and in what form people were being paid, but there was a great concern, which usually surfaced much earlier than for other matters, about the furniture and the office equipment.  It is one of those curious kinds of memos for historians and others. To answer the Senator's question, let me be cautious, but I believe &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a jaundiced view of a section which deals with consultants and advisers. I appreciate that there is a need for these boards to enlist the help of outside expertise.  I also appreciate that there may be occasions when they <Col N="464" /> will need help in mounting exhibitions, packaging their products and so on.</P>
      <P>However, will the Minister assure the House that this will not be a <i>carte blanche</i> which will allow for creative annual reports detailing the use of consultants?  I question the reasons for their use in some instances.  Apart from all the other powers the board has been given, I am concerned that it will also have the power to engage consultants and pay them inflated fees &mdash; I am aware of this from working in the media &mdash; for their time, work and effort put into producing slogans or getting their art people to create logos or whatever.  One only has to consider the horrendous amount of money spent by Bord Fáilte on replacing its logo.  Aer Lingus made minimal changes to its shamrock logo &mdash; I cannot detect any change &mdash; at a cost of £8 or £9 million, to include a change in livery and packaging.  This kind of expenditure entails the use of &ldquo;Monopoly&rdquo; money.</P>
      <P>I do not want to engage in scare mongering, but I ask the Minister to assure the House that, in granting powers under this section for the engagement of consultants and advisers, a Ministerial eye will be kept firmly on the ball.  Is the Minister satisfied that the powers he is granting to the board are not <i>carte blanche</i>, that there are checks and balances which will allow accountability and transparency in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Mooney for raising this issue.  I have spoken here on several occasions about the country's apparent fetish for consultants.  The quality of their reports varies enormously.  Some can be outstanding, but there is also much drivel.  One can see where these come from &mdash; they are removed from shelves and contain recycled rubbish.  It is a waste of public money.  I do not refer to the Minister's Department in this, but to other, more economically oriented Departments, which are presumably concerned with financial matters.</P>
      <P>We must be careful as we know that money for these institutions is scarce.  We also know, and the Minister accepts, that they are grossly under-budgeted in terms of what they ought to have. The idea that an optimum use of very scarce resources could be the hiring of consultants at grossly inflated rates must be questioned.  Many of us will have been consulted by cultural consultants from time to time, not least on the issue of the shamrock, over a drink or a meal and will have offered such advice as we can give without even thinking of asking for the drink or meal to be paid for.  They can then charge a fortune when compiling their reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is doing the job properly he or she will appoint, as members of the board, people who are able to give advice on a wide range of areas.  They will be appointed not only for their specific knowledge but also for their interest.  It will reflect badly on the calibre of persons nominated to the board if, in due course, they have to consider the hiring of consultants because <Col N="465" /> they do not have among their number people who can advise on the issues that arise.  Otherwise, what are they being paid for?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister elaborate on his thinking in this area?  Users' committees can bring to the attention of boards issues that may arise and consultants could proceed to get the views of users and then weave the results into a report.  I do not intend to provoke Senator Taylor-Quinn into talking about the superiority of cultural people, but many people in the cultural community who are deeply involved in these affairs would gladly respond to requests for advice or opinion without calling themselves consultants and charging accordingly.  It might be a different matter if it related to a building or its architectural design, but the nature of the consultants should be closely defined.  There is nothing more demoralising for the cultural community than to see what everybody accepts as scarce money frittered away, or potentially frittered away, on consultancy and advice which is not needed and may not even come from the best people.</P>

      <P>The section states:</P>
      <P>... the Board shall comply with any directives with regard to such consultants or advisers which the Minister may give to the Board with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>This should allay Senators' fears.  There are many instances where the board may need to hire advisers.  For example, if it came into possession of fine copies of the Koran, how many people in Ireland have hands on knowledge of Islamic?  In such circumstances, it may be necessary to bring in somebody with expertise from a university in Cairo, Beirut or elsewhere.  He will not travel to Ireland to enjoy the rain; he must be adequately reimbursed for his efforts.  Perhaps bad practice among consultants has given the profession a bad name but consultants are needed from time to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kelly is correct and I am glad Senator Mooney and Senator Lee raised the matter because it gives me an opportunity to explain the purpose of the section.  Many State boards can hire consultants without reference to the Minister in the appropriate Department. Section 39 takes the opposite tack by providing that consultancies will be carried out to enable the board to carry out its functions with the permission of the responsible Minister in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  The section provides two levels of consultation which do not exist in other State boards.  The section was worded in this way to cover the point raised by the Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> I can assure Senators that consultancy for its own sake will not be approved.  The section specifies that consultancies may be engaged to advance the board's functions.  This goes beyond the issue of why the board exists; it is not an invitation for existentialist excess at a cultural level.  The two filters, which do not exist in other State boards, were included to ensure that money is spent by major cultural institutions in the best way possible at times of scarce resources and for the reasons advanced by the Senators.  The section is sufficiently strong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister.  I did not put down an amendment to the section because it is better to include the section in the Bill.  In the context of other sections which give sweeping powers to the two boards &mdash; for example, section 12 in relation to functions and section 14 in relation to by-laws &mdash; the provision is loose in terms of the powers which will be given to the boards to promote and expand their activities.  If section 39 was not included in the Bill, it is possible that the boards could, without reference to the Minister, indulge in expenditure and engage consultants and advisers.  I welcome the Minister's points which clarified the matter. The provision creates checks and balances in relation to the appointment and engagement of consultants.  If the section was not included, the boards could engage consultants from their existing funds without reference to the Minister. This would defeat the argument put forward by myself and Senator Lee that scarce resources could be used for that purpose.</P>
      <P>Given that the Minister considered it important to include the section, does he anticipate that the boards will at some point wish to engage consultants and advisers?  The section states that, having regard to the guidelines, the money shall be paid by the board from moneys at its disposal. Will the Minister clarify what is meant by &ldquo;moneys at its disposal&rdquo;?  This aspect relates to the annual Vote from the Department specifically to the two boards.  In keeping with the view expressed by Senator Lee, a separate extra payment should be made if the boards come to the Minister with a proposal to engage consultants and advisers rather than the payment coming from their existing limited resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the matter.  However, I am still uneasy about what might happen and how it is envisaged the section will function.  Senator Kelly mentioned an example of Islamic manuscripts. However, given the scarce resources of the institutions and the focus on Ireland, although I am committed to comparative perspectives, the vast bulk of material with which the institutes will be concerned will probably be Irish.  In that case, the expertise should be available in this country and I am sure it would be made available without going through the hoops of consultancy.  I do not suggest that academics in principle should sell themselves below market rates but there is a <Col N="467" /> great fund of goodwill towards the institutions in the cultural community.</P>
      <P>The more things are monetized, the more they will be approached in purely market terms and the fund of goodwill will diminish rapidly.  I accept the Minister's reasoning and the goodwill behind the provision.  It may contribute towards what Senator Mooney and I are striving to achieve but I am uneasy about some of the implications.  It would be desirable to have more specific guidelines regarding the areas in which consultancy may be deemed appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senators' interest and I am trying to give them all the information available to me.  At present I am managing various types of capital expenditure, particularly in relation to the museum in Collins Barracks.  The type of consultancy which will be required relates to, for example, computing systems and the second phase of Collins Barracks. It will be a most exciting development when the museum moves to the barracks.  Many more staff and much more money than are available are required for that cultural institution but it will be an exciting time.</P>
      <P>In the second phase of Collins Barracks, museum policy includes a number of options, for example, how the new facility can be marketed to the best extent.  Specific marketing niche information is required in relation to the future of the museum.  A point was made on Second Stage and during Committee Stage, on which there is general consensus, about the new exhibition space fulfilling its function.  It will fulfil many things in relation to the traditional concept of a museum but there is greater interest among the public and a desire for it to be accessible for educational purposes.  If one wanted to use CD ROM technology for exhibitions, one would require specific consultants.</P>
      <P>As in the past, the board would discuss specific types of consultancy and would ask the Minister of the day for permission to engage in that consultancy.  There may be an upper limit on the length of time and the amount of money spent which would come from the Department of Finance.  They would be the points of reference. I hope I have made the matter clearer by giving examples of what might arise on foot of this section.  I gave examples mostly from the viewpoint of the museum.  Examples from the viewpoint of the library might deal with conservation, but the same arguments would apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Táim fíor-bhuíoch as an míniú sin.  That goes some way towards providing clarification on the type of activity.  I understand what the Minister said as regards computing facilities.  However, when he spoke about marketing I became more sceptical in that a great deal of so-called marketing expertise is grossly exaggerated.  What are presented as &ldquo;unique insights&rdquo; might cross the minds of many of us <Col N="468" /> while strolling down the street.  We cannot charge for that but they can.  Why cannot those appointed to the board for their expertise contribute to a number of possible areas? Without pushing this matter further, it would be helpful if guidelines were prepared before Report Stage &mdash; I do not know if it would be possible &mdash; on what constitutes legitimate consultancy.  It may be difficult to include this in legislation but I hope the intensity of the concerns expressed will be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Lee's concerns. In fact, that was the reason I raised this matter.  I am not happy with this section.  I appreciate what the Minister said and that it is better this section is included than excluded because it provides some checks and balances.  Senator Lee made the point that the section does not go far enough although the tenor and the sentiment behind it is excellent.  Does the Minister envisage a situation where the two boards would engage the same firm of consultants under two separate briefs at the same time?  A firm of consultants could be employed by the board of the National Library and, at a future date, by the board of the National Museum to carry out the same work.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee asked about the activities and expertise of the 16 board members.  We agreed that sales and marketing would form part of the requirement for the appointment of such people. Surely it is not beyond their ken to create a subcommittee to deal with marketing and to come up with common sense ideas on how to sell and market?  What will be the role of the directors?  The directors of both institutions will have to address the question of the expansion of powers under the Bill.  There is no answer to this problem but the Minister must issue guidelines. Board members must do more than attend meetings and rubber stamp decisions if appointed for their expertise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time to speak plainly.  I will deal with the issue of board members because there may be a genuine difference between us, but I hope that is not so.  When the board is being composed one will take account of the expertise one needs to have available to the board as a whole.  However, a person appointed will not say they were appointed to deal with one area.  I would not make such a narrow appointment nor have I ever done so.  I appointed a person to the Film Board who had a knowledge of film distribution and when that question arises everybody does not shut up except the person appointed for their expertise in that area.  That person was appointed because we needed someone with a knowledge of distribution but they also read scripts and are involved in every aspect of film.  A person may bring their expertise to the board, but they must contribute to the totality.  A board member will not switch on only when their expertise is required.  Boards in the past have been disastrous because that approach <Col N="469" /> was taken.  A board member must make a commitment to the totality of the policy which transcends his or her expertise.  That clarifies a formative point in relation to the board.</P>
      <P>The board will establish a policy for a number of years which the director will administer and report on.  The board will know whether it is succeeding.  The director will know if there is no expertise among the staff in relation to computers.  When I spoke about marketing I was referring to the form of the exhibition rather than selling.  One could argue that the two boards will not be able to do what other boards have done.  I said there are two restrictions in terms of seeking permission from the responsible Minister and the Minister for Finance.  If one goes any further, the boards will not have autonomy.  The occasional, but responsible journalist has frequently reported on my respect for autonomy, which is important to me.  I define my relationship with the semi-State bodies for which I am responsible as autonomy with responsibly.  Boards must have some autonomy.  Why should we place a restriction on these two cultural institutions with their many specialist areas, which has not been placed on any other body?  There will be accountability because the permission of the Minister is required.  A Minister who sanctions the exotic will be accountable to the Oireachtas. If we go any further, we are saying these institutions are distrusted in a way other institutions are not and, therefore, are entitled to lesser autonomy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept much of the Minister's reasoning but I am still uneasy.  Senator Mooney and I were not suggesting that board members should be appointed on the basis of narrow expertise and should keep their mouths shut when any other topic arises.  That was not even implied.  We agree with the Minister's interpretation on the type of person one would want on the board.  More than one person may bring a particular expertise to bear.  Presumably, they could progress discussion on museum or library policy some distance within the board, perhaps to a point at which consultants may be redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw a distinction between cultural institutions which have a supportive cultural community and which regard themselves as stakeholders in the types of services provided by these institutions.  There is a great deal of goodwill towards the activities of these institutions which may not be the case with the activities of other State boards.  Hiring consultants in any area beyond the technical one referred to by the Minister, which I fully accept, should be a last resort rather than a first resort. These boards should consider themselves as representatives of a society as well as a State and should be willing to seek advice without calling in consultants who may charge an excessive amount for that advice.  If that expertise is not available on a commitment basis, only then should <Col N="470" /> consultants be considered although those consultants may be inferior to those giving advice that is freely available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister assure me that, given the context of advisers and the debate on the composition of the boards, a situation would not arise where the board would employ one of the board members for his or her specific expertise and pay them accordingly for advice? They would be sitting on the board as nominees of the Minister as distinct from their commercial expertise, a distinction the Minister has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In such a case there would be a clear conflict of interest.  The chairperson would be required to draw that to the attention of the member.  In drawing on my memory of previous occasions with other State bodies for which I have been responsible, it is understood that the chairperson would draw any conflict of interest to the attention of the board.  I agree with the Senator and the answer to his question is, yes.  It will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The same would apply to the companies employed as consultants if there were a potential conflict of interest.  As the Minister is aware, some boards get around this by ensuring the member of the board is absent from the meeting at which the decision is taken to make the appointment.  This should really be a question of openness, transparency and accountability because of the checks and balances built into the section but it does not state that.  I agree that everyone will know if this happens.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Lee, I too have a jaundiced view of consultants and the manner in which they operate.  They operate in a netherworld where there is not always public accountability.  Only when questions are raised are answers forthcoming.  They are a secretive elite and obtain money &mdash; public money in many cases &mdash; which is hardly justified in the circumstances.  Before I get the entire profession down on my head, I want to make the distinction that there are excellent consultants but they suffer from a bad public image.</P>

      <P>The rise and fall of disciplines in the contemporary world is interesting. Homeopathic medicine is much more assured now than it used to be but economic, public and administrative consultancy has fallen back.</P>
      <P>If one wants a consultant to tell one what one wished to decide in the first place there is always the danger of tautology and circularity.  There is also the danger of repetition of a methodology that might be scant and the absence of originality. That is not to say that some consultancies are not capable of flashes of creativity and insight.  I assure Senators that everything will take place with probity, prudence and in the best interests of the cultural institutions.</P>

      <P>There is a very committed voluntary community of scholars and people interested in the activities of these institutions many of whom have taken time and trouble over the years without thinking of it as a marketing relationship.  I am uneasy about the degree of ministerial power in the Bill even when autonomy is part of the principle invoked simultaneously, parallel, overlapping and God knows where the circle ends sometimes.</P>

      <P>Senators are right to stress that it should be an exceptional and residual decision rather than a usual one, which answers Senator Lee's point.

      <P>The Senator has my assurance that the definition covers the matters he mentions.  There is a downside to the Bill if the amendment is accepted.  If one has a generic definition that includes these matters, a whole <Col N="472" /> range of matters will be included but if one proceeds to list, one is left with an interpretation wide open to suggestion on that which has not been listed or covered by the definition.  There is clearly a downside in relation to drafting and one goes for a definition which is inclusive, but to go for listing leaves one wide open in the future.  It seems to ask: &ldquo;Why did you not list the rest as follows?&rdquo;.  One is then unable to sustain the argument that the definition included a, b, c and d because one has specified a and b and therefore one is silenced on c and d.  That weakens the base definition.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that I have taken advice on the definition and I am satisfied it that it includes the matters to which the Senator refers.

      <P>The spirit of the Senator's amendments in other areas is achieved by the use of the phrase &ldquo;cultural object&rdquo;, which includes library material and material which is not in the institutions.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <P>These sections deal with the concept of indemnification.  There has been a great deal of publicity about other aspects of the Bill but these are valuable sections.  Until now every time a person wanted to mount an exhibition of objects or paintings the Minister responsible had to go to Cabinet to make a proposal for indemnification.  One of the more recent examples was the Louis le Brocquy retrospective at the Irish Museum of Modern Art. Curators were often doing things at the last minute and had to arrive at valuations of the objects and paintings.  However, under the Bill the State is doing the act of indemnification.</P>
      <P>The Senator had a question on the register which I will answer by giving an example.  &ldquo;The Taking of Christ&rdquo; by Carvaggio is in the ownership of the Jesuit Order but on loan to the National Gallery and the register will cover that.</P>

      <P>Section 45(1) refers to cultural objects entered in the register which are in the ownership of a person other than an institution specified in the Second Schedule.  It specifies the two bodies referred to in the Bill along with the Chester Beatty Library, the Crawford Gallery, the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, the Irish Museum of Modern Art Company and the National Museum of Ireland.  Are all these institutions in the ownership of the State or has the Minister identified them as institutions under this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>An indemnity arises if a cultural object which is in private ownership is made available.  There is a second category where an object is owned by the Irish people.  The private person needs to be indemnified because the cultural object will be part of an exhibition.  I have committed myself to regionalism with regard to cultural institutions and while other <Col N="474" /> institutions will be included in the Schedule from time to time I decided to start with two, the Hunt Museum in Limerick and the Crawford Gallery in Cork.  They are able to meet the requirements of security and curatorial capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator raises a good point beyond the scope of the Bill in terms of cultural policy.  If people want to make materials available the indemnification procedures enable them to do so without cost.  The Bill responds to those who want to behave as the Senator suggests and these sections enable many things to happens which did not before or which happened with great trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not <i>au fait</i> with the procedure in terms of the lending and transfer of cultural objects.  Did a problem exist which has been resolved by the insertion of this section? Can people be confident that if the they wish to loan a cultural object to any of the institutions listed they will be indemnified?  This should act as a motivating factor for them.</P>

      <Col N="475" /> SECTION 46.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 62:</P>
    <P>In page 30, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) (a)  Where a dispute arises between the Museum and a public authority or a local authority, as the case may be, concerning the care, control and management of an archaeological object to which this subsection applies, the matter shall be determined by the Heritage Council whose decision in relation thereto shall be binding on the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>(b)  This subsection applies to an archaeological object that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  is in the ownership of the State,</P>
    <P>(ii) is in the care of a public or local authority, as the case may be, and has been in such care for an uninterrupted period of 5 years before the commencement of the Act of 1994, and</P>
    <P>(iii) has not at any time been in the care of the Museum.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment, which is a response to concerns raised on Second Stage, is to provide a procedure in certain circumstances to resolve disputes between the museum and a public or local authority concerning entitlement to care for and manage archaeological objects with no known owner.  This was suggested by members of the Irish Museums Association.  While it is not anticipated that any problems of the above nature should arise in practice, nonetheless it is considered that any concerns there may be on this issue will be allayed by the introduction of this procedure.  As the Heritage Council has a remit in respect of museums generally, it would be an appropriate body to assume an arbitration role.</P>
      <P>Under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, an archaeological object found in the State with no known owner was formally declared the property of the State.  Prior to this Act, and as a result of the Supreme Court judgment in late 1987 regarding the Derrynaflan hoard case, Webb <i>v</i> Ireland, the State has a claim to ownership of all such objects found in the State at least since the enactment of the National Monuments Act, 1930, when controls on archaeological objects were first introduced.  The arbitration process will cover disputes over objects found prior to the 1994 Act which were held by local or public authorities for at least five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for responding to concerns raised on Second Stage. If memory serves me correctly, this matter relates to situations where there might have been competing interests between local authorities and the National Library and National Museum.  Will the Minister clarify whether this will apply to <Col N="476" /> artefacts because there was an ongoing legal dispute in connection with the Armada wrecks at Streedagh and other wrecks off the coast of Ireland?  Was the Streedagh case resolved and does the section provide for eventualities of that type occurring in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The case of the Streedagh wreck was resolved in the High Court.  The protection of sites was dealt with in the 1994 legislation.  As regards the <i>Lusitania</i> I do not want to prosecute in that case but I made an order regarding the site of the wreck.  There are unresolved legal issues.  One has been concluded and two remain before the courts.  These arise in connection with the duties that fall by way of the public interest in relation to the protection of the site.  There are also separate issues which arise with regard to the ownership of the contents of a wreck.</P>
      <P>When the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, was being debated, it was my intention that people should be rewarded for good citizenship but we should not sacrifice the issue of ownership.  The heritage of Ireland is the property of the people.  I would never concede that a person discovering an object that is the property of the people should enjoy even temporary ownership of it.  This is reflected in the legislation.  However, I did make provision, through the agencies responsible, to reward good citizenship.  When I introduced the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, I was influenced by the conclusions reached in the Finlay judgment in the Webb case in relation to a specific point.  The Streedagh case was resolved by the High Court but that litigation preceded my term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am open to correction but, with regard to the ongoing legal disputes about the wreck of the <i>Lusitania</i>, there is an unproven allegation that Sir Hugh Lane was transferring paintings back to Ireland which are lodged in sealed containers on the wreck.  The State would have a genuine interest in this regard because he may have been acting on his own behalf or that of the State at that time.  However, the State is the beneficiary of the Hugh Lane bequest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that there are sufficient legislative instruments in place, coupled with the amendment, to ensure that there will not be any doubt about the State's ownership of such objects? Will he assure the House that commercial profiteers will not benefit from the plunder of Irish cultural objects, whether discovered off the coast or on the island of Ireland?  Is he satisfied that, although this amendment relates to disputes between local authorities and the museum, it is possible that local authorities may obtain these artefacts through a private donation or on loan? We discussed this matter in relation to indemnification.  Is this amendment sufficient? According to the wording, it seems that the dispute <Col N="477" /> will be between the museum and the public authority but there might be a third party involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relying on my memory of the preparations for the different litigations involved.  There is no concept of &ldquo;treasure trove&rdquo; in Irish law &mdash; that was the effect of the 1994 legislation.  I remember facing the legal issue that arose in that regard when I was dealing with that legislation.  The reason for it, as I said, is that the heritage of Ireland belongs to the people.  It is something of a republican concept &mdash; the idea of the common ownership of that which is our common heritage.  The concept of &ldquo;treasure trove&rdquo; in another jurisdiction has an interesting history.  That is the background to my suggestion that any reward is for good citizenship.  If a person behaves responsibly it should be possible to reward them.  There are certain criteria to be taken into account in that regard.  Archaeological objects are the property of the people.</P>
      <P>Some objects found prior to the 1994 Act might have been in the care of a public body, a university for example, for many years.  The museum may now wish to take the objects into its care and this amendment is designed to deal with such an eventuality.</P>
      <P>There has been a Supreme Court decision on the Streedagh case but there are no artefacts involved.  The section refers to objects found prior to 1994.  I took a great interest in Hugh Lane connection to the <i>Lusitania</i> to the amusement of some in the other House who wondered if I would make a site inspection myself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I made an underwater protection order on the <i>Lusitania.</i>  Such an order had only been made once before in relation to a crannóg in a lake.  In conjunction with other legislation dealing with shipwrecks, the order on the <i>Lusitania</i> was designed to protect the site from indiscriminate diving.  A person must seek permission and a licence from the Department to make a dive on the site.</P>
      <P>In another case, Mr. Bemis who is suing the State through the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, sought three separate cases &mdash; one arose out of the insurance claim concerning the ownership of the shell of the vessel and another related to the artefacts and their possession.  The relatives of the passengers would have private rights to possessions but there is also the issue of the paintings, for example.  I decided to defend the case in relation to the beneficiaries.  The National Gallery would have been the agents at the time for the Hugh Lane collection and I took the necessary legal action in that regard.  I believe Mr. Bemis lost the case in relation to the possessions and is left with certain rights in relation to the wreck itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were suggestions that there was one painting which may not have been in Hugh <Col N="478" /> Lane's possession but in that of a passenger who might have on the <i>Lusitania.</i>  Clear evidence that some of Hugh Lane's paintings were on board has not been established.  There was speculation about sealed containers and their contents.  The whole site is subject to an underwater protection order and the legal measures have been taken to defend any possible benefit in the name of the people of Ireland, the National Gallery and any other beneficiary.  That has been vindicated successfully in the American courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister because it is important that these matters be clarified, particularly as they involve historical artefacts.  The <i>Lusitania</i> disaster is second only to that of the <i>Titanic</i> which took place three years earlier.  However, the <i>Lusitania</i> was sunk within Irish territorial waters.  It will be interesting to establish whether, as is suggested, there are valuable paintings in the wreck.  The weight of evidence suggests there are not.</P>
      <P>The amendment seems to deal with disputes involving the museum.  I presume the reference to the museum includes the National Library. Does the amendment take account of a third party being joined in a dispute because of the ownership issue we discussed earlier in relation to indemnity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of the third party is dealt with in the fundamental part of the Bill.  As we are referring in this section to archaeological objects the museum is the appropriate institution. I wanted a mechanism for the resolution of disputes.  Section 46 empowers the main collecting institutions to lend, borrow and exchange.  Should a dispute arise regarding the acquisition of a cultural object the Minister has the final decision and he may, by agreement, designate by order other institutions for such intra institution loans and transfers and revoke such designations.</P>
      <P>It is not in anybody's interest for a cultural object to be pursued by every institution because that could result in the object being pushed beyond the institutions' powers of acquisition. This mechanism is at a distance from the Minister, yet the Act establishing the Heritage Council as a statutory body provides an opportunity for mediation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the sentiment with which the Minister has clarified the matter.  However, I am not sure whether I enthusiastically support his republican concept. My heart would agree with it but my head tells me not everybody would share our view.  If a person found an important artefact on their land good citizenship may not be their first thought. Rather they may wonder how much the artefact might be worth to them and why they should give it to the State.  There are elements of the Bill in which there would be an onus on people to act with good citizenship but, unfortunately, filthy <Col N="479" /> lucre invariably raises its head.  I wonder if the Minister has due regard for human frailties.</P>

      <P>The balance of rights as they exist in the Constitution, which includes private rights, has been left intact in the 1994 Act.  I am pleased that legislation has been enacted as I wished.  Instead of leaving the objects which are in the possession of the people of Ireland to the mercurial decisions of people more interested in making money, I established it as a matter of law that these objects are the property of the people of Ireland.  That is a fact.  We are straying into other legislation but my amendment relates to the management exchange of objects which are in State ownership.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 63:</P>
      <P>In page 30, subsection (2), line 38, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments are of a technical nature.  I am sure that the Minister has a reason for not including the wording I have suggested and I would like him to respond to my initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When these amendments are taken together they seek to expand the basic consultative structure which will involve the creation of the register of cultural objects.  I appreciate Senator Mooney's concern to achieve a register of objects based on all the relevant interested institutions.  However, I am of the view that this is best achieved within the tight framework set out in this section.  It should be noted that the word &ldquo;objects&rdquo; does not apply to collections of items.  I am confident that the museum, library and gallery will be in a position to take a comprehensive view of all the objects that need to be included.  This section provides for those institutions to consult relevant experts. That is an important provision which is sufficient to achieve a consensus on inclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also wish the Minister of the day to have discretion in the setting of considerations rather than operating under a mandatory requirement.  It is necessary to have flexibility in view of the novel nature of this section because we are doing something new.  There would be many considerations involved in compiling the objects which should be recorded in the register &mdash; age, rarity, historic, aesthetic and cultural value, market value and the degree to which such characteristics present in an object would constitute a serious loss to the country if that <Col N="480" /> object was, for instance, exported or destroyed.  It is also important to establish the register by degrees according to available resources and as expertise develops in respect of each class of object.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the supportive intent behind Senator Lee's proposals.  However, the interests of the provision are better catered for by leaving the discretionary elements intact.  I would prefer to do this because, if one thinks of the criteria across which an object is described as having value, there will be a judgment which may be more inclusive in the future.  I want to cater for this.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Lee's proposal that an entry in the register should be amended or deleted only after consultation with the Heritage Council, I can accept the amendment in relation to deletion.  However, I would not consider this appropriate to amendments which are likely to be more technical and I will put forward an appropriate amendment on Report Stage which, I hope, will address this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for accepting that part of the amendment before I had even spoken on it.  The reason I included it was that section 47 (5) (b) states: &ldquo;The Minister may, after consultation with the Heritage Council, enter the aforesaid object or objects...&rdquo;.  It seemed there was a non-sequitur in being able to delete without consultation.  I do not have any emphatic view on the matter but it is better to have consistency.  I also accept the Minister's point about the amending powers and I will not press that at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that the Minister has addressed the reasons he objects to the extension of the list he has to consult.  I cannot see the difficulty.  For example, section 47 (2) states: &ldquo;the Minister may direct a Board or the Governors and Guardians...&rdquo;.  It would have been more sensible to state that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; direct.  I know that questions of autonomy and flexibility are involved but why include such loose terminology that the Minister may or may not direct, depending on what he or she feels like on a particular day?  Why not be more specific and say that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; direct the board and the guardians?  Will the Minister address that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make one general point in relation to the exercise of discretion. Instead of having several different sources of collection, one would know exactly the body through which the register was working.  If one extends the register one would end up with, for instance, a Department having to co-ordinate information from several sources.  This would be slow and cumbersome.  We do have the capacity to change this later because of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;. Beyond that you also have discretion, which is part of the point Senator Lee's amendment <Col N="481" /> makes.  I want to be as helpful as I can so perhaps it would be better if I spoke about the entire section.</P>
      <P>Section 47 provides for the establishment by the Minister of a register of certain classes of cultural object whose export from the State would constitute a serious loss to Ireland's heritage.  We are agreed on that.  Towards this end, key cultural institutions, under the aegis of the Minister, are to compile the relevant list because these institutions are identifiable and one will not have a variety of compilers.  The Minister is empowered through a set criterion for inclusion on the register.  The Minister has power to delete objects from the register and I am bringing forward an amendment that this will only be done in consultation with the Heritage Council. Recommendations by others for inclusion on the list may also be made.</P>
      <P>It is considered highly desirable that, given the risks to our moveable heritage, there would be a central list of the most important objects in public and private care in Ireland.  This list will assist in the protection of objects by identifying the most important ones held in the State and it will facilitate the provision of more stringent protection for certain objects through the export licensing provisions and will allow, in exceptional circumstances, for the compulsory acquisition of certain objects.  This is what people want.</P>
      <P>If this list is to be meaningful, it is necessary to limit it to a small number of significant items rather than every object considered in any way important by the professionals involved.  For this reason the definition talks of &ldquo;serious loss&rdquo;.  The Minister can also limit the class and value of objects to be included in the list.  For example, the setting of a high minimum value per object would limit it to the more significant objects of high value to export markets.</P>
      <P>I can now answer the question directly. Subsection (1) provides that the Minister shall create a register of cultural objects whose export from the State would constitute a serious loss to the heritage of Ireland.  I have spoken on that. The register may be limited by the Minister to a particular class or classes, including values specified by the Minister of the day.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides that the Minister, before compiling such a register, shall direct the board of the museum or library, or the governors and guardians, to provide him or her with a list of cultural objects which are, in their opinion, outstanding examples of those classes of objects required by the Minister for inclusion.</P>

    <P>To answer a question and anticipate another, if &ldquo;shall&rdquo; was used rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 47(2), entry could then only be made after a direction from the Minister, whereas subsection (5) as it stands allows a board to initiate an entry by recommending it to the Minister without a direction being issued.  In other words, the board <Col N="482" /> will have the information and can take the initiative rather than relying on the traffic being in the other direction.</P>
    <P>However, by virtue of subsections (3) and (4) the Minister may require that specific consideration be given to such matters as he or she directs when the register is being compiled and that there should be consultations with persons with a special knowledge of the matter. That is intended to cover consultation with such bodies as the Royal Irish Academy, Trinity College and others who would have an opinion.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) provides for the making of recommendations for inclusion in the register and subsection (6) provides for amendments to and deletions from it.  I am perfectly happy to hear the opinion of the Heritage Council before making a deletion because there would then be no danger of doing so arbitrarily.</P>
    <P>Because the term &ldquo;national treasure&rdquo; is not defined in EU law, it has been applied, fairly widely, as desired in member states.  However, if it were separately defined in this Bill the effect would be to place a question mark over existing export controls on archaeological objects. Accordingly, the term &ldquo;national treasure&rdquo; is not used in the Bill, although it was envisaged in the original Heads of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I explain all this to give the maximum information.  I re-emphasise the point touched on by Senator Mooney when he mentioned the distinction between his heart and his head in these matters.  There is no longer room in Irish law for confusion.  It is my intention to invoke sanctions and I will be inclined to increase rather than reduce them.</P>
    <P>After I introduced the 1994 legislation, a dealer in Great Britain suggested it was so severe that it might be counter-productive.  We have found the opposite to be the case &mdash; the pro-active assertion, defence and seeking of strong sanctions is a good way to defend Ireland's heritage.  My instructions to those staff for whom I have responsibility will be to seek strong prosecutions and maximum sentences as much as possible so as to defend our heritage.  In this country there is no such thing as &ldquo;treasure trove&rdquo;, only the property of the people of Ireland.  There has been and will be rewards for good citizenship but there is no possibility of making the slightest concession, even on a temporary basis, on the ownership of anything belonging to the people of Ireland.  I am straying back to the 1994 legislation, which is now the law of the land.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's explanation.  Section 47(2) provides that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; direct.  The Minister justifies that wording by referring to section 47(5)(a); I take the point about that paragraph but why was there a need to include the wording in section 47(2)?</P>

      <P>The Minister acquires the responsibility under section 47(1), which states that he &ldquo;shall, as soon as may be after the <Col N="483" /> commencement of this Part, establish and maintain a register of cultural objects&rdquo;.  The obligation is clearly on the Minister.  If &ldquo;shall&rdquo; was used in section 47(2), that would have meant the Minister was doing it by prescription, whereas the subsection as it stands is consistent with section 47(5)(a), under which the board, expressing an opinion, may make a suggestion to the Minister and the Minister may act.  It allows a flexibility so that the decision to include an object on the register may come easily from both sides.  This is the appropriate balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take on board what the Minister has said.  He may argue that these amendments are not necessary but there is no compelling argument for not including them.  He said that the section provides an opportunity to add, as the Minister sees fit, to the list of cultural institutions which may require consultation.  Not only would it be practical, it would be an aid to the efficient working of the board of the National Library if the director of the National Archives were consulted.  I appreciate that he can be consulted but it is not written into the Bill.  The section mentions the governors and guardians of the National Gallery but the director of the National Archives has as much if not more right as they have to be consulted about certain National Library materials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I say the Minister can add, he can add to the consultation or he can direct that there be consultation between the library and museum and another body.  The Senator is correct about the National Gallery. From consultations, I can tell him that the National Archives are happy to allow the library take its role but the point is that, under the legislation, it is perfectly open that the consultation which the library would undertake would include the National Archives, if the matter was relevant.  It is happy with this arrangement.</P>

      <P>As to the other cultural institutions designated by order, I had in mind those which would be outside the scope of the existing legislation and institutions, so that it would allow an opportunity for those with expertise who operate in these cultural institutions to put forward a point of view.  That was the reason for moving the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not mean to be obstructive, but section 46 states that the director of the National Archives may act with the consent of <Col N="484" /> the National Archives Advisory Council.  Is there a large enough distinction between what is involved in section 46 and in section 47 that one may consciously include the Archives in one section and consciously exclude it in the other?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <P>Section 46 deals with the lending and acquisition of cultural objects.  The National Archives is mentioned because it could lend material.  Section 47 deals with a different issue, a register of cultural objects, in which regard the National Archives is happy that the National Library should be the appropriate lead body.  Also, under the legislation a Minister is perfectly free to tell the National Library that it should consult in relation to archives.  Section 46 relates to lending, so it is necessary to include the National Archives to give them the power to lend; section 47 relates to the register and the archives is perfectly happy that the library would be the lead institution to fulfil the obligation of that section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will parish and school registers be included in the register?  Under section 47, the register is to be established and maintained as soon as may be after the commencement of the legislation.  I am raising this issue for a variety of reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parish registers are held in churches throughout this country and I wish to compliment the keepers of those records who come under increasing pressure from people seeking details of their family background who go to the church as a first point of reference.  These people work in a voluntary capacity and are to be complimented for what the Minister referred to earlier as citizens' responsibility in this area.  They know it is a very important aspect of genealogical research and they respond accordingly.  These parish registers are outside the scope of this legislation.  However, there may be a constitutional issue involved here on the question <Col N="485" /> of private ownership.  I would be grateful if the Minister would address this issue.  I am anxious for specific acknowledgement of the existence of these registers.</P>
    <P>Some school registers were abandoned as a result of the closure of rural schools.  School registers are distinct from school rolls in that the school roll will only have the name and the attendance record of the pupil but the school registers include full family details.  As a result of rural depopulation there have been incidents where the last teacher to leave the school has locked the door and left this material behind. Many of these former rural schools have been bought by non-nationals.  I do not mean that they are any more ignorant than Irish people but they would not have the same awareness of the importance of these records for our national culture.  I fear that many of them have been lost.</P>
    <P>Those that might still be in existence are pillaged to a degree, mainly by our returning second and third generation Irish people who go back to their local school, discover one of these registers, find their family name and details on it, decide that it would look lovely on their mantelpiece back home and take it away.  I am not suggesting that this Bill should be so all embracing as to incorporate every and any aspect of our cultural life but, arising from my own research in this area and from representations made to me, we would be grateful for clarification as to the protection of these records that are held in private institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as forthcoming as I can.  The register as we have defined it includes material which would be a serious loss to the country if it were to be exported.  In answer to some of the points made by Senator Mooney, it includes materials in public or in private ownership.  If the materials he mentions qualify as library materials they are included in the definition of &ldquo;library material&rdquo;.  Whether they are held in public or private ownership does not matter.  I can confirm that that protection is there.</P>
      <P>Section 48 (2) states that the Minister may, by order, declare any document which is in his or her opinion of national, historic, genealogical or literary interest to be an article to which this part of the legislation applies.  That deals with the issue of whether material is covered under section 48. Section 48 deals with restrictions on the export of articles.  There is protection in the definition of &ldquo;library materials&rdquo; and there is no inhibition on that protection whether material is in public or private ownership.  We will deal with the other issue when we are debating section 48(2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very sympathetic to what the Senator is trying to achieve.  In my discussions with the Heritage Council I will be very anxious to ensure that we come up with a strategy that would make safe as much of that kind of material as possible.  In this section we are discussing the register of cultural objects which, of its nature, cannot include everything.  When we come to section 48 we will <Col N="486" /> discuss restrictions on exports.  As well as those two requirements I will look at policy issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extremely important discussion.  I appreciate Senator Mooney's contribution and the Minister's reply.  Anyone who has worked with parish registers or school records is aware of how much has been lost by neglect over the years.  For a people who are reputedly obsessed with history we have been as neglectful of our heritage in that area as we have been in the architectural area.  While it is easy to rouse public concern about vandalisation of buildings, even if sometimes not in time to prevent the vandalisation, it is far more difficult to focus attention on the gradual erosion of the documentary basis to much of our existence.  This sort of material is essential for genealogical purposes and family histories and it will become more concerned with the history of ordinary people as we will as time goes on.  This is crucial material, so our understanding of its importance is crucial.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about another aspect of this provision.  Section 47 (1) states that subject to the provisions of this section, the Minister shall &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; establish a register.  The principles the Minister has enunciated are impeccable but how soon is &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;? Of course there are implications for resources here and we are agreed on the inadequacy of the resources hitherto devoted to these institutions, not least to the National Library, for these purposes.  Who will compile these registers?  Who will establish them?  It will be in the first instance the responsibility of the directors and those working under them.</P>
      <P>The Minister said it will be a register of meaningful objects but decisions have still to be made as to which items, among a plethora of objects, are meaningful.  Directors, in practice, carry a great part of the burden nominally associated with boards but unless they are given more resources, when are they to find the time and energy to fulfil the aspirations expressed in this section?  We can applaud the principles all day but until &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; can be turned into a concrete and realistic time period, the principles will not lead to an improvement in the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with principles here.  I take the point the Senator is making. Ultimately the impact of the legislation is at its best when resources are made available.  In preparing the legislation I have to assume that these resources will be available.  If I had to wait for resources to become available before I legislated, I would not have got anything done. I encountered the same argument on Teilifís na Gaeilge.  It is occasionally suggested that I should have reformed broadcasting legislation first, found all the money for ten years and then set about explaining to people what a good idea it was.  With the greatest respect, I suggest such a strategy might not have yielded the happy result <Col N="487" /> we have now.  I must word legislation in a way which assumes the best.  I will go further and say that my instructions will take immediate effect on the passing of this legislation, if that is possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is how I was confused.  I do not want to waste the time of the House by repeating myself.  I assure Senator Mooney that the term &ldquo;library material&rdquo; in section 2 is drafted in such a way as to include this material.  The term &ldquo;cultural object&rdquo; is defined to include &ldquo;library material&rdquo; and, therefore, I confirm it includes genealogical records and heraldic material.  I am responsible for the drafting of terms and I see considerable danger in listing items.  It is better to confirm that the definition used includes this material, which the Senator is right to raise, and other material which has not been listed today. Rather than take the risk of excluding, it is better to proceed as I have done.  I advanced this argument on a previous section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I contributed to the Minister's confusion in this regard.  While amendment No. 60 refers to similar terminology, the main thrust of amendment No. 70 relates to parish and school registers, estate records and maps.  I accept what the Minister said and that we could end up requesting a very long list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has clarified that under section 48(2) &ldquo;The Minister may by order declare any document, which is in his or her opinion of national, historical, genealogical or literary <Col N="488" /> interest, to be an article to which this Part applies&rdquo;.  While the wording of the section includes genealogical and literary interest, I was anxious to ensure parish and school registers, estate maps and the other paraphernalia which are very important to an understanding of our historical and cultural past would not be forgotten about and that the legislation would be comprehensive enough to ensure the owners and keepers of such important memorabilia could not infer it was not included.  That was my primary intention in tabling the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am constantly puzzled by the way in which drafting gets in the way of what we agree we want to achieve in this House.  Surely it is not beyond the wit of draftsmen to find a form of words such as &ldquo;including but not confined to&rdquo; which would make it clear that it is not an exclusivist inclusion.</P>

      <P>I think Senators will agree that we are actively legislating as we go, particularly in relation to this Bill.  I take Senator Lee's point. I do not want to cause further confusion, but I suggest Senators look at section 48(2).  I am moved by the arguments Senators are making.</P>
      <P>If Senator Mooney did not seek to amend &ldquo;cultural objects&rdquo; to include those items but instead concentrated on the existing list in subsection (2) of &ldquo;national, historical, genealogical or literary interest&rdquo;, I would be disposed to examine subsection (2) between now and Report Stage.  I can accommodate the principle there without infringing the principle which I mentioned earlier.  We all wish to establish the maximum protection.  Senator Lee made a good point &mdash; the main consideration is not to make the legislation in the slightest way frail.  There is the possibility of changing the wording of subsection (2) to include parish records and the other material to which the Senator referred, and I am willing to look at that.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister. We are at one in attempting to ensure there is comprehensive protection and that no loophole will be left in the legislation.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> I tabled this amendment in the spirit of my earlier one to ensure internal consistency.  I hope the Minister will accept it.  If not, I am sure he will point out why the cases are different.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now moving onto the territory of section 48 which deals with the question of the restriction on the export of articles to which this Bill applies.  Amendment No. 71 would place a requirement on the Minister to consult with the Heritage Council before an article was declared to be a document for the purpose of the export licence requirement.  I do not see that as being necessary.  The Minister will use his or her discretion according as the need demands, depending on the quality of expert advice received from whatever quarter or institution, including the Heritage Council.</P>
      <P>I am moved by one point, which is that there may be a need for the Minister to act swiftly in a given situation.  It is understood that the Minister would draw on the advice of the Heritage Council in particular.  For example, I have already given way on the idea that the opinion of the Heritage Council should be sought before any item is deleted from the register.  In this case, it is important that the Minister can respond quickly, for example, to a matter raised in either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Senator Mooney would make forfeiture of the registered cultural object mandatory.  The Deputy will know how amenable I am to the concept of that which constitutes the people's heritage and property and he will also know my lack of sympathy for those who would steal from the people.  However, the Office of the Attorney General has advised me that forfeiture is so severe a sanction that such a decision would, in the interests of equity, have to rest with the courts.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney also proposed an amendment to deal with publicity regarding export licences.  I am not sure that notices on every State and local authority building would be the most appropriate way to deal with this.  I accept that a satisfactory implementation of the Bill's provision would require my Department to acquaint both public institutions as to their rights and obligations with regard to such objects and members of the public as to the various provisions in the Bill which affect them.</P>
      <P>I see the point of Senator Mooney's amendment.  Other institutions for which I am now responsible put things in Garda stations out of archaic practice and nobody sees them.  I assure the Senator that I will seek to advertise in the most appropriate, modern and general way. However, I will not take the route he proposes because I do not need such amendments.  The institutions will be contacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Heritage Council was put on a statutory basis we included not only a reference to but a proactive role for education.  It is important that schools, including those with transition years, be aware of the significant <Col N="490" /> changes to legislation regarding the people's heritage.  They should also be utilised for the purposes of communicating the new arrangements.  I will use more modern forms of communication and there will be no question of attempting to satisfy a minimum by putting up archaic notices in places where people would be unlikely to see them.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Lee's amendment, I have outlined the importance of the ability to move with speed.  While I will continue to look at the points raised in Senator Mooney's amendment, I am bound by the advice of the Attorney General.  There are other ways of proceeding and other sanctions which I may consider.  On the question of forfeiture there is an issue of equity which would require resolution in the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister.  He referred to one's heart leading one's head.  I am sure he would agree that our hearts as much as our heads are forming an opinion on this.</P>

      <P>The Attorney General's legal advice is interesting.  It raises the question as to why any reference to the court should be included if there is a restriction on the type of wording that may be used.  Section 73(5) states that the courts &ldquo;may order the object to be forfeited&rdquo;.  My amendment states that the courts &ldquo;shall order the object to be forfeited&rdquo;, the implication being that it is forfeited to the State.  I am confused by the Minister's advice that this is a matter best left to the discretion of the court.  Perhaps he will address this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The balance between the Legislature and the courts is such that we create the capacity for the courts to judge.  That is why the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used.  The use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; amounts to a direction to the courts.  I believe we can operate with the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; because the courts will know what the legislation intended and it leaves them free to exercise within their remit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In proposing this amendment I am aware that there is a clear separation of powers between the Judiciary and the Legislature, although both are equal under the Constitution.  While we can legislate, we can only influence and recommend to the Judiciary.  We cannot force or direct it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows my views on this.  It is a matter of judgment as well as having the strongest possible legislation.  I do not want the Bill to fall on a constitutional point. Private property rights are enshrined in the Constitution.  The Finlay judgment in Webb <i>v.</i> Ireland is interesting in that it introduces the concept of the greater good, or the good of the Irish people, which I chose to interpret when <Col N="491" /> drafting the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1994, as something that was not simply conterminous with private rights enshrined in the Constitution but was almost a transcendental right because it refers to the people's property and heritage.</P>
      <P>In this context, is the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; tantamount to giving a direction to the courts? The courts argue for sovereignty in their practices in that they must, for example, have the right to take mitigating circumstances into account.  In this context the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is a direction rather than allowing for the flexibility and interpretation to which the courts are entitled.</P>
      <P>However, I take the Senator's point that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; appears to be a lesser suggestion than that intended by the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I can undertake between now and Report Stage to find a formulation stronger than &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  If this is possible while remaining within the bounds of the Constitution I will consider it.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's greater expertise in this area.  None of us would have any sympathy for those who attempt to illegally transfer important and expensive items of our culture out of the State in the belief that they will only have perfunctory fines placed on them.  I am seeking the ultimate sanction here because of the importance we all attach to the subject matter under debate.  I appreciate the Minister has a difficulty here.  It is a problem that arises from time to time.  I am interested in where his further research may lead him and would be grateful if he would advise the House on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister's position on amendment No. 75.  While I accept his bona fides on the promulgation of the various sections of the Bill as they relate to the public, I am not sure future Ministers will have as full an appreciation of the media and modes of information as the Minister.  A future Minister may leave it to his excellent civil servants who may have other priorities.</P>
      <P>This important Bill puts on a sound footing two of our major cultural institutions.  Implicit in it, and in this section, is the question of how we treat our cultural objects, including those objects that are intrinsically valuable and are an essential part of our national culture, and how we treat individuals who do not approach this issue with the respect accorded these objects by this legislation.</P>
      <P>I am a firm believer in education and as much information as possible should be given to the public.  The inclusion of the amendment would ensure that a significant portion of the general populace who visit State buildings, including all the cultural institutions and departmental offices around the country and local authority buildings, such as libraries and other ancillary buildings under their control, are aware of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he will ensure that modern means of communication are used.  I did not cover <Col N="492" /> schools or the educational area and perhaps that is a flaw in the amendment.  However, its purpose is to ensure that the public is aware of the severe fines proposed in the section for the illegal export of cultural objects.  Given that as many people visit Ireland annually as live here, perhaps an unambiguous message should be sent that we will not tolerate pillaging of our national culture in any form.</P>

      <P>I understand Senator Mooney's concern and we agree with the general principle of his argument in relation to putting as severe a restriction as possible on somebody who attempts to sneak objects of great value out of the country.</P>
      <P>It would be difficult for the Minister to replace the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; with &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because it would involve including a particular offence in criminal law.  It would have to be listed as a specific criminal offence and that is not possible in the Bill.  However, I appreciate the Senator's point. We value the independence of the courts system but given all the matters covered by the Bill, judges with any understanding of the legislation will appreciate the serious view the Minister, the Department and the Oireachtas take of this issue. One hopes that the Judiciary, in terms of its prudence and freedom to assess each case individually, will take the strongest line possible with regard to the section.</P>
      <P>Regarding the amendment, the Minister could be accused of interfering with the freedom of the court if he specifically directed it to take a particular direction.  It may be necessary to examine the position in relation to criminal law and to establish a list of statutory criminal offences in this area.</P>

      <P>One of the great merits of the 1994 legislation is that it is already a criminal offence for which one can be imprisoned for two years.  If I amend that legislation in the future, my inclination will be to raise the prison sentences rather than reduce them.  I take Senator Taylor-Quinn's important point.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; respects the discretion of the courts, particularly in relation to mitigating or other circumstances. This also applies on the other side of the divide in terms of bad circumstances.  I will examine the matter between now and Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I have a difficulty with Senator Mooney's amendment in any case because it mentions a public notice in all State and local authority buildings.  This would include water towers, public toilets and other such buildings.  The Senator's intention is that if legislation is in place and we go to the trouble of amending it, the provisions should be made known properly.  I will examine the position between now and Report Stage in terms of whether a phrase such as &ldquo;the section having come into force as law, the Minister shall take such appropriate measures&rdquo; or a similar phrase can be included to ensure the Senator's intention is achieved.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister because that is my objective.  The best way to open up the debate was to table the amendment as worded.  I was aware that if I relied on the expertise of the Minister and his Department, they would create the necessary and essential form of words.  I presume the Minister means he will consider an amendment to the section on Report Stage to encompass the sentiment of the debate.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the information is imparted and that people receive it.  It should not be allowed to gather dust on yellowing paper in offices around the country.  I had the tourism market primarily in mind rather than the domestic market.  Tourists may feel, out of ignorance rather than mischief, that if an object came into their possession they could take it away with impunity.  I am grateful to the Minister for his clarification and his assurances in relation to Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This allows for the amendment by ministerial order of the minimum limit of £35,000 for decorative art objects, subject to licensing requirements.  This issue was raised on Second Stage and it was pointed out then that the amount is in line with the equivalent EU regulations.  I am reluctant to reduce it until we have experience of the volume of material likely to be coveréd but the amendment would allow for a reduction in future if it were considered desirable.  Provision is also being made for a similar flexibility to reduce the minimum age for a number of categories.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1)(a) states &ldquo;any document (other than a document wholly in <Col N="494" /> print) which is not less than 70 years old,&rdquo;.  Many documents relating to historical events, such as the de Valera papers, may be only 30 or 40 years old but they may relate to events in 1916 or 1921. They are important and valuable documents although they are less than 70 years old.  Age does not always determine value, relevance or importance.  Why is 70 years specified in the section?  More recent documents may be of value and the amendment goes some way towards realising this point by giving the Minister power to change the age if he wishes.  What is the rationale behind including 70 years as distinct from 25 years or 50 years?</P>

      <P>I was a little taken aback when the Minister said the flexibility which he is seeking as regards the £35,000 would be with a view to reducing it.  Would there be a possibility of raising it if only in line with inflation if the figure selected here was the correct one? Inflation is deemed to be under control at present but in ten years time, even with an inflation rate of 3 per cent which depends on matters beyond our control, there would be a significant difference between £35,000 today and what it would be at that stage.  I hope the phraseology allows flexibility in either direction.  The intent seems to be to reduce it as distinct from maintaining it in line with inflation.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelly made a good point.  The Minister mentioned European Union practice as regards the value of objects.  What are the implications of European Union definitions of cultural objects and archival holdings?  I do not know the degree of binding powers this has, but the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i> lists cultural objects as archives and any element thereof of any kind or any medium which are more than 50 years old.  Is there an implication for our 70 years in terms of the EU's 50 years? What relationship does the Minister envisage between them as circumstances unfold?</P>

      <P>Senator Kelly and Senator Lee raised issues that attracted my attention.  Given what is involved in section 48(2), are the provisions in section 48(1) (a) necessary because of the powers the Minister has under section 48(2)?  Is he seeking double protection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 48(1)(a) is necessary to define where the offence lies.  A person who does not satisfy section 48(1)(a) is in breach. Section 48(2) defines circumstances in relation to the ownership of a cultural object and is necessary to ensure a person will comply.  Senator Howard's interpretation was correct in that it provides a stronger protection for the State.  If this subsection was not included, one would appear to have a description of an administrative process.  Section 48(1)(a) is clear in that one may acquire a licence.  There are actions which are in breach of that which will be clearly understood. It also helps in relation to sanctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> On the point raised by Senator Lee, when we discussed this previously the issue was not about adjusting the £35,000 upwards with inflation but about reducing it.  Members suggested the figure was too high and that objects could be valued at £15,000 to £25,000 below that figure.  I was urged to create the capacity to reduce the figure to cater for objects of intrinsic value worth £5,000.  The amendment enables amendment by ministerial order across all classes of objects within the decorative arts and it gives the Minister great flexibility.  Senator Henry said an important object may not be valued at £35,000; something which might have a relatively modest price in gross terms could be very valuable within a class of objects.  That is the reason for that flexibility.</P>
    <P>We are at 100 years in terms of the time limit. To go from 100 to 50 years would have huge resource implications.  I decided to move from 100 to 70 years with the capacity to move quickly to 50 years depending on resources.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Senator Kelly for raising the question of time.  I studied the comparable legislation in the United Kingdom. The British Library Act, 1972, refers to objects which it appears to the board to have been printed not earlier than the year 1850.  The British Museum Act, 1963, refers to an object which appears to the trustees to have been made not earlier than the year 1850.  How did the Minister come up with the figure in section 48?  Does it mean that anything older or younger cannot leave the State without a licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Anything older than 70 years will require a licence.  When passed this legislation will join the National Monuments Act, 1994, and will be succeeded by the Wildlife Bill.  This will give us the strongest package of heritage legislation in Europe.  It is more radical in that respect than some of the British legislation, and deliberately so.  If one takes from 1850 onwards, there is a raft of material which is outside the boundary of protection.  As we are moving from 100 to 70 years, we are including everything for 30 years and it is my aspiration to move quickly to 50 years.  Rather than setting this down as immovable stock, I created the flexibility to vary. I gave an example about the status of an object within a class of objects and the reason to protect its value.  Equally, within a category of material, one may need to vary &mdash; a point made by Senator Kelly and others.  This amendment provides the flexibility to address this and as resources are built up, we will shorten the period to 50 years. We will be able to cater for objects below that and gradually include more objects.  This Bill is more inclusive and up to date than comparable legislation elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's point that there is no such thing as treasure trove under the <Col N="496" /> 1994 legislation and about objects of cultural significance and of intrinsic value to the State. Would copyright extend to that because it would be within the rights of the State?</P>

      <P>I must resist the temptation to speak about copyright because it does not arise here.  When amending the National Monuments Act I confined myself to archaeological objects. That legislation is being used as a model by other countries in Europe.</P>
      <P>The issue of intellectual property is for another day and will require separate legislation. Handling this requires not just my Department but the principal Department, which is the Department of Enterprise and Employment. There is a huge issue coming up in December in Geneva where the international significance of this will be raised, including the question of what constitutes intellectual property and non-physical material.

      <P>The Act applies to exporting articles.  In the case of a book or library material, in which original copyright would have been vested in the creator of that intellectual material, which passes to the State, does the State own the copyright?  As the Minister would be aware, the term of copyright has been extended in Europe from 50 to 70 years.  Would this get over the difficulty to which Senator Kelly referred about newer material because it would be under copyright and the State had the copyright vested in it?  I refer to printed material.</P>

      <P>Organisations like the History Teachers' Association of Ireland and the local archaeological and historical societies should be informed as explicitly as possible of this.

      <P>On section 48, my query relates to the powers the Minister can have.  In relation to documents, that is well provided for in section 48(1)(a) and (c) and 48(2) but section 48(1)(b) is not nearly as strong on the protection of paintings or in relation to any object as stated in section 48(1)(f).</P>
      <P>The only protection in relation to paintings is contained in section 48(1)(b).  If one compares that to the protection of documents in the Bill it looks inadequate.  Section 48(1)(f) states:</P>
      <P>any object specified in the Third Schedule which is made in Ireland, is not less than 70 years old and the value of which is less than £35,000,</P>
      <P>Looking at the Third Schedule, it is not an exhaustive list and the protection being given to objects in section 48(1)(f) is confined to what is specified in the Third Schedule.  Is the Minister satisfied there is enough protection of these objects and that there is enough protection of paintings bearing in mind the more extensive protection provided for documents?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Effectively, the only thing protected stronger than that are the objects already debated for inclusion when we discussed a register of special objects.  The 1994 Act relates to archaeological objects.  In relation to the precise point of section 48(1)(f), I will look at the Third Schedule because section 48(1)(g) states: &ldquo;any classes of cultural <Col N="498" /> objects designated by order of the Minister&rdquo;.  The Third Schedule has every kind of object one can think of because we are in a new area of protection in relation to furniture, wallpaper, ceramics, etc.  In case the Third Schedule was not inclusive, the force of section 48(1)(g) was to enable that to be added to without difficulty.</P>

      <P>This amendment clarifies that the Minister can delegate part of his functions and not just all or nothing.  It provides an option for the Minister to delegate &ldquo;such one or more of his or her functions&rdquo; in respect of licensing of cultural objects for export or in regard to offences cited in the section.  The option of delegation is to distinguish between the classes of cultural objects, paintings and library material involved.  If the Minister wished to delegate a power, he or she can do so.  In practice, it is likely that there would not be delegation of the licensing power in respect of cultural objects in the register but there could be in respect of objects under a certain age or valuation.  It is likely in terms of the National Gallery and the Irish Museum of Modern Art Company that a delegated licensing function would be divided between them depending on the age of the painting involved.

      <P>At present the museum makes a proposal on an object and gives an opinion on a licence which is then returned to the Minister. It makes it possible for the Minister of the day to delegate his or her functions under section 49 to the board of the museum in relation to museum heritage objects and to the board of governors and guardians of the National Gallery and the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art Company in relation to painting and the board of the National Library in relation to library material.

      <P>I move amendment No. 79:</P>
      <P>In page 34, subsection (1)(b), line 42, to delete &ldquo;wholly or substantially&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I confess that I erred.  The same wording is used in section 49(2)(a) where it refers to any other institution owned or funded wholly or substantially by the State.  I picked up on this wording in section 51 which relates to cultural objects entered in the register and for an uninterrupted period of five years were in the care of an institution owned or funded wholly or substantially by the State.  Why is this wording used here?  If an institution is funded by the State it should be obligated to comply with the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mooney proposes that a cultural object which is entered in the register and is in the care of an institution funded by the State or any public or local authority may be considered for acquisition under this Part of the Bill rather than institutions wholly or substantially funded by the State.  We could reach a point where a large number of private institutions would have received funding from the State.  If all of them qualified for registration the public repository would be at a disadvantage compared to private institutions.</P>
      <P>If the intention is to widen the scope of objects which may be acquired, I would be a little concerned that the amendment would widen the provision to such a degree that it would become not only unworkable but also inequitable in that largely private institutions which have received any source of public funding could find themselves covered by the provision.  I have tried to achieve a balance between private property rights and the public interest and to confine the provision to objects in the care of what would commonly be regarded as public bodies.  I am happy with that.  I came down in favour of that in the interest of being manageable and of trying to direct the State's actions at where the maximum public benefit will fall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, it is quite the opposite. The Senator's amendments would have the effect of so extending the application as to dilute, first, its manageability and, second, its qualification to create the capacity for purchase.  I believe it is extending the powers.  I do not accept I am giving any ground away in relation to a compulsory purchase power.  By extending it over a much wider territory, one is beginning to run into the danger of a court challenge under the private property rights of the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is there is a huge difference between owned and funded.  Any funding would qualify in the second category.  A provision which would include anybody who had enjoyed any funding whatever would be an extraordinarily wide one.</P>
      <P>I believe I have achieved a balance.  I would advise Senators that the acquisition of certain cultural objects by the Minister is the purpose of the section.  Having regard to the legal advice available to me, I believe I have gone quite far.  I can examine the definition but I do not see much scope in it.  Ultimately, the main point is that it should relate primarily to public institutions.  One could not widen it to any institutions which had ever enjoyed State funding.  It would become both unmanageable, unworkable and constitutionally frail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>My point may be a frivolous one.  I am intrigued by the use of the word &ldquo;substantially&rdquo;.  Suppose the funding to an institution which has been substantially funded for years suddenly drops to 49 per cent.  Does it <Col N="503" /> thereby drop out of the schedule?  Where an institution hovers around the 50 per cent level, and may be a little above it one year and a little below it the following year, does it depend on the luck of the draw as to when the issue arises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister stating that retaining the words &ldquo;wholly or substantially&rdquo; means in practice that these are State institutions as distinct from any institution which receives State funding?  Essentially, does retaining the words &ldquo;wholly or substantially&rdquo; in this particular subsection mean in practice that it refers primarily to State institutions and not private institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be put in another way; it does not include every private institution that wanted to qualify by the back door.  It includes ones which are primarily public in purpose and funding.</P>
      <P>On the question of the use of the word &ldquo;substantially&rdquo;, there is an advantage in retaining it rather than a percentage so that when one drops a percentage point or two one is not arguing about qualification or disqualification.  I have gone as far as I can to retain an advantage for the public institutions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 80:</P>
      <P>In page 35, subsection (4), line 25, after &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, specifically for the purpose stated in this section and requested by the Minister as a separate Vote under his Department's Estimate&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The price or compensation payable on the acquisition of a cultural object to which this Part applies shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment suggests that the words &ldquo;, specifically for the purpose stated in this section and requested by the Minister as a separate Vote under his Department's Estimate&rdquo; be there inserted.  The Minister and I have exchanged views on this on an earlier section in relation to the allocation of resources.  We all agree there are will never be enough money available.  I hope there might be enough at some point but, while it is a noble aspiration, the reality is there will always be a need for significant State funding for these two bodies.  My concern is that it might interfere with their annual budgetary requirements and that where a situation arose under this subsection, the moneys would not be <Col N="504" /> taken out of the annual Vote of the Department but from a separate payment and that it would not interfere with the bodies' budgetary or development plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accede to this amendment.  I know what is behind it.  It is perfectly clear, for example, that in practice a major purchase would have to be handled out of a Supplementary Estimate.  It is also clear that one should take account of what is available in the purchase of something significant.  However, I have dealt recently with cases in which there were savings in other areas, for example.  It is best to leave it in terms of the flexibility of the normal financial arrangements.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is a problem in any event because if I were to accept the amendment, one is introducing a separate source of funding, an acquisitions fund.  The Senator is talking about compulsory purchase powers in legislation which refers to funds provided by the Oireachtas.  It is best left as it is.</P>

      <P>In the context of the acquisition of cultural objects, section 52(1) states &ldquo;if it appears to the Minister that the common good requires that the object should be in the ownership, care and control of the State, the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, acquire the object by agreement with the owner thereof...&rdquo;.  Section 52(4) states that the price or compensation payable on the acquisition of a cultural object, where the Minister decides the common good is best served by its acquisition, shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  From where will that money come? Will it be included in the Estimate for the Minister's Department at the end of each year or will it take the form of a Supplementary Estimate for the specific acquisition of the object, which will not be balanced against the annual subvention to the national boards involved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal first with the tougher part of the Senator's question.  If I am being asked to state that the boards shall be immune to the cost of exercising this power, the answer is I cannot do so.  On the other hand, if it is being stated that this would involve an exceptional measure &mdash; I already indicated what is meant by &ldquo;moneys provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo;&mdash; I can provide the following assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one were obliged to make an acquisition for the sake of the heritage of the State and the people, it would be entirely wrong if that acquisition were allowed to deplete the budget of the institution involved.  I believe this is the basis of the Senator's point.  In that case it would be likely that a Supplementary Estimate would be introduced and the acquisition would not be allowed to dislodge the board from its functions. However, it is entirely different to state that the boards should be entirely immune from the <Col N="505" /> effects of a particular exercise and I cannot do so. With regard to exceptional circumstances where a substantial sum is involved, the exercise of which would dislodge the board from its functions, the more likely mechanism put in place would be the introduction of a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 52(1), is the Minister retaining the power to decide the common good as it relates to the acquisition of an object or is the function being devolved to the board? Subsection (1) states that whenever the owner of a cultural object to which this Part applies requests the return of the object, if it appears to the Minister that the common good requires that the object should be in the ownership, care and control of the State, the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, acquire the object by agreement of the owner thereof.  I raise this point because the subsection refers to the Minister, not the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may acquire the object and that is as it should be.  The Minister can be advised by the board, but the decision ultimately rests with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the funding mechanism will be different under the new statutes to establish the boards.  However, in recent years the board of the National Library approached the Minister seeking moneys to acquire an object of cultural value.  The board was informed that funding was not available to do so.  I do not wish to open a can of worms but I understand another cultural institution in the State applied to the Minister for lottery funds to acquire the object.  It was subsequently purchased, much to the chagrin of the National Library.  It would not be correct if, in the future, the National Library or National Museum wished to acquire an object but funding was refused by the Minister and another cultural institution could then use State funds, either wholly or substantially, to acquire the object.</P>
      <P>It is for this reason I am seeking assurances that, if the Minister acts upon a recommendation of the board which he believes to be in the common good, moneys will be made available.  I do not wish the Minister to repeat his earlier reply because everyone is becoming tired.  I merely want to ensure that moneys will be available if the other elements of the jigsaw fall into place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall providing £100,000 to the National Library for the acquisition of the DeVesci papers.  One must remember, however, that the section refers to a compulsory purchase, we are not discussing spending a day at an auction.  The Senator is referring to the confusing situation which could arise if an agency asked the Department to develop the capacity to make an offer for an object and another institution bid <Col N="506" /> against it for the acquisition.  The section provides the Minister with the power to arrange for the compulsory acquisition of an object.  However, as the Senator stated, there must be good coordination and other parts of the Bill deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>We engaged in a useful quasi-ideological discussion earlier in the debate, but the State should not be the principle sucker in the land simply because it has the right to purchase objects in the name of the Heritage Council and the people of Ireland.  I pay tribute to the dedicated individuals who donated papers to the people of Ireland, who stand with those who sold papers to the people of Ireland at a reasonable cost.  There is another group of individuals who sold private papers and papers relating to their areas of expertise at great personal benefit to themselves, sometimes within the country and sometimes outside it.  I am aware of the basis of the Senator's argument which relates to what I am trying to achieve.</P>

The Bill gives my Department the power to deal with the situation to which he referred.  A number of Senators raised this issue with me and I can inform the House that the Heritage Council is involved in active negotiations for the acquisition of the items.  The auction was to take place tomorrow but I understand an extra period of time was negotiated.  I am happy with the state of the negotiations involving the Heritage Council.  This again illustrates the benefit of placing the council on a statutory basis with precise functions and the legislation which did so was introduced in this House.</P>

The Minister indicated that over a million people visit the National Gallery each year.  Entry to the gallery is free.  The Minister has promised to consider the matter of entry charges.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to inhibit the commercial or fundraising activities of any of the institutions. However, it should be a matter of fundamental public policy that we should not introduce entry charges to the National Gallery, the National Museum and the National Library.</P>

This legislation brings all the cultural institutions under a similar regime.  That will be the effect of sections 25, 33, 34, 35, 40 and 60 taken together.</P>
      <P>I will examine the issue of charges between now and Report Stage in relation to a mechanism whereby the imposition of such charges would be a policy decision with a measure of accountability in the Oireachtas.</P>

I do not want to over-emphasise the point but I wish to advise the Minister that it will be my intention to go down to the wire in relation to public entry charges to our cultural institutions.  I am aware of the Minister's thinking in this regard and what he may propose.  I do not want to pre-empt the Report Stage debate, but if there is to be any division at this late stage it will be on this issue.  I am vehemently opposed to entry charges as a matter of public policy and I believe every Government should adopt that as a permanent feature of public policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very high level of contributions.  We have dealt with culture and heritage and all matters relating to them and a <Col N="510" /> great deal of idealism was evident.  For that reason I am reluctant to intervene at this stage with an aspect which might be regarded as crude commercialism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle, I do not have any objection to what is proposed.  However, I am concerned at how widely this section is drafted and I wish to raise a number of concerns.</P>
      <P>In view of the nature of these institutions is it wise or appropriate that we should introduce into them what I would, in broad terms, describe as the pub culture?  I do not wish to be too dramatic but I can visualise a situation where a coach load of somewhat inebriated and uncultured people would be turned loose within these institutions.</P>
      <P>The way section 61 is drafted is quite unusual in relation to liquor licensing.  The Minister becomes a licensing authority and he will issue a certificate and the Revenue Commissioners will have no option but to issue a licence on the strength of that certificate.  That is a very privileged position for these institutions to enjoy as opposed to those of us who must satisfy the courts, the Garda, the local authority and the Revenue Commissioners.  We are also disadvantaged because fundamental to all liquor licences has been section 2 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, as amended by the Acts of 1988 and 1995.  The licences that will be issued to these institutions will allow trading, in theory, at all times on the premises.  The crucial phrase in 61(6) states that: &ldquo;liquor may be consumed on such premises at any time during which members of the public are permitted to enter and remain on such premises&rdquo;.  Should events be so organised, this could mean 24 hours a day.  That is a unique advantage for these institutions.</P>
      <P>There are other somewhat similar institutions which have been granted a liquor licence in recent times and who have subcontracted that function.  It does not require much ingenuity on the part of that subcontractor to ensure that the public has access at all times.  Will the Minister reflect on this before Report Stage as it is a totally new aspect of the liquor licensing régime?</P>
      <P>There is another point arising from this.  How much of the National Library or the National Museum can be utilised as a public bar?  What are the constraints?  Will there be designated areas or will the entire premises be available for that purpose?  All these provisions mean that no offence can be committed and consequently no penalties can apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The major institutions mentioned in the legislation are the National Museum, the National Library, the National Gallery, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Hunt Museum and the Chester Beatty Library. Lest anyone think that they will turn into all night shebeens or places of the greatest debauchery, let me say that what they are seeking is the right to <Col N="511" /> sell alcoholic drink in their restaurants.  With the greatest respect I have to say to Senator Howard that this it is a perfectly normal requirement.  At the age of 56 and looking forward to such years as may be allowed to me, I may look forward to a glass if wine if I visit a cultural institution in the future.  I do not see why, if I go to the restaurant in one of these institutions, I should be precluded from that enjoyment on the grounds that there are a number of competing, marvellous pubs in the vicinity.  It is also important to bear in mind that I have listed the institutions involved.</P>
      <P>The notion of a subcontractor is a fantastic construction because such catering arrangements as might be entered into would be accountable to the board and the director and would have to meet the requirements of the institution.  I do not think that a situation would arise where the National Gallery was a pub with pictures or that the museum was a pub with objects in the back or that the library was a pub with books on the walls.  I do not think it will come to that.</P>
      <P>The certification powers I enjoy are the same as those enjoyed by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications as regards licensing at an aerodrome. The Senator need not be too worried because this is a specialist licence which already exists in some theatres and, at the other end of the spectrum, at greyhound racecourses.  It is to provide a facility such as would fit in with the purposes of the national cultural institutions.</P>
      <P>The normal provisions relating to intoxicating liquor licence holders will apply as regards licence fees, tax clearance, etc.  They will also be confined to the opening hours set out in the Bill and the standard penalties for non-compliance will apply.</P>

However, between now and Report Stage I will look at the text to see that the Bill achieves what is intended.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns of my friend and colleague Senator Howard.  Without anticipating the Minister's views, he is correct in this.  The provision brings us into line.  I do not drink myself so I should declare that interest.</P>

In the context in which the Minister has responded to Senator Howard's concerns, those being facilitated are people who enjoy the <Col N="512" /> interiors of our cultural institutions and wish to avail of a glass of wine or beer over a meal.</P>
      <P>My concern is with the Minister being involved in granting liquor licences.  He has said that a similar provision in respect of granting licences to aerodromes refers to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications but why should a Minister be involved?  Why can it not be left to the board?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That was precisely my reading of it.  It is a layer of bureaucracy.  The board will decide that it wishes to seek a licence and will communicate this to the Minister of the day who in turn will deliberate within his Department and convey his decision to the board and to the Revenue or alternatively, having conveyed his decision to the board, it will go to the Revenue. We have spoken about the board having wide flexibility and autonomy but in this provision it is caught in a bureaucratic act and must proceed along these lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The institution is responsible to the Minister who must be satisfied with the reasoning behind this application.  Other conditions must also be satisfied &mdash; the Revenue Commissioners have their own criteria.  This is a mechanism for making sure that it is not casually granted but goes through the proper procedures. It is not the relationship of an ordinary client to the licensing laws &mdash; I do not want to provoke Senator Howard into an exposition on that subject but one must be satisfied as to the character of the applicant for the licence, among other things.  In this case, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is responsible for these institutions and therefore, if they are to make an application, it is appropriate that he know the conditions under which the application will be forwarded.  The compliance with licensing regulations is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>This provides that those appointed under this section to become members of the governors and guardians of Marsh's Library would serve under broadly similar conditions to those applying to the boards of the National Museum and National Library.  One of these conditions is that such persons could be paid an allowance by the Minister for their participation.  This is standard practice, as we have mentioned in discussing another section. Other members of the board of governors and guardians of Marsh's Library do not receive remuneration and, accordingly, it has been clarified that ministerial nominees will not receive such payment.  This is by agreement with the board of Marsh's Library, with whom we have had the greatest co-operation and good will in relation to its inclusion, at its request, in this legislation.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister's amendment.  We should be most grateful to the guardians, the board and all the staff of Marsh's Library for the work they have done for centuries, particularly to Mrs. Muriel McCarthy for her stewardship of that institution.  The 1865 Act mentions that the governors of Marsh's Library declined to move their library to part of a building designed to receive it.  It is interesting to consider what would have happened to Marsh's Library if it had agreed to move and to be subsumed into the National Gallery/National Library complex.  The governors did us a great favour by keeping it as a unique little gem within Dublin.</P>

      <P>Is this a carryover from existing legislation or is it introducing new legislation to exempt all the institutions listed from (a) to (i)? If so, does the same apply to other institutions of a cultural nature across the country or are they rated by local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, we are not yet in occupation of Collins' Barracks.  The provision relates to future acquisitions and future occupancy.  The museum might move part of its collection to Turlough House in Castlebar, for example, and this provision is to protect such future movement.</P>
      <P>The rest of the provision is to create consistency.  It provides that any property occupied by certain cultural institutions, bodies whose remit comes within the sphere of arts and heritage, should be exempt from the rate chargeable by a local authority.  The provision is designed to ensure that there is and will be consistency of treatment in the matter of local authority rates in respect of each listed body.  The museum and library are established as corporate entities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the rating position of this country's cultural institutions continues to be founded on the Scientific Societies Act, 1843, which provides that scientific and fine arts societies are to be exempt from rating.  This provision is founded on the definition of the arts in the middle of the 19th century which extended to scientific and fine arts societies.  It is not yet established that the National Museum and National Library or the Heritage Council would automatically be <Col N="515" /> adjudged scientific societies for rates exemption purposes.</P>
    <P>In addition, while a centrally important cultural institution, the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Kilmainham has managed to retain rates exemption in respect of its activities; the Abbey Theatre, also centrally important, has been refused rates exemption.  The Bill, therefore, ensures that certain listed cultural institutions including the National Museum and the National Library, engaged exclusively in the fields of the arts and heritage, should be exempt from rates.</P>
    <P>Other provisions enhancing the independence of cultural institutions include a facility permitting the issue of intoxicating liquor licences for certain key collecting institutions.  Only those bodies with important collections and under the aegis of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will be included.  The listed institutions either come directly under the aegis of the Minister or arise from the special arrangements agreed between the Minister and the Arts Council involving the National Concert Hall, the Museum of Modern Art and the Abbey Theatre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in suggesting that this is a pre-emptive strike by the Minister?  If it had been left to the good offices of the local authorities concerned, they might have moved very quickly to protect their turf in this regard.  Is this essentially an initiative on the Minister's part to protect these cultural institutions?  Is it also an indication that he will extend this list?  Does he have that right?  The section seems to be very specific.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the Abbey Theatre.  I am amazed that the Abbey Theatre is not exempt from rates.  The Minister should include it in this provision.  The theatre could have some section of the building set aside for museum purposes.</P>

      <P>This is very straightforward.  It extends the definition of &ldquo;material&rdquo; to include compact disc. I am including compact disc because &mdash; the Minister refered to this earlier in another context &mdash; more and more information on the information superhighway is stored on CD ROM. I know CD ROM is the current technology and I deliberately omitted using that term because it may in the future be superseded by something else.  By using the term compact disc, material will be protected under the legislation, irrespective of what format CD it is stored on.  The consensus in the industry at the moment is that most if not all present and future information will be stored on compact disc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the importance of the film archive and the O'Leary collection in particular.  On Second Stage Senators raised the issue of material being deposited in the library that might be held in other institutions, such as the film archive.  I am pleased to say that the library is currently in discussion with the film archive as to how it might co-operate with the library in the administration of the copyright provisions set out in section 63 as it affects film library material.  I am glad to be able to inform the House that I hope to be in a position, as a result of this discussion and once agreement has been reached between the library and the film archive, to use my powers under section 46 to designate the Film Institute of Ireland as a body appropriate to receive deposit material on long-term loan from the National Library.</P>
      <P>The film archive owes a great deal to the pioneering work of Liam O'Leary among others. I would like to think that were he alive he would take some satisfaction from the film archive collection being enabled, through the mechanisms in this Bill, to form a cornerstone of a new national collection of film material relating to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" /> On foot of representations I have received in recent days from many interested parties, I am also examining whether there is potential for the provisions set out in this section to be further strengthened for the purpose of enabling the National Library acquire library material in relation to Ireland more comprehensively.  If so, it would be my intention to bring forward amendments to this section on Report Stage.  This has gathered momentum and other bodies are now involved.  There have been intimations that Trinity College wishes to be part of these arrangements.  Between now and Report Stage I hope to be able to report considerable progress in relation to this.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister.  I know of his great interest in film and I am delighted to see that he has moved so far in this direction.  One of the most cheering things about this Bill has been the number of representations we have all had from a diverse body of people.  It is very good to see that so many people are encouraged by the legislation and by the Minister's attitude to it that they feel if they have good ideas they can bring them forward.  I am delighted that some people have contacted the Minister directly rather than coming through some of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting the amendment.  I appreciate that the term &ldquo;sound recordings&rdquo; covers this.  I was concerned about the copyright implications and that some people could get around it.  I echo Senator Henry's well deserved kind words to the Minister. It is heartening that he is moving so fast to ensure this important area of cultural life will be protected and enhanced.</P>
      <P>Am I to assume from the Minister's comments that he intends to strengthen the film archive? For a moment I thought he was going to say that it will be created and maintained within the confines of the National Library, which does not have enough room to exhibit what it already possesses.  The Minister referred earlier to the national attic, which is a pretty good definition of the items which the National Library has not exhibited.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister moving in the direction of strengthening, expanding and resourcing the Irish Film Archive and bringing it into line with similar archives in the developed world?  As he correctly pointed out, we have an enormous film heritage, not just within the Irish film industry from the 1920s onwards but also in regard to Irish people who developed cinematic techniques in Hollywood.  There are films still extant which should be incorporated in the archive.  Without asking the Minister to be more specific, is that his intention?  Is a legislative device required to enable him to do that or can he do it by expanding the existing resources?</P>

The library's discussions with the Film Institute of Ireland in respect of the film archive have been very positive and co-operative.

      <P>When that matter is sorted out, I want to look at possibilities between now and Report Stage of strengthening the power of the library to acquire material related to Ireland.

      <P>The Minister is aware of the prohibitive cost of the maintenance and restoration of film.  I appreciate that in embarking upon this imaginative exercise he will, with the best will in the world, be frustrated by a lack of funding.  I hope he will use his undoubted energy to ensure that many of these films are not lost.  In the Hollywood archives, Technicolor film plates from as late as the 1950s were found to have deteriorated to an irreparable extent.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the need to move quickly on this matter.  I will encourage him and give him every support to ensure this exciting dimension of the debate is developed further.</P>

      <P>This section relates to the power of disposal and is an amendment of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994.  Subsection (2)(a), which refers to the waiver of ownership in and disposal of archaeological objects by the State, states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where, after the commencement of this section, an archaeological object becomes the property of the State, the Director may, at his or her discretion, waive the ownership of the State in such object if he or she is of the <Col N="520" /> opinion that the object is not of sufficient archaeological or historical interest to justify its retention by the State and the Director may dispose of the object by whatever means he or she thinks fit.</P>
    <P>We dwelt on this matter in some detail earlier in the debate.  I am raising it under this section because I have a fear that the disposal of property which it is decided is not of any great interest to the State could lead to public controversy.  Is the Minister satisfied that in granting this power, which seems fairly sweeping in its implications, due caution will be exercised?  Is he also satisfied that we will not end up with screaming newspaper headlines about an object which they consider to be of intrinsic value because perhaps an individual decides so?  Is he concerned that in such circumstances we will have a <i>cause celébre</i> and that we may go down the same road as we did with the Chief Herald, the Genealogical Office and the Royal Court of Arms etc., because a small vocal minority decide to write to <i>The Irish Times</i>?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision allows for flexibility of practice.  For example, it allows the Director of the National Museum to decide that a pot in the ground should be left where it is and not be moved to the museum, thereby preventing it from being filled with everything that is rooted up.  I do not wish to appear felicitous on this because everything carries its own story, reflects the history of those involved with it and should be treated with great care.  Section 67(2)(a) states:</P>
      <P>...the Director may, at his or her discretion, waive the ownership of the State in such object if he or she is of the opinion that the object is not of sufficient archaeological or historical interest to justify its retention by the State...</P>
      <P>The House will note that, in the interests of gender occupancy of posts such as that of the Director, I have provided for the terms &ldquo;him&rdquo; and &ldquo;her&rdquo; in this and most other legislation.  This provides that if the Director's advice is sought and if the item is less valuable than those which constitute the national collection he or she will have the authority to decide that it may be left where it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to think of a subject that has more direct relevance to every member of the public than the safety of the food they eat. <Col N="522" /> It is, therefore, understandable that anything which endangers the safety of their food or which interferes with their confidence in and enjoyment of their food must be taken seriously.</P>
      <P>My Department has, from its inception, recognised its responsibility in this area and based its regulations on the basic concept that only food fit for human consumption should be placed on the market for sale to consumers.  This philosophy of consumer protection continues to guide the Department and the eight health boards who enforce the various regulations.  I am also conscious of the role a supply of good, safe food plays in the overall health of the population.  My Department invests heavily in promoting the importance of a good, balanced diet.  It does so from a well grounded recognition that the achievement of a balanced diet, together with other lifestyle issues, is one of the most significant aspects of our preventive health care strategy. Food safety, in its widest sense, is, therefore, first and foremost a public health issue.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that there is a considerable degree of confusion among consumers about food and related issues.  This is a reflection of unease about many modern day production and processing practices.  The BSE crisis has highlighted these concerns in a very dramatic way.  There is also an ongoing level of concern about many of the chemicals used throughout the food chain, from the fertilisers used to promote growth to the preservatives used to prolong the shelf life of products.</P>
      <P>Many of us share consumers' concerns, but it is important to point out that, for the most part, food is safer now than at any time in history.  The standards of hygiene and general control applied to, for example, our water supply are greater than at any time in the past.  This is also true of the vast majority of food production and processing establishments.  However, the consumer is sceptical and we must recognise that this scepticism is, in some instances, well founded.  We must deal with it in a number of ways.  In the first instance, we must ensure that our law and regulations on food are kept up to date and, more importantly, enforced properly and effectively. Equally, it is critical to consumers' confidence that they are satisfied about the effectiveness of the controls.  It is clearly not enough to enforce the controls; we must be seen to do so.</P>
      <P>When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I do not mean just the authorities answerable to the Department of Health, or other Departments.  It must be clearly stated that everyone involved in the production and processing of food has a responsibility in this regard.  I include in that farmers and fishermen, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and caterers and any other party with responsibility for the handling of food.  Apart from the fact that it is in their interest to observe the highest standards, they have a clear duty and responsibility to discharge honourably their role in the protection of the public's health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> I drew attention earlier to the need for a well balanced view about the current state of food safety.  I also wish to emphasise that I am satisfied that the great majority of producers and processors and others involved in the industry meet their responsibilities.  I am clear about the different criteria to be satisfied when considering food safety.  I indicated that the public health aspects take top priority but more general concerns about consumer protection and confidence are also considered as major issues. Many aspects of these criteria are inter-related and this is also true when considering the economic and financial importance of the issue, especially for people in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are blessed with an environment that is still among the cleanest in Europe.  This, together with the natural advantages conferred on us by climate and soil, make Ireland one of the most favoured places in Europe for the production of clean, safe food.  As a nation, it would be unforgivable if we failed to take full advantage of these natural assets and it would be madness in the extreme if, for some ill-conceived idea of short sighted gain, we were to endanger the opportunities nature and years of hard work by all involved have provided.</P>
    <P>Our food industry is, without doubt, one of our great natural assets.  It is the responsibility of Government and industry to ensure we maximise the benefits and do nothing to endanger its potential.  It is against this background that the Government, in March this year, instituted a comprehensive review of food safety.  The review was carried out by an interdepartmental group of senior officials.  It focused on the control regimes involved and made many useful observations and recommendations.  It confirmed that high standards apply in almost all cases and that this is verified by probing reviews and analysis conducted not only by the EU but also by authorities in major markets, such as Japan and the USA.</P>
    <P>In many instances, Ireland is among few European states whose beef and other products are allowed access to those rigorously controlled markets.  We can draw considerable comfort and satisfaction from that, but we cannot be complacent.  The Government recognised its obligations to the consumers of our food, as well as the long-term value and potential of our food industry, particularly the importance of retaining public confidence in it, and this is why it accepted the recommendations of the review group.</P>
    <P>The group recommended the reorganisation of controls for certain specific products to ensure a clearer line of authority.  This will ensure better, more efficient controls in those areas.  Most importantly, the group recommended that a new body should be established which, in the first instance, could satisfy itself on the basis of full scale audits about the manner and extent of the control regimes operated by the various official agencies and, secondly, which could communicate <Col N="524" /> that information to consumers.  As a result, Members will be aware of the Government's decision to establish the Food Safety Board of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health expects to introduce legislation early in 1997 for the establishment of the board but at this stage I would like to set out for Members some important and essential aspects of the board and its remit.  It will be established on the basis of its own primary legislation.  The House will appreciate that this represents the strongest possible commitment by the Government to the question of food safety. The board will come under the aegis of the Minister for Health, thereby placing it firmly in the public health area but it will be given the maximum degree of independence possible in its operation.  That is vitally important and will add credibility and authority to its pronouncements.</P>
    <P>It will have a wide and comprehensive range of legal powers.  It will, for example, be able to establish standards for the hygiene and safety of food in areas where none currently exist, thereby ensuring that safety standards are not compromised by outdated legislation.  It will have all the powers necessary for the conduct of its audits of other agencies, including powers to enter premises, seize goods, see and, where necessary, seize records.  It will be given powers to prosecute agencies which are not discharging their obligations and it will also have powers to prosecute operators or outlets failing to comply with legal standards.</P>
    <P>The board will also be required to publish reports of its audits.  I consider this to be of central importance and when taken together with the degree of independence it will have and the range of powers available to it, I am satisfied its reports will quickly become major and authoritative statements on the status of Irish food.  It is also my view that regardless of any other organisational or structural changes undertaken now or in the future in the food control regime in Ireland, the board as envisaged will serve an essential, long-term function as an independent and powerful assessor of our food safety standards.  It is no longer sufficient that the regulators should assess themselves, we need an independent and credible body to provide the reassurance demanded by our consumers.</P>
    <P>I am convinced the establishment of the new board represents a radical and innovative step in the development of our food controls and, to underline the Government's commitment to this subject, the Minister for Health has already established an interim board.  It has already met and is engaged in drawing up work plans.  I look forward to this interim board coming forward with ideas and suggestions which, I hope, we will be able to incorporate into the new legislation.  I am confident we have emerged from recent difficulties with a better understanding of the need for total transparency in relation to food safety and the new board will be a strong and powerful vehicle to deliver it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  The BSE scare has done enormous damage to small farmers, particularly in County Donegal where they depend on cattle for their livelihoods.  While I do not want to be political, the Government has not done enough to convince the consumer about food safety.  It is not good enough for people to say beef is safe.  The Minister will agree that seeing the British Prime Minister, John Major, on television eating a slice of beef will not convince the consumer.  The consumption of beef has reached an all time low and while nobody is responsible for this, we have not done enough to resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>I come from farming stock and I know from talking to beef producers what needs to be done. Before we convince the consumer it is safe to eat beef, we will have to remove cows from the food chain.  This cost of doing so will be more than offset by restored consumer confidence in the beef industry.  Cows are dosed for mastitis and injected at least six times a year during their average ten year life span.  If the Government has the courage to take all cows out of the food chain, it will do much to restore confidence among those who buy beef.</P>
      <P>My children have refused to eat beef until drastic measures are taken.  However, we are only tinkering with the problem.  We complain about the Russians and others who refuse to eat our beef.  However, those who buy beef are entitled to be selective.  I ask the Minister to take a positive approach to this problem.  Although I do not have the full answer, we will only make progress when we take cows out of the food chain and compensate farmers for so doing.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the Food Safety Board, but I have some reservations.  I am sceptical because it will only cover food production in this country which comprises a small part of food on sale.  I listened to my colleague, Senator Quinn, give a detailed account of the way his company inspects the production of food products on sale in his supermarkets and I compliment him on that.  If the company is not satisfied with a product, it will not continue to purchase it.  That is admirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fruit, including grapes used to make wine, and vegetables are sprayed with pesticides.  How can the Food Safety Board guarantee the safety of food produced in Italy or another country? People may say this should be dealt with at European level.  However, it will be difficult to implement the objectives of this new board.  How will we deal with a container of chickens which comes across the Border or from the UK or Europe?  Where will the inspection take place? This new food board will be only partially successful.  On this side of the Border I see the containers of food lining up at Dundalk and elsewhere.  Any of the ferries leaving tonight will be loaded with 30 or 40 heavy vehicles.  How is it proposed to police and monitor food production all over Europe and further afield?  I have yet to <Col N="526" /> be convinced, as has the consumer.  This is a crucial time, especially given that we are trying to contribute to the confidence of the consumer. The Bill's intentions are admirable but I am concerned at its prospects for success.  The Minister of State should take into consideration that he is dealing with a public that is very hard to convince.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not go far enough.  There should have been linkage and European involvement. All Europe is involved in the BSE crisis.  Why did we not broaden our scope and tell Europe to get its act together as this affects all of us?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I too welcome the establishment of the Food Safety Board of Ireland.  I do not speak as one who has any experience of agriculture but on behalf of the consumer, and the Food Safety Board is concerned with the consumer.  As a strong agricultural country, we rely heavily on food exports and on employment in the producing and the processing sectors of the agricultural business.  Such exports are worth 80 per cent our GNP.  The industry is a massive one in this country and that is why consumer confidence at home and abroad is so important.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Board is being established on the basis that the existing regulatory systems in the Departments of Health, Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Environment were inadequate and inefficient.  The board will have a double-edged impact.  Its creation as a policy agency will force all statutory bodies to improve standards of control for fear of investigation, and standard tests and investigation will address the specific problems.</P>
      <P>The board will have powers to close food processing businesses that do not reach the required standards, and also substandard food can be seized and destroyed and fines can be imposed.  It will have powers to investigate what the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and especially veterinary officials, should be doing in meat plants.  Its officials can seek records and if they do not receive the required co-operation they will then have power to requisition records they are not given freely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board will be set up on a statutory basis when new legislation is introduced later this year. This Bill will ensure that it has powers to draw up binding hygiene and safety standards for any food sector or product.  No such standard currently exists in EU and national law.  The board's staff would then be given full powers of enforcement including the rights to enter premises, to seize and destroy contaminated foods and to seize records.  It would also have powers of prosecution.  In the majority of cases it is unlikely that prosecution will take place. Instead, the board would have the authority to publish all reports of its audits, as the Minister of State has explained, and it is expected that this would ensure compliance by all parties.  The publication of regular comprehensive reports <Col N="527" /> without the necessity to receive permission from the Minister will be seen as central to the board's work.  If an adverse finding is being made against any agency, they can be shown the findings before publication and advised to make public comment on them.</P>
    <P>The challenges that face the new board are truly enormous.  It will be charged with responsibility for ensuring the maximum achievable standards of food quality for the home and export market.  The consumer and exporter will be critical and demanding.  There is a crisis of confidence among consumers about agriculture and about the food we eat.  Perhaps it is unfair to blame farmers, although some at least are responsible.  We all want cheap food and many of us ignore the chemical and commercial shortcuts which were taken along the way.  Ecological and environmental concerns often took second place through silent consensus.  This has to come to an end now and the board must insist on that.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to blame all farmers but some must take responsibility for the situation we now find ourselves in.  It is difficult to understand how cattle can now develop BSE when the feeding of bonemeal was prohibited since 1990.  Some of these cattle would have been born since then.  It would appear that some farmers are insisting on feeding their cattle with contaminated bonemeal.</P>
    <P>Second, the consumer has been shocked to see farmers in court recently charged with injecting their cattle with the illegal growth promoter clenbuterol or angel dust.  Any farmer who participates in this illegal practice does not deserve to be allowed to farm any longer and should be prohibited from farming altogether. Court fines and imprisonment are insufficient punishment for that illegal activity.  We also have recently read with concern the Consumers' Association report on the use of antibiotics in pigs.</P>
    <P>Finally, we now have a situation where a Garda investigation has taken place in at least three areas in the country where farmers are alleged to have contaminated their herds with BSE so as to make it worthwhile for them to claim generous compensation from the State on having their herds culled.</P>
    <P>It would be unfortunate if the board was to confine its attention to the food processing industry alone.  The feedstuffs with chemicals, antibiotics and pesticides used in the production of food should be carefully monitored and regulated.  If the board is to police food safety and effectively, it must have the capacity to enforce standards on the use of these chemicals.  It must ensure that these chemicals are only available to the general public by way of licence and prescription.</P>
    <P>If there is a logic in setting up this board, it is that it will be totally independent of the vested interests which have dominated farming and food for the past 50 years.  The mentality that allows the farming lobby to insist that more of their <Col N="528" /> people should be on An Bord Bia has to be resisted because it is not in the national interest or the farmers' interest.</P>
    <P>Selecting a board to generate public confidence was an important first step and the Minister has succeeded in achieving this with the personnel that have been appointed to the board under the chairmanship of Dr. Daniel O'Hare.  I welcome Dr. O'Hare to the House.  The board must be seen by the consumer as being totally independent and I believe the composition of the new board has achieved this.</P>
    <P>For the first time farmers and farm producers are not directly represented on the food advisory board.  The Director of Consumer Affairs, Mr. William Fagan, only agreed to be a member of the board if it was genuinely independent and had a strong consumer representation.  He is quoted as saying &ldquo;This is genuinely a board which is independent of the food industry.&rdquo;  It is in the interest of producers that the board is independent of them since it has to be seen by the consumer to be separate from the food industry.  Mr. Fagan also agreed to join the board on the condition that its members would be involved in the drafting of legislation to put it on a statutory basis, and I concur with his views.</P>
    <P>The food industry has a great deal to be proud of in this country but the BSE crisis and other irregularities have highlighted the consumer's awareness and anxieties and have imposed new demands to which there must be a response.  The present controversies and upheavals have the potential to do enormous good in unifying producers, Government and food processors.  The food advisory board will play an important part in helping to achieve this.  I wish the members of the board every success in carrying out their duties and functions.</P>

      <P>I welcome the setting up of the Food Safety Board.  It is about time consumers had some say and control over the quality of food that they buy.  I compliment, in particular, the Consumer Association of Ireland on its efforts in the past to expose the unfortunate episodes which have occurred with food in this country.  The Minister has been extremely lucky with the worthy people he has to serve on the board under the chairmanship of Dr. O'Hare and I hope they will be allowed to co-opt any professionals they need should they require more expertise in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it would be much better if the legislation and regulations which exist were enforced.  For example, the dispute with the environmental health officers is nearly a year old and has not been settled.  They are in the front line in maintaining proper standards of hygiene <Col N="529" /> in the handling of food on behalf of the public. These officers refuse to implement any legislation which has been introduced since 1981 until the dispute is settled.  Environmental health officers inspect retail outlets to ensure they are in compliance with the food hygiene regulations, which were introduced in 1950 but which were greatly amended in 1989.  The public has little awareness of these regulations and does not realise that there is a lack of enforcement.  The main aspiration is to trace meat back to farms with infected animals so that confidence can be restored in the beef trade, but these officers have to enforce such traceability.</P>
    <P>The food labelling legislation introduced by the Department of Industry and Commerce but enforced by the officers on an agency basis is not being monitored either, nor is the food composition legislation.  Unscrupulous producers could have a field day and the public is unaware that it is unprotected.  The officers are also in charge of monitoring the recent legislation on food stalls.  During the summer there were many festivals and stalls went uninspected.  While there are many reputable mobile canteens, there are also substandard operations and many of these went back on the road again when it was realised that they would not be inspected.</P>
    <P>There is discussion about the high level of antibiotics in food at present and I am sure the Minister realises that even the sampling of food for microbiological analysis has been greatly reduced.  It occurs in Dublin and Cork only because centres were in existence there before 1981.  Similarly the training of staff in how to deal with food hygienically in outlets is being carried out solely in Dublin because there was an establishment training people there before 1981. The environmental health officers have been responsible in the investigation of food poisoning. Technically, there has been a halt in these investigations, with only emergency cover in place; but the officers realise that it is a serious problem and that there are many hazards in the modern production of food if techniques are not properly implemented.  For example, it is particularly important that the reheating of food is done scrupulously.  As a gesture of goodwill to the public, officers are investigating all reported cases of food poisoning.</P>
    <P>Regulations are due to be introduced here to coincide with those in Europe.  They are hazard analysis critical point regulations and are the keynote to food safety heading into the next century.  This dispute must be settled as it has gone on for too long.  The regulations must be enforced by the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>Another problem is the involvement of so many Departments in the regulation of food safety.  For example, there was a great problem in the past with shellfish.  The Department of Health regulated the sale of shellfish here, but the Department of Marine regulated export sales. That was solved during the summer so that <Col N="530" /> Parisians are entitled to the same standard of healthcare regarding their mussels as we are, but a problem still remains.  During the summer neurotoxins which cause paralysis were produced in areas of the south.  They are far more serious than the toxins produced by shellfish, which cause diarrhoea.  The Department was not in complete control because the Department of the Marine still has control of large scale producers.  That situation needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>There is great confusion regarding water also. The Environmental Protection Agency has produced a report on water quality in Ireland between 1991 and 1995.  It pointed out that there was an upward trend in water pollution here through animal manure and artificial fertilisers. While I do not want to suggest that the safety of drinking water is badly affected, the quality of water has deteriorated by 5 per cent and its taste and odour are seriously affected in some areas. This is due mainly to agriculture and better sewage facilities have been put in.  The over application of inorganic phosphorous is serious. Section 2.25 of this report mentions a recent Irish/UK study which says that the recommended application rates here are two to three times those in England and Wales of the same crop and conditions.  Why is that?  Soils no longer deficient in phosphorous are being fertilised annually.  The saving of £25 million a year could be made if attention was paid to it and the use of fertiliser more intelligently applied.  Overgrazing of sheep has to be addressed.  In section 2.30 it is recommended that alternative schemes to headage payments must be urgently introduced and that effective interdepartmental and inter-institutional channels of communication need to be established.</P>
    <P>The same applies to consumer concerns regarding pesticides and antibiotics.  An organochloride pesticide called lindane is being more widely used than ever.  It has not been proved to be carcinogenic but it remains in the soil and the food chain.  I received a letter from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in January 1995 in which he said that the samples of food analysed for pesticides' residue showed they were below EU directives.  Should they exist?  Should antibiotic residues be in our food? How important are they in the development of multiple resistant antibiotics in this country?  The serious effects of pesticides are often not recognised until decades after their use and our clean, green image will depend on reducing pesticide, antibiotic and additive use to an absolute minimum if they cannot be completely excluded.  Let us hope statements are no longer heard such as &ldquo;no scientific report to date has conclusively proved any adverse effect on human life.&rdquo;  That implies we need to wait for a body count.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lack of balance in the application of the regulations.  In one sense they are overly stringent and in another they are far <Col N="531" /> too lax.  To put in practical terms some of the things which Senator Henry said, I find it disgusting to see ice being made in pubs with ordinary water.  I find it more disgusting to see unwrapped mince in fancy restaurants which has been handled by 20, 30 or 100 people whose fingers carry, all sorts of germs.  I have asked restaurant owners on many occasions how they can have any idea of service and quality and have unwrapped mince in restaurants where a person pays as much as £20, £30, £40 or £50 per meal? There is a lack of understanding and people need to be educated about hygiene.  That is just an example of the practicalities and I do not have time to develop that point.</P>
      <P>We passed an abattoirs Bill some years ago.  In terms of what the Minister is trying to achieve, that is, the ability to trace beef back to the farm from which it came, that Bill did more damage than any farmer to date.  Prior to that Bill, the local butcher bought an animal, slaughtered it in his own slaughter house and sold it across the counter as a quality product which he could guarantee.  Nowadays, a butcher in Dingle, County Kerry, might buy meat from a place 100 miles away.  He cannot guarantee the quality of the product.  This is the reality.  We do not need scientific evidence as the Minister has only to talk to people who sell meat in butcher shops and they will tell him that the problem is people do not know what they are eating.  People do not want to stop eating beef, it is just that they have no confidence in it because they do not know from where it is coming and, as a result, they do not know what it contains.  If people who know those who rear the animal, slaughter and sell it, they will be able to say that the meat is clean as the animal never left such and such a farm.  That will restore consumer confidence.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider amending the Abattoirs Act. It is overly stringent and regressive in many areas.</P>
      <P>The same applies to finding a balance with regard to hygiene.  For instance, most meat factories are washed down with pressure hoses. The idea of somebody using water from the ordinary supply on hot, freshly killed beef is anathema.  When I learned about butchering at a very young age, one cleaned it down without using water.  We heard what Senator Henry said about the contents of water.  Freshly killed meat is cleaned with water which may contain pesticides, and that might be the least of what it contains.  We need to take care in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have put too much pressure on vegetable outlets.  I am not sure what my colleague, Senator Quinn, will say about this but every time I go to the south of France I am amazed at the quality of vegetables which Superquinn or any other store in Ireland would not accept because they would not comply with the stringent regulations with regard to shape, size, etc..  Those of us who are lucky enough to live in rural areas can get the best quality vegetables even though they are rejected by stores because they are the wrong <Col N="532" /> size, etc.  People take photographs of vegetable displays in towns in Provence, France, but such vegetables would not be allowed onto the shelves of local Irish shops because they do not comply with the European grading system to which we are slaves.  The rest of Europe concentrates on hygiene rather than shape.</P>
    <P>The price of beef in Ireland at present, as the Minister knows, is approximately 50 per cent higher than the world price.  Ireland is selling overpriced beef into intervention.  There are people using growth promoters to produce bigger animals and more meat than we want.  It is unnecessary and there is no reason to reward them.  The subsidy should recognise that the industry is losing 8,000 or 9,000 farmers per year. We should be protecting farmers rather than their produce.  Giving a subsidy for every animal means the big operator is rewarded and more meat is produced than is required.  If we move towards the world price of beef, the use of growth promoters or hormone implants would no longer be commercially viable.  Therefore, the animals produced would be normal in size, they would go through a normal selling process and farmers would be better off at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The price of milk in Ireland at present is twice the world price.  People are buying milk quotas at prices which are more or less equal to the world price.  They pay 45p or 50p per gallon to buy quotas in order to sell them for 90p.  That is completely wrong and it is creating the whole problem in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I hope Dr. O'Hare will home in on the issue of additives.  When I am buying a product, I would like to be able to read the ingredients, contents and additives in a way which makes sense.  I would like to know what is E 100 and E 120, etc., what is and is not dangerous and, as Senator Henry said, what contains only a little or a great deal of poison or toxins.</P>
    <P>Organic farming needs to be developed and supported, and resources should be given to that area.  There is a market for free range poultry and organic produce.  However, the industry must be regulated because people will lose faith in it if it is discovered they are buying something which was not produced organically.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Henry for sharing her time with me.  I wish the new food watchdog and Dr. O'Hare, in particular, the best of luck and I congratulate the Minister on beginning this process.  I hope it is successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>My party welcomes the proposed establishment of the Food Safety Board of Ireland.  For far too long the food industry has been dominated by the notion that the producer is king and that has permeated the minds of farmers, the representative farming organisations and possibly some sections of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Unfortunately, it has some basis in fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a wider level, the Common Agricultural Policy has in part protected many agricultural <Col N="533" /> producers from the rigours of market forces faced by industrial workers and others.  When the history of our times is eventually written, I will not be surprised to see a chapter on the triumph of the market.  In the western world, during the 1980s, absolutist ideas on the value of the market and its benefits held sway.  Thankfully, these ideas are not widely held at present by sensible people, except for the Progressive Democrats, but the collapse of the Soviet bloc and its command based economies has left the market in an ascendant position.</P>
    <P>The consumer is the king in a market economy. Consumers judge the worth of an array of products before them and make decisions accordingly.  In the food area, that array of products is wider than ever before.  If there is the slightest doubt about the quality of one product, there are many others from which consumers can choose.</P>
    <P>I worked as a butcher for approximately eight years at a time when the buzz word was &ldquo;hygiene&rdquo;.  People were only concerned about whether one washed one's hands and wore a clean coat and apron.  One did not wear a hat or gloves and the only disease prevalent at the time was TB.  Sickness did not originate from food because the producers were very responsible. Today, however, there is much discussion about preservatives, antibiotics, chemicals, injections, environmental health officers and various restrictions.  The situation has worsened and we must ask whether people are becoming careless and greedy and if a deterioration in the environment has brought about the current difficulties.</P>
    <P>Since the British Government's declaration in March that there may be a link between BSE and the human disease, CJD, the consumer has taken over.  We may argue that the British acted irresponsibly and we may resent the extent to which outside interests link our economy with theirs.  However, regardless of the way this issue is considered, the results are clear.  Consumption of and demand for beef have decreased considerably.  Senator O'Toole made the point that the reduction in the price of beef has not been passed on to the consumer.  The European Union's capacity to intervene is diminishing. There will come a time, sooner rather than later, when Europe's voters will refuse to intervene to purchase products no one wants to buy.  Reform of CAP and moves toward the globalisation of world trade will only compound the problem.</P>
    <P>Ireland is relatively free of BSE, but not as free as it should be.  Clearly there have been breaches of regulation relating to the use of bone meal in the feeding of ruminants.  Nonetheless the country is relatively free of the disease.  Irish beef is of good quality and we insist on better food standards than many of our European counterparts.  However, this is of no consequence in the context of a general scare about a product. For example, news reports in Russia led to a bizarre ban on produce from three Irish counties. <Col N="534" /> Producers' groups, particularly the IFA, do not understand this.  The IFA, aided and abetted by Fianna Fáil, is flailing about seeking political targets and those responsible for the problems faced by its members.  These are complex problems and they require solutions which will address long established difficulties in the industry.</P>
    <P>Everyone welcomes the establishment of the Food Safety Board.  This is a step toward ensuring that Irish food is not only of high quality but is seen to be so, which is an important distinction. The board should have been established many years ago.  Had it been, the difficulties we face today might not be as pronounced.</P>
    <P>Since the food crisis developed members of Fianna Fáil have made many statements, but this is as much to hide their culpability as it is to highlight the real issues.  Despite Fianna Fáil's holding the Agriculture portfolio for seven years, no food board of any kind was established.  It is no surprise that many of the issues about which that party is currently excited arise solely from its failures in Government.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the atmosphere in which the board will be instituted.  I do not doubt that it is the Government's intention to establish a vigorous, active and independent board; the appointment of Danny O'Hare, President of Dublin City University, is a testament to that fact. However, I sense a perception in some quarters that the establishment of this food authority is a short-term response to a short-term problem.  If it is to be successful, the new board must be given the capacity to set and enforce standards in food safety; it must be seen to be independent of vested interests and existing groups; it must have the capacity and resources to conduct research; it must be staffed by people committed to its purpose not by those associated with the existing <i>status quo</i> and it must set out to reassure the customer of the quality of its approved produce. In short, it must win the respect of the public at large.</P>
    <P>I believe the board can succeed in another important task, namely, bring about a change in the mindset of Irish food producers.  This is a critical issue and time is not on our side.  Many consumers have already turned their backs on certain food products and they are becoming more discerning.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's decision.  I wish the new members of the board and its chairman well in the difficult job they face.  If used correctly, the board marks the first step in changing our attitude to the food industry.  It is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss.  Food, as an industry, is too important to the country and is a potential vehicle for further economic growth but, the industry could also decline.  The choice is ours and we must make it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1996, the Government decided to undertake a review of the food and safety systems in operation in Ireland.  The group <Col N="535" /> charged with carrying out the review was chaired by Mr. John Hurley, Secretary of the Department of Finance, and the remaining members comprised senior officials from the Departments of Health, Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Marine, the Environment, Enterprise and Employment and Tourism and Trade.  Not one person from outside the Civil Service was involved.  The group finalised its report in July 1996.  Is it not amazing that this report was never published?  Instead, the Government decided to establish an interim board and issued a press release to that effect.</P>
      <P>I cannot find any legislation which allows this board to operate.  Perhaps that is the reason it is called an &ldquo;interim board&rdquo;.  The press release stated that the board was established on foot of &ldquo;a Government decision&rdquo;.  In view of the urgency of the situation, the Government stated that the board should be established on an interim basis. It did not state the nature of the urgency and one can only speculate in this regard.  We can only assume that the food industry is in a very serious state <i>a propos</i> quality and safety.</P>
      <P>There are now major questions regarding the safety of one of our most trusted industries.  This is unhelpful, coming as it does, on the heels of problems relating to BSE.  If the Government was concerned about BSE when it referred to the need for urgency, it should have stated as much. If not, I suggest the Minister of State explain the findings and publish the report because the present situation is very damaging and a negative image is being transmitted to foreign customers. I need not mention that it is also undermining the confidence of Irish consumers.</P>
      <P>To date, the only available information relating to the report was issued in the form of a press release from the Department of Health entitled &ldquo;The Establishment of a Food Safety Board in Ireland&rdquo;.  I quote:</P>
      <P>The board will be established by new, primary legislation to be introduced in early 1997.  The primary function of the board is its audit and supervisory role in relation to other food control agencies.</P>
      <P>It is stated that the board have a relatively modest staff complement.  It is patently obvious that the board is merely intended to police the operations of other control agencies, which adds further to the level of bureaucracy.  One would have expected thought to have been given to co-ordinating the various bodies with a view to creating a one-stop-shop. This would have made sense.</P>
      <P>The press release also provided the first indication that the Government intended to be stingy when it came to staff.  Is this the right attitude to adopt when a sector of one of our most respected and prized industries has lost the confidence of a substantial number of people and we are playing on the blind with imports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> The Government must set up an agency, properly staffed with suitably qualified people, to regulate and to enforce the law.  This would help to recoup some of the confidence lost and give the industry back the high degree of confidence and credibility for which our food was renowned. It would make sense to set up a board with total responsibility for the control of food quality, similar to the Food and Drug Administration in the US.  The FDA regulates the food and drug industry in the US.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has proposed the establishment of a food quality authority which would have the power to control the quality of food, its processing and its importation.  Such an agency should have absolute control over the quality of food produced here and food which is imported. There is little point in coming down heavily on indigenous products if there is no control over imports.  One can take a random sample of goods from a ship but if we are to control the quality of food we must demand the same standards of imported products.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health's press release does not refer to fruit and vegetables.  I imagine about 90 per cent of our fruit is imported.  A recent survey in England showed that over half of the fruit and vegetables taken on a sample basis from supermarket shelves and tested contained levels of pesticides at least 14 times above the World Health Organisation's standards for residue levels of pesticides.</P>
    <P>The information I have seen apropos this new body makes no reference to the provision of quality control for imported fruit and vegetables. Have checks been made to establish the level of pesticides in imported products?  Have there been checks on the level of animal fats in imported confectionery or on the levels of other animal byproducts in imported products such as sauces or pharmaceutical raw materials?  Some pesticides are carcinogenic.  The focus at present is on BSE and on levels of antibiotics and hormones in meat and milk.  However, we must also focus on fruit and vegetables, particularly on imports.  The new body to be established should have statutory powers to control the production, processing and storage of these products up to the point of sale. The body must also be empowered to demand the same standards of imported products because they pose the greatest threat.</P>
    <P>Why did the Government not publish the Hurley report?  Why did it deem it necessary to take immediate action?  Why is no reference made to imported products?  One can only speculate on these matters.  Unless a single agency is established with statutory powers of regulation and enforcement and to demonstrate to the public that home produced and imported foods are to the highest standard, we are on the slippery slope to losing the credibility of our greatest asset.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Democratic Left has long campaigned for a separation of producer and <Col N="537" /> consumer interests.  The level of abuse which has become evident in intensive food production represents a triumph for the producers lobby over consumer interests.  The new body must be driven by the primacy of food safety and quality and the need for that safety to be determined by independent scientific and veterinary criteria rather than producers' interests or farming politics.</P>
      <P>I represent an area largely dependent economically on farming.  The overwhelming majority of farmers are struggling to make an honest and decent living from the land, often in the face of many obstacles not of their own making, in particular the recent Russian beef ban. The efforts of the majority of farmers have been undermined by the activities of tiny rogue elements of large farmers who seek to profit at the expense of consumers and taxpayers.</P>
      <P>The use of angel dust was the norm for the last five years.  It was well known that it was being used and it was sold openly at marts.  Such abuse has led to the current crisis.  The establishment of this new body will have a large part to play in rectifying matters and creating the necessary awareness.  In north and east Cork most farmers share the outrage of consumers when they learn of the use of illegal growth promoters or that BSE was deliberately introduced to herds in order to claim compensation.</P>
      <P>A person in whose opinion I would have confidence said recently that the headage payment led to a lot of these difficulties.  Some farmers were able to organise themselves to dispose of the herds and get the value for them and also get the headage payments.  It is an outrageous system which has led to abuses.  The producer, not the product, should be subsidised. I welcome the IFA's recent decision to get tough with rogue elements within its ranks.  It will go some way to enhancing consumer confidence in the food industry.</P>
      <P>Foodstuffs on sale in supermarkets usually have an indication of a &ldquo;best before&rdquo; date.  I do not think all retailers or wholesalers take the food off the shelves if it has not been sold before the date indicated.  This is an issue which needs to be looked at because from time to time one hears complaints and perhaps the retailers would not have looked at the label on the package.</P>
      <P>Ireland's green image is only a perception at the moment.  It is only a matter of time before it is recognised, but all of this might change attitudes. Water and air pollution in this country are very serious as a result of the failure to enforce laws. Producers' organisations have a central role to play not only in regulating the conduct of their members but in educating them about legislative and scientific changes.  I urge these organisations to ensure that their members are fully informed of the implications of the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996.  Therein lies the legislation which will compel people and create an awareness about food safety.  The establishment of the food safety board will also have that effect.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and Dr. Danny O'Hare, the chairman of the interim board, who is in the Public Gallery.  The fact that he has shown the interest to be here gives us all confidence in the interest that will be taken by this board.</P>
      <P>I want to make one fundamental point &mdash; the key to credibility in food safety is independence. Unless the new Food Safety Board is totally independent, and is seen to be totally independent, it will not be credible to customers. In particular, it will not be credible to customers outside Ireland.  These are the most important customers for our food industry and if the Food Safety Board is not credible we might as well not have it.</P>
      <P>If the board is not credible then it is a waste of State money and of the time of Dr O'Hare and his interim board.  We as legislators have a major responsibility and our top priority should be to make sure that we create a Food Safety Board whose credibility is beyond question because its independence is unimpeachable.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged by what has happened so far. I listened to Senator Haughey and I am aware of his concerns.  I am all too aware that we could be here discussing plans for a Food Safety Board that was under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  However, the board is being created by the Department of Health and that is a major advance on what could have been.</P>
      <P>We saw an instance of what could have been when An Bord Bia was being set up.  I was a member of the expert group that set up that board and I argued strongly that it should be under the aegis of any Department other than the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It was an argument which I did not win and I put in a minority report.  I understand that there has been something of a turf war fought in recent weeks regarding the Food Safety Board.  I am pleased to see that it is not under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. This is fortunate for the future of the Irish food industry.  When I speak of the Department, there is a marvellous job being done and to be done, but there are certain things that should not be under its aegis &mdash; the safety of food is one of those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that some within the food industry do not yet realise the crucial importance of keeping the Food Safety Board fully independent.  When the membership of the interim board was announced there were protests that the board was unbalanced because it did not include food industry representatives.  Not only is it right to exclude the industry; it is vital to do so. It is in the industry's best interests to be excluded <Col N="539" /> and to have a totally independent body so that they, the industry, can point to it and say &ldquo;These people have nothing to do with us and they say that our food is O.K.&rdquo;.  If the food industry is able to say that then they and the board will have credibility.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Board of Ireland has to earn a reputation such that its <i>imprimatur</i> will fully satisfy a potential buyer of our food in Germany, Russia, the Middle East &mdash; wherever we seek to sell our food products.  I was in America this year and met Michel De Roy, the head of a large company which operates supermarkets and hypermarkets in France.  As I joined him at the Food Marketing Institute he said &ldquo;We do not sell Irish beef anymore&rdquo;.  I immediately reacted by saying that we are not British.  He replied &ldquo;I know, but the only sign we can put on our supermarket shelves is &ldquo;French beef only sold here&rdquo;.  It is not strong enough to say we do not sell British beef&rdquo;.  That is a reminder of our task. We need to enable him to say &ldquo;Irish beef sold here&rdquo; and be sure that the public will react positively.  That is the challenge which the Food Safety Board has to face.</P>
    <P>The opening assumption of a typical overseas buyer will be that any Irish board is unlikely to be fully open and impartial about Irish food.  A further assumption would be that the board is an agency of Government and, therefore, operates under the umbrella of Government policy.  It would certainly not be an opening assumption of overseas buyers that this board will act exclusively in their interests or, indeed, in their interests at all.  The challenge facing Dr O'Hare and his colleagues is this &mdash; the Food Safety Board must overturn those assumptions and put contrary assumptions in their place.</P>
    <P>A first question is: how can such a board create the necessary credibility overseas?  My initial suggestion is that the membership of the board should include, as a statutory requirement, a number of people who are not Irish, who do not live in Ireland and who have no vested interests in Ireland nor any previous connection with it. Ideally they should be people of international standing in a relevant field or whose independence is transparently unimpeachable. Appointing such people would be a first for the Irish public service but that should not stop us doing it.  Neither should the expense of bringing such people on board, because their potential contribution is priceless.  With this in mind the interim board should demand the power to recommend appointments to its own membership.  It is likely to be far better at international head-hunting than the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The independence of a board is not only determined by who you put on it but also by the security of their tenure.  If individual members of the board, or the board collectively, can be removed at the whim of a Government Minister, then the perceived independence of that board is <Col N="540" /> lessened.  That happened with RTÉ some years ago when the Government abolished the board. This board should have the same standing as judges when they are appointed.</P>
    <P>Similar considerations should apply to reporting.  Semi-State bodies report to their sponsoring Minister, who, along with his Department, directs the overall policy of the organisation.  We do not want that to happen with this board.  I am pleased that the Minister said in his speech that &ldquo;The board will also be required to publish reports of its audits&rdquo;.  I hope that means they publish themselves rather than have the Department publish the reports for them.  I looked for the RTÉ report of 1995 a week ago.  It had not at that stage been published.  When I asked the RTÉ Authority I learned that it completed its annual reports for 1995 in April and handed it to their Department which has been sitting on it since.  That is an example of why I want this board to have the right to publish.  It is the public to whom the Food Safety Board should report and it should report directly, not through the medium of Government or Parliament.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a second essential element in building credibility for the Food Safety Board.  It must be seen to be serving the customer and no one else.  It is vital that we work on the premise that the board has no responsibility whatever to the Irish food industry or the Irish economy.  That takes some thinking.  Its responsibility is solely to the customer.  If it serves the customer properly it will do a world of good for the Irish food industry and the economy.  However, it can only serve the customer properly by ignoring any wider consideration.  We have often heard the phrase &ldquo;the customer is always right&rdquo;.  That was never so true as in this case.  If we allow the customer to have doubts, like that man in France, he or she will no longer be a customer.</P>
    <P>Every week I meet a group of customers from our supermarkets.  I was jolted by the power of customers, particularly in recent months.  I asked them whether they have changed their habits since March and I was struck by the number who said they have but if they had confidence or trust in beef, they would continue to buy it.  A number have changed their attitudes and are concerned. It is the job of this House to ensure the Food Safety Board can change minds and has the tools to do the job.  It is not the job of the board to balance conflicting interests or find a compromise between them.  It should have one master alone, the customer.  Our task over the coming months is to create a statutory structure which will reflect that.  We have taken the first steps in that direction.</P>

      <P>I realise it may not necessarily end tonight but the Order Paper contains many items of long standing which must be resumed and that suggests we may wait some time before returning to this matter.  I regret that a substantive motion was not put forward as there is widespread agreement on the necessity for the board and a motion would not have caused particular difficulty for the Government.</P>
      <P>I agree strongly with Senator Sherlock about our green image, on which I speak at regular intervals.  It is our idea of how Europeans should perceive us rather than their actual perception.  In most cases they do not even know we exist, let alone know about our green image.  That is part of the marketing task which confronts An Bord Bia and it tackles it well.  I also welcome the attendance at this debate of the chairman of the Food Safety Board, which indicates a hands-on interest on his part, but I wish we had far more time to discuss this matter.</P>
      <P>In creating the Food Safety Board and placing it under the Department of Health, the Government is implicitly accepting that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is not the appropriate body to carry out the task of creating credibility in the mind of the consumer. It is understandable that this is the case because we have had an intervention mentality for so long.  The task of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry was thought to be to send the Minister to Brussels to get money, to distribute that money and to set up the framework for schemes.  There are more people in that Department looking after the operation of the schemes than there are people concerned about how beef is sold, the safety of beef and other food products.</P>
      <P>The creation of the board had as much to do with deflecting political and consumer criticism of the Government's handling of the BSE affair as with anything else.  It was significant that the matter first came to public attention when the Minister, Deputy Barrett, mentioned it on a radio show.  It was announced, on a day when the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was in Brussels, by the Minister for Health.  A press conference arranged for that afternoon was cancelled, probably on the basis that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was not too pleased about it.  I only speculate, of course, having no knowledge of these things.</P>

      <P>If we are determined to overcome the crisis of confidence which exists in the industry the new board needs a staff of more than 30 in a glitzy office in Baggot Street.  People who come from Russia should not be brought into a nice building and told everything is all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" /> I agree with virtually everything Senator Quinn said about the independence of the board because it must be able to restore credibility and confidence in our food.  I am a farmer and I hope the food and grain I produce is up to the standard required so that consumers can use it with confidence.  However, it is useless for An Bord Bia to spend millions of pounds unless consumers believe that what they buy is of the quality and standard required.</P>
    <P>At last we accept there is a health aspect to the matter, as is shown by bringing this board within the ambit of the Department of Health.  It would be preferable if the board took under its control the inspectorate of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and if it had the capacity to go into any plant or farm to see that everything was in order.  That would establish credibility, which is crucial in this matter.  We were told there were administrative difficulties about adopting an integrated approach with, for example, Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry food and veterinary inspectors.  This industry deserves more than talk about administrative difficulties, irrespective of their size.  We are talking about our most significant export industry and we better get this issue right because we are on a slippery slope at present. There is a belief that one should not publish facts, for example, we should not talk about antibiotics in pork, people using angel dust or BSE, but that is to deceive ourselves.  It is heaping delusion upon delusion to think that by hiding these facts we will not create more difficulty when they are revealed.</P>

      <P>We are giving everyone the opportunity to say what he or she wants.  I agree with Senator Quinn that the independence of the board is vital for the credibility of the food sector. I am a producer and I will put the farmers' viewpoint in my contribution because most other areas have been covered.  I have no problem with the fact that there are neither producer nor processor representatives on the board.  During the debate on An Bord Bia, Senator Quinn said he would rather see that board separated from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I strongly disagreed with him at that time but I agree that this board is essential and that its independence is vital for its credibility.</P>
      <P>No effort is too great to ensure that the consumer has safe, quality food at all times and in all places.  By doing this, the Government is not only giving assurance to the consumer but protecting the long-term interest of producers.  I urge all producers to remember that they are living in an increasingly consumer oriented world, with huge demands for consistent quality. Anything less will be totally unacceptable in the future.  From a moral as well as a commercial point of view, it is essential that all producers adhere to the highest possible standards.  It is not enough to have a watchdog for the Irish producer.  We need even greater vigilance in relation to imported goods from sometimes untraceable sources.</P>
      <P>The milk industry is a shining example to the rest of the food industry in the way it ensures that no undesirable content exists in milk, which is used as a raw material for many products.  Milk undergoes a scrutiny test on a daily basis and every producer is guaranteed at least four tests per month on his or her milk in the local creameries.  The EU is continuously bringing up the standards by introducing new regulations. The latest one is the sematis cell count. Creameries can refuse to take milk from farmers if they do not achieve the necessary results as and from 1 January 1997.  Any creamery or processor can refuse to accept from any producer's milk if his or her standards are not up to that level.  No farmer would risk that sanction.</P>
      <P>Quality food requires quality farming.  If we are to improve or maintain standards, high capital investments are required.  Franz Fischler, the present Agriculture Commissioner, wants to reduce the price of agricultural produce by approximately 15 per cent over the next four or five years.  This is a dangerous approach, from the farmers', the processors' and the consumers' point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to give a few figures in relation to the retail price of agricultural produce.  One figure, which is easy to follow, springs to mind immediately.  That is the difference between the <Col N="544" /> retail price of milk and the price the producers are paid.  Almost every household buys milk on a daily basis.  The present retail price of a litre of milk is approximately 64p per litre.  The producer receives 40 per cent of that 64p and the processor and retailer receive 60 per cent.  Senator O'Toole said that prices on the world markets are 50 per cent of our prices but that is incorrect.  In certain countries prices are 50 per cent of ours, but in those cases the Senator is not comparing like with like.  The consumer will benefit very little from a 15 per cent reduction in price, but that reduction will have a very serious effect on the ability of the producer to produce a very high quality product in view of the capital requirements.</P>
    <P>Prices in the beef sector are another example. The present price to the producer is around 78p per lb for meat.  The consumer is paying between £1.50 and £2.50 per lb.  The retail price of meat is divided between producer, processor and retailer in the same way as milk.  The producer receives approximately 40 per cent of the retail price of that product while the processors and retailers receive 60 per cent.  Milk must be delivered to the creamery concerned.  It is the same with beef.  All transport costs must be paid by the producer. That has been the situation for years.  These examples give people some indication what effect a 15 per cent reduction to producers over a period of three or four years will have on the consumer.</P>
    <P>I asked a butcher recently how much he brought down his share of the retail price of beef as the result of a 20 per cent reduction in the price to the consumer over a 12 month period.  He said that he did not bring it down at all because his sales were reduced and he had to keep his profits up.  The producer took his 20 per cent cut and the consumer got no benefits.</P>
    <P>I told the Minister for Agriculture, and I will tell Commissioner Fischler, that we have to be careful.  Further reductions to producers of 15 to 20 per cent over the next four to five years will have a devastating effect.  As Senator Sherlock said, most of these farmers are barely managing to survive.  Some of them are on very small holdings with very little profit indeed.  If this profit is taken away from them their situation will be worse.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to have a watchdog on the Irish producer; it is essential to have greater vigilance over imported goods.  I draw the Minister's attention to the importation of poultry into this country.  I brought this issue up during a debate here not long ago.  <i>The Irish Times</i> published a very good article about the constitution of the Food Safety Board and its powers.  What is the situation in relation to imported goods?  Many vegetables are imported into this country.</P>
    <P>I read an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Saturday, 19 October 1996 by William Dillon about the importation of poultry and poultry products, headed &ldquo;Salmonella up due to junk foreign poultry&rdquo;.  There are some very revealing statements in that article.  I understand from this <Col N="545" /> newspaper report that we import chicken from England and Germany, but that these countries accept a level of salmonella of about 1 per cent. Should we expose any consumer in this country to salmonella?  The same test is carried out on our chickens and they are salmonella free.  According to this report 250 imported chickens were tested and three had salmonella.  A second batch was tested and four had salmonella.  These reports are available in writing.  There were 200 deaths from salmonella in Germany last year, but Germany accepts this level of incidence.  It is clearly stated in this article that if salmonella is found in an Irish flock of hens we destroy the whole flock and that if the same standards were applied to English chicken farms, their poultry industry would be wiped out overnight.</P>
    <P>When the board is put in place it should have the power to insist on the same standards in imported food as in home produced food.  This is absolutely essential.  Anything less is unacceptable to our producers.  I am sure the Department of Agriculture has a copy of the newspaper article from which I took my information.</P>
    <P>People spoke about the production of beef and milk and, to a lesser extent, pigmeat, poultry and cereals.  I hope the impression will not be given that we produce bad quality food.  A very small percentage of farmers produce bad quality food and their production will be stopped over a very short period by the farmer organisations and coops. I have no pity for them.  They represent a very small percentage of Irish food producers.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry spoke about antibiotics in milk. There are no antibiotics in Irish milk.  They would not be allowed.  I am a milk producer and I produce for the liquid market.  We are tested four times a month and if the processors have the slightest suspicion that a producer is doing anything wrong, his or her milk is tested on a daily basis and he or she is stopped from supplying that milk to the processor concerned.  That producer gets no chance whatsoever.  I defy anybody to prove to me that antibiotics are present in any Irish milk anywhere in Ireland.  It is a simple test and people can be caught very easily.  We produce the highest quality milk in the world.</P>
    <P>People spoke about beef.  I know the BSE scare brought about the constitution of this board and has done untold damage to the beef industry. Beef is a very important source of iron and protein for children and women, in particular. The problem is that not enough beef is being eaten.  Although there has been a very small number of BSE cases, we are sorry to see the number is increasing.  We hope that will now begin to scale down.  Nevertheless, I am prepared to accept that the use of meat and bonemeal before 1989 was responsible for that situation. There is no doubt that the situation will improve from here on in.  The impression should not be given that a large number of herds in this country have BSE.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> I accept there were some bad reports recently in relation to pigmeat.  However, that was cleared up very quickly.  As far as pig producers are concerned, the withdrawal period was not adhered to.  The inspection of the production of pigmeat is a very simple exercise.  The same applies to milk and beef.  A small withdrawal period in relation to the use of small drugs such as penicillin and streptomycin would clear up the whole issue.  Farmers would be well advised to ensure they comply with the regulations.</P>
    <P>We produce very high quality cereals in this country.  Cheaper cereals are imported for use in compound feeds.  Such manufacturers should make far more use of our barley and, in certain cases, wheat which is unmillable.  Compound feed is a very high quality product which is being cheapened by the use of groundnut and other imported cereals.</P>
    <P>The board should have the authority to ensure that compound feed is properly labelled with the percentage of each ingredient identified. Speaking as a producer, there was a very serious situation from 1985 until 1990 when they were not labelled.  Everybody knew that feed manufacturers were using meat and bonemeal but nobody was sure about the damage that would cause.  All manufacturers should be compelled to ensure the percentage of every ingredient is identified on the bag.  The board is the right body to ensure that is implemented because compound feed is part of the food chain. Producers feed cereals to their herds for six months of the year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the setting up of the board.  I look forward to the great work it will do in the future.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the setting up of the board but I would love to have as much confidence in it as other speakers do.  During my 30 years in public life I have seen the setting up of many boards and inspectorates which were supposed to solve all our problems.  However, Members know they did not do so.  The setting up of this board is a reaction to a problem.  That is not good because it means it will have tunnel vision.</P>

That is what was fed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That was when cattle were fed naturally.  When Senator Maloney was a butcher eight and ten hundredweight cattle were considered to be very heavy.  In those days butchers killed more seven hundredweight cattle, which were a year and a half or two years olds.  It was good quality meat.  Every butcher bought meat at the local fairs and everyone knew from where the cattle came and what they had been fed.  Many butchers had farms where they fed cattle for the lean period in the winter.  Everyone going to town saw the butcher's cattle grazing in the field &mdash; they always seemed to have fields near a public road.  There were no worries about beef at that time.  There were no inspectors then but we were not bedevilled by chemists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Farmers are quick learners, particularly where money is involved.</P>
      <P>We then started to compensate owners of infected cattle.  As we know, we have the best compensation culture in the world.  I question all the BSE cases which are arising now.  There was no BSE here for hundreds of years, so why do we now have a rash of it?  I have a sneaking suspicion that the amount of compensation available is causing more problems than it is solving.  I do not think this board will solve that problem.</P>
      <P>We set up veterinary inspectorates and put veterinarians in every meat factory.  We then set up environmental health inspectors.  County councils managed to do the job with one sanitary inspector for years.  When the health boards were established there were health inspectors and now there are environmental health inspectors.  There are more and more inspectors, yet we have more and more problems.</P>
      <P>As Senator D'Arcy said, farmers have to try to make money because the manufacturers get 60 per cent and the farmers get only 40 per cent.  If we set up a board to monitor profits and ensure that the producers got 60 per cent, farmers would not have to try to make ends meet by using chemicals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will this board set up field trials to test land for chemicals?  The country is awash with chemicals.  One sees nothing around the country but manure which is made from chemicals.  Spring wells which supplied villages for generations have been polluted by the influx of chemical fertilisers. <Col N="548" /> Years ago cattle were fattened with turnips, crushed oats and barley in sheds and bedded down with straw.  They produced good meat and there was plenty of farmyard manure.</P>

      <P>One would.  As I said, we had good food then.  However we destroyed it, not the farmers.</P>
      <P>When we talk about resources we mean money and when we talk about agricultural producers we mean farmers.  Farmers would do a good job if they got half a chance.  For example, they saved their hay for silage pits until experts told them they could make silage anywhere in hail, rain or snow.  While this gave rise to pollution for which they were blamed, who educated them to make their produce in ways that caused it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>He is correct.  We are importing chickens from a country that is well known to have given them diseases.  What are we doing about it?  Will we wait for the outbreak of another disease?  Is the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry providing veterinary inspections of food imports?</P>
      <P>What is wrong with Ireland, a country that was noted for food production?  The women of Ireland were the best bakers in the world, yet today cakes are imported from Europe.  How many jobs could we create if, instead of such imports, we encouraged people to produce more food?  Yet environmental inspectors have prevented industrious housewives from producing home-made buns, soda bread, sandwiches and tarts.  The kitchen from where she works may be good enough for her family but she is not allowed sell any produce.  The requirement to build new kitchens put such housewives out of business and destroyed our tourism industry. Many tourists, especially from the US, loved to buy their produce.  However, inspectors ensured that housewives who baked the best bread in Europe, if not the world, were not allowed to make cakes, nor allowed to keep their daughters or sons at home to help.</P>
      <P>We had a great country in the 1960s but we have ruined it in the past 20 years by giving drugs to animals.  We now import the raw materials for meals, such as soya beans.  Are any checks made on these products?  Surely we should stop such imports at a time when farmers are paid to leave their land idle.  We could produce meal from corn, oats, barley and wheat which would create jobs on the farm, keeping people in rural Ireland and producing a good basic ingredient to create a good, wholesome food for cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> We are told that the cause of today's problems are pigmeat and bonemeal.  What scientists invented these?  Everybody knows they are unnatural.  When they were first produced the smell was terrible.  Nobody seems to care.  If we are concerned with good food we must ensure that animals eat good food.  We are not doing this at present.</P>
    <P>In the war years we produced plenty of good meat and fed the British Army.  Our cattle were much sought after by Scottish, English and Welsh buyers.  They do not want them today.  Why did we destroy this market?  In those days farmers could hardly write their name but they retained a credibility that was recognised and rewarded the world over.</P>
    <P>In latter years smart people have been telling us to do things fast to save time.  What are we doing with this time?  Our economists tell us how to produce things economically, but at what price to our social fabric?  Why are so many people on the dole and on drugs and drink?  It is because they have nothing to do.  Those that advise us how to do things economically do not look at the whole picture.  Would it not be better to pay extra to produce meals at home using good quality beasts and producing good quality cattle?</P>
    <P>When we killed cattle at 800 to 1,000 cwt. there was no need for antibiotics or angel dust because they came off the grass at that kind of weight. However, they were pumped with drugs and angel dust to increase their weight by a further 600 to 700 cwt. in the fastest time possible, regardless of the quality of the meat, on the basis that the bullocks would go into intervention and would not be eaten.  Intervention was one of the worst things ever to be introduced to this country.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to import food, the raw material for meal manufacture, poultry and confectionery. This is an agricultural country with thousands of people unemployed, yet we pay to keep them unemployed because some economists say it is cheaper to have such imports.  It should not be cheaper, nor does this view take account of the whole picture.</P>
    <P>We will never get our food back to what it should be unless and until we decide to produce cattle in the natural way from grass. We must produce them in houses, bedded with straw and proper, natural manure from the cattle recycled onto the land.  We must also get away from chemical farming, which starts in the grass, goes on to the beast and to the finished product to give it longer shelf life.  What are we eating?  If 40 per cent of the feed the farmers get consists of chemicals, it must be 60 per cent in the case of our food.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus, for coming to the House to deal with my request to the Minister for the Environment to meet the Knocknacarragh combined residents' association with a view to providing £1 million to Galway Corporation towards the construction of the western distributor road.  I raised this issue two years ago when I asked the Minister to make a special allocation towards the construction of this road.  His response at the time and since then has been most disappointing.  He referred the issue to Galway Corporation to provide money from its existing block grants and revenue, which in 1996 only amounted to £210,000 under the non-national roads programme and £300,000 in block grants.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to give this major road project the special consideration and attention it deserves.  The overall cost of the project is £5 million, including roundabouts.  Approximately £1.5 million has been spent to date on two sections of the road.  The provision of £1 million would enable the construction of the road between Miller's Lane and the Clyborne Road to be completed and eliminate the serious traffic problems which exist.</P>
      <P>Knocknacarragh is a new town with a population of 8,000 people, built on the western environs of Galway city.  The expansion of the area has been so dramatic that its population has doubled in the last four years.  It has been left almost completely without essential infrastructural services due to a combination of bad planning, lack of resources and unprecedented growth.  Population growth projections estimate that up to 16,000 people will live there by the year 2000.  The main infrastructural requirement is the construction of the western distributor road.  Knocknacarragh has only one access road to Galway city, the old Spiddal road on which I am sure the Minister has travelled.  This carried capacity traffic even before the development of Knocknacarragh.  At present it takes traffic up to 45 minutes to travel the three mile journey from Knocknacarragh to Galway city.  There are long and frustrating traffic delays, particularly at peak times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Galway Corporation's method of financing the road is the use of planning contributions from new houses which are now being developed in the area.  It is shameful to spend planning <Col N="551" /> contributions on a distributor road when such contributions should be spent on infrastructural facilities for the area, including local roads, sanitary services and, in particular, open space, playing facilities and other amenities.  Inadequate planning is now being followed by a failure on the part of the local authority to provide adequate infrastructure.  This means Knocknacarragh is beginning to experience many of the social problems which are inevitable in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Using the £2,400 planning contribution from each householder to pay developers to build this road is entirely unacceptable.  It is the most important road project in the west and it should be funded from central Exchequer funds, not from people's planning contributions, which are £700 more in Knocknacarragh than contributions paid in other parts of Galway city.</P>
    <P>Is é seo an phríomh bhóthar atá ag dul go Barna, An Spidéal agus Gaeltacht Chonamara, áiteanna go bhfuil tionscailíocht mhór le fáil iontu &mdash; Indreabháin, Caisle, an Ceathrú Rua, an caladh is mó ar an chosta, sé sin Ros a'Mhíl, ceannáras Údarás na Gaeltachta agus, ar ndóigh, Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá suas le 20,000 daoine ina gconaí agus ag obair sa Ghaeltacht agus tá siad ag baint úsáid as an bothar seo chun teacht go dtí cathair na Gaillimhe.  Aon scrúdú eacnamaíochta gur féidir leat a dhéanamh taispeánfaidh sé go bhfuil a lán airgid caillte i nGaeltacht Chonamara muna bhfuil bóthar ceart acu le dul go dtí cathair na Gaillimhe.</P>
    <P>Building the most important and urgently needed road in the west on the planning contributions of the people of Knocknacarragh is sheer economic lunacy.  Hundreds more houses must receive planning permission where services do not exist in order to continue the road, which at present is being built from both ends on a piecemeal basis.  This defies all logic and common sense.  Of most concern is the fact that at the current rate of progress, the road will not be completed for at least three years.  The spending of £1 million immediately on this project would rank as the most important expenditure by the Department this year.  A further £1 million allocation next year would complete the final phase of the road between the Ballymoneen Road and the Cappagh Road, thereby serving all of Knocknacarragh.</P>
    <P>The major concern of the people of Knocknacarragh is the unacceptable traffic problem which even supersedes the urgent need for community facilities for a growing young population.  The area has been fraught with difficulties caused by road works and, the need to bring additional services into Knocknacarragh, which continues to grow beyond all predictions.  I hope the Minister will respond positively to my request for him to meet the combined residents' association of Knocknacarragh, which represents a population of 8,000 people, to hear their views <Col N="552" /> on the necessity for their special case to be addressed without further delay.  A sum of £1 million for the next phase of this road should be provided immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to address the House on this important matter.  The Minister for the Environment has received no requests to date from the residents for a meeting in connection with the road project.  The purpose of the road is, I understand, to relieve the existing narrow and inadequate road system which has substantial housing developments along it and also to open up industrial development lands to the west of the city.  It would also serve tourism, fisheries and forestry in Connemara and west Galway.</P>
      <P>I understand the new road would be 2.73 kilometres in length and would cost in excess of £5.7 million to construct.  This is a considerable sum by any standard.  An allocation of £1 million would, therefore, enable only a portion of the new road to be provided.  As the proposed road would be a non-national route, responsibility for its construction is a matter in the first instance for Galway Corporation.  Specifically, it would be a matter for the corporation to fund the road from its resources, supplemented by annual State grants.</P>
      <P>I wish to outline the types of grants which are available from my Department for road developments, such as the route under discussion. There are the traditional annual discretionary block grants to local authorities, which give a very wide degree of discretion to local authorities as to how the moneys should be used and, in the case of urban authorities, allow them to decide not only what road schemes the moneys should be spent on, but also how the grant moneys should be divided between maintenance and improvement works.  Under this heading Galway Corporation will receive a grant of £300,000 in 1996.</P>
      <P>The second source of State funding for non-national roads is under the EU co-financed scheme of specific grants for road improvements which promote employment and economic activity.  In particular, under this scheme co-financed projects must have a significant and quantifiable economic impact, particularly as regards employment and on industrial, tourism, agricultural and rural development.  Local authorities prepare and submit annually to my Department proposals in respect of improvement works on non-national roads which can be considered for funding under this heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this scheme Galway Corporation received grants of £150,000 in 1994 and £247,000 in 1995.  I should mention here that the road under discussion was not the subject of a formal application for an EU co-financed improvement grant, either in 1994 or 1995.  However, it was one of three proposals received from the corporation late last year for consideration for funding in <Col N="553" /> 1996.  As the applications submitted by the local authority considerably exceeded the appropriate expenditure guideline limit set by my Department, the proposals were returned to the corporation for revision and resubmission.  The corporation resubmitted two proposals &mdash; not including the western distributor road &mdash; in December 1995 for funding in 1996 at a cost of £335,000 and received a grant allocation of £215,000 in respect of 1996.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are advised by my Department that it is accepted that circumstances can arise where a single large high priority project can exceed the expenditure guideline.  In such circumstances, only the single project concerned should be submitted for consideration.  In the event, the corporation recently submitted three proposals for consideration for funding in 1997. Two of the proposals related to the western distributor road scheme and these were prioritised as numbers two and three on this list. However, as these applications again breached the expenditure guidelines, they have been returned to the corporation for revision.</P>
    <P>The Minister is simply not in a position to fund all applications submitted by the corporation given the limited funds available under this scheme and the competing demands from all other local authorities.  It is a matter for each local authority to determine its priorities in this area and to submit proposals to my Department that come within the appropriate guideline limits.  Any other approach by my Department would result in a flood of applications from local authorities and would not be realistic.  I should also make clear that in this respect, Galway Corporation is in the same position as every other local authority and must operate within the agreed rules.</P>
    <P>Overall, record grants of almost £147 million will be paid to local authorities in 1996 for non-national roads.  This represents an unprecedented increase of more than £40 million, or almost 39 per cent, on the base allocation for 1995.  So far as future progress is concerned, it is clearly a matter for Galway Corporation to decide how to proceed with this matter.  It is open to the corporation to finance the proposed road over a number of years out of its own resources supplemented by the block grant from my Department.  Equally, the corporation may wish to consider submitting an application to my Department for funding under the EU co-financed scheme of grants in 1997 on the basis outlined earlier.  If it decides to do so, the application will be considered on its merits in conjunction with other applications which are received from other areas.  In this regard, it is not envisaged that allocations generally will be made until early 1997.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the House will agree that at this stage the ball lies firmly in the court of Galway Corporation and that no useful purpose would be served by the Minister for the Environment meeting a deputation of residents at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister for the Environment to make special funding available to Dublin Corporation to reconstruct Beach Road/Strand Road.  I thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus, for coming here to listen to my plea on behalf of the residents of Strand Road/Beach Road.  Both roads constitute an important and busy motorway linking two major parts of the greater Dublin area.  As well as being a regional road, it is also a residential road with 250 houses fronting on to it.  It also serves the amenity on Sandymount Strand.  Indeed, the Minister might be well acquainted with this road.</P>
      <P>The carriageway was constructed in the early 1960s and it consists of mass concrete.  Because of the volume, weight and speed of traffic on the road, it has sustained a severe pounding over the past number of years.  It is now in what engineers call &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  I am informed by road engineers that the designed life of such a carriageway is 20 years.  The Minister will understand that the present carriageway is well beyond its sell by date.</P>
      <P>The failure of the road has resulted in an unacceptable noise and vibration level causing severe discomfort to those living on Beach Road/Strand Road.  The continuing pounding of traffic on this concrete road has caused serious vibration to the extent that the quality of life is at an all time low for residents with sleep constantly disturbed.  In a recent survey 70 per cent of residents showed damage to their property as a result of the vibration on the road.  I have great sympathy for the residents because any time I visit the road to speak to constituents, I have difficulty doing so because of the noise of passing traffic.  This traffic passes by 24 hours a day.</P>
      <P>To reduce the noise and vibration, it is necessary to reconstruct the carriageway from Church Avenue to Merrion Hall.  It is estimated that this will cost approximately £1.2 million. Dublin Corporation's present level of funding means that this project cannot be financed and, therefore, a special <i>ad hoc</i> source of funding is required from the Department of the Environment.  The purpose of my plea tonight is to ask the Minister for the Environment to make the necessary funds available to Dublin Corporation so the residents of Beach Road/Strand Road can live in a relatively noise free environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>To date my <Col N="555" /> Department has not received any application from Dublin Corporation for funding the proposed works at this location.  I understand, however, that the reconstruction of these roads would cost in the region of £1.2 million.  It is a matter in the first instance for local authorities to provide the funding required to meet their statutory obligations in respect of non-national roads in their areas, although they may supplement their own resources by using the annual State grants provided by my Department.</P>
      <P>The discretionary block grant of £3 million which the corporation will receive in 1996 is a considerable sum of money which is being made available by my Department for maintenance and improvement works on non-national roads in our capital city.  It will allow the corporation, in conjunction with the £3 million it will provide out of its resources, to undertake a considerable amount of work during 1996.  It is still necessary for the corporation to determine its priorities and to face up to the difficult choices which present themselves in this context but this is no different to the problems faced by every local authority.</P>
      <P>I should explain that in the case of county councils, discretionary grants from my Department are generally calculated on the basis of mileages.  This approach would not make a lot of sense in the case of urban authorities, however, which can have low mileages of non-national roads but with considerable demands being made on them because of the higher volumes of traffic and general usage.  Because of this, discretionary grants for urban authorities are allocated on the basis of population size within bands.  Under this system, block grants to urban authorities will range in 1996 from £40,000 to £3 million in the case of Dublin Corporation, with the next largest grant after Dublin Corporation amounting to only £1 million.  It is clear from the foregoing that the corporation is fairly treated in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument has sometimes been advanced that urban roads generally are disadvantaged when it comes to the distribution of non-national road grants, as they are outside of the restoration programme which applies only to such roads in county council areas.  I categorically reject this suggestion.  It is universally accepted that the major problem with non-national roads lies in county council areas.  I categorically reject this suggestion.  It is universally accepted that the major problem with non-national roads lies in county council areas and that, relatively speaking, urban roads are in a more satisfactory condition. Because of this, the Government has decided to concentrate the restoration programme on the areas of greatest need, namely, regional and county roads in county council areas.  This does not mean that the problems with urban roads are not recognised or that State assistance for these roads has, or will be, reduced due to the county focused restoration programme.  In fact, while roads in urban areas constitute 3 per cent of the road network, State grants for roads in urban areas in 1996 will amount to over 8 per cent of the total grants available for non-national roads. <Col N="556" /> This demonstrates clearly that not only are urban roads not being neglected, they are being treated favourably.</P>
    <P>An additional source of funding available for non-national roads is the EU co-financed scheme of specific grants for improvement works which promote employment and economic activity. Allocations in respect of individual projects put forward annually by local authorities are determined by the Minister following an assessment of their individual merits and their compliance with EU approved criteria relating to the grants scheme.  The Operational Programme for Transport, 1994-1999 provides that road investment on such improvement works on non-national roads amounting to £225 million will be co-financed by the EU over the period 1994-1999.</P>
    <P>Under this scheme Dublin Corporation received grant payments of £38,000 in 1994 and £54,000 in 1995.  The Beach Road/Strand Road project was not included in the corporation's proposals for funding in either of those years.  The allocation to the corporation under the scheme for 1996 is £800,000 for road works in the Custom House Docks area.  Again, the scheme which is the subject of this debate was not included in the Corporation's applications submitted for consideration for funding this year.  As I have indicated, the EU scheme will remain in operation up to the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>On 4 September, 1996 my Department invited local authorities to submit applications for consideration for funding in 1997.  The corporation has yet to submit its proposals.  It is open to it to consider whether to include this proposal for funding in any or all of the remaining years of the EU co-financed scheme.</P>
    <P>However, I must point out that decisions on funding for projects submitted under the scheme are based on the strict EU eligibility criteria governing the scheme, the priority attaching to different projects, the needs of different areas and the limited funds available.  In this regard therefore, it would be a matter for the corporation to determine its priorities in selecting projects under this scheme and to submit appropriate proposals to my Department.</P>
    <P>Non-national road grants have been fully allocated this year and there are no monies available to the Minister from which an additional grant could be made to Dublin Corporation for this scheme or, in fact, to any local authority.  I have outlined the various sources of funding available to the corporation and I am sure that the House will agree that it is now a matter for it to decide on how to progress with the proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>When Dublin Corporation makes an application for funding in 1997, I hope the Minister looks sympathetically at the issue I have raised.</P>
