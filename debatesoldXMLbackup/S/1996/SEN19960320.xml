      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1 and 2.  Item 1 &mdash; Irish Steel Limited Bill, 1996 &mdash; Second Stage to conclusion and by agreement, there will be 20 minutes per speaker; if that is not sufficient we can change it.  Item 2 &mdash; Refugee Bill, 1995 &mdash; Second Stage to conclusion, also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.  This morning the BBC reported on a private letter to Minister Gummer from Mr. Frank Davis, Chairman of the Health and Safety Commission relating to lack of funding; it was suggested that he could not guarantee safety in the workplace because of cutbacks &mdash; we must remember that nuclear power stations come within his remit.  That <Col N="1534" /> would have serious consequences for this island.  I would ask the Leader to ensure that our Government is aware of this and that the Minister in charge, whether it is the Tánaiste or Minister for the Environment, would be made aware of that and that they would take whatever action is necessary.  Two weeks ago in Private Members' business Fianna Fáil raised the need for legislation with regard to Sky television's position of control of sports coverage. Our spokespersons and those who contributed, who were not reported by RTE that night as Senator Magner stated, made the point that if legislation was not implemented, our national sports would be under threat and the taxpayer would be the loser in that event.</P>
      <P>Within two weeks of that debate, the head of sport at RTE, Mr. O'Connor, in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Monday suggested there was a need for a major television licence hike so that he could compete with Sky television for sporting events.  The FAI is in discussions on the possibility of Wimbledon football club playing in Dublin and the PRO for the GAA announced yesterday that the GAA would be foolish and imprudent not to examine the evolving media situation. We ask the House to bear in mind that as the situation evolves we should allow more time between now and the summer to ensure further debate on this important issue.</P>
      <P>The Cheltenham races was a sporting event not raised on Private Members' Business last week but it would have been a disaster if the country had not been in a position to enjoy the success of the Irish bred horses.  I ask the Leader to include that sport in any future debate so that it will be safeguarded for all those who would wish to see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy with the Order of Business.  However, with regard to Senator Wright's point, I am of the opinion that almost everybody was at Cheltenham watching that race and did not need television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1535" /> I take this opportunity in a week when the eyes of the world were on Ireland to ask the Leader to congratulate the Minister for Tourism and Trade for his great effort to enhance the St. Patrick's Day parade this year.  It was praised more among the public than in the media, and the Minister should be congratulated for the attention he gave it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader whether it is possible for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to come into the House before any decision is made on the bidding for Telecom Éireann? According to the newspapers there have only been two bids at only half of what was anticipated.  We should be careful, and ensure the Minister is aware of the feelings of this House before any decisions are made.  I am not sure of the process by which this takes place.  It may be better for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies to address the matter.  I ask the Leader to keep the Minister aware of our concern and disappointment with regard to these bids.</P>
    <P>Few Bills have been initiated in this House in the past year or two.  When I first came into the House three years ago, a number of Bills were initiated here.  When the House examined the Trade Marks Bill, 1995, a couple of weeks ago, we found that a great deal of the work had been done in the other House.  It seems there is quite a logjam in the other House and this House is capable of doing much more work than it is being asked to do.  We must earn that right to have the opportunity to debate Bills here before they go to the other House.  I ask the Leader to bring these points to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Quinn in asking the Leader to make time available for consideration of the sale of Telecom Éireann.  It would be useful if the Minister could come to the House and clarify the position for us because there seems to be considerable confusion. <Col N="1536" /> Newspaper reports suggest that the bid is around £200 million for a 35 per cent stake.  The Minister refuted that figure but did not give the amount of the bid.  What we are dealing with here is a strategic alliance, although in this context, &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; may not be a particularly appropriate word to use.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware, the original bid was £460 million.  We are a long way from that and there seems to be considerable difficulty arriving at the amount being proposed for this sale. There is an element of three card trick economics about this.  Is there consistency between the positions being taken by the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Democratic Left on the matter?  If one was to suggest that when Kerry Co-op or Avonmore Co-op went to the market, they were to give 35 per cent of their stock to another company outside the State, they would not have got on as well as they did.  Kerry Co-op floated for £40 million on the stock market and it is now worth around £800 million. There is a message here somewhere.</P>
      <P>Why is there no Private Members' time this evening?  It has been a long standing tradition that Private Members' time is available on a Wednesday evening from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  If a party cannot find a matter of merit for Private Members' time or does not want a matter on which there will be a vote, time should be given to somebody else who is prepared to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to make time available for a statement from the Minister setting out the Government's position on the elective process for Northern Ireland, which will be announced tomorrow.  I make this request because I am concerned with the amount of debate about the form of election that may be agreed on and the arguments that will arise from it.  I would also like to hear a statement from the Minister that will narrow the discussion to the matter of consent.  It is a waste of time arguing about decommissioning. We should discuss consent, which is the nub of the matter.  If it is <Col N="1537" /> granted by all parties at the round table talks, everything else will flow from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The conduct of China to Taiwan is a matter of serious concern to Irish people and to people in all democratic countries.  China is conducting ground, naval and air military exercises off the coast of Taiwan and in the Taiwan Strait; it is using live ammunition and threatening lives.  This is obviously an attempt by the Chinese Government to influence the presidential elections in Taiwan next Saturday.  We should discuss this matter.  China is attempting to bully and intimidate the Taiwanese people and prevent them voting for a particular candidate.  Would the Leader consider providing time for such a debate?  I am certain the Tánaiste will agree to come to the House; the Leader may also be interested in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Price Waterhouse report on the review of BIM be brought before the House as soon as possible?  It is rumoured that when this review was presented by Price Waterhouse to the Department of the Marine, it was so critical of that Department and of the Department of Finance that it was returned to Price Waterhouse to be watered down.  If this happened it is a disgrace.  The whole purpose of this review was to find out what had gone wrong with these Departments.  If those Departments exercised undue interference &mdash; and I contend that they did &mdash; in the affairs of BIM in recent years, it is no surprise that our fishing industry is in its current state.  Will the Leader attempt to clarify the position and provide time for a debate on the review?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's request that the Leader of the House urgently bring to the attention of the Government concerns regarding the safety of nuclear fuels in the UK.  This issue was recently debated in the House with the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and <Col N="1538" /> Communications, Deputy Stagg.  It is a frightening issue and we must ensure that there is a high level of public awareness of the dangers involved.  This is the first occasion on which I have become aware that questions exist with regard to safety.  The implications are terrifying when one considers previous disasters, such as Chernobyl.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House join with Opposition Members in expressing his condemnation of, and revulsion at, the terrible murder which took place at Jack White's public house in County Wicklow in the early hours of Tuesday morning?  Would he agree that recent debates in this House on law and order and crime have focused mainly, perhaps correctly, on the issue of drug trafficking and drug abuse?  Would he also agree that it is time to engage in a serious and wide ranging debate on the necessity for new legislation in relation to gun control?  Guns are widely used in this city and throughout the country and can be hired easily and cheaply.</P>
      <P>People reading today's newspapers will be shocked to discover that 26 murders have taken place in the past 12 weeks.  The Government appears to have the worst possible crime record. Members on this side of the House demand urgent proposals from Government to deal with gun control and with the criminal gangs and thugs who operate in this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Quinn's point, I thought that this year's St. Patrick's Day parades were excellent. The Minister deserves credit for the allocations given to parades in Dublin, Cork, etc., and long may this continue. The parades placed more emphasis on arts, culture and our young people.  The Minister deserves great credit for considering what can be achieved by such parades.  For far too long there has been an over-emphasis on commercialisation. He is to be heartily congratulated.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Commissioner Flynn on having the decision on beef fines relating to Ireland deferred.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, who has not been as successful as Commissioner Flynn, will put every effort into ensuring that the fines are reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Enright's request for a statement from the Tánaiste on the situation in Taiwan. The House should be aware that, under legislation being enacted, we as Members must declare vested interests. Therefore, I declare a vested interest on behalf of Senator Enright and myself in that we should have been landing in Taipei Airport at this time to observe the presidential elections taking place in Taiwan at the weekend.  The Senator and I are present today due to current events in the Taiwan Strait and because the Department of Foreign Affairs was extremely hostile towards our trip.  It would be instructive if the Tánaiste were to make a statement on the matter in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our trip was planned on the basis of an invitation received and accepted by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. However, the Tánaiste saw fit to write a somewhat hectoring letter to the chairman of that committee criticising its Members for accepting the invitation because Ireland does not recognise Taiwan. Many countries do not recognise Taiwan.  For example, the United States does not recognise Taiwan but is currently involved in its largest military build-up in the Strait of Taiwan since the Vietnam war.  This is a very strange policy for a country which does not recognise another country.  The Americans are present in defence of the Taiwanese. It would be instructive to clear the air about where this country stands on what is happening in Taiwan as opposed to sticking our heads in the sand and saying we do not acknowledge or recognise Taiwan and therefore do not care what happens.  That is not good enough.  I hope the Chinese will see sense about the build-up in the Taiwan <Col N="1540" /> Straits and demilitarise.  All they are doing is intimidating a fledgling democracy. The Tánaiste should come to the House and I hope the Leader will convery my strong feelings as a Member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs about the attitude taken by the Department to this trip.  Some Members of the other House have gone and although Senator Enright and I have not, I hope we will have an opportunity in the future.  It is kind of you to indulge me on this issue, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. It is important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope representatives from Taiwan and China come here for the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do also and I hope the press gallery takes note of our concerns. We cannot officially inform the Taiwanese because they do not officially exist, so we have to rely on the media.</P>
      <P>As spokesperson on communications, I endorse the call for clarification about Telecom Éireann's strategic alliance.  At this morning's meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs, a group of visiting Canadian parliamentarians paid a warm tribute to &ldquo;Irish Telecom&rdquo;, as they called it.  They had attempted to become involved with Telecom on a bilateral basis but other factors intervened.  They praised the company's efficiency and standing.  In that context the Minister has an obligation to clarify the matter.  I echo our spokesperson, Deputy Brennan's call for him to go back to the drawing board. Telecom workers should not be left in limbo.  Will this strategic alliance go ahead with an underpriced tender &mdash; as has been alleged &mdash; and with up to 1,200 workers losing their jobs?  This will not be good enough.  The Minister should come to the House.  Our party will not agree to the sale of the valuable national jewel which is Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join our agriculture spokesperson, Senator Rory Kiely, in complimenting Commissioner Pádraig <Col N="1541" /> Flynn on his positive initiative.  His intervention was necessary, considering the record of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry on those fines in recent times.</P>
      <P>When will we have a debate on the Government's White Paper on Mental Health?  It has become a bore calling for this debate on the Order of Business for the past nine months.  The Leader should give a positive response and I ask him again to name a date for a full debate.  There are many issues to be discussed and several Members apart from me have called for this.</P>
      <P>Barnardo's, the child welfare agency, today made the welcome announcement of an information and counselling helpline for people who were adopted or in care.  The agency has publicly called on the Government to give it about £90,000 to run the helpline.  It is appropriate that money should be given to provide this valuable service for the next few months and perhaps years.  It is a small sum in response to this human problem and I ask the Leader to convey the wish of Members that Barnardo's should receive this money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator McAughtry in asking the Leader to ensure we will have a presentation of the Government's position on the electoral and referendum process which is to take place in Northern Ireland.  These matters should be disclosed to the Houses of the Oireachtas because we are accountable to the people.  We should have a fully informed discussion on such issues of crucial importance before the Government takes another step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE and <i>The Irish Times</i> had the capacity to be made aware of issues related to the forthcoming White Paper on foreign policy which should have been made available to the Oireachtas. I compliment the media for their capacity to get information the Oireachtas cannot.  The White Paper concerns matters of important foreign and security policy and the Houses of the Oireachtas will not have a chance to <Col N="1542" /> discuss them before the Intergovernmental Conference meets in Turin next week.  The White Paper will be published next week giving only a day or two to absorb and discuss such important issues.  Does the Government's concept of openness mean leaking? What is its idea of accountability or transparency?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator would know all about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the media for making us aware of what was leaked.  Perhaps the Government might leak some information to the Houses of the Oireachtas and it could then make the official communication to the media.</P>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference meeting next week in Turin is of great importance yet the Houses of the Oireachtas will not have time to discuss the implications of the White Paper on foreign policy.  The Government sat on the White Paper for 18 months and then promoted it by leaking it.  That is a new concept of openness and is a strange concept of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House arrange for a debate in Government time on matters in the University College Hospital in Galway?  I am reticent to make this a political issue. However, given the nursing staff has followed the junior doctors in the hospital in announcing a strike in two weeks, it has become a national issue.  I appreciate the Minister for Health has responded to the crisis in the hospital but the situation is now likely to get out of control.  I ask for a debate on the provision of acute medical services in the Western Health Board area and in Galway city, in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Enright and Senator Mooney in asking for a debate next week on Taiwan.  I understand the Leader is making efforts in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The efforts to take on a strategic partner for Telecom Éireann are obviously floundering.  I agree with Senator Quinn <Col N="1543" /> it is time the issue was discussed in the House.  The price seems to have fallen from about £450 million to about £220 million.  Telecom Éireann is a valuable asset and we should have a say in the matter before it is undersold.  It would be in everybody's interest to debate the matter.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader make time available to discuss the changes made to the summer jobs scheme for students?  Surprisingly, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, has effectively excluded post leaving certificate students.  Many students who have obtained their leaving certificates but are not yet formally in third level education will be seriously disadvantaged if they are not allowed participate in this scheme, as are their parents.  Members on all sides will be appalled at the Minister's decision.</P>
    <P>As on five or six previous occasions, I abhor the fact that we have not yet had a debate on the post Maastricht treaty and the Intergovernmental Conference. This issue arises next week. After the Turin conference there will be a discussion on matters relating to common foreign and security policy.  We have not yet had any debate in either House on issues such as the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>The mishandling of this matter by the Government will ultimately lead to a rejection of Government policy at a referendum. There must be a debate. France has issued an extensive discussion document on the Intergovernmental Conference and the UK has issued an extensive White Paper.  All we are getting are leaks, which is reprehensible. This is a very sensitive issue to the people.  We should debate it in the next week.  If not, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will bear personal responsibility for a disaster in the next referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Mooney and others for a debate on Taiwan.  I hope we can voice our support <Col N="1544" /> for this nation, which is being attacked by a large aggressor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>During the last session there were many calls from the other side for a debate on the economy. It is in the national interest to debate this issue at least once a month.  The people cannot be reminded too often of the state of the country at the time of the last election in November 1992. Interest rates were over 20 per cent and jobs were being lost at the rate of 50 a day.  We should have a positive debate to highlight the achievements made since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Leader of the Opposition that there will not be a time limit on the two matters we are debating today.  I am pleased he raised the nuclear power issue.  I will bring it to the attention of the Minister and, if necessary, will try to arrange time, either tomorrow or next week, to have the matter debated.</P>
      <P>The question raised by the Leader of the Opposition regarding Sky Television is appropriate.  We started a debate on this last week.  The issues are complex, but it is important that the body of opinion as represented by him should find expression.  If need be, we will return to this subject in the near future.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for raising the issue of the Dublin St Patrick's Day parade, which was subject to a great deal of criticism.  I thought it was a great success, as did those with me.  Anything that could be controlled was done very well, but unfortunately, we have no control over the weather.  However, it was an innovation and it worked out very well.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn and others raised the question of the current state of the Telecom Éireann strategic alliance.  I will ask the Minister to attend the House to indicate the current state of play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn also raised the question of the initiation of Bills in this House.  The recent Powers of Attorney Bill, the Irish Steel Limited Bill, the Arterial Drainage Bill, the Johnstown <Col N="1545" /> Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Bill, the Civil Legal Aid Bill and a number of others were all Seanad Bills.  The Taoiseach has made the Leader of the House a member of the Government legislation committee to ensure that as many Bills as possible start from this House.  I will continue to try to press for as many Bills as possible to start here.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised the sale of Telecom Éireann and the question of Private Members' Business this evening. It was Fine Gael's turn this evening but because I was particularly anxious that two major pieces of legislation be given as much time as possible, I forewent our opportunity to have Private Members' business.  I also want to try to clear the schedule so that we will have time for some of the topics raised by the Opposition later in the session.</P>
    <P>Senator McAughtry raised the question of Northern Ireland.  We all agree that the question of consent is central to any resolution of the situation there.  I will consult with the Leader of the Opposition and other groups and when it is appropriate I will arrange a further debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright and others raised the question of Taiwan; it was also raised last week and the week before.  It is an open secret that there is a very sharp division of opinion between official thinking on this matter and a strong body of political opinion on all sides in these Houses.  I have asked the Tánaiste to address the matter; it may be possible to have that debate next week.  I will press to have the issue debated.  Senator Fitzgerald raised the question of the Price Waterhouse report on BIM.  I will make inquiries and inform the Senator on the Order of Business tomorrow morning on the status of that report.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy asked us to express our sympathy to the family of the victim of the murder which took place on Tuesday last.  The savage murder of Mr. Nevin was reprehensible and we send our sympathy to his family.  This should not be turned into a political football and I have no intention of doing so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1546" /> With Senator Kiely, I applaud the part being played by the Irish European Commissioner in backing up the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. We all hope the best solution can be found to a problem which was not created by this Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran raised the question of the health debate.  I have promised the Senator that we will have that debate.  I hope I will be able to announce a date for it tomorrow.  I am sure the Senator's point about Barnardo's will find a sympathetic hearing. We all pay tribute to what Barnardo's has done recently for a great number of people at a particularly traumatic stage in their lives.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised the question of the leaking of the White Paper on foreign policy.  I do not know how that part of the White Paper was leaked. A colleague of Senator O'Kennedy once told me never to look to the obvious place for the leak, that it always comes from somewhere else.  It is a pity the White Paper was leaked in this way; I hope it will be published soon.  I can promise a full debate, with no time limit, in this House as soon as the White Paper has been published.  It deserves a full and open debate and we will all be very keen to provide the time for that debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey's question on the University College Hospital, Galway, would be more appropriately dealt with on the Adjournment.  If that avenue does not prove fruitful, we can talk about Government time but he should first try to deal with it on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche raised a number of questions on Taiwan, Telecom and the summer jobs scheme for students.  The Social Welfare Bill will be in the House next Thursday so he will have a full opportunity to raise the issue of the summer jobs scheme for students there. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges at the request of the House recently invited former Senator James Dooge to speak to us about the Intergovernmental Conference.  That session will take place at 2 p. m. next <Col N="1547" /> Thursday and I will be moving a motion tomorrow to begin that debate.  Senator Townsend always talks sense.  Senators from Carlow will always be listened to with great respect.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Seanad for agreeing to take Second Stage of the Irish Steel Limited Bill, 1996, today.  When the remaining outstanding matters are finalised between the State negotiators and the representatives of ISPAT International, it will mark a momentous milestone in the history of Irish Steel Limited and will see ownership of the company pass from State ownership to private ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, Irish Steel's troubles have been ongoing for decades. Successive Governments have invested substantial amounts of taxpayers' money in the company with no return on the funding.  Irish Steel has only made profits in three years out of the last 20 and these profits were never of a sufficiently large amount to protect the <Col N="1548" /> company in its years of poorer performance. Its consolidated profit and loss account to the end of June 1995 shows an accumulated loss of some £145 million. The experience over the years has demonstrated that the State was far from the ideal partner for Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>The employment level in Irish Steel has dropped from over 1,000 two decades ago to 561 in recent years.  In the trading year 1993-94, Irish Steel was losing well over £1 million a month and total losses for the year amounted to over £20 million.  Figures for the year to the end of June 1995 show further losses, although on a scale considerably less than the previous year, with losses approaching £6 million.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel is a small stand-alone company within a much bigger European and worldwide steel industry.  The international steel market the company serves is cyclical and in the early 1990s the steel industry experienced a downturn in both price and sales volumes. Selling prices were lower than they had been for 20 years and raw material prices were high, leading to immense pressure on margins.  Most steel companies in Europe found the going tough and as a result, with the support of the European Commission, a massive restructuring of the steel industry in Europe was undertaken.  Following the lead taken in Europe and in the light of the huge losses being made by Irish Steel Limited &mdash; £13 million on a turnover of £58 million in 1993 &mdash; it was imperative that the company implemented cost reductions and restructuring measures.</P>
    <P>During 1993 the company unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a cost reduction package with its workforce.  A new viability plan was drawn up in early 1994.  This was an absolute precondition to the survival of the company and provided for, <i>inter alia</i>, a reduction of 205 workers, the introduction of new totally flexible work practices, the achievement of efficiencies and a pay freeze.  There were extreme difficulties in reaching agreement with the unions on the implementation <Col N="1549" /> of the plan.  Industrial relations difficulties beset the company throughout the summer of 1994.  Following difficult negotiation, which saw the company on the verge of closure on a number of occasions, each of the trade unions and all employees in Irish Steel indicated their acceptance of the company's survival plan.  The plan allowed for cost improvements and savings of £8.8 million a year.  I am pleased to acknowledge once again the tremendous sacrifices and efforts made by the workers of Irish Steel in the implementation of the viability plan.</P>
    <P>The viability plan has been vital in securing a prospect of achieving a viable future for Irish Steel.  Without the achievement of cost savings under the plan, it is unlikely that any company would have been interested in Irish Steel and there were considerable doubts that the company could achieve and sustain viability on its own.  For example, the European Commission and others expressed considerable reservations about the ability of Irish Steel to provide adequately for the next downturn in the steel markets.</P>
    <P>Faced with high losses which occurred in 1993-94 and the implementation of the viability plan notwithstanding, Irish Steel was still not in a break-even situation as a stand-alone enterprise.  The board of Irish Steel submitted, on 28 November 1994, a final viability plan to return the company to profitability within three years.  This plan included a request for £50 million, including £40 million in equity and £10 million in guaranteed borrowings.</P>
    <P>The Government, following discussions with the European Commission, was faced with three options: to seek EU approval for the £50 million State aid package; to close Irish Steel, at a conservative cost of over £40 million or to find a suitable strategic partner who, with experience in the wider international marketplace, would be able to bring their knowledge, marketing and production resources to bear on Irish Steel and turn the company's fortunes around so that it would have the <Col N="1550" /> strength to prosper in the market.  In the event, the Government decided in February 1995 that negotiations with the European Commission for approval of State aid to Irish Steel should be on the basis of the £50 million envisaged in the viability plan and that at the same time negotiations could be opened for the possible sale of shares in, and control of, the company.</P>
    <P>Following the Government decision, an application for State aid approval was lodged with the European Commission and at the same time I appointed Investment Bank of Ireland Corporate Finance Limited to act as advisers to the State on the sale of Irish Steel.  Five parties were quickly identified as being interested in purchasing part or all of Irish Steel.  Applications were made by each of these five companies in the first round of offers.  It is common knowledge that these five companies were ISPAT International, Riva, Aicher, Nippon Denro and Nucor/Yamato.  Each of their offers was weighed on its respective merits.  In some cases, companies were even invited to improve on their offers.  All the offers, save one, were for the purchase of 100 per cent of the shares in Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>A short list of companies was drawn up after the final first round offers were received and a number of companies were invited to submit further more detailed offers.  Following receipt of these further offers, the Cabinet subcommittee, comprising of myself, the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State with responsibility for science, commerce and technology, which had been formed to oversee the sale process, selected ISPAT International, following recommendations from my Department and the State advisers, as the company which should be granted exclusivity of negotiation to purchase 100 per cent of Irish Steel.  It was considered that ISPAT International had the necessary experience in turning around steel companies. The financial commitments it was proposing were stronger than those of the other bidders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> During the summer of 1995, ISPAT concluded detailed due diligence with its own professional team, in co-operation with IBI Corporate Finance Limited, Irish Steel Limited, my Department and the Department of Finance. The due diligence process was conducted on the basis of the normal process of disclosures and representations made by Irish Steel, in the main, but also by the State, on foot of which ISPAT decided to purchase Irish Steel.  Negotiations with the company continued during and after this process and led to the conclusion of a sale and purchase agreement with ISPAT International on 6 September 1995, which was signed by me and the Minister for Finance, for the sale of all of the shares of Irish Steel Limited to ISPAT International.</P>
    <P>As the agreement with ISPAT International involved State aid from the Irish Government amounting to approximately £27.5 million, which included writing off an old Government loan to Irish Steel of £17 million, an application was submitted to the EU Commission for approval of the State aid involved under Article 95 of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty.  The EU Commission accepted the case made by the Irish Government on behalf of Irish Steel and recommended to the EU Council that the State aid for Irish Steel Limited should be authorised exceptionally under Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty subject to certain conditions.</P>
    <P>The Commission's recommendation was considered at the EU Industry Council on 6 and 7 November 1995 and while 14 of the 15 member states were in general prepared to approve the State aid involved, the UK refused to give its support.  Unanimity among all member states of the EU was essential for the approval of the State aid for Irish Steel under Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty.  In view of the UK opposition, the Council of Ministers agreed on 6 and 7 November 1995, at the suggestion of the Spanish Presidency and the EU Commission, that the Irish and UK delegations <Col N="1552" /> should continue to search for an agreement on the matter that could be approved at a later Council meeting.</P>
    <P>Following the intensive negotiations I had with the UK Minister for Industry and Energy, Mr. Timothy Eggar, and with the president of the UK Board of Trade, Mr Ian Lang, during the months of November and December 1995, the UK Government withdrew its reservations to the State aid involved in the Irish Steel restructuring plan.  This enabled the EU Council of Industry Ministers unanimously to approve the State aid package on 20 December 1995 under Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty. To overcome the UK objections, production caps on finished steel and billets, together with limits on the sale of finished steel products in the EU market, including Norway and Switzerland, had to be agreed by me in consultation with Irish Steel and ISPAT in order to secure the unanimous approval of all the EU member states, in particular, the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I will now give the Seanad details of the deal agreed with ISPAT International on 6 September 1995 and the changes agreed with ISPAT International following the EU approval secured on 20 December 1995.  ISPAT International is to buy Irish Steel for a nominal sum of £1.  The sale will be finalised within the next few weeks.  The agreement will involve a certain level of expenditure by the State and ISPAT International.</P>
    <P>In addition to writing off an old Government loan of £17 million to Irish Steel Limited, the State has agreed to pay £20,273,500 to Irish Steel Ltd./ISPAT International.  The State's contribution of over £20 million includes provisions: for charges and expenses identified by ISPAT International in the due diligence process which should have been in the balance sheet of Irish Steel Ltd. for the 12 month period ended 30 June 1995; to fund necessary environmental and other remedial works; for a matching contribution towards an ECSC staff training grant; to compensate the company for <Col N="1553" /> the restrictions on production and sales imposed on the Irish Steel/ISPAT project to overcome UK objections; for an upfront cash payment in lieu of indemnities in respect of possible residual taxation and other costs and financial claims arising from the past; to compensate the company for interest charges on existing debts and provisions to fund a deficit in the staff pension fund.</P>
    <P>ISPAT International will invest £5 million in working capital into Irish Steel immediately on completion of the deal.  ISPAT International is also committed to a significant level of capital expenditure.  This will see investment of £20 million over the next six years, allowing Irish Steel to produce products more efficiently and thus more profitably than at present.  These funds will be spent on the re-equipment of the mill and the melt shop.</P>
    <P>About half of the capital spend will be devoted to enabling Irish Steel to make higher grade, added-value raw material.  Ultimately, under ISPAT International, Irish Steel will produce a more extensive range of finished steel products, which will, because of the higher grades of steel they will be able to make, add to the value of output.  In addition, ISPAT International has agreed to maintain production at least at present levels.  Furthermore, the deal provides undertakings from ISPAT International to take over all loans, debts and liabilities of Irish Steel with the exception of an old Government loan of £17 million made in the mid-1980s. That will be extinguished by the Government as part of the sale.</P>
    <P>Among the issues at the forefront of negotiations has been the Government's concern for the workers of Irish Steel and the protection of their jobs and rights in the new Irish Steel operation. Under the deal, ISPAT International has entered a contractual commitment to employ a minimum of 300 full-time workers in Irish Steel for the first five years of its ownership of the company. ISPAT International has also agreed to honour in full all commitments of Irish <Col N="1554" /> Steel with regard to labour contracts and pension plans.</P>
    <P>I am confident Members of the House will agree that this situation contrasts very favourably with the situation 18 months ago when the plant was on the verge of closure with the likely loss of all employment in the company.  The contractual commitment with ISPAT International also provides that it will pay to the State specified liquidated damages in the event that the number of full-time workers falls below 300.  There was understandable concern among the workforce of Irish Steel and their trade unions that the sale of the company could be prejudicial to their interests and that the job guarantees were not real.  I have assured the unions that the guarantees given by ISPAT are real and substantial.  I am satisfied that the trade unions are now fully committed to a new Irish Steel in the full ownership of ISPAT International.  Indeed, I have been impressed with the management style of the new owners.  I am confident that this augurs well for good, professional relations between the new management, the employees and the trade unions.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to give a brief pen picture of ISPAT International.  It is a multinational corporation, founded in India, with manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, Germany, the USA, the UK, Indonesia and Kazakhstan for the production of steel and related items.  The group is the world's largest producer and consumer of direct reduced iron &mdash; that is, iron produced from iron ore.  It is also one of the world's largest producers of liquid steel.  Prior to its very large acquisition in Kazakhstan, the group employed a total of 6,500 producing more than 6.5 million tonnes worldwide.  The total assets of the group exceed US$3 billion and annual revenues exceed US$2 billion.</P>
    <P>Most of ISPAT International's acquisitions have been former State owned steelworks in the process of privatisation and it has a proven track record of turning around all its major <Col N="1555" /> acquisitions, usually within a year of purchase.  This is rapid by steel industry standards.  The Kazakhstan acquisition from State ownership is enormous with some 30,000 employees involved.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel will be able to benefit from the experience the new owners will be able to bring to bear and the economies of scale that also derive from a group of such size.  The Government is satisfied that with the sale of Irish Steel to ISPAT International, it has achieved the best possible deal for the State, the company and for the workers of Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>The legislation which has been circulated to the House is necessary to enable the sale of the shares of Irish Steel Limited to ISPAT to be finalised. The Irish Steel Limited Bill, 1996, is a short Bill with only ten sections, the main purpose of which is to repeal the legislation on Irish Steel passed by the Oireachtas during the period 1960 to 1985 when the company was in the ownership of the State and when it required Exchequer funding to survive. That legislation will no longer be necessary when the shares of Irish Steel Limited are sold to ISPAT.  The Irish Steel Limited Bill, 1996, also contains provisions to enable me as Minister for Enterprise and Employment to fulfil the financial commitments agreed with Irish Steel/ISPAT under the agreement for the sale of the shares of Irish Steel Limited. I look forward to discussing the individual sections of the Bill during the Committee Stage in this House.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to this House and in so doing I would like to thank the very many people who have worked extremely hard and tirelessly to secure the long-term future of Irish Steel. Besides ISPAT International and the workers, I acknowledge the services of the board of Irish Steel and its chairman, the public servants who are often forgotten both in my Department and in the Department of Finance and our advisers.  I would also like to thank the Members of the Oireachtas &mdash; particularly Senator Sherlock &mdash; who have <Col N="1556" /> taken a very keen interest and who have seen the company through a very tense period because their forbearance has stood to us in securing the long-term future of the company.  I commend this Bill to the House.  It will prove to have been a valuable approach adopted by all public representatives and we will be well served by the result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Irish Steel Limited Bill, 1996, which will enable the sale of Irish Steel to ISPAT International.  Senators on all sides of the House welcome the end of this long running saga.  I join the Minister in complimenting all those involved, not least the executives and workforce of Irish Steel who have taken hard knocks in the course of the negotiations and the scaling down of the plant.  I also compliment the Minister and his officials.</P>
      <P>However, there are a number of disconcerting aspects to this deal, the principal being the cost to the Exchequer, which has risen from £27.5 million last September to approximately £37.2 million now, an increase of £10 million.  This appears to be the result of the intervention of British Steel and the British Government.  I and my party are very concerned at this intervention and to the objections of British Steel and the British Government to this takeover. This deal was acceptable to the 14 other EU countries, showing it does not offend against the rules of competition. I and my party do not accept that, given Ireland's tiny share of EU markets, and that the British steel industry produces over 40 times what Irish Steel is producing, consolidating Irish Steel's producing capacity could possibly lead to a downturn in the British steel industry or the closure of a British Steel plant.  It would be indefensible and very bad competitive practice for the giant British steel industry to be able to close down a tiny Irish steel industry and from the experience of the last few months, that is exactly what the British steel industry tried to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" /> Since the 18th century, British commercial jealousy has greatly retarded Irish industrial development, once excluding Ireland from whole branches of industry.  This must never be allowed to happen again.  Successive Governments made a large investment in Irish Steel and Fianna Fáil in Government fought against its closure.  Writing off debts represents the last Government's input.  The maintenance of a steel plant in Ireland is of vital national strategic interest.  Britain more than any other country insists on respect for such interests.  Therefore, it has to recognise the legitimacy of our wish to keep Irish Steel open.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his success in overcoming the objections of British Steel.  I would like him to spell out in more detail why this success has resulted in an increase in costs of £10 million.  This should be a salutary lesson to everyone in politics, business and industry.  We face stiff competition from across the water.  The history of Irish industry shows how our traditional industries have been stripped and transferred mainly to Britain.  To see what we have put up with in the past we only have to look at companies like Dunlop and Ford, our clothing and other traditional industries to see that we have lost industry after industry to Britain.  We took it on the chin but when one of our more strategic industries posed a minor threat to the major British steel industry, Britain gave us a sucker punch.  This should be a lesson to politics and industry. We must be prepared to fight back much more aggressively than we have up to now.  Our industrial sector and people must be aware that we face stiff competition.  From Ireland's point of view there is a negative balance of payments deficit between imports and exports between Britain and Ireland.  It is vital that from now on within the confines of EU regulations we take the gloves off when it comes to protecting Irish industry to ensure its future growth, given our experience in this case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1558" /> I welcome the privatisation of Irish Steel.  The privatisation of major State companies does not take place frequently and not usually in the manner of the sale of Irish Steel, the shareholding of which was sold in one go.  The sale of Irish Life and Irish Sugar was on a gradual basis.  I found amusing the Minister's details of the strategy team involved in this sale.  It involved himself, the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, who has responsibility for science and technology. This shows that ideology has gone out of the window with regard to this sale as far as the Labour Party and Democratic Left are concerned.  I compliment them for losing their baggage when it comes to the practical realities of the future of business here.</P>
    <P>The sale of Irish Steel also takes place against the background of the commitments in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> which stated that:</P>
    <P>State assets will not be sold except where it protects employment and is in the long-term strategic interest of the company and its stakeholders . . . We will retain majority state ownership in these companies.</P>
    <P>The programme states that change in State companies will be managed in the best interests of employees.</P>
    <P>Not least among the reasons for discussing the sale of Irish Steel is that the company has been a major part of this State for nearly 50 years.  It was established as a State-sponsored company in 1947.  Its role was to supply the domestic and export markets and it quickly became a major employer with 566 people employed in June 1993 when the last rationalisation plan began.  The steel industry worldwide is cyclical and Irish Steel was no different from any other producer in Europe.  It enjoyed good times and many bad times.  In the years after its establishment it enjoyed reasonable success and it had a boom period during the 1950s and 1960s. However, in the 1970s difficulties began to emerge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> Despite the Government investing £185 million between 1980 and 1993, Irish Steel recorded losses of £135 million. The investment in the company was substantial, representing several times the IDA's annual budget.  The biggest single investment ever made by a Government in Irish Steel was during 1985-86 when £24 million was invested of which £18 million was in the form of a loan.  The current Taoiseach was Minister for Industry and Commerce and was succeeded by Deputy Noonan, the current Minister for Health.  Both will remember the trials and tribulations of Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation of the company was initiated in 1993 by the Fianna FáilLabour Government, which considered how the plant could be modernised. Consultants were appointed and recommended sweeping changes in work practices, a reduction in the workforce and the establishment of a strategic partnership between Irish Steel and another steel finance company.  This rationalisation programme was successful.  The workforce accepted major changes and Irish Steel moved from a loss of £20.7 million in 1993 to a reduced loss of £5.8 million in 1994-95.  Its chairman, Mr. Dineen, told me it is on track to make a small profit in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>My concerns relate to the safeguards built into the deal to protect Irish Steel workers and the Exchequer, as they have been outlined by the Minister.  The workers are a key part of Irish Steel. They were instrumental in turning the company round and preparing it for the sale.  More than 230 jobs were shed and major work practice changes were accepted.  I appreciate the Minister's guarantees with regard to the future of the workforce.  However, I would like him to spell out in more detail exactly what is intended by the contractual commitment with ISPAT International which provides that it will pay to the State specified liquidated damages in the event of the number of full time workers falling below 300.  What will happen if there is a major downturn in <Col N="1560" /> the steel industry within the next five years?  How can the Government ensure that liquidated damages can be obtained from this company if it runs into further financial difficulties?  While ISPAT International guarantees to retain employment numbers in Irish Steel, I am concerned that there could be lay offs and redundancies in future.  Is it possible that the State could be liable for this?</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to comment on a report in a Sunday newspaper when the original deal was concluded in September, that ISPAT International promised to pay a penalty of £10,000 for each Irish Steel worker made redundant in the next five years and all such payments were to be made to the Government. Is this report accurate and, if so, what does it mean for the Exchequer? Does it mean the State will have to pay further redundancy money in the event of ISPAT International letting workers go?  Are Irish Steel workers aware of this arrangement and have they accepted it?</P>
    <P>Why did the Government decide to sell Irish Steel?  In privatisation there is often an opportunity for the Government to hold golden shares so that it can have some influence on the future of the company.  Was this considered in the case of Irish Steel?  How does the sale of Irish Steel fit into the Government's commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to maintain assets in State ownership and manage change in the interests of the workforce?  If the interests of the workforce are important, why has the staff of Irish Steel not been given a shareholding in the new venture?  Aer Lingus staff receive shares for accepting minor changes.  Why is there not a similar arrangement in Irish Steel?  The Minister should spell out in more detail how the deal will be monitored by the Government.  Will there be an early warning system to deal with disputes? Must ISPAT International consult the Government and the workforce before making any major changes?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1561" /> I accept that in choosing ISPAT International the Government was satisfied it was the best company to take over Irish Steel.  However, I would like the Minister to explain in greater detail why ISPAT International was selected and what advantages it had over the other companies who tried to purchase Irish Steel.  He must also explain why the Government has agreed a complete sale rather than accepting ISPAT International as a strategic partner.  The consultants, Simpson Xavier, who were appointed in 1994, appeared to recommend a strategic alliance rather than a sell out.  Why did this not happen?</P>
    <P>When the Minister made the announcement in September he said he hoped Irish Steel would increase in value after the sale.  If the Minister expects the value of Irish Steel to increase, why should the State not benefit? Was the investment of taxpayers' money in a strategic alliance with ISPAT International considered as part of the deal?  Over the past 25 years Governments have invested £185 million in Irish Steel.  The Government has now agreed to write off the £17 million loan and to invest another £20 million.</P>
    <P>I welcome the deal agreed by the Minister.  ISPAT International will be a good owner of Irish Steel.  It has an exceptionally good track record and is the world's largest steel manufacturer of iron ore.  It has many strategic alliances and its recent acquisition of a major state mill in Kazakhstan is a significant development as Kazakhstan has the most significant resources of iron ore in the world.  That ISPAT International entered an extremely difficult trading situation and acquired ownership of a major mill is a good sign in terms of its involvement in Irish Steel.  While we guarantee there will not be job losses in Ireland, the 30,000 workforce in the mill in Kazakhstan will be significantly reduced.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to answer the questions put to him today, but the deal is a good one for Irish Steel, its workers and for Cork.  We look forward to seeing Irish Steel progress, to the <Col N="1562" /> optimistic projections of the Minister and to the immediate injection of £5 million working capital and £20 million investment in capital improvements in the plant over the next number of years. My party is happy that this saga has come to an end.  I compliment the Minister on a job well done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on introducing this Bill.  He said the situation looked promising in September, but that changed a few weeks before Christmas. He and his team deserve great credit for securing this deal.  Some £24 million was invested in Irish Steel in 1985.  Senator Fahey mentioned the loss of Dunlop, Ford and the dockyard.  At that time other old industries, including industries at Whitegate and Irish Steel, were in trouble.  The Taoiseach was involved in trying to save Whitegate and Irish Steel. There was a question as to whether one should close and as to which industry should stay open.  Things were bleak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned what larger nations, such as Britain, can do to a State like ours.  It is a sad reflection on us that some 14 EU countries said a steel plant should be based in Ireland and one said it should not be.  It was an easy way out for the President of the EU who was the Spanish President to say that Ireland and Britain should get together on it.  It is a little sad that the EU should suggest that.  On Committee Stage we should broaden the debate to consider why one country who built steel plants down through the years, in the first world war and the second world war, and is now producing more steel and has done well through the EU having regard to the reduction in steel plants and the commitment it got from the EU, has not been prepared to accommodate us.  Britain is now producing more steel in fewer steel plants than it was ten or 15 years ago.  It has done well from being a member of the EU, yet it tried to stop having a steel plant here.  We must question why the EU said that the two countries should get together to consider whether there <Col N="1563" /> should be a steel plant in Ireland.  It would be ridiculous not to have a minimum sized steel plant in Ireland where it would mean so much to the workforce and the southern region rather than exporting our raw materials to another country.</P>
    <P>The number employed in Irish Steel has decreased from 1,000 in 1981 to approximately 561 in 1994 to 300 today. The Minister has given a commitment to maintain these jobs over a five year period.  ISPAT International, which is one of the finest steel companies in the world, is known for taking over companies and making them profitable in 12 months.  We want to see that happening in the Cork region.  However, how can it happen if the EU places a cap on its production while allowing another nation to increase production?  We should not allow this to continue without making our views known to the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>What does Irish Steel mean to its workforce and what has it gone through?  The workforce was prepared to consider anything to ensure that the steel plant stayed open.  Despite rationalisation, the workforce, which was reduced by 250 people and accepted a cut in wages, was committed to new ideas as were the unions.  We must ensure that no nation can tell us that we cannot produce steel.</P>
    <P>We must consider the indirect employment created by Irish Steel &mdash; in CIE, freight companies and the private sector.  Many people are employed in the transportation of raw materials to the steel works.  Approximately 1,000 to 1,200 people are directly or indirectly involved in this steel plant.  We are not writing off £17 million for 300 workers. More work has been generated because of the £1,000 allowance for taking ten year old cars off the road.  Last year 3,500 cars which could have been exported are now going to Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>Modern production methods could lead to increased exports.  I would not like to think that we have the commitment of 14 EU members and that one <Col N="1564" /> nation is biased.  I do not know how the Minister was able to manage last November when the situation looked very bleak for Irish Steel because one country said it did not want any production on its western side.  That is very sad.  I would be prepared to raise this matter on the Adjournment if necessary.  EU members should work together.  No country should be allowed to say that Ireland should not have a steel plant. We can be sure it would adopt a different stance if there was a steel plant in Northern Ireland, as in the past.  Then it would not object to a steel plant on its west coast.</P>
    <P>I do not know how one country can dictate to other EU member states. Why is that country so biased?  Is it because we are moving forward at last? We must hold onto anything productive which we have built.  Why not allow this company to make Irish Steel profitable in the next year or two?  Since it was set up in 1947 Irish Steel accumulated losses; this could not be allowed to continue. The EU would not have provided money in this regard.  Why should it? The Minister has picked the best company to take over Irish Steel.  I compliment him on his speech and on his openness as regards the figures, including the sale of shares at £1 and the writing off of £17 million, which was necessary if a company was to be found to take over Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>We must consider the future of the 300 workers &mdash; I hope there will be 400 within the next five years.  I know what Irish Steel means to Cobh and to Cork South-Central.  Cork suffered as a result of the closure of Dunlop, Ford and the dockyard within a nine to 12 month period. At one time 1,600 workers were employed in the dockyard, 2,200 in Ford, which was reduced to 1,200, and 800 in Dunlop.  Cork is committed to moving forward.  It recognises that rationalisation is necessary and that the workforce must get on with it.  The region, like others, has an excellent young workforce which is a credit to us.</P>
    <P>I compliment Mr. Pat Dineen, the management and the unions in Irish <Col N="1565" /> Steel.  My two brothers, who are trade union officials and who are involved in SIPTU, were directly involved in this. Everybody was committed to keeping the plant open at any cost.  The company must have discussions with the Minister and his officials on the future as regards the EU.  Will the company need to trade outside the EU?  We must not allow the company to be blocked by one or two countries.</P>
    <P>We deserve credit for our steel plant. Unlike other countries we established out steel plant to meet our own needs. Plants in Britain were used to produce for export.  I resent MPs on television dictating what should be done in Ireland.  I am sure they would resent it if we told them how to run their steel plants.  We have never interfered in anybody's business.  I believe it gave the British pleasure to say there was enough steel in the EU.  I ask the Minister to outline future EU policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the open manner in which he has taken us through the history of Irish Steel.  This Bill will rubber stamp what is a <i>fait accompli</i>, but that should not stop us from looking carefully at the deal.  Although nothing we say will affect the deal, there are important lessons to learn.  Since a considerable amount of State money is involved, I begin by looking at it from a value for money viewpoint.  Costs arising from this Bill will total approximately £37 million, of which £17 million is accounted for by writing off an earlier State loan dating back to the 1980s, while the remainder, £20 million, must come out of our pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the deal was struck six months ago, we were told that the cost would be £27 million, a sizeable sum in itself.  If I have not worked out the sums correctly, I would welcome the Minister's correction.  Now, after the jigs and reels of due diligence, we are told that the real bill will be £37 million, an increase of over one third.  The reality, therefore, is that we are paying £37 million to have <Col N="1566" /> someone take this company off our hands.</P>
    <P>Let us leave aside for a moment the mountain of money which the State has poured into Irish Steel since the 1960s, a mountain which over the past 15 years was steadily added to at the rate of approximately £1 million per month &mdash; £1 million for every month for the last 15 years.  Let us concentrate on the extra money we are now being asked to spend.  The question should be &mdash; should we be throwing good money after bad?  To put this deal away will cost £37 million.  Is that value for money?  To find an answer we must ask what benefits will flow to the State from this deal.  The main benefit would seem to be that a number of jobs are being saved, at least for the time being.  There are 395 jobs in Irish Steel which would be lost if the company was to go to the wall and under this deal there is the prospect that most of these jobs will continue to exist, as I say, for some time at least.  One does not need a computer to work out that the cost per job saved in Irish Steel comes to about £94,000.</P>
    <P>Is that good value?  Maybe we should make some comparisons.  The State development agencies now have a standard benchmark in regard to the cost of creating jobs &mdash; the cost of creating or preserving a job on a sustained basis, that is, for a period of seven years.  It is a tough enough measure and rightly so because it involves taxpayers' money.  It recognises that not all the costs of supporting the job are covered by what I call the up front investment.  It is a measure which includes possible hidden costs and it means that the cost per job figure come out higher than it might be otherwise.  By this rigorous measure, what does it cost IDA Ireland to create a job through overseas investment and what does it cost Forbairt to create a job in indigenous industry?  The answer is that the average cost per job created and sustained by IDA Ireland is £12,000 while the similar figure for Forbairt is £10,000.  When you put these figures side by side with what it costs the taxpayer <Col N="1567" /> to sustain the 395 in Irish Steel under the terms of this deal, you realise straightaway that this is a very expensive deal indeed.  We are talking about a cost per job of 8.5 times the average cost per job created by the State development agencies elsewhere.  On the face of it, this does not seem to be good value for money.</P>
    <P>There is a second factor which we can bring to bear, Senator Cregan has touched on it already, and that is the strategic importance of the industry to Ireland's economic development and the future prospects for the industry's growth.  This country has an industrial strategy in place.  For the past 20 years we have said we want to attract only those sunrise industries where Ireland can offer a strong competitive advantage. In parallel, we have been seeking to develop indigenous companies on much the same basis, that is, to create businesses which are built on Ireland's strengths or potential strengths, which development our capabilities in the industries of the future not of the past; that is what I mean by &ldquo;sunrise&rdquo; industries. From the perspective of this strategy some industries are naturally more attractive than others.  We decided as a nation to develop capabilities in industries, such as computers and chemicals, and in service areas like software and telemarketing.  That makes a great deal of sense because these are sunrise industries with immense growth potential in which it might well make sense to pay over the odds to get a foot in the door.</P>
    <P>Where does steel fit into this?  The short answer is nowhere.  Steel is a sunset industry not a sunrise industry.  The past 40 years have seen a shake out among traditional producers of steel, all over the world steel works after steel works have gone to the wall.  Hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost as an overcrowded industry has come to terms with technological change and with a changing pattern of demand. There is a region in Europe, which stretches from Alsace-Lorraine in eastern France to Luxembourg and Germany, <Col N="1568" /> where the local economies have been devastated by the restructuring of the steel industry.  Today's steel industry has no room for minnows; it has room only for a small number of large players who have the economies of scale and are at the cutting edge of technology.</P>
    <P>Let me put it another way.  If someone walked in off the street today and said &ldquo;Give me £37 million and I will put this country into the steel business&rdquo;, what would we say?  Surely, our answer would be thanks, but no thanks; this is a business in which Ireland does not need to be involved in the future and this is a business in which Ireland has no competitive advantage on which to build.  Our answer would also be that this is a business with very little future compared to the industries on which Ireland has focused, and intends to focus.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the suggestion that if we have a potential imperative to preserve 300 or so jobs in Irish Steel, the price we should be prepared to pay for doing so should be less than the average cost of creating a job elsewhere, not more and certainly not 8.5 times more. Since we have already poured £175 million in equity, loans and grants of one kind or another into this ill-fated company since 1979 alone, this deal fails the value for money test.  I believe it cannot be justified except on the basis that these jobs must be preserved at any cost, and I have heard these words used today.  Preserving jobs at any cost is not a defensible policy; it is not one that many people would dare defend in the full light of day.</P>
    <P>I began by saying that this deal is already done and there is nothing we can do to turn the clock back but I suggest we can learn two things, in particular, from this affair.  First, when we are presented with a price tag, such as £37 million, we should compare the promised benefits with the going rate for those benefits.  It is all too easy to say &ldquo;It is only £37 million; that is a drop in the ocean when you look at what the State spends on other things&rdquo;.  Instead what we should be asking is how does <Col N="1569" /> this rate in terms of value for money?  If it rates badly, and especially if it rates very badly, we should have the courage to refuse the deal and use our resources to create jobs with more long-term prospects in the same area where possible. Second, we should reread the Culliton report.  The clear message which came from that report was that the most effective way to stimulate growth in Ireland was to provide the right environment for industries to grow, and that environment includes lower taxes and lower infrastructural costs.  Culliton showed in that attractive and interesting report that these things were far more important than the traditional State handouts which often end up trying to sustain the unsustainable.</P>
    <P>The sorry state of Irish Steel is a graphic illustration of the truth the Culliton report was trying to show.  I support the efforts made by Pat Dineen and others to ensure that sucess was obtained there.  However, this Bill is testament to the sorry history of Irish Steel and shows what we should have learned from the Culliton report; we have still to learn this lesson.  While the Minister has already made the decision and the deal has been accepted, we should never forgo the opportunity to learn from past deals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCashin" hpid="Mr. Cashin Mr. Cashin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cashin</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for his handling of the Irish Steel debate and wish him well.  I am pleased, particularly as a Corkman, to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Irish Steel is the last heavy industry in the Cork area and its survival is essential for the well being of the area.  I thank the Minister for his hard work in bringing this agreement to fruition and especially for standing firm against the objections raised to the package before us by the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Congratulations are also due to my party colleague, the Minister for Finance, who supported the current Minister throughout and for his work as Minister for Enterprise and Employment. I also congratulate my party colleague, Deputy Mulvihill, for his strenuous <Col N="1570" /> work on the issue.  As a former employee of the plant, Deputy Mulvihill knew only too well the importance of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>When the package which gives rise to this Bill was announced it was met with unfavourable comment in some sections of the media.  It argued that this Government and Governments through the years had put too much money into Irish Steel and that no more should be invested.  I reject this argument totally. Cork has suffered badly through the years.  We lost Dunlop, Ford and other major companies and another major loss would have rendered it even more difficult for Cork to bounce back.  The loss of Irish Steel would have been a serious blow.  It would have destroyed the confidence of the people of Cork. The devastating effect of such a blow cannot be measured in mere figures.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the package in this Bill.  There is little point in pretending that Irish Steel was not performing well despite Government investment through the years.  The 1995 figures show a loss of £6 million but it is no secret that previous losses were on a larger scale than this.  Irish Steel is a small plant in European terms, in an industry where competition has increased considerably over the past decade.  Profit margins in the industry are low.  To survive, any company must use the best available methods of production.  This requires a considerable amount of capital as well as experience of the best practices in the industry.  I am happy that the deal with ISPAT International provides these requirements.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, ISPAT's reputation in this regard is outstanding. It is a multinational company operating on four continents.  Most significantly, it has a good track record in turning around the fortunes of previous State owned companies and we should have some confidence in view of that.  It is committed to production and the survival of Irish Steel.  There is always a fear that when companies like ISPAT take over a struggling firm like Irish Steel, they will merely engage in asset <Col N="1571" /> stripping.  However, in this case the Minister has secured commitments from ISPAT in relation to production levels, capital injection and employment.</P>
    <P>The latter point is important.  The workers and unions in Irish Steel have made huge sacrifices to maintain their jobs.  The cost of the company's survival plan runs to almost £9 million a year. These savings would not have been secured if the Minister had been unable to secure guarantees about future employment levels in the company.  As I understand, ISPAT has contracted to keep employment levels in the plant at over 300 people and will have to pay damages to the State if the numbers employed fall below that level.  The existing pensions arrangement is also to be maintained.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a cost to the State in all this but it is not a massive one. Not including the existing Government debt of £17 million, the investment comes to £20 million.  For that £20 million, the State helps fund environmental works, the company pension fund etc. among others.  For its part, ISPAT will invest £5 million immediately and a further £20 million over the next few years.  This is a small price to pay for maintaining a heavy industry presence in Cork and it is more than matched by ISPAT's contribution to the plant.  It is a testament to ISPAT's commitment to the plant that it has contracted to be responsible for Irish Steel's debts, other than those payable to the Government.</P>
    <P>Part of the Government's financial contribution goes towards meeting caps on productions and sales at Irish Steel imposed on the company as a result of British intransigence at EU level over the deal.  This merits some comment. Britain is more used than most in going it alone in Europe but its position on this issue is a sad reflection on it; it was petty.  It is sad to see the supposed champion of free industry resorting to this level of protectionism.  From my conversations with people, this deal would not have impacted in any way on British Steel.  On the contrary, British <Col N="1572" /> Steel's activities in this area of steel production have been downgraded for some time.</P>
    <P>The Government is to be congratulated for standing firm against British intransigence by securing only limited changes to the original plan.  It is regrettable that such changes had to be made, but responsibility for this lies firmly in the British court.  The irony is that this British Government has secured subsidisation of many of its privatised industries by undervaluing them during the privatisation process.  The net effect of this has been to transfer subsidies from shareholders in these enterprises, stake-holders like the British people, to shareholders and shareholders only.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I look forward to a speedy passage of this Bill through the House.  I am confident it heralds a new beginning not only for Irish Steel but also for the people of Cork and Cobh. Hopefully it will allow Irish Steel to carve out a new niche for itself in this very competitive industry.  This Bill is not controversial and I hope it secures the required support from all sides of the House.  The problems in Irish Steel have dogged successive Governments for a decade.  As a result of this package, an end is in sight and we should not let it slip.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Bille.  It is great to see these problems with Irish Steel finally coming to an end because they have been around for a long time.  Irish Steel was a valuable industry.  It employed up to 1,000 people at one stage and put steel on the market at a reasonable price.</P>
      <P>The problem with Irish Steel arose from our entry to the EC.  I sometimes wonder if our membership of the EC has been more of a hindrance than an advantage.  Ireland lost its textile industry, which provided much employment, and many other industries on entering the EC.  Many of those industries would still operate if we had been allowed to provide proper protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if we are too good in fulfilling our responsibilities as Europeans? <Col N="1573" /> We seem to obey every rule and regulation introduced while our friends across the Irish Sea seek derogation and are anything but good Europeans.  They were not friends of Ireland in the past and, in this instance, were less friendly than ever because they delayed the Irish Steel settlement for a long time. Government negotiators faced much difficulty in attempting to finalise that settlement although other European partners were more than willing to help us in this regard.  It is sad that mother England adopted such an attitude. However, we are pleased that the settlement succeeded.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn's point about value for money.  We will not receive value for money if the jobs in question will cost a great deal to maintain. However, it is better that they be maintained because if they were lost we would not receive the £50 million subsidy from Europe.  The major problem is that jobs cannot be created elsewhere. If jobs could be created at a cost of £10,000 each, there would not be unemployment. It is unfortunate that we cannot buy them, that they are not stacked on supermarket shelves.  These issues cannot be considered on a purely commercial basis, so it is wise to maintain jobs in Irish Steel.  I hope the company involved will be honourable and guarantee these jobs.</P>
    <P>As a previous speaker stated, a danger is that this settlement might represent the beginning of a process of asset stripping.  The company might pull out of the market in two or three years saying that the business is no longer feasible or economic.  The State has already experienced this problem with another company.  I hope the situation will be closely monitored but, at present, we can do nothing because this deal is a <i>fait accompli.</i> Let us hope Irish Steel recovers to a point where it can employ perhaps 500 or 600 people.</P>
    <P>Employment will be a major problem. A number of years ago, who would have thought England or Germany would face huge unemployment problems? Germany is one of the largest industrial <Col N="1574" /> nations and could cope with any situation in the past but it is now experiencing difficulties.  The Germans will have to cut social welfare and health care payments and may still not achieve the 3 per cent requirement for European Monetary Union.  We must consider our position when a country such as Germany experiences unemployment problems. We must do everything possible to maintain employment.  We cannot afford to lose any jobs.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions I stated that I know of many small companies which went out of business.  In many cases staff members wished to take over the operation of these companies but could not do so because the State would not provide assistance until the staff had been unemployed for six months.  At the end of that six month period, the business had moved elsewhere.  They should not be placed in that situation.  Will the Minister seriously consider this problem? If a small firm in the services sector, for example, goes out of business and members of the staff are prepared to maintain its operations, they should not be denied assistance or obliged to claim unemployment benefit for six months.  If these people can inform customers that they will take over the business when the owner leaves, we should put in place a process similar to that provided for under this Bill.  If we can do this for a foreign company, surely it can be done for our small industries.</P>
    <P>It is Government policy that people must claim unemployment benefit for six months before assistance is provided. This is completely wrong and I appeal to the Minister to end that system. Jobs are like gold dust and if lost, they cannot be replaced.  The opportunities to create jobs elsewhere do not exist.</P>
    <P>Another issue which must be considered is the tax system.  In the past, many small builders employed and trained workers at a lower cost than does FÁS.  However, because they were obliged to have tax free cards, etc., they went out of business and had to sign on for unemployment benefit.  We must <Col N="1575" /> stop looking at employers as speculators and people who steal from the State.  A man who invests money in his business and employs two to three people must receive help.  For that reason I support this Bill.  I support any measure designed to maintain employment.</P>
    <P>In the so-called good old days men travelled to England in search of employment.  If they obtained a job immediately, they climbed the ladder of success.  However, if they did not, they became part of the pub culture and would stand on street corners on Monday mornings waiting to be picked up for casual labour which lasted three to four days.  They then returned to the pub and eventually slid down the social ladder.</P>
    <P>People must have pride and the only way to have it is to be in employment. This cannot be achieved if obstacles are placed in the way and people must be unemployed for six months before receiving assistance from the State.  This is stupid because a similar amount of money to the amount they received in unemployment benefit would have helped them to remain in employment. Money would not be lost.  I appeal to the Minister to adopt this attitude.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel has cost much to maintain in terms of taxpayers' money.  However, it provided food for the families of 1,000 employees.  It had its good days, its sunrises and its sunsets.  Let us hope we are witnessing a new dawn and the company may be restored to its former glory and provide increased employment in County Cork, which has been an unemployment blackspot.</P>
    <P>Something must be done about objectors. We all want a good environment, but we will not have one if we return to the conditions of the 1930s and 1940s. At that time I was glad to work breaking stones for 12 shillings and 6p per week in the weeks leading up to Christmas.  Otherwise I would have had no money for Christmas.  I do not wish to return to a similar situation.  Many people who speak about protecting the environment never sat on a bag of hay, <Col N="1576" /> sheltering from the wind, breaking stones to earn money for Christmas.  I am not ashamed to admit that I experienced the bad old days.</P>
    <P>We must be more considerate toward those who create employment.  Construction of the Masonite factory in County Leitrim, which was delayed by objectors for many months, is almost complete.  It can hardly be seen from the road and it is invisible from the river. The same nonsense occurred when SNIA established a base in County Sligo 25 years ago.  It was stated that Lough Gill would be polluted and the area would never be the same.  SNIA operated for 25 years, created thousands of jobs and generated much money in the economy.  The lake was cleaner when the company departed than it had been when it arrived.  The objectors went silent &mdash; there was no word about the good side.</P>
    <P>We must encourage people and we cannot stop progress.  Some people stop road, water and sewerage schemes and then ask why there are no jobs.  How can we have jobs if we adopt that attitude? We must be more employment friendly and people who create jobs must be helped and supported because they are the people we want in society today.</P>
    <P>There are not only 300 jobs here, there is also spin-off employment which, as Senator Cregan said, involves many more jobs, perhaps up to 1,000.  When a firm closes, the number of small firms which also go the wall is colossal.  They all depend on each other; if one door closes, it has the effect of slamming another and when the breeze gets through the first door, every door slams. That is what happens in business.  We must give more consideration to creating jobs but, above all, we must be more helpful to people who try to create work.</P>
    <P>I appeal to workers to form co-operatives if their company is going out of business.  They should get together to keep their jobs because if they do not, their sons, daughters, grandsons and granddaughters will go through what I went through growing up in the thirties, <Col N="1577" /> when there were no jobs and no social welfare.  Social welfare will disappear again if there are no jobs; we cannot continue to have a social conscience and pay out money if we do not have workers, because it is they who put the money into the kitty.  If we do not have workers we cannot carry the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to repeat elsewhere what he has done in this Bill.  I know it has cost a lot of money.  I ask him to give service industries the recognition they deserve.  Those companies pay wages and, like employees of companies which export, their employees also pay into the Exchequer.  Those industries are also necessary but they have received a raw deal and it is time we gave them greater consideration.</P>
    <P>For years I have argued that we can create jobs.  We are an industrial nation and there is a big market to which we should be selling our wares but are we helping small industries to sell their wares?  Do we have proper sales management? We should be helping small companies to do this.  I have suggested to certain people that they should call to companies who are expanding their businesses but they never do, although they are paid to do so.  We should put greater emphasis on officials in our State-sponsored bodies giving advice. Someone who wants to create jobs should not have to run to offices, cap in hand; the people in those bodies should leave their offices to meet him.</P>
    <P>The employer must be regarded as the most important person in our society.  No firm should close its doors if there is any possibility of keeping them open.  Corporations or county councils who evict a person for not paying his rent have to provide him with another house at no cost to him.  Would they not be better to make a deal or to compromise and leave him where he was?  The same logic can be applied to jobs; we must help firms who are prepared to help themselves.  I welcome the Bill and wish it every success.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, all the more so for introducing the Irish Steel Limited Bill, 1996, to secure the company's future.  The uncertainty which has hung over the future of Irish Steel for some years has had an adverse effect on economic confidence and activity in Cobh.  The announcement last year that a deal had been concluded with ISPAT marked the beginning of a new era for Irish Steel, ISPAT, Cobh and Cork generally.  I am confident ISPAT will be able to turn Irish Steel around and that the company will be able to harness the proven commitment of its workers in establishing a market niche for itself.</P>
      <P>Credit is due to this Government, and in particular to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and their officials, who worked tirelessly to secure not only the ISPAT deal but also UK agreement for the aid package.  Management and unions at Irish Steel are also to be commended because they were constructive at all times.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Quinn, this is the only steel mill in Ireland and in any evaluation of this investment, consideration should be given to the spin-off to other industries, as other speakers said. The building of the tunnel in Cork is being served by steel from the mill.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn may not entirely appreciate the impact of this investment on Cobh and Cork.  It proves that Ireland is not Dublin only; we have a steel industry and the Government has decided to support it.  We must also consider the rates and taxes which will accrue, as well as the revenue to An Bord Gáis and the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decline in employment at Irish Steel &mdash; from 1,000 two decades ago to just 561 &mdash; mirrors a similar decline in other European plants.  It has been clear for some time that cost reductions and restructuring measures would have to be implemented if the company's long-term future was to be guaranteed.  This <Col N="1579" /> Government has overseen the transfer of Irish Steel from State to private ownership in a manner which ensures the interests of the workforce are protected, not just now but in the future.</P>
    <P>In seeking to secure agreement for the aid package, thus guaranteeing the future of Irish Steel, the Government had to overcome persistent objections from the UK.  The restrictions on production and export imposed by the EU are due largely to UK fears that a rejuvenated Irish Steel could pose a threat to British Steel.  That in itself is a measure of ISPAT's reputation for turning ailing enterprises around.  It is, however, ironic that the UK Tories &mdash; apostles of free competition, deregulation and unfettered markets &mdash; should seek to impose conditions designed to render Irish Steel uncompetitive.  I have no doubt that Irish Steel will overcome the restrictions and will go on to carve out a distinctive and profitable niche for itself both in European and world markets.</P>
    <P>We should not, however, lose sight of the fact that the problems confronting Irish Steel in recent years are part of the wider difficulties confronting the European steel industry as a whole.  In this regard, Democratic Left has long argued for the formulation of a common European industrial policy which would control State aids to the richer central regions of the EU while supporting industries located on the periphery.  We believe the development of a common industrial policy is vital to regional development and to ensuring that jobs are created and maintained in the periphery rather than being concentrated in the centre.  Competition and intervention are not mutually exclusive.  The challenge facing us is to develop a common policy which would ensure that location is not a bar to competition and which enables all industries to compete on a level playing field.  Unemployment is currently the greatest challenge facing the EU.  The innovative ideas put forward by the former President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, in the <Col N="1580" /> White Paper on Employment have not been fully implemented.  I would like to see the early implementation of the Delors proposals together with the formulation of a common industrial policy which will facilitate industries throughout the EU in achieving their full potential.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  We have called many times for a debate on Irish Steel.  I have to declare a vested interest in the matter as I am from Cork.  For the past 18 months to two years when we read of Irish Steel going to the wall or of a possible takeover, our thoughts were with the workers.  They were willing to make sacrifices but were often kept in the dark as to what was happening.  I understood the sensitivity of the issue while the Minister tried to find a company interested in taking over Irish Steel to secure its future.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister referred to provisions to ensure the workers' rights are protected and to allow him intervene if necessary.  It was an overriding concern for the Irish Steel unions, the workers and the public representatives in the Cork area that in the event of a take-over there could be mass redundancies and lower pay levels.  Public representatives in Cork did not make a political issue of Irish Steel.  Had they tried to grab headlines it would have instilled more fear and undermined the confidence of the company.</P>
      <P>ISPAT International has a fine reputation. I am glad Senator Sherlock has welcomed private enterprise to Ireland at long last.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to be welcomed that private enterprise is ensuring the future of a former State enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed with the UK's negotiating stance, using its veto at EU level.  It was also disappointing that the Spanish presidency suggested that Ireland and the UK should get together to thrash out a deal.  The UK should <Col N="1581" /> have had to object and negotiate before the other member states rather than behind closed doors where it could force the Minister's hand.</P>
    <P>Unanimity among our EU partners has been obtained but Irish Steel will have a cap on its production which could be of detriment to the venture in the long-term.  The UK wanted the cap on production because it fears ISPAT International and the possibility of Irish Steel becoming a major force in steel production in this area of Europe.  The Minister should outline in greater detail why he is confident the cap on production will not pose any major problems for the plant at Haulbowline.</P>
    <P>The European steel industry has been transformed and profit margins whittled away.  The industry had been hugely labour intensive since early 1940s, yet technology was not introduced until the industry was stagnant.  It finally dawned that if something was not done the job losses would have been enormous.  Up to 100,000 people will be laid off in the foreseeable future in the German steel industry to ensure its viability.  It is a measure of the importance of the deal to Ireland to note that we will have a few lay-offs but the survival of Irish Steel is assured.</P>
    <P>In the future, if a State or other company is on the brink of closure, the Government must make a definite decision and guarantee the workers it will do its best to ensure the company will receive State aid or that a third party will be found to ensure its survival. For weeks on end Irish Steel workers were ferried out to Ringaskiddy for meetings and ballots, and the unions met officials and public representatives. It was sad to see people not knowing from day to day what was to happen.</P>
    <P>In such crises the Government must decide it will ensure a company stays in business.  Irish Steel had to be saved because of the huge spin-off for the Cork region.  Had Irish Steel closed many people would have been laid off in smaller downstream industries.  I welcome the Bill because the Government <Col N="1582" /> did not stand back and let the company close.  I also welcome the provisions which allow the Minister to monitor the process of the take-over.  I wish the workers the best for the future.  I am slightly disappointed the Minister did not send a card to the British Minister, Tim Eggar, thanking him for his help in securing the viability of Irish Steel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their constructive and worthwhile contributions to the debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn's comments were the most critical.  They are based on a misapprehension. Irish Steel was a State owned company and the State had full responsibility for its liabilities.  Closure of Irish Steel, if the Senator contemplated that as an alternative, would have been much more expensive for the taxpayer. One of the merits of the deal is that we have secured the long-term future of employment in the company with the arrival of a strong international player to support Irish Steel and have done so at a cost less than that of closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third alternative was to retain the company in State ownership and hope to build a viable future.  However, that would have cost a minimum of £50 million &mdash; far more than is involved in the ISPAT International deal.  The EU Commission which did a great deal of consultative analysis on the viability of the various proposals, was extremely sceptical as to whether Irish Steel could have achieved viability in State ownership. We might not have been able to take that option even if we had wanted to.  Senator Quinn's example giving the cost of a green field start up, where IDA Ireland or Forbairt might offer grant aid to a newly establishing industry, does not compare with a State owned company where the State was bound, in terms of decommissioning the plant, to repay substantial loans and trade creditors and to make provision for very substantial redundancy sums etc.  The Senator is wide of the point in suggesting <Col N="1583" /> that this was bad value for money or throwing good money after bad.</P>
    <P>One may question whether this is a sunrise industry.  While not many would regard the steel industry as a new or modern industry, it is clear that steel production will be here for a long time and successful players who develop good technology and get into the marketplace effectively will have a strong future.  The key to the long term success of Irish Steel Limited will be to have the support of a strategic partner who can improve the quality and range of products available.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey asked why the cost increased from the original package of £27.5 million to the final package of £37.5 million.  We will consider this in detail on Committee Stage, but broadly speaking, the condition we had to accept at EU level required that a substantial part &mdash; approximately 10 per cent of production &mdash; would have to be diverted away from EU to non EU markets. This, coupled with the cap on overall production, constrains the company. It is easy to see that to transport relatively low value and high volume product from outside the EU markets into non EU markets is a considerable penalty. When such conditions were imposed there was a clear cost implication. However, the project, including the cap on production, has been assessed not only by us, but by the EU consultancy and has been passed as viable.  The consultancy is happy that the project, with the investment proposed by ISPAT International, will be able to achieve viability, even with the cap on production.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan and others questioned why any one EU member should be in a position to impose such caps. Under Article 95, unanimity is required for any State aid provision.  This means moving at the pace of the slowest mover.  The British Government had a veto and we had to negotiate to a considerable degree on their terms.  Many have criticised the approach taken.  I was, at times, confused and bewildered <Col N="1584" /> by the British approach, because only approximately 10 per cent of the output of Irish Steel Limited would overlap with the output of the plant at Shelton, with which they were specifically concerned, and of this amount, only approximately 7,000 tonnes were being sold into UK markets.  There was not, therefore, direct head to head competition as has often been presented in the media.  Nevertheless, given that unanimity is required under Article 95, the Government was constrained, as was the EU Commission.  Throughout, we had the very strong support of the Commission, but the British position was disappointing and it cost the taxpayer more.  However, the alternative to not doing a deal was to see the company go down.  We cannot provide any State aid money without agreement at the EU Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Many Senators raised the issue of safeguards to workers.  There are contractual commitments by the companies in the terms of the agreement so that if employment falls below 300 there is provision for certain repayments.  I am optimistic that the project is strong and that this clause will not be used.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey asked why we sold the entire shareholding without retaining some of it, or holding out for worker shareholding.  When we entered the original competition to attract a strategic partner, we were interested in the possibility of State or worker shareholding. However, all of the serious bidders envisaged 100 per cent holding and did not envisage that the State would continue as a shareholder.  It would not be an enviable position for the State to hold a minority shareholding in a company controlled by another party.  It is better to proceed with our present arrangement.  There are monitoring arrangements with regard to issues such as the investments planned by ISPAT International.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey also inquired as to the advantages offered by ISPAT International over others.  It was partly the commitment of investment it was willing to make, but it was also its strength as a <Col N="1585" /> strategic partner.  ISPAT International is strong.  Its background in terms of sourcing raw material, technology and commitment to improving the technology of the plant and its wide international spread gave confidence that, not only was the financial deal better, but that the company had credibility as a partner.  We are especially pleased with the company.</P>
    <P>I recognise the value of Senator Cregan's remarks on downstream employment. It is a very important aspect of this project.  I have already addressed his comments on the issue of competition and how one company can hold out against another in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell and Senator Cashin raised concerns about asset stripping. There will be no question of this.  Under the deal, ISPAT International is putting £20 million of capital investment into the plant enabling it to build up the quality of assets.  In addition, there was no head to head competition with British Steel.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell raised the wider agenda of job creation strategy.  Much of what he said made good sense.  The service sector needs far greater recognition. Problems regarding a six month period on the dole would not normally apply in the case of management buy-outs. The issue of support from the dole is related to measures such as back to work allowances, administered by the Department of Social Welfare, and involves people who were unemployed starting up.  Management buy-outs are different and perhaps I will follow this up with the Senator on another occasion.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock raised the interesting issue of the need for a common industrial policy with regard to State aid.  This is desirable from an Irish and an EU perspective.  The difficulty with not having some kind of co-ordinated approach is that we effectively get into wasteful competition for projects and the European taxpayer is ultimately the loser.  The stronger countries can afford to offer higher levels of State aid, even within the existing State maxima.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1586" /> The difficulty with getting change in this area is that, like section 95 under the steel aid code, substantial unanimity would be required for any changes in State aid rules to be brought in at EU level.  It would be extremely difficult to establish State aid ceilings.  However, I would be keen to examine this issue in the context of our own EU Presidency, from June to December this year, to see whether we can establish a more level playing pitch for State aids.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher spoke about the fear that the capping of State aid would damage the long-term viability of the plant.  We would prefer not to have the cap imposed but we have, at the same time, vetted this carefully and we are confident that the package as agreed will secure viability.  I dealt with Senator Quinn's comments at the start of my reply.  The situation where the IDA looks at greenfield start ups for outsiders coming in is different from the situation where the State owns a company and with it all the liabilities built up &mdash; such as loans outstanding, commitments to redundancy payments and to decommissioning the plant.  We valued these commitments at well in excess of £40 million, and that was not including the written off loan.</P>
    <P>In terms of value for State money, we have a strong plant going forward with a good international partner in an industry which one might not say is a sunrise industry but nonetheless is a very important strategic industry in the long term.  We will be able to secure a good niche for ourselves in this industry on the basis of that partnership.  Our action today is a lot cheaper than the alternative of closing.  A value for money test has to look at the realistic alternatives and the two alternatives were far less attractive than the deal we are doing today.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their very constructive approach which has characterised the debate in these Houses on Irish Steel throughout the last number of years.  There has been a consensus across the political parties to deal constructively with this issue and that cross <Col N="1587" /> party support has helped ensure that the State got a better deal for all concerned.</P>

    <Title>Refugee Bill, 1995: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, but I am totally frustrated by the length of time it has taken for this legislation to come before the Oireachtas.  Members are aware that a number of years ago the Refugee Protection Bill, which was first proposed by Deputy Shatter and later by Senator Neville, was not accepted by the previous Government. In 1994, the then Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, introduced a Refugee Bill but, unfortunately, it fell when the previous Government left office. Given that humanitarian protection is vital, that important legislation, which sought to safeguard internationally recognised rights, should not have been considered on a party political partisan basis.  The important provisions contained in the Refugee Protection Bill and the Refugee Bill, 1994, received, in practice, the backing of all parties in <Col N="1588" /> both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In that light I welcome the Refugee Bill, 1995, which arises from the Government programme negotiated in December 1994.</P>
      <P>I am sure Members are aware of the precarious way in which the State treated refugees seeking asylum in Ireland.  Our record in terms of those seeking asylum and protection is one of the most disgraceful episodes in our history. I hope the new legislation will shift the balance and tide of history so that we will successfully fulfil our international obligations.  The 1951 UN Geneva Convention and the subsequent 1967 Protocol, while accepted by Ireland, were not put into practice.  The Bill will put into law for the first time the international obligations Ireland accepted when it signed the Geneva Convention relating to the rights of refugees.</P>
      <P>It is most important to make a clear distinction between those to whom reference is made and the rights we are seeking to bestow on them.  Unfortunately, sensational prejudices and nationalistic commentary fuels much of the debate on this issue in Europe. Establishing rights for refugees does not mean the creation of an easy or quick route to Ireland for those seeking protection from crimes they committed in other jurisdictions.  Instead, through this Bill we are recognising our international obligations and giving effect to them by our actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is not a landlocked country surrounded by six or seven or other jurisdictions, nor is it a gateway for international terrorism.  There is not a ready supply of employment opportunities here for the thousands of people throughout Europe displaced as a result of political or economic upheaval.  The number of refugees seeking asylum in Ireland is probably the lowest of any EU state.  That is borne out by the figures. Just over 1,000 people are seeking asylum in Ireland at the moment and in 1995 a total of 424 persons sought refugee status here.  Therefore, we are not referring to a massive transfer of population. The number of refugees who <Col N="1589" /> seek asylum in Ireland is a small percentage of the total number who seek that status in other European jurisdictions. It is important to state that point clearly because some people seek to distort the true picture.</P>
    <P>People in this State must realise that in signing the 1951 Geneva Convention, or any other international treaty, we took on certain obligations.  We have a responsibility to put a transparent system in place and to play our part in providing a home for those who seek refugee status.  To date, this has not been the case in Ireland and I hope this Bill will change that.  We must never forget that hundreds of thousands of Irish people received a home in countless foreign jurisdictions over the past 300 years and we have an obligation to find a home and safe place for people escaping tyranny or fleeing political persecution.  It would be totally hypocritical for us, as a State, to put our collective heads in the sand when it comes to recognising refugees' rights when so many of our people found such rights and comforts abroad, albeit in different circumstances.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a proud record of standing up to persecution and tyranny where it raises its head across the world.  Frequently we allow our security forces to take their place with the United Nations to defend displaced people in poverty stricken countries.  We rightly pride ourselves on our record of helping to establish and guarantee human rights throughout the civilised world. However, law officers of this State have, in the not too distant past, summarily sent those seeking refugee status here back to the countries from which they came.  Lecturing other countries on human rights issues must not be just theory, it must be of practical application by our State to help the most defenceless and vulnerable people.</P>
    <P>I will wait until Committee Stage to deal with each section in detail and just make some observations at this stage.  A number of agencies regard this legislation as worthwhile but feel, from their experience, that some modifications may be required.  The Minister of State <Col N="1590" /> signified on Committee Stage in the Dáil that she would look at a number of aspects of the legislation.  The issue is not of questioning the system which has been proposed to deal with refugees seeking asylum, but rather that it seems exceptionally difficult for refugees to enter the system under which their application will be judged.  I hope we can iron out these difficulties, otherwise many of the people whom the Bill is intended to help will be unaffected by its measures and their chances of making a successful application will not get over the first hurdle.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is aware of the need to provide adequate interpretation facilities for those seeking asylum.  The application form is available in only six languages which prevents many refugees from understanding the procedures in this country.  Is it possible to provide interpreters for those seeking refugee status at a much earlier stage in the process? As Members are aware, the vast majority of asylum seekers have little or no English and their inability to communicate with immigration officers adds to their trauma.</P>
    <P>What proposals does the Minister of State have for the establishment of a special unit within the legal aid system to deal with the legal requirements of applicants for refugee status?  A mere 20 people received refugee status in Ireland recently.  While this figure is low, how large a backlog of applications will emerge when the legislation is passed?  The Minister of State undertook on Committee Stage in the Dáil to put in place special provisions through the legal aid system for asylum seekers. What provisions has she made?</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed establishment of an appeal board.  It is vitally important for the system of deciding on applications for refugee status to be seen as open and transparent.  Refugees should have the same rights of appeal as those enjoyed by every citizen in the State.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to enact new procedures to satisfy the 1951 Geneva Convention. It also highlights a greater <Col N="1591" /> awareness of the problems of persecution and tyranny which still exist, and of which we have seen a great deal lately.  The Bill brings our laws up to date and fulfils our international obligations. However, we are also seeking to stretch out the hand of friendship to those who have undergone despicable treatment in their countries of origin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which brings to an end a sorry chapter in Ireland's history of dealing with refugees and asylum seekers.  Although this may sound contentious, for a country which has shown, and continues to show, so much compassion to other parts of the world, particularly the Third World, our record of dealing with refugees and political asylum seekers over the past two decades has been appalling. I have heard and read of people being bundled back on to aeroplanes &mdash; many such occurrences are unseen, unreported and unpublicised &mdash; and whenever I raised the matter with various Administrations over the years, it became clear that the main reason for such action on the part of the authorities was not that they lacked compassion &mdash; far from it &mdash; but political expediency.</P>
      <P>The point has been made repeatedly that, because of the easy access Irish citizens have to the United Kingdom, we are, in effect, treated similarly to a Commonwealth country.  Certain Protocols were entered into to ensure that Ireland would not be seen as a back door for refugees, political asylum seekers and others denied access to the United Kingdom.  It is a sad fact of <i>real-politik</i> that we, as a sovereign nation, have had to adopt such Protocols. However, the motives were of the highest order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several hundred thousand Irish people live in the United Kingdom and one million people in London are Irish born or of Irish descent.  Given the history of relations between the two countries, if we were to allow unfettered access to non-citizens there is no doubt <Col N="1592" /> that the flog them and hang them brigade associated with the British Conservative Party, which needs little excuse to call for passport controls, would use such a policy change to introduce unacceptable controls on Irish citizens travelling between the United Kingdom and Ireland.  What amuses me about this lobby, a constant feature of British politics, is that it does not appear to recognise that the traffic is not all one way; a substantial number of British citizens travel to this country, be it for business or pleasure, and they would not welcome the introduction of passport controls in what they consider to be a friendly country.  Perhaps this is an ideal opportunity to highlight that aspect of the continuous and offensive call from British MPs who should know better.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to all who campaigned for this legislation for many years, especially the Irish Refugee Council, Refugee Trust, Amnesty International and individuals too numerous to mention. The tone of my contribution to this debate will be influenced to a large extent by the warm welcome for this legislation from the aforementioned organisations.  However, a number of concerns have been raised and I will deal with some of them.  They will be familiar to the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>One concern centres on a position paper from the National Union of Journalists.  I will declare my interest because I am a practising journalist and a member of the National Union of Journalists.  I have great empathy with the NUJ on their point that section 19 appears to directly contravene the part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states: &ldquo;Everyone has the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media, regardless of frontiers&rdquo;.  Section 19 requires the consent of the Minister for Justice as well as the applicant before details of a case can be published or broadcast.  Any breach of this regulation results in a fine of up to £1,500 and or imprisonment for up to six months.  That will concentrate the minds of journalists.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1593" /> I accept that an applicant has the right to refuse publicity.  However, the point being made by the NUJ is that the power granted to the Minister under this section could &mdash; and I use that word advisedly &mdash; be used to ensure that matters of potential embarrassment to the Government of the day could be denied a public hearing.  A political activist who might have a criticism to make about individual Ministers, officials, a political party, a politician or anybody associated with the Government of the day might feel his plight offers an ideal opportunity to make that criticism.  The criticism might or might not be justified but the Minister of the day could decide that it would be best to leave matters unsaid.  That is where the concerns of the NUJ are centred.  The union believes in openness, accountability and transparency.  Whoever first coined that phrase should have taken out copyright on it because he or she would have made a pile in royalties each time it was repeated.  The NUJ claim these powers could be misinterpreted.  I will be interested to hear the Minister of State's response to their concerns.</P>
    <P>The Irish Refugee Council raised a number of concerns.  The provision of translation and legal services to an applicant is absolutely essential.  The reason I took this matter to heart is that, as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, within the last 12 months I listened to representatives of Refugee Trust and of the settled Vietnamese community in this country discussing it.  Some members of that community live in or near the Minister of State's constituency.  This is a law abiding, low profile community which came to Ireland in the aftermath of the Vietnamese war.  It appears to have integrated effectively into and made a positive contribution to Irish society in a variety of areas and we should acknowledge that and pay tribute to the community for it.</P>
    <P>Their main concern &mdash; and this applies to their countrymen or somebody coming to this country who cannot speak our language &mdash; centred on the <Col N="1594" /> lack of information printed in their language from Government and State agencies. One could argue that they have translation facilities and there are people in their community who speak perfect English or have learned English since they arrived here.  However, it was depressing to hear that after that length of time these people still had difficulty in interpreting ordinary Government documents and State information leaflets about areas such as social welfare, education and other State services which we take for granted because we speak the language.  I was struck by their concern and I found it depressing.  I am not sure if action has been taken since then.</P>
    <P>A section within the Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for liaising with such communities and I am sure it would argue it is doing the best job in the circumstances.  However, of all the concerns the Vietnamese had, their major concern focused on the denial of the basic right of access to Government publications on social services and the rights of citizens to a significant proportion of their community who could not read English.</P>
    <P>That predicament can be applied to a political refugee or asylum seeker who cannot speak English.  There appears not to be a legal requirement to provide translation and legal services to an applicant.  The Minister of State, on Committee Stage in the Dáil, said that the Bill would place &ldquo;the highest possible onus on the authorities to provide interpretation&rdquo;.  The Irish Refugee Council finds this terminology unacceptable and I must confess to sympathising with the council.  While the Minister of State is highly motivated and means well, this legislation will be enshrined in law and will outlast all of us.  Now is the time to change the phrase &ldquo;where possible&rdquo; to something more substantive.  I will be interested in hearing the views of the Minister of State; I hope they will be an advance on those she gave on Committee Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" /> The other area of concern relates to detention.  I urge the Government to explore alternatives to detention when an applicant has to await a final decision.  The Irish Refugee Council expressed great concern about this issue.  In its view detention is not appropriate for asylum seekers, save in extreme circumstances of public safety. It is not a proportionate response to an investigation into an applicant's identity. The council is concerned that interpretation of section 9 (8) (c), (d) and (e) would penalise asylum seekers who have made difficult decisions while traumatised or confused by using false documents or by deliberately destroying travel documents.  In that context the council strongly urges the exploration of alternatives to detention.</P>
    <P>I agree with this because some, if not all, of those seeking asylum in this country may have had to leave their countries of origin in extremely difficult circumstances; they may have had to leave overnight.  They may have been under surveillance in their home countries for some time and they may have been operating under aliases for legitimate political reasons.  It seems to me that the Bill may not take account of this scenario, which may be used as a disadvantage in the processing of such a person's application.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (4) (b) concerns the right to work.  The Irish Refugee Council recognises that the talents and creativity of those seeking asylum could contribute positively to the economy and culture of Ireland.  If this is so, permission to work could be granted after six months residence to asylum seekers, as is the case in the UK.  International studies have documented that asylum seekers who most fully integrate into the host country are the first to return to their countries of origin when circumstances there improve.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the right to work is granted, in certain circumstances, to asylum seekers who are awaiting the outcome of their applications.  According to the Irish Refugee Council, the <Col N="1596" /> Minister has put forward a number of justifications for denial of the right to work, one of them being that the decision making process would be so speedy &mdash; I wish the Minister well in this &mdash; that there would be no need to look for work in the interim period.  There is also a suggestion that the cost of providing supplementary welfare allowance is arguably reduced by permitting people to seek employment so that they would not be a burden on the State.  In this context there is no doubt that there is a strong argument for assessing the talents and creativity potential of an asylum seeker and this must be taken into account by all those concerned in this process.  If the person who is seeking asylum has proper and credible bona fides which would not give rise to any conclusion, other than that he or she would be a force for positive good in the community, detention would be a harsh penalty to impose during the application process.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on this.</P>
    <P>The definition of a refugee is a difficult area.  I would hope we would not use legal jargon to exclude people for the political reasons I indicated at the outset and I seek some assurance from the Minister on this.  In the EU there is a growing trend towards a &ldquo;fortress Europe&rdquo; policy.  I would hate to think that, because we, as a peripheral nation, are in a sense an outpost of Europe, pressure will be put on the Irish Government by our EU colleagues to strictly interpret this law in a way which would be in their interests rather than ours.  Unquestionably, there has been a trend in Europe over the last few years towards a stricter immigration policy.  I have no doubt this will accelerate with the pending integration of Eastern European countries into the EU.  A stricter policy has already emerged in France.  The British are past masters at interpreting asylum laws for their own benefit.  Some of their legislation, which has resulted in the splitting of families, has caused anger and sorrow and has been downright uncharitable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> I would be grateful for a reassurance from the Minister that we will adopt our own sovereign attitude to the definition of refugees and that we will not be influenced to any great extent by trends in Europe.  It is inevitable that we are going to be sucked into this debate because of our EU membership, our peripheral nature and our unprotected coasts.  I understand there have been unrecorded attempts by people to enter Ireland through the UK, not on scheduled airlines or ferries but illegally.  I have no statistical information on this but there is a perception that this is happening because of our proximity to the UK.  As the law becomes more defined and more anti-immigration in several larger EU countries, especially the UK, I would hate to think that we would use this legislation, laudable as it is, to deny access because we accept an international definition of refugees or deem it more politic to interpret the legislation in such a way.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to NGOs and I acknowledged the great contribution they are making to this debate.  The Minister also acknowledged this and I have no doubt that she will continue to do so &mdash; it is what I would expect from her because of her work with NGOs in her previous career.  The Irish Refugee Council would like explicit recognition of the role played by local NGOs in the determination process and would welcome an invitation to partake in discussions on the role of NGOs in the context of the Bill.</P>
    <P>NGOs unquestionably do marvellous work in an area about which, to put it bluntly, the majority of people in this country could not care less because it does not impact on them.  So what if poor unfortunates arrive off planes without tickets or visas and are returned from where they came?  We do not worry about such matters.  We salve our consciences in other ways, perhaps by giving money to Third World charities. We are dealing with human life and there is a duty on all of us as Christians to ensure that people will not be adversely affected by this legislation by <Col N="1598" /> being imprisoned or returned to their countries of origin.  We have this duty even if only one person is so affected. We should be compassionate in our approach and not take a legalistic view.</P>
    <P>The chairman and vice-chairman of the Refugee Appeal Board must be practising barristers with not less than ten years experience.  I appreciate that we are dealing with matters of law but why should people in the public service with a non-legal approach not be considered? Why was it felt necessary to exclude everybody except those with ten years experience as barristers?  Do they have a monopoly of wisdom in this regard?  Those of us who observe courts and the practise of law throughout the country would hardly think so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely this exclusion narrows the Minister's scope for action in this area. If she identifies people, some of whom may work with NGOs, who have long administrative experience, have been at the coal face and have all the necessary credentials, surely they should be considered for these posts The Refugee Appeal Board will determine after the fact decisions made by the Minister and other agencies.  I am not enthusiastic about that aspect of the legislation.  Perhaps the Minister could widen it to include this area because it seems exclusive and elitist in this day and age. We have a great deal of talent and expertise, so why should it be excluded? I look forward to the Minister's response.  I reiterate my welcome for <Col N="1599" /> this long awaited legislation which is to this Administration's credit.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. These provisions represent a considerable improvement for those seeking refugee status.  They aim to correct the most glaring inadequacies in a system which leaves much to be desired.</P>
      <P>We pride ourselves on being a welcoming country.  The welcome should extend to those in need of refuge in the same way as it applies to those who come here on holidays.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries Irish people needed a refuge from persecution, poverty, famine and hardship.  The United States and Australia provided a political refuge, while Britain provided an economic refuge for thousands of Irish families.  In an earlier period continental Europe provided a refuge for the Wild Geese.  We hope the days are gone when Irish people have to seek refuge.  However, we should not forget our history or our responsibility to those less fortunate than ourselves.</P>
      <P>In recent years we accepted refugees from Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America.  They are making a valuable contribution to the development of our country.  Who could have foreseen ten years ago the horrendous ethnic cleansing in Bosnia?  That unfortunate country has suffered from war, racism, genocide and devastation, while we in the developed part of western Europe are troubled by nothing more than arguments about a common European currency. We cannot nor should we try to isolate a prosperous western Europe from the rest of the Continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an important interest in European stability and have a role to play in this regard.  Our refugee policy is an important contributory factor.  Our policy on refugees should not be governed solely by considerations of self-interest. We are a small independent nation which has made a significant contribution to foreign policy and the workings of the United Nations.  We have authority, credibility and standing <Col N="1600" /> among the international community. Our refugee policy is important for our reputation.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Government for introducing this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  We are doing nothing more than we should have done many years ago.  When we signed the Geneva Convention in 1951 we should have taken on board our national as well as our international responsibilities.  However, signing the convention merely provided a photo opportunity and, unfortunately, the reasons for it became clouded.  We have been waiting since 1951 to introduce this Bill, although I will not criticise anyone for that.  I am delighted the Bill is before the House today.  There is no reason we cannot accept our obligations under the convention.  This Bill should not take away any rights under the Geneva Convention.</P>
      <P>Ireland will not be inundated with refugees.  Approximately 2,000 people applied for refugee status in the past and this has increased since Aeroflot started flying through Shannon from Cuba.  There has been an increase in the number of refugees from countries where people are in danger.  Ireland is on the periphery of the refugee problem. There will be a major refugee problem in Europe from Africa into southern Europe and from the former USSR into Germany and the eastern part of the EU.  However, we will not be inundated with applicants for asylum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who has travelled to see the plight of refugees in camps throughout the world know they live in poverty and in sordid conditions with no rights and without hope.  We should, therefore, feel privileged to accept a small number of refugees and to apply this Bill in a fair manner.  Few obstacles should be put before people running away from persecution.  Some countries persecute their people in an inhumane way.  The word &ldquo;animalistic&rdquo; was used in this Chamber &mdash; I would not use that phrase <Col N="1601" />&mdash; but the treatment of citizens in some countries has downgraded the word human.</P>
    <P>It should not be a problem to provide interpreters because many people who seek asylum come from eastern Europe, Cuba or Africa.  Few people come here from Africa who do not speak Spanish, English or French.  The majority of interpreters would need to know Portuguese, Spanish and French.  The same applies for refugees from Cuba.  Few people from eastern Europe do not speak English or French.  Although people without English, French, Spanish or Portuguese are in the minority, interpreters should be sought in the short term.  If a person can get on an plane in eastern Europe to fly to London and then on to Dublin, somebody must be able to understand their ticketing and seating arrangements.  Few people arrive in Ireland by boat.  I do not know any instance where somebody has left a mother ship off the coast and has arrived in County Kerry, County Cork or County Wexford.</P>
    <P>There have been many problems in relation to refugees.  I remember when the refugees arrived from Hungary in 1956.  They were dumped in camps which had been abandoned by the Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Two refugees were in school with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were given little support.  Some, however, did very well and stayed here.  I had the privilege of visiting Hungary last year and I attended a social function with the Ambassador at which I met two sons of refugees who had come here in 1956. They had gone to school and university here and had then gone back to Hungary to give it the benefit of what they had learned.  People who come here may return to their country of origin if the situation changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ensure that refugees are treated humanely and are not dumped and put into confined quarters.  Often refugees are already traumatised when <Col N="1602" /> they arrive here and then they are met by officious people from the Department of Foreign Affairs or another group and treated as genuine refugees only if they can prove otherwise and that they are not coming here for social or economic reasons.  They must be treated as citizens and not traumatised further by being placed in confined quarters without interpretative services and legal aid.  Genuine asylum seekers will not have the resources to pay for the legal aid which I would expect if I arrived without a passport in another country.</P>
    <P>As I said refugees arrive in a traumatised state as they are fleeing from an authoritarian regime and they should be treated like citizens.  If it is proven that they are not genuine refugees under this Bill or the 1951 Convention, then so be it.  We will not need to set up camps for hundreds of thousands of people as has happened in central and eastern Africa or in Jordan to which Palestinians in Kuwait fled.  There is a difference between what we and other nations face.  I plead with the Minister to give anyone seeking asylum refugee status.  It should not be impossible to provide interpretation facilities in Dublin, Shannon and Rosslare.</P>
    <P>Anybody who leaves a country in which they are not wanted and in which they feel threatened will not have proper travel documents.  It is nonsense to think that anybody genuinely seeking refuge will have a passport unless it or exit documents are valid for five to seven years.  I have seen the plight of genuine refugees who have spent 20 to 30 years in camps which they cannot leave.</P>
    <P>I ask that this Bill take people's humanity into account.  In the past we have not welcomed foreigners who sought refugee status.  There have been instances of blatant racism, although we like to believe that we welcome people from abroad.  We have been as racist as other countries when dealing with under-privileged people from abroad. Indeed, foreign students who have come to Dublin to study have been treated as <Col N="1603" /> the Irish were in Great Britain after World War Two.</P>
    <P>There is racism in Ireland because it is not a multi-racial society; it has tended to be white.  Medical staff from abroad who serve us well are discriminated against in towns and cities.  If professionals who have studied here and who are giving their professional services are being treated in a racist manner, how can a person fleeing corruption and fearing for their safety believe they will be treated fairly?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure the human element is taken into account in the implementation of the Bill.  Whoever deals with these people, whether it be the appeal board, the commissioner or whoever, should treat them as if they were genuine refugees until it is proven otherwise.  We will not be inundated with large numbers of people seeking refugee status.  There will be no boat people.  We will not have a situation such as that which exists between Cuba and Miami or the countries which border Rwanda.  It will only cost us a small amount of money to pamper these refugees when they arrive for a short time. If they must stay, they must be given the dignity of reasonable housing, education and being able to apply for a job.  If we give them asylum, they should have the same rights to work as an Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  Most fairminded people will see there is a growing need for the Irish people to show they feel for less fortunate people who must flee their countries.  We live in a cocoon.  We live in a safe environment.  We have reasonable laws and a reasonable chance in life.  The people who come here as refugees do not have that.  I have seen what man can do to his fellow man and the inhumanity of this world appalls me at times.  I ask the Minister to be humane.  I ask that we be forgiving if a person is not exactly as they appear. Even if we cannot allow people to stay here as genuine refugees and they must be sent away, I ask that we ensure they go away feeling they were treated as human beings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for bringing the Bill to the House.</P>
      <P>When I was first elected to Dáil Éireann in 1982 I used to hear some of my colleagues from County Clare and County Limerick raise cases of refugees who had arrived at Shannon Airport.  I never thought I would be faced with such a case until four coloured people, three men and a woman, approached me as I finished a clinic I held at Markievicz House.  One of the men told me that the woman was a refugee from Sri Lanka and that if she was forced to return, she would face summary execution.  They gave me the name of a barrister who was acting on her behalf so I contacted her the next morning and she explained the details to me.  She told me that her application was under examination by the Department of Justice and that the young lady in question was pregnant.  Then it came to my attention that the authorities here were preparing a deportation order so my only recourse at that time was to approach the then Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, with whom I shared a constituency.  He showed great sympathy towards the case.  He said he would use his authority to have the matter examined and would put a stop on the deportation order.  I went to bed happy that night because I felt we were saving this woman from the terrible experience she would face if she was forced to return to her country.  The next morning I rang her barrister to tell her the good news and was somewhat taken aback to hear that in panic the woman had taken the boat to England the previous night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explain that case to the House because I do not think we dealt well with applicants for asylum in the past.  I welcome this Bill because it includes a mechanism which her barrister could have used had it applied in 1983, that is, an application can now be made to an independent commissioner.  If an application is denied, one can appeal to a five member appeal board and an oral hearing can be sought.  That is a tremendous improvement over what has been there in the past.  I agree that when people <Col N="1605" /> flee their own country &mdash; and a terrorist organisation as in that particular case &mdash; they do not have money or a passport and are very vulnerable.  Nevertheless, I believe we should treat them with great dignity.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the Bill provides that applicants for refugee status are entitled to the same social welfare, housing, education and health care Irish citizens enjoy.  That is a great advantage because in doing so we show we are prepared to give them the same status as citizens.  They deserve nothing less.  For these reasons, I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join all my colleagues in welcoming this Bill.  It deserves and will get support on the broadest basis from all of us.  It is appropriate, in particular, since we are the successors in title &mdash; although our refugees did not have much title &mdash; of those who experienced economic and political repression at home.  Our nation has been developed and enhanced by the experience of our refugees.  Nowadays, they might be called economic refugees and, to that extent, I have a certain worry and reservation about the distinction which is made sometimes between political and economic refugees.  It would be reasonable to say that some of our people were escaping from political repression but most of them were what would nowadays be termed economic refugees.  Had they been faced with restrictive bureaucratic limitations when the arrived on Staten Island on the east coast of the US or at some of the well known refugee stations of America or Australia, the haven which our people enjoyed, and from which they developed such an established reputation for themselves and their families, would never have been afforded to them.  In that connection, I do not think Ireland should make what is sometimes a convenient but not reasonable distinction between political and economic refugees as we are the least qualified people to make that distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had the experience, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, of welcoming on <Col N="1606" /> behalf of the Irish people one of the biggest groups of refugees which came to our country, that is the boat people in the late 1970s.  In that instance, our fellow members of the European Community with Australia, Canada and the USA made a commitment in Geneva during Ireland's Presidency in 1979 to take on the responsibility of receiving these people as refugees.  The fact that we did is now a matter of record.</P>
    <P>I want to make the distinction between the formal decision by Government to accept a group &mdash; such as the boat people or the Hungarian refugees in 1956 where formal arrangements and preparations made in advance were sometimes not as good as we would wish them to be &mdash; and the less formal issue in this Bill which deals with individuals about whom we have no advance notice.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with individuals, many of whom come totally ill-prepared. Some of them come illegally in so far as they do not have proper passports or documentation.  If they had, they would not have to rely on receiving refugee status.  When we are dealing with these individuals, it behoves us to be as generous, understanding and tolerant as possible.  That view has been reflected in the contributions here this evening and in this Bill.</P>
    <P>However, there are still anomalies. We should be generous to a fault in respect when it comes to their practical requirements, such as translation and legal services.  If they have to face the legal requirements of our State, which is understandable, they must have access to legal advice from the beginning to enable them, under the rights of the international conventions and as fellow members of the human condition, to avail of every opportunity and loophole in the law.  It is our responsibility to ensure that our law gives effect to what we want it to do.  Just as our citizens can avail of loopholes in the law which we have left through our failure as legislators, there is no reason refugees should be in a different position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1607" /> I also agree with the suggestion from the Irish Refugee Council that detention is not appropriate for asylum seekers save in extreme circumstances of public safety.  Every state has the responsibility to provide its own security but that should not mean that we will detain these people while they are being investigated.  I welcome the appeals board.  Whatever the circumstances that may have forced these people to come to our shores, it would not be reasonable to subject them to detention as soon as they arrive.</P>
    <P>My final point concerns a matter in which I will be involved in Geneva this coming weekend.  It is regrettable but true that all around the world there are repressed minorities, whether it be in the Western Sahara, Tibet or East Timor.  As often as not, wherever there is government &mdash; I would like to think it is not true in our case &mdash; there will be minorities, some of them repressed to a much greater extent in one country than in another.  There will also be unrepresented minorities who will play no role in the international community.  It will be the purpose of the conference that I will be attending this weekend to try to represent these people.  This conference will be held under the aegis of the United Nations, which has given its blessing.</P>
    <P>Repression has reached such a dimension that it has become almost a characteristic of many regimes.  Sometimes power for the few means repression for the many.  However, people are now thinking more than ever that if they are repressed at home, they can look to a haven elsewhere.  They could not have done this before now.  It is important that, for historical, judicial, conscientious and legal reasons, we should be seen to be at the forefront of this issue.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and the Government for taking this action and hopefully we will be able to make precise comments and observations on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this long overdue legislation and I commend the Minister for her work on this matter. She had interest in a Refugee Bill before she ever had responsibility for the Justice and Foreign Affairs portfolios and has worked hard to reach this point.</P>
      <P>We can only do a limited amount for many victims of persecution in various parts of the world because they often cannot leave their countries.  The kind of actions we can take may be limited to supporting UN resolutions and sanctions, highlighting issues such as the situation in East Timor and supporting human rights organisations like Amnesty International.  However, for those people who do break free from persecution and look for asylum, particularly in our country, we can and should take action.  I welcome this legislation. We will be complying with the basic principles of natural justice by giving a fair hearing to people looking for political asylum.  In bringing the legislation to this point, the many proposals and suggestions put forward by various organisations and all political parties have been listened to and taken on board.  Indeed, they strengthened the initial legislation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we are finally putting into law the principles of the 1951 Geneva Convention and the 1967 Protocol and that various aspects have been strengthened in the Bill, the guarantees in terms of gender, sexual orientation and trade union membership which were not in the original legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other speakers said, when somebody looks for political asylum in this country, many difficulties must be understood, and they are being dealt with in this legislation, for example, language difficulties, concern about the safety of their loved ones whom they have to leave behind etc.  These people may also need translation and interpretation facilities, legal assistance and clear procedures to understand what is happening.  All those considerations need to be taken into account.  Senator <Col N="1609" /> Lanigan referred to the need to understand that we are dealing with human beings facing real dilemmas.  They may not even know where they are when they come here; they may be disorientated and frightened and have language difficulties.  We should not only deal with them by way of proper legal procedures but in a humane way as well.</P>
    <P>I support to some extent the concerns expressed by Senator Mooney.  While it is important that whoever is dealing with these people &mdash; whether it be the commissioner, the people they meet when they arrive or those on the appeal board &mdash; has the relevant legal expertise and knowledge, they should also have the personal skills to deal with these people, many of whom may be frightened and or do not know their rights.  I welcome the indication that interpretation facilities will be available.  The wording in the legislation was queried by some of the organisations which made representations but the matter has been clarified and I am satisfied with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the Government's agreement that legal assistance would be provided and said independent advice is being sought on this issue.  She should keep the House informed of progress.  It is important that people seeking asylum receive appropriate legal assistance because they usually do not have access to financial support on entering the country. While their cases are being dealt with they also require a decent place to live and supplementary welfare payments. Assuming they obtain political asylum, they need access to normal rights such as housing, social welfare, etc.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers raised section 22 and the Dublin Convention.  I and other Senators are members of Amnesty International, which is particularly concerned about this section.  A representative of Amnesty International recently informed me that the organisation wishes to ensure that someone travelling to another EU country under the Dublin Convention &mdash; which will determine what state is responsible for examining <Col N="1610" /> applications &mdash; will receive a fair hearing and will not be transferred to a third country without one.  I welcome the Minister of State's assurances that the Dublin Convention provides for the establishment of a committee comprising representatives of the member states, which can examine general questions concerning the application and interpretation of the convention and that she intends to avail of this provision if difficulties arise in relation to section 22.  I welcome this because section 22 is Amnesty International's remaining major concern about the legislation.  I hope her assurances will allay the concerns expressed by Amnesty International.</P>
    <P>Another question relates to numbers. As Senator Lanigan stated, it is unlikely Ireland will have to deal with numbers of refugees similar to those dealt with by other countries.  The number seeking refugee status in 1991 was 31.  In 1995 this rose to 424 and it seems there will be a further increase in the current year. This bears no comparison to the numbers applying for refugee status in other EU countries, particularly Germany where applications have reached millons. Nevertheless, Ireland has experienced an increase in the number of applications and there is likely to be an even greater increase when legislation is enacted to deal with refugees.  People will feel they will receive a fair hearing and are more likely to apply.  Are we prepared for an increase in the number of applications?  Has there been assessment of what is likely to occur in the event of increased numbers?  Are there structures in terms of legal aid?</P>
    <P>It is quite likely that there will be an increase in numbers.  This is a tribute to us for enacting good, comprehensive, humanitarian legislation to deal with refugees.  We must monitor the situation on an ongoing basis and listen to refugees already resident in this State, and to those who will come here, to ensure that we deal with their problems in a humanitarian way.  We must deal with them as human beings.  Many flee from appalling persecution and are denied <Col N="1611" /> basic human rights which we take for granted such as access to free speech and to hold political views or are censured on the basis of their membership of minority groups, gender, etc.</P>
    <P>There are many political differences here, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland, but nobody is denied the right to express a view.  Unless we travel to countries which deny human rights, it is difficult to comprehend the fear, trauma and terror that people experience in seeking to exercise their rights. If they manage to escape, the least we can do is to ensure that they receive a fair hearing and all possible comfort, consideration and a decent lifestyle if it is proved they are genuine political refugees. I welcome the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State correctly stated that the number of applications which will be dealt with under this Bill are quite small.  Apart from the number of applicants who are granted asylum, a considerable amount can be achieved in the overall context of refugees if Ireland, a small independent democracy, exercises its influence at every public forum on the international stage to try to improve the conditions under which refugees live.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and her husband lived and worked among the people of Africa.  I had the pleasure of meeting them on a visit to Tanzania some years ago.  It would be wrong of me to lecture her on the plight of refugees since she has expertise and experience in that area.  I pay tribute to her and her husband for the work they did in Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past Ireland was not as generous as it might have been toward refugees. To put it mildly, our record is very disappointing.  No particular Government or civil servant is to blame. Government policy throughout the history of the State was to exclude rather than include due to the climate of public opinion.  We now realise the importance of being more generous.  On a percentage basis, no other country exported <Col N="1612" /> more refugees than Ireland.  Millions of people left Ireland and took refuge in other countries.  We have a duty to ensure that we are generous in granting refugee status to those seeking it.  We were over-zealous in imposing rules and regulations in the past and people were prevented from entering the State.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the number of people seeking refuge in Ireland, 31 applications were made in 1991, 355 in 1994 and 424 in 1995.  This shows the numbers applying and the existing procedures were not designed to handle these increasing numbers of applicants. I have not had much reason to visit the Aliens Office in the Department but it needs better accommodation and more staff, notwithstanding the embargo.  I would find it difficult to carry out my work under the conditions these officials must tolerate.</P>
    <P>Refugees are people who have been intimidated and threatened.  Since they are particularly vulnerable, it is essential that the procedures we introduce are based on a distinct policy decision by the Government that we play our part. I have seen at first hand the way refugees are treated; if animals were treated that way, animal rights campaigners would complain.  While we may talk about the way people were treated in the past, the way refugees are treated today is to the shame of the human race. Our voice may be small but we should continually raise it as long as people live in those conditions.</P>
    <P>Legislation is in hand to allow people who can trace their forefathers to apply for citizenship.  I raised one such case previously in the House but I will not go into detail because it does not relate to this Bill.  We are strict in enforcing these regulations.  This case concerns a South African, some of whose family are here while others have been excluded.  If the family left some generations ago we should be careful.  We have gone all over the world to look for soccer players, and now rugby players; possibly we will look for hurlers and <Col N="1613" /> Gaelic footballers in years to come. However, people with no sporting talent are prevented from coming in and no one is seeking them out.  We should be helpful to those who love Ireland and want to live here.  I brought this case to the attention of Ministers in the Department of Foreign Affairs and may raise it again at some future date.</P>

In response to Senator Enright, I am also Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and if those whom he wants to bring into Ireland particularly wish to go to Shinrone, I undertake to treat his application and representations with particular care.</P>

      <P>Having had the pleasure not only of being visited by Senator Enright in Africa but also of visiting the Senator's family in Shinrone, I will reciprocate and undertake to look at this matter if he brings it to my attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the basic point made by Senators from all parties that the passage of the Refugee Bill and its broad acceptance by NGOs and Members of both Houses is a mark of the maturity of our democracy and the development of the concept of human rights and openness in this society.  As Members have said, this is particularly appropriate at the beginning of the cycle of commemorating the Famine.  While most of those who left Ireland then were what we would now call economic migrants, there was nonetheless a political motivation <Col N="1614" /> for many exiles and it behoves us to recall how we were received in other countries.</P>
    <P>In relation to broader developments in the EU and Ireland, while as a Minister of State at the Department of Justice I must be cautious about the problems caused by large scale, unstructured movements of people, the concept of building a &ldquo;fortress Europe&rdquo; is not necessarily in the best interests of the EU in the long term.  I think we should take a broader and more generous view, not least in our own interest in the context of European demographics.  If Europe is a greying and aging society it may be that some countries should do as the US did in the past and allow in younger people with talents and particular skills &mdash; and families &mdash; to contribute to ageing democracies.  I welcome the broader view of the movements of people put forward by many Senators in this debate.</P>
    <P>I accept that in the past our reputation in relation to the reception of asylum seekers was less than wonderful. However, I hope the style and culture of that reception has changed permanently and that this change happened some time ago.  Various Senators referred to the reception of people in Ireland as far back as the Second World War &mdash; I hope we have changed for the better. When I visited Shannon recently I was particularly struck by the open, frank and friendly relationship between the gardaí who act as immigration officers, the NGOs and many people who came as refugees, subsequently settled and clearly intend to stay in the area.  That is as it should be.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the language difficulties.  For the last nine months we have printed application forms in a number of languages &mdash; Arabic, French, Romanian, Russian, Spanish and Turkish as well as English.  That is a step forward and we will add other languages in due course.  The specific problem raised by Senator Mooney was of the 500 Vietnamese people who came here as programme refugees.  I am pleased to say that more than 300 of the <Col N="1615" /> Vietnamese community are now naturalised Irish citizens, so they are committed to staying here.  I have met with members of the community and visited their centre in Hardwicke Street, Dublin, on a number of occasions.  I accept that one of the greatest difficulties for some members of that community is language.</P>
    <P>Classes are made available in the Vietnamese community centre and a great deal of effort is being made, particularly by the City of Dublin vocational education committee with the co-operation of the Refugee Agency and the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice, to make the essentials available to refugees which will allow them to make full and satisfying lives for themselves and their families in Ireland once their status has been clarified. Another problem for the programme refugees is the resettlement in Ireland of other family members who are still abroad.</P>
    <P>There is a community of about 500 Bosnian programme refugees in Ireland. Two weeks ago I was privileged to open a community centre on Pearse Street for the Bosnian community.  It will act as a centre to make facilities available, such as information, community and social contacts and language learning.  It will be helpful to that community.</P>
    <P>I am aware that people are often anxious about family members.  The Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice are anxious to facilitate family members who wish to join those who have been given refugee status in Ireland.  That is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to the NUJ and difficulties it has with section 19 of the Bill.  Section 19 does not prevent a refugee speaking with a journalist.  It deals with the public identification of a refugee.  It may be important for the safety of a refugee, their family or the political movement or cause with which they are associated that their anonymity is preserved.  The section does not prevent refugees telling their story or commenting on political conditions in <Col N="1616" /> the country they fled.  However, it provides that their identity should be protected &mdash; their story could be fully disclosed with the use of an alias &mdash; by permission in relation to disclosure of identity being given by the refugee and by the Minister.  Under section 19 the Minister cannot withhold consent in an unfair way as such a decision would be subject to the possibility of a judicial appeal.  That is provided for specifically in the Bill.  I invited the NUJ to speak with me on the matter if it wished.  That invitation remains open as I have not heard from the NUJ to date.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Convention should provide a mechanism for refugees who have no definitive country in the EU where they can make an application.  The Convention commits all EU member states to reaffirm their commitment to the 1951 Geneva Convention.  It provides that refugees can make a positive application in the country in which they first arrived.  However, if someone arrives in Ireland having passed through another European country, they could be told that they must process their application in that country.  However, there is not a requirement on us to do so.</P>
    <P>I have undertaken to seek that the EU should provide that matters dealt with under the Dublin Convention should be dealt with openly so that we can be reassured that cases are dealt with properly and, in particular, that nobody in such a situation might be deported via a second country to a third country where they might be persecuted.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifically broadens the definition of persecution to include persecution on grounds of gender, sexual orientation or membership of a trade union.  Those provisions go further than the 1951 Geneva Convention.  Ireland has given a lead in this regard which I hope other countries may follow in due course.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy was worried that a refugee would have to prove their persecution came from the state.  That is not so.  Religious intolerance is rife in some countries.  In one country in Mediterranean <Col N="1617" /> north Africa persecution does not necessarily come from the state but from religious zealots.  Persecution does not have to come from a state source.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy and Senator Roche raised the concern that a UNHCR recommendation could be overruled by the Department of Justice.  Since becoming Minister of State at the Department of Justice I have read many files in relation to asylum seekers.  Having checked with officials, I am not aware of any instance in which a UNHCR recommendation that somebody be treated as a refugee was overturned at official or ministerial level.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the issue of legal aid.  We have drawn up a scheme of legal aid having consulted with the Refugee Council and the Irish Red Cross.  The proposed scheme went for examination by the Attorney General's office; the Chief State Solicitor had comments on the proposed scheme and the Attorney General then decided he would have an independent senior counsel examine the proposed scheme to ensure it meets certain legal requirements in relation to the legal profession. That examination is being carried out. The Government is committed to having a scheme of legal aid and I would like that scheme to be as efficient as possible.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the commissioner and the appeal tribunal is not to have an adversarial system as in a court.  The objective at each stage is to get the refugee's story.  Having heard that story and, as far as possible validated it, a decision may then be made as to whether that person comes within the provisions of the Geneva Convention or the definition in the Bill.  I hope the appeal tribunal will not become a court because the adversarial system is not particularly appropriate to it.  It will be seeking to elicit the story and, based on the facts, trying to judge whether the person comes within the terms of the convention.</P>
    <P>There has been a rise in litigation and court actions in Ireland in recent years. I do not feel that refugee hearings <Col N="1618" /> should be conducted as court hearings. Under the Bill, the commissioner and the chairperson of the appeal tribunal should be legally qualified persons of seven years and ten years experience, respectively, because many refugee applications are the subject, ultimately, of court proceedings.  Nevertheless, it should not be an adversarial court proceeding.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem with regard to refugee applications is the delay period. I hope that when the structures set out in the Bill are established, the commissioner will be able to give fairly rapid indications of the success or otherwise of the applications once the facts are known.  In the case of negative decisions, there is the appeal procedure with the right of an oral hearing.  It is important this processing should take place as quickly as possible because I recognise that, for applicants and their families, the waiting period can be one of great tension and uncertainty.  I urge Senators to appeal to the Minister for Finance and the Department of Justice to ensure that in years to come an adequacy of resources is available for these structures.</P>
    <P>Senators referred to the relatively low numbers of refugees received in Ireland. Up to last night, we had received 222 refugees this year.  It is interesting to note that, of this figure, 100 are from Romania and none of them made an application directly at a port of entry. They called subsequently to the Department of Justice.  Nowadays, many of our applicants do not declare themselves as asylum seekers at our ports or airports. They arrive in the country and subsequently make an application to the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>Senators referred to a number of specific points which arose on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  These points will probably arise again on Committee Stage here.  I thank Senators for their contributions and for their welcome for the Bill.</P>
    <P>Looking after refugees and providing facilities on a par with the entitlements of Irish citizens costs money.  We have <Col N="1619" /> established a structure in Ireland and have recently commissioned a report in the Department of Justice.  The nub of the report is to suggest that the welfare of refugees should be primarily directed towards one official &mdash; similar to the one shop stop concept &mdash; who would be a community welfare officer.  Senator O'Sullivan and other Senators from the mid-west would agree that the community welfare officers of the MidWestern Health Board in the Shannon area have been extremely helpful and efficient in providing a service.  As suggested in the report of the working group, community welfare officers in other areas should be the first point of call for the range of services to which refugees are entitled.  In addition, through the Refugee Agency for Programme Refugees, we have the specialised services of the refugee agency.</P>
    <P>We are moving to address what is our fundamental responsibility as an independent State.  It is going to cost us but it is a cost we should be prepared to <Col N="1620" /> meet.  I thank the many Senators for the generosity of their response on behalf of the many refugees they met over the years.  If in the past our record was not wonderful, I hope the Bill will provide the basis from which, in the future, we can acquire a record which not only reflects our traditions as a people but is in keeping with our own specific historical experience and our need to be generous to those who may now be experiencing what our people once experienced.</P>
