      <P>I have notice from Senator Sherlock that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to rectify the anomaly under EU regulations which precludes farmers growing peas for green harvesting from area aid, resulting in the loss of 50 jobs at Universal Dehydrates Limited, Middleton, County Cork.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to create a mounted police unit for Dublin as a publicly acceptable and cost effective way of upgrading the Garda presence in Dublin city centre and at major events.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide a new classroom, toilet block and ancillary classroom accommodation at Kilmurry national school, Ennis, County Clare, and if she is aware of need to have the finance for this project included in the capital building programme.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to investigate the increase in brucellosis in Crusheen, County Clare and if he will advise on the steps he will take to deal with this serious situation.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Farrelly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education if funding will be made available this year to ensure that the extension to St. Oliver Plunkett's School, Oldcastle, County Meath, can go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> I have also received notice from Senator Reynolds of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide funding in 1996 or 1997 for the first phase development of a residential hospice service for the North West Hospice.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Kelly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to outline the reason so few agricultural projects are being funded under the Leader II programme.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Sherlock's and Senator Quinn's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice of the matters they wish to raise on another day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with today's Order of Business I wish to give Senators information arising from yesterday's Order of Business.  Senator Dardis asked about the food security board legislation.  There will be widespread consultation before it is published and that will involve a debate in this House so Members' views can be taken into account.  I will announce the date for that debate shortly. Senator O'Sullivan asked about the Children (Juvenile Justice) Bill and it will be published in about three weeks.  Senator McGowan asked about the Education (Boards of Management) Bill and it will be published in early December.</P>
      <P>Today's business is item 1, which will be taken until 1 p.m., and item 2 which will be taken from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. with a time limit of 20 minutes per speaker.  There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to the Order of Business. What progress is being made on the report on fisheries safety launched by the Minister for the Marine?  There is great concern in the fishing industry that the report is gathering dust rather than being put into effect.  The report was welcomed by all those interested in the fishing industry.  It is time for action.  Will the Leader inquire as to the Minister's intentions on the implementation of the report?</P>
      <P>With regard to yesterday's release of republican prisoners, it is our view that this is another cockup by the Department of Justice which undermines public confidence in the judicial system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the food security board legislation is welcome.  It will meet our need to discuss the connection between agriculture and food issues.  Will the Leader give a commitment to have a debate on European Monetary Union, its impact on currency, the <Col N="355" /> impact of Britain being in or out of the system, whether we can meet the convergence criteria and the problems in reducing inflation in other European countries?  Members need to be aware of the issues involved to respond to the questions put to them.  There does not have to be a motion directing the Government to take a course of action but we should have a consultative discussion so we may inform ourselves of the issues involved and consider the consequences. There are shared views in the House which should be articulated and receive a response.</P>

      <P>I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom iarracht a dhéanamh beagán Gaeilge a labhairt. Tá a fhios agat nach raibh dóthain ama againn oíche aréir mar gheall ar dhíospóireacht ar Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Ba mhaith liom thar ceann an Pháirtí Daonlathaigh inniu céad míle fáilte a chur roimh Theilifís na Gaeilge agus comhghairdeas a chur in iúl don fhoireann a chuir an stáisiún i gcrích.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important point.  I realise the House ordered its business that way but a number of people were unable to make a contribution because there was not enough time. I thank the Leader for his reply on the food security board.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Wright in raising the issue of 15 people being released from jail and then rearrested because of an administrative shambles. It sends an appalling signal to the general public on the administration of the justice system and it might be appropriate to discuss that matter in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I asked the Leader for a debate on social welfare, particularly in regard to adult dependency.  I welcome the spending of £2 million by the Minister for Social Welfare on an aid package for security for the elderly.</P>
      <P>St. Patrick is welcome any time because there is more than one snake in the grass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Donegal County Council will meet tomorrow to examine the estimates for the coming year.  This body is largely representative of local authorities in Ireland and it is imperative that this House establishes whether there will be water charges nationally.  It will cost my local authority £1 million if water charges are abolished.  This House is entitled to look for clarity on the matter because there are internal <Col N="356" /> rumblings and rumours on this issue.  Will the Leader consult the appropriate authorities and advise Members on this important aspect of local authority funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken many times about the ridiculous system of so-called ministerial responsibility and it arises this morning. Everybody knows that if Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn were in charge of the prison system, the same incident would have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ridiculous to say otherwise. There have been many discussions in this House on crime, drugs, etc., but never one specifically on the Department of Justice.  There ought to be because that Department has not covered itself in glory down through the years.  Will the Leader consider a debate on the responsibilities of these highly paid officials who frankly at times mismanage the system in the most appalling way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>When Michelle Smith won gold there was euphoria in the House and it was decided that a debate should take place on sports funding and various other aspects of sport.  When will we have a debate on that?</P>
      <P>On the matter raised by Senator Magner, will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice when prisons will be open on a regular basis to Members of the Oireachtas?</P>

      <P>Over the next couple of weeks an opera will take place in Mountjoy Prison. Members of the public have been invited and 60 prisoners will take part.  It is imperative that if people are put into the prison system they are not just taken out of society and forgotten about which is what happens at present.  Some of those imprisoned are there because they consistently commit crimes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>When will there be a debate on the prison system?  These prisoners are human beings with families.  Many of them need to be incarcerated but there are many others who need to be rehabilitated and educated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ascertain from the Minister for the Environment the current position with regard to applications for cohesion funding?  A huge number of water and sewerage projects are awaiting sanction by the European <Col N="357" /> Union.  There is no indication from the European Commission on what the reasons are for the delays in sanctioning them.  The Minister indicated earlier this year that he hoped to have decisions on these within a matter of weeks.  It is over a year since the applications were made and I want clarification from the Minister on the current situation.</P>
      <P>I again raise the proposals to close the railway line from Ennis to the West and the serious concern of those employed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other ways in which the Senator can raise that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a serious matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing the seriousness of it but the Senator can find another way of raising it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There needs to be some indication from the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications on this matter.  Perhaps he can do this through his public relations advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, to come into the House and debate the lack of funding for the Leader II scheme?  It has been brought to my attention in Kerry that funding of as low as 10 per cent has been offered to applicants.  The scheme is under-funded and does not come near the funding of the Leader I programme.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Daly in his call for a debate on the railway system.  The most rural parts of the country are excluded from cohesion funding for railways.  I refer particularly to the line between Tralee and Killarney along which there have been severe accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am aware of the concern raised by the Leader of the Opposition about safety at sea.  I am also assured by the Department that a great deal of progress has been made but I would be very happy to have the Minister in the House as soon as possible to discuss the issue.  I know it is of great concern to many Senators.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the release of prisoners, there will be statements and the usual question and answer session in the other House later today on that matter.  If there are further points to be raised next week, we could have some time on that.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator O'Toole's question, the debate on European Monetary Union is fixed for 4 December and I will try to give as much time as is needed to it.</P>
      <P>I will certainly make more time available to Senator Dardis for any short contribution he wishes to make in Irish on Teilifís na Gaeilge. Last night's debate was very useful.  We should have further such debates and I am very open to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> Senator Finneran's contribution had too much tailspin for this hour in the morning and I do not intend to comment on it.</P>
    <P>I must apologise to Senator Kelly for not replying to her query last week.  It was an oversight.  I would be happy to try to arrange a discussion on those issues between now and the end of session.</P>
    <P>I do not have the information which Senator McGowan seeks but there will be a debate on the funding of local authorities between now and the end of this session.  The Minister who is responsible will be here to take that debate and there will be no restrictions on it.  I think he is as anxious to have that debate and hear the Senator's views as Senator McGowan is to have the debate.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Magner's point and I would not be averse to the type of debate he suggested.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan sought a debate on sport.  I have discussed that with the Minister of State and he is very keen to have that debate.  It is a question of finding time between now and the end of this session but it will take place.</P>
    <P>I will try to get information on cohesion funding for Senator Daly.  With regard to the railway line, my understanding is there is no question of it being closed; it is simply under review.  We will be having a debate on Luas this afternoon and perhaps we can move on from there to look at the problems of rural railway networks.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present for a debate on Leader II, to which Senator Dan Kiely referred, but perhaps the Kerrymen could get together and sort it out.  If not, I will try to find time for him.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the spirit in which it is put forward, it flows as a consequence of our discussion last week.  Amendment No. 31 in the name of Senator Lee involved the distinction between qualification and interest.  I am in favour of retaining the broad definition so that those with an obvious interest but without necessarily a qualification could be selected. To delete &ldquo;or interest&rdquo; would make it too narrow so I am inclined to hold to the general principle.  However, that amendment was not moved.</P>
      <P>I see merit in amendments Nos. 32 and 33 in the name of Senator Mooney.  He suggests in amendment No. 32 that the definition of deciding board membership be extended to include the word &ldquo;genealogy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 33 suggests the inclusion of the words &ldquo;sales and marketing,&rdquo;.  Both amendments have merit and I accept them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (2), line 26, to delete &ldquo;consecutive&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the meaning of &ldquo;consecutive&rdquo;.  Does the Minister intend that one can only be nominated for a consecutive term and, if one has served two consecutive terms, one cannot be nominated subsequently?  For example, one cannot leave the board and be nominated five years down the line or whenever.  What is the purpose behind the word &ldquo;consecutive&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>I ask this purely for clarification.  I am not saying it is either good or bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is in the Bill, a person who had, for example, served two terms and then had a period of time when they were not on the board would be eligible subsequently for reappointment.  If one accepted the amendment, a person having served two terms would be ineligible for the rest of their life.  The Bill proposes that once there is a gap, a person could be considered for reappointment and I am disposed towards that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to dispute that; it is just the phraseology was not entirely clear. Concerns were raised on Second Stage about the issue of remuneration.  I do not know why people who serve on boards of this type should expect remuneration because they are involved in a public service activity.  If they have the qualities, attainments, interests and knowledge which will be required for appointment, their suitability will come from a commitment to scholarship and a love of heritage.  I hope there will be a motivating principle for people engaged in activity of this sort.  Perhaps I am naive but I do not see why such people should expect remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Senator Lee on this issue.  I accept the idealism of his suggestion but it puts into tension other principles of democracy.  For example, in a certain historical period it might affect those who, in their benevolence and impulse to philanthropy, might want to serve.  However, there are others who may be involved in a self-employed practice or business who are interested and motivated, in the same way as those in the first category, by an impulse to public service and interest.  I am inclined to the opinion that their commitment to public service is not lessened by the very modest <Col N="361" /> remuneration which pertains to membership of the board.</P>
      <P>To make the board different in its treatment to other State boards would be anomalous and would make a statement in its own way.  I will later deal with the question of the users of the institutions; I believe people should be facilitated. The impulse to public service is one thing, but to ask people to be at a disadvantage, regarding their capacity to serve, by receiving a modest remuneration does not hold.  I am sympathetic to the argument that the best and most wonderful people will not want to accept money.  Under the Bill, members of the board will be free to return remuneration or not draw it.  If the Bill were changed to state that those who enjoy a surplus of time, personal resources or remuneration were the only people who could serve, there would be limited representation.  I ask the Senator to consider the balance and the fact that I am obliged to come down on one side or the other.  I am in favour of treating the boards of these institutions in a similar way to other State boards.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister's point and will not push the amendment to a vote. However, I wish to place on record my concern about the principle involved.  In practice, I presume there is no way people of high professional calibre can be remunerated by the amount they will receive; these individuals are probably highly paid in their own fields.  If they are not, one would be obliged to ask why they had not reached the level of eminence which would entitle them to be considered for service in these areas.  It is not a question of remunerating them precisely for the monetary amount they will lose as a result of service.  The remuneration provision is symbolic.  It seems that such symbolism should involve service without remuneration rather than service with very limited remuneration, compared with people's alternative remuneration.</P>
      <P>I am uneasy that there could be appointments to the boards of people whose interest is more evident to the Minister or themselves than to the wider public.  If a remuneration element is involved, it will not help the public perception of the motivation behind the nomination of certain people to these boards.  I will not press the amendment but there is potential for behaviour which is not in the interest of the boards or the type of values they are intended to serve.</P>

      <P>We are discussing a nominal sum of money which is more in the realm of the gesture.  The amount involved is approximately £2,000, which does not dislodge any major ethical principles.  I appreciate that the Senator is developing his point of view.  However, he will agree that one must come down on one side <Col N="362" /> and I have done so for the reasons to which I referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">

      <P>I am glad the Minister stated the amount involved because I was about to inquire about the norm across semi-State boards.  In such instances, I am of the opinion that it is in the nature of an honorarium rather than a remuneration.  I take on board Senator Lee's argument that there could be a danger but, as it relates to both institutions, the Minister will ensure that those appointed are of the highest calibre and integrity.  I am optimistic that those honoured with an appointment will be competent to implement the sweeping functions being granted to the boards.  There is an old saying &ldquo;If you want something done, ask a busy person.&rdquo;.  I hope that the people appointed will come from various sectors of society and will be able to bring their particular expertise to the boards.  I would like to believe that those appointed will see it as a public duty to offer a contribution rather than for any monetary gain.  It is important that Senator Lee raised this issue because of the concerns involved.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (5), line 36, after &ldquo;ill health&rdquo; to insert&rdquo;, appropriately certified,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 repeat earlier arguments.  With regard to amendments Nos. 36 and 37, I am concerned that subsection (5) grants the Minister enormous powers.  I would like to see some controls being imposed on those powers.  When Bills of this type come before the House, they are introduced by reforming Ministers and we usually welcome their general thrust because they are moving in the right direction.  However, we tend to forget that the Ministers responsible for introducing such Bills will not be in office forever.  Therefore, one must take cognisance of subsequent events.  The Minister is aware of the unease I expressed at the extent of ministerial power, however controlled and modified, in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 20(5) states that a member may be removed from the board &ldquo;if, in the Minister's opinion the member has become incapable <Col N="363" /> through ill-health of performing his or her functions&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 36 suggests that the phrase &ldquo;appropriately certified&rdquo; be included which would involve the issuing of a doctor's certificate.  However, the term &ldquo;in the Minister's opinion&rdquo; strikes me as too sweeping a provision. The subsection also states that a member may be removed for &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo; which is fine. However, it further states &ldquo;or his or her removal appears to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance by the Board of its functions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A responsible Minister will not abuse that power but it again seems to be a very sweeping provision.  I do not know why it is necessary to include it in such an absolute form in the Bill as drafted.  I am uneasy about the extent of ministerial authority incorporated in that particular phrase.  If the purpose is to let the board get on with its business, this sword of Damocles hovering in the background seems contrary to the spirit which the Minister has repeatedly assured us underlies his approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the spirit behind the Senator's amendment.  We are agreed on the high calibre, motivation and ethics of the people most suited to serve on the board.  If a Minister appoints a member who becomes ill and requires two or three months treatment in hospital, the Minister is acting too intrusively if he or she inquires into the member's medical treatment.</P>
      <P>I also have a reservation about certification in this instance.  The certified ill health would probably be on narrow grounds and could lead to a contest as to which form of certification was most suitable.  The Bill allows a more general approach which respects the privacy of the member and the delicacy of the issue.  I do not like the idea of certification, even if it is sourced in the Minister's action.</P>
      <P>There is no argument about removal on the grounds of stated misbehaviour.  However, the next grounds allows removal if it &ldquo;appears to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance by the Board of its function&rdquo;.  What happens if an appointed person never turns up? The Bill gives the Minister power to take account of that and seek to replace such a person.  I have to strike a balance between the capacity of the Minister to ensure that board members are able to work in the interests of the institutions, irrespective of whether they agree with the Minister, and falling into the trap of arbitrariness in that it could be a discretion open to abuse.  If the Senator wishes I will look again at that balance before Report Stage and see, for example, if the word &ldquo;functions&rdquo; can be expanded to mean &ldquo;in advancement of the principles of the institution&rdquo;.  This would make it clear that the functions are not simply constructed by the Minister for reasons other than the spirit of the Bill.  That may go some way to meet the Senator's concern.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's forthright way of dealing with this and I would be grateful if he would look at it again.  I take the Minister's point on the matter of ill health but if board members are of the calibre we assume they will be, presumably they would not want to stay on the board if they could not discharge their responsibilities.  If not, we may have to flex out our concept of ethical responsibility.</P>
      <P>As regards the phrase &ldquo;in the Minister's opinion&rdquo;; it may be delicate to look for certificates but what if the person challenges the Minister?  In such a case it would be an arbitrary exercise.  This needs to be looked at again.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a scenario in which a board member does not turn up.  Would it be possible to oblige members to attend a minimum number of meetings?  This was, I am not sure if it still is, stipulated in the Universities Bill.  It ought to be possible to include such a reasonable clause rather than leaving this broad statement.  Supposing a Minister of a different party, with a different ideological persuasion, has a friend who is desperate to be appointed to a board.  The potential for abuse of these powers should be curtailed, even though this may be an extreme example.</P>

      <P>The Senator is losing sight of an essential matter, namely, the constitutional responsibility of the Minister to the Cabinet, the people and, particularly, to the taxpayer.  It is essential that these terms are specifically included in the Bill.  If one pursues Senator Lee's line, one is left with a Minister who is a figurehead with no final responsibility.  That goes against the spirit of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>A Minister may be appointed who has a different political persuasion to a board member and the Senator knows what could happen then.  Suppose a board member decides to be so obstreperous and difficult as to stall, for political reasons, the proper operations of the board, what happens then?  Will the Bill leave the Minister powerless to prevent such stagnation?  It is essential that the present wording remains in order to allow the Minister exercise his responsibilities.</P>

      <P>This amendment draws attention to the requirements for the functioning of the boards and questions whether the specified quorum is adequate.  There can be 16 members of the board of the museum and 12 members of the board of the library.

      <P>In relation to the establishment of a quorum, what one is always worried about in any decision making structure is that a small and unrepresentative group might organise a cabal which could dislodge the general purpose.  I suggested a figure of four and the amendment seeks to replace it with six; there is no way of answering this point.  Having straightened out the legal basis and established good institutional structures, I wanted there to be as much autonomy as possible in the board itself, therefore I did not want to tie its hands.  I think Senators support me in that aim.  I am not hung up on the figure, that is the way I have approached the legislation.  If the Senator feels four is too low, between now and Report Stage I could consider a figure of five, which is between his figure and mine.  There is no magic answer.  If I accept the amendment and raise the figure to six, my only worry is whether that makes it difficult for the board to be flexible.  I am open on the matter.</P>

      <P>To be consistent with what I said about allowing maximum autonomy the legislation suggests minimum figures but the board, in its view of best practice, could decide at an early meeting that the quorum will be higher and under the Bill it is free to do so.  I felt I should put in as the minimum the realistic figure below which one would be concerned about how representative the decision making may be.  It is a minimum figure with discretion left to the board in its operation&mdash;in terms of its experience and its view of best practice &mdash; to increase if it wishes.</P>

This provision relates to a board being appointed to fulfil certain functions which comes out of a different ethos.</P>
      <P>The question to be decided on this amendment is not the appropriate figure but the minimum figure.  Senator Lee's amendment suggests six, which I think is high for a minimum.

      <P>In page 19, subsection (1), line 6, after &ldquo;Board&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;shall establish a users committee, and may establish other committees&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a substantive proposal, not simply a procedural one and I was glad to hear the Minister say on the last day that he saw some merit in the idea.  It arises from the experience of those of us who have served on committees of this sort in our own institutions or elsewhere.  The consumers of the service are able to identify weaknesses more quickly that those who deliver it and boards are a step further removed.  A users' committee would be an important addition to ensure the most effective functioning of these institutions.  Organisations which do not have places on the board &mdash; such as the Library Association of Ireland, an Chomhairle Leabharlanna and the Association of National and University Librarians &mdash; should be included on this committee, as should users who do work in the library and museum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good case for this committee.  It would also allow the Minister and the board to take cognisance of the legitimate interest of other organisations which may not have representation on the board but have a lively interest in the activity which the institutions represent.  I do not pretend the amendment is the best way to do it, I am sure the Minister and his officials can devise a more effective method and I would gladly withdraw my amendment in favour of theirs if <Col N="367" /> they came up with a phraseology which they preferred.  However, the principle is important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take on board the positive spirit in the House towards the Bill.  Senator Lee's amendments Nos. 42, 44 and 47 deal with the issue of users' committees.  The Bill as currently worded did not preclude the establishment of such committees but the effect of the Senator's amendments is to oblige the institutions to have them.  I see merit in this and accept the spirit of the amendments.  Between now and Report Stage I would like to reword them because the amendments pose a difficulty in terms of application &mdash; for example, there may be a difference between the requirements of the library and the museum; and, having established the users' committees, it may be difficulty to word the Bill in such a way that it will achieve the spirit of what is in the amendment.  I will examine appropriate wording between now and Report Stage and address the issue.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept amendment No. 46 because it seems to diminish the authority of the board.  If one is setting up an advisory committee, it is important that the functions and purpose of the legislation for which the board is responsible be connected to the specialist needs coming through that committee.  It would erode the authority of the board if the chairperson of such an advisory committee was not appointed by the board.  I will examine amendments Nos. 42, 44 and 47 for rewording but, reluctantly, I cannot accept amendment No. 46 for the reasons I have stated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice, under section 23 (3) those who form part of the group could decide who will chair it; section 23 (4) gives the board the right to appoint a chairperson.  The effect of the amendment is that it takes the initiative from the board whereas the text of the Bill allows it flexibility.  The board may decide there is an area in which it needs an advisory committee.  Its attention may have been drawn to it by a member of the board and it is free to appoint that person as chairman of the board.  It may well happen that there may be an advisory committee under section 22 (3) and it will equally have the freedom to decide on that.  This simply retains the flexibility of both sources.</P>

      <P>There is a serious import to this. I defer to the main thrust of Senator Lee's argument.  Let us be honest about this irrespective of the practicalities involved.  Take the example of a Department which is currently being attacked in the media because it has not been traditionally consumer oriented.  The charge is that it has been more oriented towards the State or lobby groups for vested interests, although I am not saying that is accurate.  How better to dismiss that type of argument than to give consumers, those using the services, recognition and acknowledgment in a formal structure?  I understand that many of these committees operate on a purely voluntary basis in that they do not constitute a charge upon the State.  They tend to comprise people who are already involved in consumer protection.</P>
      <P>The Minister has accepted the spirit of what Senator Lee said.  It is a debate for another day. The arguments on both sides should stimulate further debate in this House on the question of users' councils and the rights and protection of consumers in a fast moving world.  Many people do not feel empowered but feel they are outside the system.  That is the perception and we should make strident efforts to ensure they are brought back into the system.</P>

      <P>They will have no hesitation in bringing aspects of the operation of institutions to the attention of their boards and they will be beneficiaries.  It is a way of trying to ensure that bureaucracy at the producers' side does not lose sight of consumers' needs.  It arose out of practical experience serving on the library committee of my own college where we recently set up a users' committee following student pressure.  Both male and female students, who are users in a different way from staff, brought several matters to our notice which, by common consent, led to improvements in the service the library provides.  I have no doubt that exactly the same principle applies across all institutions where on the producer side we become so consumed with our own interests and concerns we have difficulty seeing it from the point of view of the users.  It is a serious matter and I am grateful to the Minister for accepting the principle.</P>

      <P>When selecting somebody to serve on the main board the Minister should take account of concerns about including consumers <Col N="371" /> or users of both the library and the museum. Users of the National Library and the National Museum, unlike users of the library in UCC, are many and come from varied strands of society.  A users' committee that would be representative of the users of the library and the museum would be so numerous as to be guilty of the charges made by Senator Taylor-Quinn.  A balance must be struck between the rights of the consumer or user being reflected on the committees of the boards and the effective working of the boards.  The Minister has a difficult task in that regard.</P>

      <P>My view is slightly different from the points made by Senators.  I prefer to approach achieving balance in the wording from a theory of citizenship rather than consumers.  I do not like the description &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; for many reasons.  If one establishes the notion that the State provides and people are consumers of State services, then, effectively, consumers are dealing with complaints.  It is better to use the concept of citizenship.</P>
      <P>The two institutions are doing something important not just for this generation but for future generations.  That is why we approach the Bill with such care.  If one uses the theory of citizenship it means members of the boards of the library or the museum are citizens.  Sometimes in the history of, for example, museum philosphy people have put an emphasis on security while, at other times, the emphasis is on display.  In other countries people might put an emphasis on the quality of what is available to the public.  However, the important point is that this interaction between citizens and the legislation, administration and procedures that are in place is good in principle.  That is what we must try to achieve.  We do not want people to come together simply because they want to organise this year's complaint.  It is better to approach it from the point of view of citizenship, partnership and interaction.</P>
      <P>I will be as frank as Senators with regard to the general principle.  It would be unacceptable if a single and narrow professional view were used to define the ethos in a way that did not meet the needs of those who are interested in citizenry. There should be a check on that; it is a matter of checks and balances.  I will look for a form of words before Report Stage that will meet the spirit of the amendments but will not contribute to bureaucracy.  The purpose is to check bureaucratic abuse rather than add to it.</P>

      <P>These amendments are consequential on the business we transacted last week.  The proposal for a standing committee with the possibility of board functions on genealogy and heraldry is positive and has workable potential.  I am prepared to accept the idea in principle and bring forward a proposal on Report Stage.  I must decide whether the inclusion is appropriate to section 23 or section 13.  I hope this will meet the Senator's concern about strong recognition for the status of these functions.</P>
      <P>The proposal that advisory committees should have a majority of board members is also appropriate for the standing committee on genealogy and heraldry which would carry out board functions.  Senators will appreciate, however, that it will not be necessary for other committees because they are advisory and differ in nature.  I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment.  I accept the principle and will look at it in terms of its implementation and the appropriate section of the Bill in which it should be included.</P>

      <P>I am surprised.  The amendments were an attempt to cement the arrangements for finance from the Exchequer for the boards.  Can the Minister explain section 26 in the context of grants?  My wish is that the boards will have sufficient funding within the budgetary constraints inevitably imposed on a Department. I also hope that grants conveyed to the board&mdash; the Minister might clarify what these grants would constitute&mdash;would not subsequently be balanced against the annual vote to the boards of the National Library and the National Museum. If the annual subvention to either board is X amount and if a grant is made during the financial year, I hope the annual subvention in the following year will not be reduced by the amount of the grant.  I might be confusing the status of these grants so I would be grateful if the Minister would explain them.</P>

      <P>I must accept the discipline of the House and not discuss matters that involve a charge on the Revenue.  I understand Senator Mooney's point but he has answered it himself in his reference to budgetary constraints. Effectively, the wording in the section covers standard practice.  For example, if an institution for which I have responsibility agrees a plan for a number of years in order to implement it the institution requires a certain amount of money. At that stage, following the agreement of Estimates with the Department of Finance, I have to examine how far I can go to meet these allocations.  I then have discussions with the Department of Finance, following which I may make payments.  That is the flow of authority in relation to financial provision.  I have a view on strategic management in the Public Service, which belongs to another debate.  Under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, and the relationship of the Department of Finance with other Ministers who are co-equal in Cabinet, the discretion may be narrow and built up out of practice rather than out of the most appropriate relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill states that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo;, which is the standard wording.  The last amendment would have placed an obligation on the Minister.  On the section, I am not satisfied with the level of funding for these cultural institutions.  I began at a low baseline figure and acquired discipline in relation to financial provision in a way which fell heavier as I was moving from a low baseline.  At the same time, I am anxious to make as much provision as I can but I must take account of the national finances.  I am sympathetic to what was <Col N="374" /> intended in this amendment and those which have been reintroduced on the section.  I am working for the implementation and resourcing of plans and strategies which will put the institutions on a sound financial footing.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 50:</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht may allow gifts of money to a Board to be eligible for tax relief with the consent of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have had informal discussions with a number of people about this matter.  It should be used as a vehicle to aid the Minister in light of the comments he made on the previous section.  He repeated the term I used &ldquo;budgetary constraints&rdquo; and I accept what he has said.  There will never be enough money, especially for cultural institutions.</P>
      <P>The Minister would be the first to agree that at county council level as well as at the Cabinet table, when the list of priorities for the year are drawn up inevitably cuts will be made in the cultural area.</P>
      <P>My approach to the financial aspect of this Bill is influenced by the realities on the ground. Unfortunately, our cultural institutions get the short straw when it comes to money.  The Minister is to be complimented on ensuring that the slice of the cake has been increased.  Big business and those with money should be motivated to make contributions to the National Library, the National Museum and other institutions, which would result in a regular flow of money.  In the United States those who have the means can make a contribution which is written off against tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that under the heritage legislation, there is a mechanism whereby private donations of heritage objects from a value of £75,000 are allowable for tax purposes.  The Minister should reduce this figure significantly because there are many objects held in private hands that may be of less monetary value but would still be quite significant at a value of £2,000, £5,000 or £10,000.  If people were aware of a tax break for donating pieces to our cultural institutions, they would readily hand them over for exhibition purposes.  I was careful to ensure <Col N="375" /> that the wording of this amendment was acceptable.  The Minister should enter into discussions with the Minister for Finance in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the general thrust of Senator Mooney's amendment and his approach to the matter.  There is almost an element of civic education involved in this.  Ireland does not have the great philanthropic foundations that many other countries, even relatively small ones enjoy, nor do we have the tradition in business of providing the type of gift that Senator Mooney envisages.  It is widespread in the business cultures of most other Western countries, including small ones.  This is partly because we have so few large firms.  We are a country of very small firms and the issue does not arise most of the time.</P>
      <P>This mentality should be consciously fostered as far as it can, within reason.  This Bill provides an excellent opportunity to begin to foster that mentality with the two premier national institutions in their areas.  It does not mean there would have to be indiscriminate extension of this in every direction.  There is an educational process involved.  I do not know what the best mechanism is but the spirit of Senator Mooney's amendment is worthwhile.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of the spirit of Senator Mooney's amendment though it raises an issue which is more the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, although I have a direct interest in the matter.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, I am anxious that as much assistance as possible, through both Exchequer funding and tax incentives, is provided for the development of cultural institutions.  However, such developments must take place in the context of general Government policies on public finances and taxation reform.</P>
      <P>There were significant developments took place in the Finance Act, 1995, on the donation of cultural objects.  I accept Senator Mooney's point.  If the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht had a conversation with officials from the Department of Finance, they would say the State's income would be reduced if tax payments were foregone. For example, the limit is £75,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the minimum is £75,000. If it is reduced, a new category is introduced and tax relief is extended.  I will make representations to the Minister for Finance between now and the next Finance Bill.  I have an open mind about the £75,000 and I am willing to ask him to consider it.  I am also willing to look at amendment No. 50 which states: &ldquo;The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht may allow gifts of money to a <Col N="376" /> Board to be eligible for tax relief with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  I am grateful to Senator Mooney for giving me some of the powers of the Minister for Finance, although he might not welcome that.  I will consider what has been suggested and negotiate on that basis to see if we can implement the spirit of the amendment in the context of the Finance Bill.  It is primarily a matter for the Department of Finance and the Government.</P>

I would be reluctant to withdraw this amendment if it meant the Minister and the Department had to pursue this matter as part of statute law.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht I am interested in anything which will increase the income of the cultural institutions.  However, I am not the Minister who gives tax relief under the Finance Bill.  The change made in the Finance Act, 1995, was good and it went some way towards meeting their nees.  We may build on existing provisions in the Finance Act, 1995.  However, as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht with responsibility for cultural institutions, I cannot give tax relief.</P>
      <P>The amendment states: &ldquo;The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht may allow gifts of money to a Board to be eligible for tax relief with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  I would not have any difficulty with the amendment if it meant that no obstacle would be placed in the way of the boards receiving such tax relief as may be designated from time to time by the Minister for Finance.  The board enjoys that power at present.  On the other hand, if the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht used his discretion in relation to tax relief, which appropriately belongs to the Minister for Finance, it would be remiss of me to include something which could not be implemented.  Our case might not be assisted by the fact that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht gave tax relief to everyone after he felt the mantle of the Minister for Finance descending upon him in the Seanad. I am prepared to accept the spirit of the amendment so that the boards can receive and enjoy such tax benefits as may exist.  I am willing to forward the Senator's views to the Minister for Finance.  However, I cannot accept the amendment as worded.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister and Senator Howard said and I appreciate the overlap between the Minister's functions and those of the Minister for Finance.  There is a need for change in the mindset of corporate Ireland.  Last week corporate companies gave themselves awards for sponsorship of the arts.  I appreciate the responsible approach of some companies to the arts and I acknowledge their continuing support for the arts which does not have much commercial advantage.  This is one of the more positive aspects of corporate Ireland.  Individuals and corporate entities give money for promotion and advertising purposes on the basis of what they get in return for their companies.  There is nothing wrong with that, but they will not give money to cultural institutions because they know they will not receive many kudos in return. People will not flock to buy their products because they make an endowment to the National Library or National Museum.  If there were an expansion of the section in the Finance Act, 1995, money would flow atsignificantly higher levels than now and,not only would the two cultural institutions concerned benefit, but the Minister could find an easing of his own financial burden.  However, that is all speculation.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said and appreciate his difficulties with this being written into the Bill. However, if I can be assured that the Minister, as he indicated, will make it a matter of policy in his Department to ensure due recognition is given to this amendment in his discussions with the Minister for Finance and that there can be some revision, reform or change to the section which will accommodate this view, it would be churlish of me to pursue the matter further.</P>

It is worth encouraging people to become involved by way of donation, etc.  The Seanad will have an opportunity to deal with this in a direct relationship to legislation when it discusses the Finance Bill.  In the same spirit Senator Mooney made his offer.  I will <Col N="378" /> communicate the views of the Seanad between now and the publication of that Bill to the Minister for Finance.  My concern as Minister with responsibility for the two institutions is to ensure there is nothing in the legislation that serves as a block to them enjoying such benefits as may be negotiated.  The only difficulty I have is that I cannot assume responsibility for the Finance Bill.  I will undertake to make the case proposed in the amendment to the Minister for Finance between now and the framing of the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>My first reaction when I saw these amendments was to think they were redundant because, when a person, in this case the director, would be removed from office, there would be the usual requirements of natural justice.  There are provisions in employment law and huge corporates of protections exist.  I thought about it and now think I know from where Senator Lee is coming.  There could be an allegation and an action, and a question could arise as to whether the action was taken on the basis of the allegation or the provisions in the legislation.  I still believe there is no need to include it in the section.  However, even if they are a little redundant, if they clarify the matter, I accept the amendments.

      <P>I wish to discuss subsection (6): &ldquo;The first Director of the Library shall be officer standing designated by the Minister...&rdquo;.  My comments are not relevant to this legislation, but I would like the Minister to ensure that the retiring Director of the National Library is more than adequately remunerated for her services. The Minister will be aware, and the House should be aware, that the Director of the National Library will be retiring&mdash;perhaps she has already done so&mdash;due to ill health.  Owing to the relatively short duration from her appointment to her enforced retirement, I understand that normal pension and remunerations will not amount to a significantly high figure.  I raise this issue following consultation and it allows me an opportunity to pay tribute to an outstanding public servant who will be a great loss not only to the National Library but to the State.  I appreciate the sensitivities involved and do not expect the Minister to expand on what I say. However, I feel more content in having raised the issue and hope that due recognition will be given within the constraints placed on the Minister.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with Senator Mooney's tribute to what anyone who has any experience of the library, even as a mere user, will recognise as the outstanding service Dr. Donlon has given.  I greatly regret that circumstances have obliged her to retire prematurely from that post.  She has been an outstanding public servant.</P>

      <P>I agree with what other speakers have said in relation to the retirement of Dr. Donlon.  Great work has been done by the retiring director and, given the unfortunate circumstances of her retirement, we should ensure that due recognition is taken of that.  I am confident the Minister will do everything in his power to treat Dr. Donlon as generously as possible.  It is important that we always show recognition and understanding of people who suffer from ill health or any other misfortune.  We <Col N="380" /> should always be generous and sympathetic to people in those circumstances.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the tributes paid to the Director of the National Library, Dr. Patricia Donlon, which are well earned.  Dr. Donlon came into the Library and approached her task with far more enthusiasm and commitment than might be required for such a position and the results have been noted, acknowledged and appreciated by everyone who uses the National Library.</P>
      <P>Some aspects of her retirement have not yet been concluded and it would be inappropriate for me to discuss these matters with the Seanad. There is a structure for retirement.  Within what is appropriate and exercising such discretion as may be available to me, I am inclined to interpret that discretion with appropriate recognition and generosity.  These matters are the subject of negotiation between a citizen and the State and it would be inappropriate for me to go into more detail.  I join with others in paying tribute to Dr. Donlon.  I also agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn that in matters like this, while one is constrained by regulation, in so far as there is an opportunity for discretion it should recognise the contribution of those who give public service.</P>

I wish Dr. Donlon, an outstanding public servant, a very fruitful and happy retirement.  I know the Minister's comments will be deeply appreciated by all those who have come in contact with Dr. Donlon in either a personal or professional capacity.  The gap she will leave on the staff of the National Library is so great that I wish the Minister and his new board well in filling this vacuum.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 29.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 54:</P>
      <P>In page 22, subsection (1), to delete all words from and including &ldquo;(an adequate&rdquo; in line 18, down to and including &ldquo;English)&rdquo; in line 20 and substitute &ldquo;(who should normally be competent in the Irish language as well as English)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a little taken a back in one way to see this section.  I know it is meant in the very best spirit and with the best of intentions because the Minister has said, and I agree with him, that one ought not ordinarily to have to include specific reference to Irish as it is a defensive gesture in certain respects.  I recognise the spirit behind this section but I would like clarification as to the practicalities.  What size is the staff of the board likely to be?  Is the staff of the board the entire <Col N="381" /> staff of the museum or the staff of the secretariat servicing the board?  I am not clear about that, although no doubt I should be.</P>
    <P>I would have taken it for granted that the staff of our two greatest national institutions dealing with heritage would be assumed to be competent in both official languages and that it would not be necessary to specify that they ought to be competent in Irish as well as in English.  If the staff of these two institutions is not assumed to be competent in Irish, one may well ask what staff can be assumed to be competent in Irish. Irrespective of what precise service they are rendering and to whomever they may be rendering it, one ought to be able to take that for granted.  I am even a little reluctant to include my amendment, except that once something to this effect is in the legislation there has to be something different unless we are to drop it altogether, and I do not want to lose the spirit of it.</P>
    <P>I defer to the Minister and his officials, if they are prepared to accept the spirit of the amendment, as to what phraseology they would prefer.  I know it is not intended but there is almost a hint of defeatism in having to include a phrase of this sort in legislation relating to these two State institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can solve Senator Lee's problems.  There is no great disagreement on this matter.  It is a matter of what we want to achieve.  We want to achieve a citizenship institutional relationship in which those who wish to do their business through the medium of Irish, for example, will be able to do so.  How do we achieve this?  We looked at how we sought to achieve this in different State institutions.  I recall situations in which proficiency in both languages was used as an instrument to defeat competence, excellence and scholarship.  We want to avoid that.</P>
      <P>In both institutions specific professional skills will be required in many areas, for example, in the area of conservation.  We must balance the need of the institution for the skills of a conservationist, for example, with proficiency in Irish or English.  There may well be conservationists with competency in Irish and English.  Using many languages gives a breadth of mind which includes these great skills and excellence rather than anything else, but both institutions will need to fill vacancies with candidates who have particular skills and we cannot have a rule which would operate to the effect that the vacancies could not be filled.</P>
      <P>Section 29 (1) states:</P>
      <P>A Board may appoint such and such number of persons to be members of the staff of the Board [that is all the staff] (an adequate number of whom should be competent in the Irish language so as to provide service through Irish as well as English)...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> That means that the composition of the staff would be such as to enable the service to be delivered to citizens through the medium of Irish or English.  If I move to the alternative in the amendment, the word &ldquo;normally&rdquo; is open to a wider definition and construction and may be far less precise.  While such is not the intention, it could lead to an allegation that it could be interpreted arbitrarily.  I believe that my text is better.</P>
    <P>I have a reason for not accepting the word &ldquo;normally&rdquo;.  The provision has been designed to ensure that there will be the necessary proficiency, as I emphasised, to provide an adequate service in both languages at all times. The provision is in accordance with my policy ensuring a reasonable measure of real bilingualism in the key cultural institutions of the State.  The provision should be incorporated into the key institutions, including the National Library, as custodians of our past.</P>
    <P>I mentioned professional skills, for example those of a conservationist but there are other levels of recruitment in the National Library as well.  There may well be recruitment at the level of attendant, for example.  Are we to impose this policy on each individual?  I assure the House that there is a very definite union view on this.  I have to decide on the best policy.  Making it clear that the service will be provided in both languages and by having a balance avoiding the concept in the amendment, is the best vindication of a bilingual policy.  Reluctantly, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed by the Minister's reasoning and his obvious commitment to a cause we share.  I accept his reservations about the term &ldquo;normally&rdquo; but I used it precisely to avoid the possibility of a language barrier being used for unworthy purposes, as has been done in the past.  I am not a fundamentalist or a fanatic in imposing such requirements.</P>
      <P>I am uneasy that one should not begin from the assumption that a knowledge of Irish as well as English would be the normal expectation from the staff of these institutions.  I would start from that and then examine the deviations from it rather than starting from the assumption that many of them are not likely to have Irish and we must try to ensure there is an adequate number. How will an &ldquo;adequate number&rdquo; be defined in practice?  There is scope for massaging the numbers and it would be helpful if the Minister could indicate how it is envisaged this will work in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé féin bréan den chur i gcéill i gcúrsaí Gaeilge.  I am heartily fed up with gestures in relation to Irish.  There is little to be gained by pretending that all the members of an institution are Irish speaking and that if a Gaeilgeoir arrives Irish speaking will break out like a rash.  Many sources of employment &mdash; State, semi-State and public sector &mdash; have <Col N="383" /> suffered from this cur i gcéill.  It is important to start from the other perspective which is more democratic.</P>
      <P>There are people in the two institutions who would not be capable of delivering a service in Irish.  I cannot interrogate staff on what tasks they carry out normally.  However, as Minister, I have a responsibility in relation to these important cultural institutions.  It is normal and reasonable to expect that competence in the Irish language would prevail.  However, there is a gap to be bridged.</P>
      <P>With regard to the service provided to the public I have a responsibility, which is stated in the Bill, to ensure that a service is available in Irish and English.  If it were found that some element of an institution's functions were not available in Irish that would be a matter for the board to address.</P>
      <P>An adequate service through Irish and English will have to be available at all times and I do not intend to relent on that point.  What is important is the way in which that is brought about.  There will be advertisements in the newspapers shortly in regard to a pilot study to define the Gaeltacht areas.  We must deal with reality.  I am realistic about the Irish language and I am against the compulsion which defines everybody as Irish speakers and requires a cigireacht about how much is for real and how much is illusion.  Illusion has badly served the Irish language.</P>
      <P>It is the right of citizens to go to the cultural institutions and to carry out their business through Irish and that is reflected in the Bill.  It is the duty of the board to have a balance in the staff to ensure the service is delivered adequately and efficiently.  That is as far as I can go.  It is the board's responsibility to maintain the ratios so that the aims I have described can be delivered.</P>
      <P>People used to telephone my Department to hear if English was being spoken in the background.  This is indicative of the narrow minded mentality which, for decades, damaged the Irish language.  Those who want to give the service should be invited to be proficient in the language.  I cannot yield on the right of a citizen to have the service available through Irish. However, I am trying to deliver that aim in an achievable and positive way.</P>
      <P>Current attitudes towards the Irish language are very positive.  A large number of people use it in their interaction with State bodies.  There was always a gap between the sympathy for and the use of the language but it is narrowing.  We must have an atmosphere in which we do not make people feel insecure but encourage them to make up the gap.</P>

I agree with the general thrust of what the Minister has said.  I was concerned to arrive at working assumptions that would not involve <Col N="384" /> illusions.  I am a little concerned about the concept of an &ldquo;adequate number&rdquo;.  I have no problem with conservationists and attendants, although I suspect I would differ strongly with the union view on such matters.</P>
      <P>In a number of institutions there are historians who believe they can be authorities on Irish history at a time when the Irish language was the vernacular, without knowing a word of Irish.  I would be sorry to see such assumptions creep into national institutions of the calibre and importance of those in question.  It was this concerne which lay behind the phraseology in my amendment, not a concern with creating a barrier.  I am a meritocrat and I believe in performance principles in such matters.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister on the principles involved and if he is confident that his phraseology adequately takes account of these principles I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Lee on this important point.  The excess I described is known as nativism but equally there have been situations in institutions and workplaces in Ireland where simply being from abroad and having an attitude of mind that was against absorbing matters of Irish culture and language was perceived as superiority.  It established an excellence that depended on a distance from natives.  Such people were in these institutions and did immense damage in eroding national self-confidence and in creating a shoneen view where rejection of what was familiar and of one's people was a necessary step in the ascendant ladder to preferment.  They were miserable people and I agree with Senator Lee that one cannot but look and wonder at the endurance of individuals or enclaves with that frame of mind.  The Bill is not a significant comfort to them.  It is a delicate and difficult matter in which to achieve a balance and I acknowledge Senator Lee's appreciation that I am trying to follow the same route he intended in his amendment.</P>

      <P>I followed the debate with great interest.  I am grateful to Professor Lee and also to the Minister for his mission statement which was needed.  Speaking as somebody who grew up in the Galltacht, as distinct from the Gaeltacht, I confess that my generation felt inadequate in dealing with people who had a great knowledge of the Irish language but who tended to move in elitist circles.  There was no recognition or encouragement given to those of us who had school Irish and who wanted to use even the most basic expressions and phraseology in day to day speech.  I remember being in the company of gaeilgeoirs where I was effectively shut out so that they could speak as Gaeilge.  On the other side of the coin, the Minister referred to the other element in Irish society and I came across this in the media.  Were his comments informed by the experience of his Department over the past couple of years?  I do not want to single out RTE <Col N="385" /> but I come from the heart of the country where the State broadcasting service is perceived to have a Dublin 4 bias.  For example, something important to our local culture which people admired, enjoyed and appreciated in everyday life and was distinctly Irish was not always given due recognition by programme makers, some of whom had lived outside the country for a number of years and had gained their expertise in broadcast technology but had lost their Irishness along the way or who felt on their return that they had to educate the peasant Irish in different attitudes.</P>
      <P>I have tremendous respect for Professor Lee because he has chronicled Ireland since 1912.  I like to think that we are fast approaching a certain equilibrium in Irish society where we are happy with our identity and are not only accepting our Irishness but are positively proud of it.  We are ensuring, particularly when we go abroad or meet foreigners here that our Irishness is important and something of which we should be proud.  For too long what was uniquely Irish was swept under the carpet, perhaps it was the post-colonial attitude but I am glad this debate touched on it because it is an important facet of Irish life.  The most encouraging aspect of it is that the younger generation of Irish people no longer have any shibboleths about being Irish.  They know precisely who they are and where they come from and long may it continue so.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 55 not moved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section affords me an opportunity to clarify the position of the Genealogical Office and the Office of the Chief Herald which has been dealt with in section 13. The staffing complement of the office is five plus support staff and the Keeper of Manuscripts post is currently held in an acting capacity.  It is interesting, in light of the debate on the status of the staff and the question of the continuing status of the Chief Herald and the Genealogical Officer, that the published annual reports of the council of trustees of the National Library reported that the current acting Genealogical Officer was appointed to the post of Assistant Librarian in 1971, where he worked in printed books, because once again the impression had been conveyed that there was a form of continuity of specialisation which was separate to that of the library staff and mere librarians and that the chief Herald and Genealogical Officer was living on a different planet far removed from normal day to day functioning and activity.  It has escaped the notice of those who were critical of the proposals contained in the Bill that up until 1982 and the appointment of the retired Chief Herald <Col N="386" /> and Genealogical Officer the position was coupled with Keeper of Manuscripts in the National Library clearly indicating that far from being a separate office there was even less division than currently exists.  In 1982, on the retirement of Gerald Slevin, the then Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer and Keeper of Manuscripts, Mr. Donal Begley was appointed Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer, and a separate post of Keeper of Manuscripts was created.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the library commissioned an in depth staff training needs analysis which highlighted the lack of flexibility and mobility in the professional staff as a weakness.  The management committee of the library together with the council of trustees decided that it was in the interest of staff and the library that staff shuld rotate more frequently than in the past.  A period of about five years in a given section was regarded as ideal and staff were notified through the consultative committee and in writing that this was policy.</P>
      <P>In the context of this section I want to lay to rest suggestions that there is any diminution of what existed.  The Bill enhances rather than diminishes that.  When an attempt was made to give effect to the decision, Mr. Begley indicated his intention to take early retirement, thus effectively blocking any possibility of moving the assistant keeper into that position, which is why he is in an acting capacity.  There is an opportunity under this section to nail the suggestion that there was something there before; there was not.  It is an illusion.  This question of separateness within the library is fascinating.</P>
      <P>However, this section also allows me to ask the Minister to ensure, in so far as he can, that the staff complement is increased.  There are a number of vacancies in the National Library and it is important that these positions are filled.  I understand there is a vacancy for the post of inspector of manuscripts which would be rather important in that context.  At a different level which is important in terms of access to the library, there are two vacancies for the post of library attendant and two for the post of science and arts attendants.  There is also a vacancy in the cleaning section.  I am sure the Minister will not mind me taking this opportunity to put these matters on the record.  I know he would aspire to ensure all these posts are filled.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of my contribution to this section was to clarify, again, the historic context in which the Office of the Chief Herald and the Genealogical Office operated and prove, if proof was needed, that the position has been enhanced rather than diminished as a result of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Mooney for clarifying matters related to this section as he did on the last occasion.  The distorted communications to the newspaper, which I note have not been corrected, have been outrageous.  Any damage to Ireland's reputation for genealogy or heraldry has been done by the <Col N="387" /> small number of irresponsible people who misled the public knowingly, in most cases, and did not correct that misleading information.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney's contributions today and last week have been very useful with regard to the basic decision of 1943 for example.  The first letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> with regard to the Government decision of 1943 which started this controversy is factually wrong.  It may be based on research but it is factually wrong.  It suggests, for example, that a Government decision was taken in one month of the year after a public campaign when, in fact, the date of the Government decision which precedes that date by several months is now on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>The controversy rolled on and those of us who were trying to clarify a situation were accused of all sorts of different things.  Before I introduced this Bill, the National Library had staff and buildings; it had responsibilities and it was accountable and there were those under an obligation to respect those who were in charge of administration.  That was another source of letters to the newspaper.</P>
      <P>The Bill set out to clarify administrative structures so that the Director of the National Library would be able to speak, discuss and carry out the functions the State wanted without an eccentric disregard for what were proper relationships in a public institution; the Bill did that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Office of the Chief Herald, etc., Senator Mooney is correct.  When it was said, for example, that Irish heraldic seals and genealogical records would be diminished, I was accused of being anti-royalist, a philistine and ignorant.  That does not bother me.  The point is that I have a fine peasant recognition of a con job when it is being perpetrated with regard to what was the basis for this.  I saw it then, I see it now and I know the basis for it.  It is outrageous and it has nothing to do with institutional options and models which we have been discussing in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney said that the position in relation to the office and functions of the Chief Herald are clear; they are mentioned in legislation.  It is linked to clear genealogical functions.  We may differ about what the future may hold; the Bill makes possible all sorts of things.</P>
      <P>It is also linked to librarianship.  I appreciate in particular Senator Mooney's recognition of the role of librarianship in this.  The suggestion that a librarian is disqualified from an opinion with regard to genealogy or heraldry is based not just on ignorance but on bigotry.  Anybody who has spent a wet moment in this field knows the connection between all these different things.</P>
      <P>The debate, to be good humoured about it, has been marvellous because it has outlined clearly the background to this office for the first time and future historians will be able to look at the historical texts with greater accuracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="388" /> With regard to the other side from which we will all benefit, the section now provides for what Senator Mooney mentioned.  Everybody will benefit from this matter being sorted out.  I am not so sure it will be the end of it but let us be clear that this Bill facilitates new institutional arrangements which will give the people of Ireland modern structures at the end of the 20th century.  When that happens and the director is responsible to the board appointed by the Government, one would hope there would be a degree of co-operation and a new atmosphere of co-operation, whoever carries the heavy burden of being director.  The unions and I are anxious that there be both high morale and good relationships.  With the passage of this section, let us hope we will see an end to personal eccentric indulgence also.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister again for his elucidation.  With regard to staffing and qualifications, the assistant keeper, Mr. Lyne, MA, was recruited to the post of assistant keeper II and worked in printed books.  He was transferred to the Genealogical Office in 1974 and then went on to take a Diploma in Library Studies.  He moved to the manuscripts department where he remained until 1995 when he moved to genealogy.  Therefore, in terms of this &ldquo;continuity&rdquo; of people with massive expertise in genealogy, time and again all the current staffing arrangements in the library give the lie to that.  In fact, in 1988 a post of executive officer in the Genealogical Office was created and it was competed for from the library assistant grade.</P>
      <P>Apart from those who are strictly Genealogical Office staff, the section has two clerical assistants for typing, secretarial and reception work.  These officers are usually recruited from the general service and often leave after a brief period to return to the parent Department.  The present incumbents have been there three years and six months, respectively.</P>
      <P>Access to and from the Genealogical Office and cloakroom, security and other such matters are handled by the science and art attendant grade.  There are seven in all and each person is rostered for a variety of duties across the library. When the EO in the office is ill or on annual leave, he is replaced by one of the library assistants, not somebody from outside who has massive genealogical experience or knows all about heraldry.</P>
      <P>In no way can the office be seen to have operated independently.  The funding for the Genealogical Office comes from the National Library's annual budget and money accrued from the provision of grants of arms, etc., is part of the overall appropriation-in-aid of the National Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the qualifications to which the Minister and I referred, the acting keeper and the deputy chief herald has an honours BA, a Diploma in Archival Studies; many years practical experience in the section.  The assistant keeper I has an MA, <Col N="389" /> H. Dip. in Ed. and a Diploma in Library Studies and the executive officer has no professional qualifications but he is doing a wonderful job.</P>
    <P>None of the staff is in possession of qualifications specific to genealogy or heraldry. All have learned from their predecessors.  This year, 1996 for the first time a specific training programme in genealogy was instigated in the Library and GO to ensure that all staff were conversant with the basic sources used by the genealogical researcher.  This training course was carried out by Seán Murphy, and a subcommittee of the Association of Professional Genealogists in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion by many of those involved in the libraries that an attempt was being made to hijack the Bill by the small but vocal minority to which the Minister referred.  The status is not being diluted; it is being linked to the title of Chief Herald in the Genealogical Office and will not suffer.  Respect for the office holder must be earned and this post, unlike some positions of chief herald in certain countries, will be full-time and high ranking.  The Chief Herald of Spain suffers no loss of status or dignity due to the fact that he works full-time as a lawyer and part-time as chief herald.  However, that situation will not arise under this legislation.</P>

      <P>This debate comes at a very opportune time.  It is nearly one year since the public consultation programme on the light rail proposal was launched and it is now drawing to a conclusion.  It is timely for us to assess the public response to the project and consider the principal issues that have arisen during the consultation.</P>
      <P>Since the public consultation programme was launched people have become conscious that this Government is determined to make sure the recommendations of the Dublin Transportation Initiative are implemented.  This Government is committed to their implementation in a coherent and planned manner.  Neither the Government nor I will allow this opportunity to make a lasting improvement in the transport and traffic difficulties of our capital city slip through our hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> Unfortunately some people, despite the work of the Dublin Transportation Initiative, appear to seek to have the whole study process revisited. The history of transportation planning in Dublin is littered with missed opportunities and lack of effective and decisive action.  The Government will not allow that to happen to DTI.</P>
    <P>DTI has been the most exhaustive, extensive and open approach to transportation planning ever undertaken in this State.  It took more than four years to complete and involved all relevant interests.  The approach adopted and the transport strategy recommended by DTI have been endorsed, not only by this Government, but by its Fianna Fáil led predecessor.  The current Fianna Fáil leader Bertie Ahern announced two on-street light rail routes in late 1994.</P>
    <P>The European Commission, which provided substantial funding for the study phase, will support implementation of significant elements of the recommended transport strategy.  We have spent years getting to where we are now.  We have spent £10 million getting the detailed planning of the light rail system to this point.  We have spent enough time, energy and money on studies.  Now is the time for action.  There is a committed project team working to prepare an application for the statutory powers for the light rail project. I am not prepared to divert them from this work. I want them to concentrate on finalising their application; I want delivery not distraction.</P>
    <P>It is important to put light rail in its proper context.  The first point that must be stressed is that light rail on its own is not the solution to Dublin's transport and traffic problems.  It is a significant element of an integrated plan and each element is being acted on.  In addition to light rail, other elements of the plan include a radical overhaul of the city's bus services.  We are delivering on that.  New quality bus corridors are being opened on a regular basis.  These mean a higher priority on the streets for buses and better facilities for passengers.</P>
    <P>The plan also includes the extension of the DART and the upgrading of other suburban rail services.  We are delivering on those.  Work on the extensions to Greystones and Malahide has started; new rolling stock has been ordered; new track is being laid and new stations will be built.</P>
    <P>This Government will deliver on DTI.  The ultimate objective is the transformation of the city centre environment.  It is currently characterised by congestion, noise and fumes generated by cars and heavy goods vehicles.  That will change to a pleasant environment more suited to the type of city people have clearly indicated they want.  DTI has given us the strategy for a better city.  That strategy is based on a vision which sees Dublin as a living city on a human scale; accessible to all; serving its people and communities and meeting their aspirations for an improved quality of life.</P>
    <P>I am determined to see the public transport elements of the strategy delivered.  I am also determined that the DTI plan will not remain on <Col N="391" /> the drawing board.  On-street light rail is a key element of that plan.</P>
    <P>There are those who oppose on-street light rail. People in the 1970s said that bus lanes were wrong for Dublin.  Today there are more than 20 kilometres of bus lanes playing a critical role in ensuring that buses are kept moving at peak times.</P>
    <P>People in the 1970s said the DART was wrong for Dublin, that it was dangerous and expensive and would cause traffic problems at junctions. Today the DART is an essential part of our transport infrastructure.  There are those in the 1990s who say that on-street light rail is wrong for Dublin.  I am confident they will be proved wrong.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the fact that light rail will lead to traffic gridlock in the city centre. There are two points I would make in response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can guarantee that if nothing is done we will have gridlock anyway.  We are close to that point now.  We are not seeking to simply insert light rail into the city in isolation.  Many organisations and agencies are co-operating to ensure that the integrated DTI package becomes a reality.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that some politicians have chosen to make a political football out of the light rail project by assuming every criticism of the project is evidence that it is seriously flawed and in need of re-evaluation.  The people of Dublin deserve better than that.</P>
      <P>Some have been critical of the public consultation programme on light rail; arguing that the authorities had a closed mind on the route alignments.  This is not true.  I have always been determined that progress towards implementation of the light rail network should not be made at the expense of genuine and effective public consultation.</P>
      <P>Since the public consultation programme began the LRT project team has held more than 350 public meetings and briefings; produced major reports on substantive issues raised during the consultation and organised public exhibitions which have been attended by more than 15,000 people.  I hope at this stage we can finally dispel any notion that the Government and the project team are not genuinely committed to full public consultation on the light rail proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> The strength of the public consultation programme can be clearly seen in the many issues that have been raised over the past year.  They mainly relate to the choice of routes and route alignments, the capacity of light rail, integration with other public transport modes, provision of an underground section in the city centre and traffic management aspects.  Many of these concern details of the light rail proposals and do not reflect opposition to the implementation of a light rail network in Dublin as such.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking at some of the key points. As to the choice of routes, it was the Fianna Fáilled Government that acknowledged there were financial and physical constraints on the extent of the network which could be implemented within the timeframe of the current Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999.  That Government's preference was to proceed with the Tallaght-Dundrum element of the core network recommended by DTI.  This Government has acted to ensure that a line to Tallaght and Dundrum will become a reality.  In addition we are committed to the completion of the core network to Cabinteely and Ballymun. We are considering the wider northside.</P>
    <P>Following the completion of the Oscar Faber study on the Tallaght-Ballymun and Tallaght-Dundrum lines, I reached an understanding with the European Commissioner for Regional Affairs which reinforces the target I have constistently stated of having all three lines in operation as soon as possible.  Planning and design of the Ballymun to city centre route will be brought forward and will proceed in parallel with the construction of the Tallaght to Dundrum route.  I am committed to the construction of the Ballymun route as soon as possible and, at the latest, immediately after the completion of the Tallaght to Dundrum route.  The Commissioner expressed a willingness to co-finance the design and planning work on the Ballymun line within the current Community Support Framework envelope and also indicated that the Commission would be favourably disposed to co-finance its construction should the Structural Fund situation for Ireland post-1999 make this possible.</P>
    <P>I have asked the project team, in the course of the design and planning work on the Ballymun line, to investigate possible alternative alignment options which would take account of the wider needs of the north Dublin area and also to consider an extension to Dublin Airport.  This will involved looking at the northside afresh.  I am not convinced that the current proposals adequately meet the needs of the northside.  I have asked, for example, that the use of the Broadstone alignment and the potential to service Finglas and Dublin Airport be taken into account.  I expect a number of options tobe developed and in due course these will be published and will undergo the same rigorous public consultation as was undertaken in phase one.</P>
    <P>The aspect which has perhaps given rise to most debate is the provision of an underground <Col N="393" /> section in the city centre.  There are many reasons the Government is not supporting an underground option.  The real issue is not about on-street versus underground, it is more about the type of city to which we aspire.  It is certainly not a question of cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it did not fit in with DTI's overall vision for Dublin which envisages sharing of road space by various types of traffic based on the movement of people rather than vehicles, and it would be less accessible to the travelling public. An underground would have fewer stops.  There would be longer distances between stations, compared with an on-street system.</P>
      <P>The project team published a report on a review carried out by its consultants which found that an underground LRT section is not justified because it would cost substantially more than on-street LRT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="394" />
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the cost did not matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional cost would range from £124 million to £300 million, depending on the length of the tunnelled section.  The report stated that building it would cause substantial disruption because cut and cover tunnels and excavations for underground stations could not be avoided.  Also, it would simply concede the streets to the private car.</P>
      <P>Dubliners themselves, when surveyed, have said they have concerns about the underground system.  Primarily, they are concerned about it from a personal safety aspect.  I understand the real fears of women, in particular, using an underground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister allowed to be exists in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair will not tolerate these interruptions.  Senators will have an opportunity to respond to the Minister in their contributions.  I ask that the Minister be allowed to proceed without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, I am concerned that this is a proposal which is more than the city needs or on which it can justify spending money. I cannot stand over a proposal which would impose an annual drain on resources because of its higher operating and maintenance costs and yet would not deliver substantial benefits.  I am very much aware that the additional money it would cost to build an underground could instead be used to complete the extra on-street lines.</P>
      <P>Against this background the key must be to use the streets of the city most effectively to move the greatest number of people.  This is a major change from the old policy which concentrated on moving more vehicles.  This is central to the debate.  There are no solutions which include facilitating the continued dominance of the private car at the very heart of our city.  Its strategy is based on a rightful, but not a dominant position, for cars.</P>
      <P>The capacity of on-street light rail has also been questioned.  Concerns have been expressed that the light rail system will not be able to carry all the passengers wanting to use it.  The central issue here is how many people will seek to use the system at peak hours at the most congested point on the system.  High figures relating to total boardings in an hour or total passengers carried have been used by some commentators to give the impression that the system will have inadequate capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent studies show maximum passenger flows during the morning peak hour in 2001 at just under 3,000 passengers per hour in each direction.  From the opening date it is proposed to run a service at five minute intervals at peak hours.  This means there will be 12 trams passing any one point in each direction every <Col N="395" /> hour.  As demand increased the next step would be to increase services.  This need not be done along the full line but only between the most popular stations.  For example, the service in the city centre could be increased from every five minutes to every three minutes by providing turnback facilities so that not all services would go to each terminus.  Using such an option, the capacity figure rises dramatically to 4,700.</P>
    <P>Even then Luas would still not have reached its limits.  The system, particularly the lengths of vehicles, station platforms and the power supply, is being designed to accommodate longer trams. This can be done by adding a small centre section, ten metres in length, to increase the tram from 30 to 40 metres.  At three minute frequencies this increases capacity to over 6,000 with five passengers to the square metre.  This is similar to the current level of carryings on the DART which, after 12 years of operation, now carries an equivalent of about 5,000 passengers in each direction per hour at peak points.  These are some of the principal issues that have arisen during the course of the year long public consultation programme.</P>
    <P>The next phase of the project will be the statutory approval process under the Dublin Transport (Light Rail Order) Act which was enacted last July.  Under this legislation, an application for a draft light railway order will shortly be submitted to me for approval, with an environmental impact statement and other detailed supporting documentation.  The draft light railway order and the environmental impact statement are currently in preparation by the project team.  A final decision on the light rail routes to be included in the formal application for a light railway order will not be made until the current public consultation process is completed.</P>
    <P>The consultation process has had an impact on the timetable for the preparation of these documents as they must reflect any changes which arise as a result of the process.  It is important that the details are correct because there is a strict limit on the extent to which they can be amended when the statutory process begins.  This documentation will be available for public examination for at least two months, after which a public inquiry will be held early in 1997 which will provide an independent statutory forum at which the outstanding issues can be aired.</P>
    <P>This is a major project for this city and one with which I have been proud to be involved.  Getting to this stage has been a difficult process.  The work to date has taken many years and £10 million.  All the effort has confirmed that on-street light rail will produce substantial transportation benefits for the city of Dublin.  It will contribute to badly needed urban regeneration and environmental improvements. The coming months will be critical in ensuring that Dublin gets a transport infrastructure suitable for the 21st century.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> Now is the time to support this project, ensure that the traffic problems in Dublin are addressed and give the project team the support it needs to complete its application.  I will be urging the team to concentrate on this task so that it can finalise its work and prepare for the public inquiry.  The time for studies is past.  The time for action is now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil supports an alternative rail transport system for Dublin and has been committed to it for many years.  All fair minded people agree that the increase in road traffic in the city centre in recent years needs to be addressed urgently.  However, we differ with the Minister's proposals on this.</P>
      <P>We are aware of the demand for the Dundrum line to be extended to Sandyford, as well as the demand for the Tallaght and Ballymun lines.  The north side of Dublin has been badly neglected by all Government Departments, not just the present Minister's.  As someone with much experience of the north inner city, it is appalling to see how it is left behind whenever proposals are made by Government Departments.  I hope that when Deputy Bertie Ahern becomes Taoiseach next year he will address the issue as it is his area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no plan to link all the light rail lines I mentioned.  When one considers the proposal to eliminate 50 per cent of motor traffic from St. Stephen's Green, as well as 40 per cent of road use in Dawson Street and putting a lane on each side of O'Connell Street, one can see the massive difficulties which the city centre will experience.</P>
      <P>I have been in many countries where monorail is used.  I raised this point with the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, but I do not know whether she passed it on to the Minister.  Have the Minister's experts examined the possibility of using monorail?  It is a modern, environmentally friendly rail system currently used in Sydney, Atlanta and elsewhere.  Fianna Fáil wants a study to be undertaken on monorail which would be an ideal, pollution free underground system, an all weather station.  I do not know why there is such big opposition to an independent study for an underground rail system for Dublin.  It would have the advantage of retaining existing road capacity in the city centre.</P>
      <P>How can one argue the case for tackling chaotic traffic conditions in the city centre while eliminating two traffic lanes around St. Stephen's Green, thus cutting capacity there in half?  Why is the monorail option not being examined?  It is the future direction for rail transport and is already used in Sydney even though there was massive opposition to its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am the Fianna Fáil spokesperson for transport, energy and communications yet no one has indicated the proposed lines to me.  I would <Col N="397" /> like the Minister's officials to let me have a copy of the proposed lines.</P>
    <P>The former Fine Gael leader, Dr. Garrett Fitzgerald, is opposed to the Minister's plans for the city centre.  While we have not always agreed with him on this side of the House, we recognise that he is an expert in this field.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to protect the business people of Dublin city centre as much as the transport system.  It is wonderful to see satellite towns being provided to cater for the population but life in the city centre must not disappear after a certain time at night.  We must retain city life and, in order to do that, people must be allowed to bring their cars into the city and use the abundant car parking facilities.  One does not have to be an expert to know there are many parking spaces available in the city.  There are signposts at virtually every corner showing how many parking spaces are available in the city's car parks.</P>
      <P>We sought an independent study to examine the option of an underground system.  Monorail should be one of the systems studied.  I am told it is the cheapest form of rail transport and is the most environment friendly.  It is a state-of-the-art system that is not noisy and does not cause pollution.  Nobody in the Department has mentioned it or replied to my queries about it. This is the third time I have raised the issue of monorail but nobody appears to be interested.  I do not know why there is such lack of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not realise until recently that one will not be able to drive a car across the rail lines when they are not in use.  I understood Luas would be somewhat similar to the old tram system whereby <Col N="398" /> one could drive a car on the lines when they were not in use.  How can business maintain the same rate of growth in those circumstances?  It is mooted that part of Nassau Street will be a pedestrian area.  It will be impossible to drive a car through the city centre and that is a shame. We have a beautiful city to show our tourists and they should be able to travel around it in comfort. If the overflow of people is to be transported through the city the best place to do it is on an underground.</P>
    <P>The Minister says Luas will cost £300 million. Look at what is paid in taxes by city centre business people in terms of VAT alone.  It is probably about £1,000 million per year.  Look at the cost of what was built in Cork.  A good job is never cheap and we should do the best and right job.  There is no point in coming back to tell the House that mistakes were made because an independent study was not carried out.  An independent study would take another few months.  The Minister should commission one on the feasibility of an underground system for the city centre.</P>
    <P>The Minister is fair minded.  He came from humble beginnings to reach his present position and I could never accuse him of being blinkered. He, no more than I, is not an expert on this matter but he is from the business world and knows he must review all his options.  What is commonplace today could be obsolete in a short time with the advance of new technology and ideas.  The Minister is open to new ideas and that is why I, as a person with extensive business interests in the city centre, ask him to commission an independent study.  There are also experts in the House who have experience in this area.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept my proposal. Fianna Fáil supports an alternative rail system but, as the party stated in the Lower House, it wants the Minister to address the need for an independent study.  The findings can be available within 100 days so there should not be a problem in commissioning it.  If CIE has carried out a study it will have dealt with the costings.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the cost of the project will be £300 million.  The estimates of the experts who are advising Fianna Fáil differ substantially from that figure.  If the objective is to prevent the city centre from being jammed even further a study must be carried out.  I remember a former Taoiseach who was at one time Minister for Transport&mdash;perhaps this Minister might also be Taoiseach some day &mdash; encountering enormous opposition to the establishment of bus lanes.  He launched the system on one of the city streets at 7 a.m.  It was the right thing to do; it is never the wrong time to do the right thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister is introducing the proposed routes and that is the right thing to do.  We want routes to Dublin Airport and Finglas in addition to the routes on the southside.  However, the study must be carried out.  The Minister should initiate it and bring its findings before the House. The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, told us the <Col N="399" /> recent legislation on this matter was enabling legislation.  We had many reservations about it but in order to allow the Department progress the proposal we accepted it.  She gave us her word, as a former Member of the House, that we will have many opportunities to discuss the project before the final decision is taken by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have outlined my party's position and I look forward to the Minister commissioning an independent study.  It is necessary.  I also hope the Minister will research and address the monorail system.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the House has again been given an opportunity to debate this important issue for Dublin.  This is the third time we have debated the issue since I became a Member of the House last December.  The debate in this House has been of a higher quality and standard than the debate in the Dáil and the comments of Senators on all sides have been helpful.  Senator Cassidy put down an amendment on Committee Stage of the enabling legislation seeking the inclusion of the Ballymun line.  While that line could not be included in the legislation, its provision is now Government policy.  I am delighted for the people of Ballymun and the northside that the third spur will be included.  The Government has listened to the views of all sides of the House and has responded.</P>
      <P>Everybody is aware of the seriousness of the city's traffic problem.  It has reached crisis point. That is a result of the increased standard of living and good Government enjoyed by the citizens of the city and its suburbs over recent years.  Car ownership has dramatically increased in the last six years.  This year over 60,000 cars in Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Meath are registered for use in Dublin city.  The figure for last year was 40,000.  There is a dramatic increase in the number of cars being driven through the city. When the DTI forecast traffic flow for the years 2001 and 2011 it did not realise that its figures would be true five years before that time.  The figure the DTI predicted for the year 2001 was reached in 1996.  That crisis must be addressed.</P>
      <P>At present there are 320 cars per 1,000 population in Dublin.  The European average is 450 cars per 1,000 people and we are moving rapidly in that direction.  The figures will soon converage.  At the same time, Dublin has also seen a dramatic increase in the number of vehicles using its port.  On any day in the city one can go to the quays and count the number of vehicles accessing the port.  Few of those vehicles have business in the city; most of them are through traffic on their way to other parts of the country such as Belfast, Cork and Galway.  This is a disappointing picture which we all have to address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the interests of the city centre are eloquently articulated by Senator Norris and Senator Cassidy, sometimes we fail to remember that the majority of the people in this city live in <Col N="400" /> the suburbs.  There has been a dramatic increase in traffic there with very little response from local authorities.  As the Minister rightly said, now is the time to act.  The congestion has to be dealt with.  If we do not act now, we will be responsible for the continued decline of our capital city.</P>
    <P>Politicians and policy makers must be honest about this issue.  The only way this will again be a living and working city is if we are straight with car owners.  The city cannot cope with the current level of traffic.  The honest statement to the public is that it will have to be restricted in some shape or form.  This is not popular as most people want to use their cars whenever they like but taking that irresponsible attitude will never solve this problem and the city will become increasingly congested.  All politicians need to face that reality.  We need to reduce the number of cars coming into the city and the Luas proposal is part of that.  This is more honest than speaking about other issues and whether we see car options as a viable part of the city's infrastructure.  We need to reduce the number of cars coming into the city and I am convinced the Luas proposal will succeed in doing this.</P>
    <P>The DTI process, as outlined by the Minister, started in 1991 and made its first report in 1994. Since then a range of proposals from the report has been implemented.  Luas is only part of the total package of measures, which include the port access tunnel and the cycle way network.  Five per cent of commuters from the suburbs use bicycles and there are proposals to increase this to 10 per cent over the next five to ten years.  We also need quality bus corridors.  These have been spoken about over the last ten years or so, but little has been implemented.  The extension of the DART line also needs to be established.  We need to ensure that a park and ride facility is available, for suburbs in particular.  The &ldquo;C&rdquo; road proposal and the investment in the motorway is also part of the DTI process.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, now is the time for action on Luas.  Are the citizens of this city getting the best value for money from the proposed project? Will Luas make a difference to city congestion? When we strip away the information and propoganda and the great debates between former Taoisigh, will Luas work?  From my discussions with other colleagues and the research I have led, I am quietly confident that the proposal before this House and the people of this city will make in roads in reducing the number of cars coming in to the city.  It will also provide a quality public transport facility that the citizens of the city rightly deserve.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion of the tunnel proposal.  I understand the point the Minister made in relation to costs, when he said that if the money was there, he still would not implement the tunnel proposal, primarily because it would not reduce traffic coming into the city.  We have a responsibility to look at the issue of cost.  If a tunnel, which, according to the Minister, could cost anything between £124 million and £300 <Col N="401" /> million, was to proceed, the additional capital investment required would be moneys taken away from the kind of community I represent. Luas is only going part of the way in Tallaght and will serve about one third of the people there.  It will not serve the people who need the service most, those who do not have cars and rely on public transport.  If additional money is available, the suburbs should be given priority in providing the public transport system required.</P>
    <P>The report on tunnelling stated that between £124 million and £300 million in additional moneys would be required to make the tunnel a reality.  If that money is available, I would prefer to see it being used for west Tallaght, Clondalkin and the greater Dublin area which does not have the kind of public transport facility they need.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the DTI wanted to give the kind of financial support to the communities I represent.  Its report states:</P>
    <P>In the Western Town areas only basic facilities, such as primary schools, which were generally incorporated in the planning of the local authority housing estates, were reported by high percentages of respondents as being within walking distance.  Since fewer facilities were within walking distance it followed that people in these areas needed to travel more to get to services.  Not surprisingly, given the above, the percentage of respondents travelling to services by bus was twice as high in the Western Towns as in the Inner City.</P>
    <P>Our responsibility as legislators and policy makers is to provide support through public transport to the new suburbs, particularly in the west and south-west of Dublin and to move the focus of the debate from the issue of the city centre.  Throughout this debate there seems to be a bias towards the centre.  While I understand business interests determining much of the life of this city, to which Senator Cassidy referred, the overriding interest is not that of business but to ensure the public transport facility we give to this city is the very best.  The representative organisations of small businesses in the city support what the Minister and Government proposes.  This bias needs to be addressed.  I would welcome additional moneys for the west and south-west of the city where the new towns are struggling to provide the kind of public transport facilities the people in those areas require.</P>
    <P>As someone new to the House, I have found this debate quite frustrating, primarily because there is so much cynicism about the proposals.  I can understand why people feel cynical about the latest set of proposals.  They have seen 20 or 30 years of inaction in city and public transportation management.  As Senator Bob Dole said recently, I am an optimistic man.</P>

      <P>These proposals, if implemented, will be part of the answer to this problem.  There is cynicism not only among Members on the other side of the House but also in my party.  Yesterday senior colleagues, such as Deputy Mitchell, expressed doubts to me about the transport policy for this city.  The debate has revolved around different types of propaganda, one team of engineers being pitted against another and people's professional expertise being questioned. <i>The Irish Times</i> also helped to hype up this issue. This has been an eye opener particularly for someone trying to find the best way forward for some parts of the city.</P>
      <P>Development issues are always difficult and politicians face great pressure from groups in their constituencies.  People do not seem to look at policies from a long-term point of view.  We are doing a great disservice to DTI by looking at what may not work instead of seeing it in the context of an overall package.  We must think about the long-term planning needs of this city if we want to deal effectively with the problem of congestion.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for the work he has done on this issue.  He has shown great courage in the face of political opportunism by some Members in the other House who should know better.  We will all be better off as a result of the Minister's long-term policy for this city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, although my welcome is qualified because I am not happy with what he said, particularly in light of the previous debates for which I was instrumental in calling.  On those occasions the Minister gave a clear commitment that the underground option would not be ruled out and that there would be a full independent inquiry. Neither of those promises has been met.  There has not been a proper examination of the underground option, nor has a date been fixed for a proper independent inquiry.</P>
      <P>The examination was conducted by Semaly, who are the consultants for Luas.  Does the Minister recollect the old poem by Lewis Carroll: &lsquo;&ldquo;I'll be judge, I'll be jury&rsquo;, said cunning old Fury. &lsquo;I'll try the whole case and condemn it to death&rsquo;&rdquo;.  I do not seek to impugn the professional credentials of Semaly, but it was told what to do; it is not an independent inquiry.  Let us have the independent inquiry to which the Minister was committed.  I believe a public inquiry is still on track.  I would like a clear commitment that it will be independent and comprehensive and the Minister will cease undermining it by announcing in advance what the result will be as far as he is concerned.  Ever since the last debate he has consistently referred to when we build the on-street Luas.  What kind of respect is that for an independent inquiry?  It is no respect at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not accusing the Minister of being macho, but of being weak.  We are dealing with a bullish bureaucracy in the transport hierarchy which is pushing the Minister in a particular direction.  The <Col N="403" /> last time we debated this issue the Minister said the time for words was over; it was now time for action.  He amended that as a result of the debate. However, it has crept back into the script.  I wonder from where it crept back in.  I do not think it is the Minister's view; he is being pushed. It is necessary for him to rethink this matter in light of the information made available by people like Dr. Garret FitzGerald from whose articles I propose to quote so they will be on the public record.  I am calling for a clear independent inquiry, which has been promised and which is required, and for Dr. FitzGerald to be called as an expert witness so that this material may be placed in the public light.</P>
    <P>We are told there is a public demand for this system.  However, I do not belive that.  It is a public relations exercise.  I was at a dinner last night and the Luas people had a table at £150 a skull next to mine.  I was discussing with the people at my table this issue and the public relations exercise, which has been superbly mounted at enormous cost to the public.  Is the Minister satisfied this meets the constitutional test laid down in the McKenna judgment, because I do not believe it does?  The Government is not entitled to pay for one aspect of a matter of public interest.  I would like the Minister to consider that point.  One often hears people say they were never asked for their opinions in a public relations exercise.  However, one of my colleagues at the table was asked for his opinion. He was doorstepped in Grafton Street, cameras closed in on him and he was asked would he not agree that when Luas is set up, he would get home to Dundrum in half the time.  He said he would not.  The interviewers were flabber gasted and asked why not.  He replied that he lives in Clontarf.  I doubt if that film clip was ever shown.</P>
    <P>When RTÉ did a programme on this issue all those taking part were given clear understandings there would be a level playing field, that we would all be interviewed separately and that nobody would be given an overview in advance. What happened?  Mr. Mangan from Luas managed to strong arm his way into the proceedings.  He was the only person who was allowed to see the contents of the programme, to comment in most disparaging terms and to impugn the professional capacity of all those on this side of the argument.  I wonder what type of behaviour that is and what kind of a level playing field we have in terms of this debate.</P>
    <P>Another argument is that women are afraid of tunnels.  I have never heard such nonsense in my life.  That is plainly sexist.  Will the Minister suggest that because I am critical of Luas I am suffering from some kind of transport penis envy?</P>
    <P>The questions asked in the public relations campaign have been heavily and seriously angled. No person who knows anything about public relations and opinion polls could do other than to look at those and ask questions about the nature of the material placed before the public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> The Minister invoked the city of Hanover. Many cities are mentioned but people are careful not to tell us which cities also complement the light rail on-street by having an existing underground system, or have developed an underground system or have abandoned the proposals for LRT, such as the city of Glasgow in the past few months.  When Hanover is mentioned, they studiously avoid the Hannover Stadtbahn which includes an extensive underground network, but is otherwise at the lighter and of the definition of light rail.  It has an extremely successful history.  An article, &ldquo;25 Years of Light Rail Development&rdquo;, by Dr. Richard J. Buckley in <i>Light Rail Review</i> states:</P>
    <P>A particularly significant feature of the Hannover Stadtbahn has been the manner in which the convenience and accessibility of the trams has been retained.  Virtually no tramway stops have been lost, even when replaced by underground stations...Nowhere in the inner city is more than five minutes from an underground station.  And interchange is planned to take no longer than the changing trams...</P>
    <P>Environmentally, the Stadtbahn has certainly made possible a radical restructuring of the city centre, with extensive connected pedestrain zones and a free passage underneath the Hauptbahnhof.</P>
    <P>With regard to other environmental benefits, it is naturally the case that where trams have gone underground &mdash; and still more so where streets have been pedestrianised &mdash; the noise levels are much reduced.</P>
    <P>Commercially, the Stadtbahn has proved more economic to operate than the trams. Comparisons made in 1976 between Stadtbahn line A and former tram services show that although the Stadtbahn cost more to run, its higher earnings reduced the operating deficit by about 20 per cent.  On the expenditure side, the high-capacity cars require fewer drivers, so wage costs are reduced.</P>
    <P>This is a point made by former Taoiseach Dr. FitzGerald, a transport economist and world authority.  It is rubbished by those who have the cheek to impugn on RTÉ people such as Rudy Monaghan on the basis that they never designed and ran an underground railway.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about inaccuracies in what the Minister said.  I refer him and his experts to another article by Ian Yearsley called <i>Build Now, Pay Latter</i> which looks at the new generation of light railway systems.  It states they will face financial problems in the future.  For example, tram vehicles last for 30 years but the track only lasts for 15.  The means Sheffield is in with its light rail system should be examined.</P>
    <P>A negotiated sale to Mainline is the only way Supertram can be privatised, its chief executive Peter Sephton told its employees.  Trams were <Col N="405" /> carrying less than 6M passengers a year compared with a forecast of 22M.</P>
    <P>That places in context the Minister's bland assertions that he knows exactly how and why this system is going to work and wht it will cost.</P>
    <P>There is another article: <i>Light rail rejection signals need for Scots law change.</i> A parliamentary commission rejected a light rapid transport system for Glasgow.  A three month public inquiry took place last year at the end of which the commissioners rejected the proposal completely.  There is by no means a universality on these matters as the Minister claims.  Sheffield is a clear example of a system in crisis.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote two articles written by Dr. Garret FitzGerald in which he examines light rail and which have fundamental information for us. I apologise for reading but they are technical and, with the House's indulgence, I propose to put a certain amount on the record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first article on 28 October 1996, Dr. FitzGerald states:</P>
      <P>...even if one assumes that by 2011 commuter traffic will have been boosted by 20 per cent rather than 40 per cent, that would still increase the morning peak traffic inwards from Ranelagh on the Dundrum route in the year 2011 from the present forecast of 3,000 to 3,600.</P>
      <P>This alters the DTI's figures drastically.</P>
      <P>But the Dublin Transport Initiative traffic projections have also shown that the planned extension of the Luas from Dundrum to Cabinteely will increase the morning peak-hour traffic on this route by two-thirds, which would bring the morning peak-hour load in 2011 up to 6,000.</P>
      <P>Such a figure would be in line with experience with the DART.</P>
      <P>He then quotes about the DART.  The crucial paragraph in this section of the article is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus it would clearly be indefensible to build a Luas system incapable of handling comfortably 6,000-7,000 passengers in the peak hour; although, equally clearly, the initial <Col N="406" /> capacity of the vehicle fleet on a network starting at Dundrum rather than Cabinteely might not need to be more than about half this figure.</P>
    <P>It would be clearly indefensible to do what the Luas lobby is proposing.  It keeps shifting its ground.  Dr. FitzGerald points out that in January 1995, the CIE document about the Dublin LRT quoted:</P>
    <P>...&ldquo;200 passengers for each unit of rolling stock, nominally...in normal conditions of comfort...25-30 per cent of passengers seated, four passengers per square metre&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In response to criticism, they now say:</P>
    <P>...these 30-metre vehicles could carry more than 200 passengers, an outcome to be achieved by raising belatedly the standing room density from four per square metre to five per square metre.</P>
    <P>That is the concern for the comfort of passengers in Dublin.  It is also proposed:</P>
    <P>...to use larger 40-metre long vehicles, with a theoretical capacity of 317 passengers at the higher standing density of five people per square metre.  And the peak-hour capacity has been calculated on the assumption all services during that hour will carry 317 people.</P>
    <P>However, as Dr. FitzGerald points out that these traffic peaks are not &ldquo;like Table Mountain in South Africa&rdquo; but more like Mount Everest.  He demonstrates this by examining the DART:</P>
    <P>...when a census was carried out on the DART on November 25th last year, the busiest train from Howth carried 835 passengers (a figure, incidentally, well below the DART theoretical capacity of 1,000), but the average load during that hour was 617.</P>
    <P>He concludes the article by stating:</P>
    <P>For my part, I cannot see how this vision of Dublin is to be helped by building an inadequate LRT system, with a capacity deficit which will ultimately force many people to continue to drive into the city, thus impeding the realisation of the planners' vision.</P>
    <P>We all sympathise, as Dr. FitzGerald does, with the idea of having fewer cars and less congestion in the city, but the maintains, and I agree with him, that the commitment to an on-street option and the opposition to the consideration of an underground option has become some sort of mystical Holy Grail which has bedazzled the eyes of the Minister's advisers, if not the Minister although I hope he has not been.</P>
    <P>The second article examines the question of routing for the underground and light rail.  I wish to put on the record in summary some of what Dr. FitzGerald said.</P>
    <P>...a decision to place Luas in a tunnel under the city area would benefit Dublin because:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> 1.  Only in this way could the eventual demand be catered for;</P>
    <P>2.  It would liberate centre city streets that would be blocked by an on-street Luas, freeing them for pedestrians and other public transport;</P>
    <P>3.  Disruption during construction would be avoided;</P>
    <P>4.  The need to demolish dwellings in certain areas and to disrupt some businesses permanently would also be avoided;</P>
    <P>5.  Transit times would be halved in the case of Tallaght and reduced by a quarter in the case of Dundrum;</P>
    <P>6.  It would leave open the possibility of an LRT service being constructed to both Finglas/Ballymun and Blanchardstown at a later stage at low cost, by means of a 1 km tunnel from O'Connell Street to Broadstone, and then northwards along the abandoned rail track towards Liffey Junction;</P>
    <P>7.  The alternative of an LRT service capable of handling traffic to and from the airport would also be kept open.</P>
    <P>Dr. FitzGerald calls for certain things and I call clearly and explicitly for these to be considered by the public inquiry.</P>
    <P>1.  The gross under-estimation of the post-1991 growth of employment and car ownership in Dublin;</P>
    <P>2.  That the peak-hour load cannot be assumed to exceed more than 70 per cent of the load on the most densely packed individual peak service;</P>
    <P>3.  That the best, and probably the only, way of coping with the virtual doubling of demand as between a Dundrum-terminating line in the year 2001 and a Cabinteely-terminating line in the year 2011 is the coupling of vehicles &mdash; a procedure that is practicable only if a tunnel is used in city areas;</P>
    <P>The Minister's vision that women are terrified of tunnels suggests that they will only be populated by men.  Is this some kind of homosexual tunnel?</P>
    <P>4.  That a partly-tunnelled routing via Kimmage that would be 4 kms shorter would create an offsetting capital cost saving of £85 million, would reduce the overall journey time by 40 per cent, and would generate several million pounds of additional revenue;</P>
    <P>5.  That the net return on a tunnelled section in terms of operating profit per unit of capital expended seems likely to be similar to, or probably even to exceed, that of the existing on-street project.</P>
    <P>Against this background, I believe that it would be unwise of the Government to resist <Col N="408" /> the case for an independent review of the tunnel option.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Minister is engaged in the fable of &ldquo;The Emperor's New Clothes&rdquo;.  He has been sold a pup by the Luas lobby effectively and professionally.  Does he remember where they came in with their suit of clothes?  &ldquo;Good morning, my lord&rdquo;, said the weavers bowing low. &ldquo;Have you come to see the clothes?  Do you like the design?  Don't you think the colours are beautiful?  Look at this deep rose in the centre, that line of gold in the corner.  Do you think the emperor will be pleased?&rdquo;  The poor old emperor's chamberlain looked at the empty looms.  He could see nothing but he thought again &mdash; like the Minister.  When the emperor set out in his procession a little boy told him the truth. People like Dr. FitzGerald, myself and the unified proposal people were saying very clearly: &ldquo;Minister, you are in your pants and you are on your own&rdquo;.  At the end of the day there is no doubt that the light rail on-street Luas will create gridlock.  It will not be able to deal with the demands placed on it.  It will create business disruption and block off streets.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the beauty of Dublin and I agree with him.  Trinity College was invoked.  I taught there for 30 years.  It will not be enhanced by the on-street light rail.  I call for the Minister to repeat his commitment, to which he is bound, for a public inquiry in which these materials will be looked at exhaustively in terms of costing.  There is no doubt, in regard to the figures available to us in terms of the tunnel, for example, that they have quoted an inflated figure. This is demonstrable.  The port access tunnel which is one and a half times the diameter of the Luas tunnel comes in at less than the Luas people claim it will cost to build the tunnel for the light rail.</P>
    <P>Another chimera raised by the opponents of the underground rail system is that on-street traffic is safer.  This is absolute nonsense.  The on-street system will lead to between 40 per cent and 60 per cent more accidents; if I could find it among my papers I would quote extensively from <i>Cycle News,</i> the newsletter of the cycling community in these islands, which has published a major article on the dangers of the Sheffield tram and the number of accidents and fatalities that occurred in the last couple of months as a result of the on-street tram.</P>
    <P>I hope that, although I have been hard hitting, I have not been unfair in my remarks.  I would like to think that the other side will be fair, that we will be allowed our day in court, so to speak, to introduce for independent analysis and assessment the issues of costing and accessibility. We can answer all these questions.  I said to the Minister when we had meetings with him and his advisers &mdash;they reminded me of this last night &mdash; demonstrate in controvertibly to me that Luas was the best option for Dublin.  I would throw my weight behind it.  They have signally failed to do <Col N="409" /> so.  They have not answered any of the detailed material presented by people such as Garret FitzGerald and the unified proposal and it is time they did so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not quote statistics or quote from the classics.  It is significant that this debate was opened by a Tipperary man, responded to by a Longford-Westmeath man, and that a Cork man is now speaking on it.  This shows that Dublin is a very special place.  It is the capital city and as such the country has to do business with it.  It is a diabolical place in which to do business; Dublin is largely paralysed.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a direct connection between modes of transport and emotion which goes right back into history.  Some contributions would remind one of reading about the Indians and the train, or the iron horse as it was known.  It was said that it would do great damage and would never be successful.  The same happened when aircraft were being developed.  It was said they would never work either, yet air travel is recognised as one of the safest modes of travel.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned bus lanes.  They too were condemned.  If one was to go back to the debate on the DART one would read prophesies of multiple deaths on a weekly basis, particularly at the Merrion crossing.  It was said that the DART was a crazy notion.  None of this has come to pass, nor should we expect it to in this case.</P>
      <P>The expenditure of £10 million and probably a forest of trees in terms of written documentation has led to more debate, analyses and money that must be spent to avoid making a decision.  Seán Lemass used to say that he hoped this House would be peopled by representatives of the country, not by experts.  All the major projects in the world have been decided by lay people.  If necessary, they seek advice, whether about building bridges, creating major companies, roads or nuclear stations.  All the great engineering projects have been decided in the final analysis by lay people.  We are lay people.  The Minister is a lay person.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not have the luxury of doing nothing, nor has the Opposition.  Its only responsibility is to make a real and honest contribution to the debate.  I was disappointed with one aspect of Senator Norris's contribution. I thought 30 years in Trinity College would have trained him to take a broad view of the subject matter, whatever it may be.  In this case, Senator Norris decided to talk about light rail to the exclusion of all the other modes of transport contained in the DTI plan.  When we are talking about getting Dublin moving, which is essentially what this proposal is about, we have to look at all the ramifications, as the Minister said.  The contribution by my friend Senator Norris was flawed in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Luas is either part of an integrated package or it stands alone.  As a stand alone it would be wide open to the sort of criticism Senator Norris made, but it is not a stand alone project.  It is part of <Col N="410" /> an integrated prject in which all the parts are designed to make a contribution towards solving the problem.  It is right&mdash;I said this at the outset &mdash;that the Opposition should look, examine, discuss, debate and argue, but at the end of the day it has the responsibility to keep the debate in a reasonable context because the bottom line for this Government, or for any Government, is to ensure that the process of implementing a travel plan for Dublin goes ahead.  Of all the options that have been discussed, one is not available and my colleagues in Fianna Fáil will have to accept this.  The option of doing nothing is not available to this Government or to any future Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a speech on 16 September and used the phrase &ldquo;paralysis by analysis&rdquo;.  That is gridlock and anyone who travels to this House from any Dublin suburbs can sit in a car for an hour or an hour and a half, depending on the traffic.  That is gridlock in anyone's language.  The reality of the city, given its layout, is that if a truck breaks down on the quays there can be huge traffic delays for hours.  This is a dangerous place in which to live in many respects because a minor breakdown can close down substantial parts of the city.  There is no disagreement about the need for this project to be undertaken as swiftly as possibly.</P>
    <P>Any outside observer would say that the room given to analysis, debate, studies etc. and indeed the ongoing public discussion which has yet to be finalised, would lead one to believe that there is almost a conspiracy that nothing will ever happen.  Successive Administrations will pass it on because it is too hot to handle.  People talk about disruption.  Nobody pretends for a second that there will not be serious disruption for many people.  I am old enough to remember when one-way streets were introduced.  People said it would be the death knell for certain places and it was but it enabled the vast majority of places to prosper and thrive.</P>
    <P>Similar arguments were advanced about by-passes around towns and villages.  Many communities felt their areas would die but the opposite happened in most cases.  In some cases, businesses were badly affected but in the vast majority of cases they thrived.  As ever, there were those who wanted the old arrangements to continue because the issue was a hot potato.  Most of the by-passes in the early days were politically controversial.</P>
    <P>We have no option but to grasp this nettle.  The Minister was accused of favouring an option.  It would be a nonsense if the Minister whose responsibility it is to bring the project to fruition told us he had no idea what he wants, despite all the discussion and advice he received.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy and Senator Norris cited Garret FitzGerald as an icon, presumably because as a former Taoiseach and Leader of Fine Gael it must be embarrassing for the Minister to have Garret FitzGerald quoted at him.  That is nonsense.  As far as I know Charles Haughey may be delighted with Luas but he <Col N="411" /> keeps his counsel.  We condemned him in relation to the renovation of Government Buildings.  Who condemns him now?  Dr. FitzGerald was condemned over the refurbishment of Dublin Castle.  Charles Haughey was attacked over the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  I was at the opening of the canal which was performed by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste gave the former Taoiseach his due for his vision.  Many people criticised Mr. Haughey bitterly at the time for spending money on the project but it has changed the nature of relations between the North and the South.  The level of traffic on the canal in both directions has exceeded all expectations.  I spent six weeks of the summer in Enniskillen and am aware of the numbers using the canal.</P>
      <P>Every large engineering project will have its coterie of critics.  As Senator Hayes said, with regard to this project, experts are being thrown around like Scud missiles.  One can hire anybody to say anything; one can hire expert engineers and tunnelling experts who will tell one what one wants to know.  At some stage a lay person must weigh up the advice and make a decision.</P>
      <P>In this case the options and the necessary information have been put before the people. There are volumes of information available on the project and one can get all sorts of advice.  It really depends on the point of view you adopt.  If you want to have a go at the Government there will be an analysis to support your view.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, there is common cause that the Luas light rail project must go ahead.  However, as sure as night follows day some aspect of it will go wrong because that is the nature of things.  In some cases politicians are taking out an insurance policy so that if some elements do not go quite right they can say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;&mdash; it is a national pastime.  Shortly after the DART opened one of the trains broke down and the mainline trains had to stop unexpectedly at some of the DART stations.  A common response was &ldquo;This system will never work&rdquo;.  However, it is now a jewel in the crown for CIE.  Eventually, people will tell the Minister that he was lucky he got it right even though they were waiting for him to get it wrong.</P>
      <P>We must solve this problem rather than muddy the waters.  Experts have pronounced on the tunnel, monorail and light rail options and it is the Government's responsibility to pick the one most suited to the city.  The people have been consulted.  They have made their views known in an MRBI survey and are in favour of the light rail option by two to one.  In that respect, the democratic process has been utilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the world's major projects have been decided upon by lay people having received and judged advice in accordance with their responsibilities.  I have no doubt the Minister will <Col N="412" /> follow the same process.  I am confident that when the system is in place he will be proved to have been right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to be portrayed as a Luddite but in this case making no decision might be better than making the wrong one.  A major error is being made in this case.  I was stunned at the outset when the suggestion was made to resurrect the tramway system in the form of the Luas light rail system.  I do not mean to take a shot at the Minister because he inherited a process that had been in train for some time and experts in the State agencies involved had already started to take sides before the Minister took office.</P>
      <P>It is commendable that decisions are made rather than letting the paralysis of analysis take hold.  However, neither the underground alternative nor a pre-metro system have been given proper official evaluation.  There are fundamental flaws in the Luas proposals.  In ten years' time the Luas system will have created gridlock in Dublin.  The gridlock will have been contributed to by a variety of the city's characteristics and selfish Irish motorists.  In ten years' time we will have to undo the Luas system and consider an underground system.</P>
      <P>The primary political attraction of Luas is that it can be running relatively quickly.  The primary political disadvantage of tunnelling is that it is a longer term project and considerably more costly. It would be better to start an underground process, even if it meant constructing only short links, than to go ahead with the Luas project.</P>
      <P>There has not been a proper evaluation of the traffic implications of Luas.  It is unfair to criticise a system from the point of view of disruption during the construction phase.  If one installs a sewerage, gas or on-road rail system there will be associated disruption.  A large proportion of the major streets in Dublin will be disrupted because of Luas.  We do not have an external network of public transport around the city which encourages people to leave their cars at home. Further traffic chaos will be created in the city.</P>
      <P>Senator Magner suggested that we should not cite Garret FitzGerald and I seldom do so. However, for once it seems he is speaking with eminent good sense and is using his considerable statistical skills to analyse the traffic capacity of Luas.</P>

      <P>Dr. FitzGerald's figures may be right in this instance but nobody knows for certain and this is the nub of the issue.  An appropriate and sufficiently detailed analysis of the tunnelling option has not been published.  I have sympathy for the Minister because, on the one hand he has the urge to do something while, on the other, resources are available for this project and in house expertise is strongly committed to Luas.  The coming together of those three elements do not in themselves make an impelling case to go ahead with Luas as there has not been sufficient analysis of the traffic chaos that will inevitably occur.</P>
      <P>I have an objection to the Luas proposals on aesthetic grounds which has not been argued.  I do not want to see a Georgian city which has been devastated by improper development over the years further destroyed by strings of additional wires.  There were some trolley bus systems in this city which were extremely ugly.</P>
      <P>Senator Magner spoke of the chaos caused by a truck illegally parked on the quays.  A series of traffic jams will result from the Luas system operating in the busiest parts of this city.  A significant proportion of the main traffic arteries will be taken out of circulation at the busiest times of the day.  The trams will have to stop to disgorge passengers and take new ones on board. That does not make sense and there will be nothing but chaos.</P>

      <P>This city will not have a public transport network, even with Luas onstream, that will be sufficient for the suburbs.  A relatively narrow corridor in the city will be served by this upgraded public transport system and there will still be chaos in the western and south western suburbs and further afield.  People are commuting from Wicklow and I cannot see them leaving their cars behind.</P>
      <P>I refer to two characteristics of driving here that will cause chaos.  It is singularly difficult to come to a long term traffic solution because of the physical layout of the city.  That is not unique to Dublin and the same can be found in many continental cities.  We have uniquely selfish driving characteristics in this country and people will not abandon their cars for Luas.  It will mean abandoning them in an outlying area, getting on a tram and travelling on a more restrictive transport mode.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> The decision which needed to be made in Dublin was to go underground.  It is not just this Administration which will stand accused by the people of Dublin if the wrong decision is made on this occasion.  Every Administration has failed to do something about traffic management in this city.  The DART was a success and I argued strongly against the doom sayers, economists and people who argued that it was going to induce misery and traffic chaos.</P>

      <P>I am not arguing from a technical point of view but from that of a person who travels around this city.  There will be gridlock and we are being impelled to make the wrong decision.  My argument is that rather than compel ourselves to make the wrong decision all the questions on the tunnelling option should be answered.</P>
      <P>Serious public safety arguments are being made against street light rail systems.  They cause problems for cyclists and cause traffic gridlock. At a recent inquest on the death of a cyclist in Sheffield it was pointed out that the front wheel of his bicycle had been caught in the super tram lines.  He sustained head injuries and died.  The unfortunate man could have died because he went under a car or because some idiot threw a car door open but he died because of this system. The people who have argued that this system is above reproach in terms of public safety are being disingenuous.  It is no more above reproach than the tunnelling option.  The suggestion that Irish people are fearful of underground systems is patent and absolute nonsense.  Irish people are perfectly at home with the underground systems in London and New York or the Metro in Paris.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that there could be no proper or valid reason to blame him or to decry a decision to have a full and final analysis of the two options &mdash; tunnelling versus road.  This decision is an error, but I hope as the project goes ahead that it will be a success and that we will not be in a position in five or ten years' time to say we told him so.  I agree with Senator Magner that this is almost a national pastime and is usually engaged in by those who can never make a decision such as the curmudgeoning individuals who attacked the decision to upgrade Government Buildings or the facilities in this House.  People who are not capable of making decisions have the facility to sit on the fence and come off it with the benefit of hindsight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>My admonitions to the Minister are sincere.  I use the city streets extensively and have the flexibility of a private car.  I wish I could use public transport and the majority of commuters <Col N="415" /> in this city are in the same position.  With a burgeoning population and continuous suburban growth in areas which will never be touched by public transport, the Luas option is the wrong one.  It would make good sense to start on the underground option and continue with an ongoing scheme of improvements particularly in the western suburbs of the city over a 20 year period.  That will not satisfy anyone with short term political ideas but in the long term it will make more sense.  I wish the Minister and his experts well.  It is not easy to make a decision like this because the buck stops with the Minister.</P>
      <P>We need to examine the arguments that Luas will not create chaos on the streets on a long-term basis.  My fundamental difficulty with the project is that, while it has many other attractions not least of which is it is considerably cheaper than going underground and would be completed more quickly, it will continue to add to traffic chaos in the long term in a city which, because of its physical layout and the selfishness of motorists, is already in gridlock.  We will regret the decision to opt for Luas and not an underground route in ten or 15 years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) (No. 2) Bill last June, I expressed my reservations about the proposed Luas system for Dublin.  My concern was and, to some extent, still is that the laying of the Luas system would cause a certain amount of disruption which would affect the economic life of the city.  I also had serious reservations about the amount of road space which would be left to business motorists when the Luas system is in operation.</P>
      <P>I want to make a distinction between business motorists and commuters.  We cannot accept the number of commuters who are coming into the city between 6.30 a.m. and 9 a.m. and in the evening.  Provision must be made for the commuter who wants to come into the city after 10.30 a.m. to do business.  I do not accept Senator Roche's argument that commuters are not prepared, if there is a proper facility, whether it be light rail, DART or bus, to leave their cars and travel in comfort on public transport to work. They could read the newspaper or prepare for work in their own time.  The build-up on the roads in my locality begins at 6.45 a.m., it is not conducive to a good way of life and it is unnecessary.  There is a better way of life than to put such pressure on commuters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the general public wishes to do business in the city it is important that it has a choice between using public transport and private cars.  I accept that numerous studies of Dublin transport have been conducted over the past number of years but no action was taken.  In the meantime, Dublin Corporation, of which I am a member, has grappled with this problem.  We have done everything in our power to try to resolve the traffic problem in Dublin.  We created one-way <Col N="416" /> street systems, residential disk parking schemes and &ldquo;no parking&rdquo; zones but there is still tremendous traffic congestion.  I accept that if the process is allowed to continue, it will be a serious factor in the deterioration of the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>The starting point for the Dublin Transport Initiative was a review of the economic and social trends facing the city.  Population, employment, economic activity and car ownership were all examined.  The outcome of this analysis showed that car ownership would increase by 16 per cent by the year 2001 and by 60 per cent by the year 2011.  We can see in 1996 that these projections are accurate.  While the economy continues to grow, people become more prosperous.  More people are able to purchase cars as a result and we can see the huge increase in the number of cars on the roads this year.  An estimated 30,000 cars come into the city at peak times at present. By the year 2011, the number will have increased to 40,000.  Clearly, this volume of cars cannot be accommodated by the existing street network, especially between the canals.</P>
    <P>It is said that there will be gridlock while the Luas system is built.  We have gridlock already.  I experienced this for the first time last Friday week when my second eldest son graduated from DCU, Glasnevin, Dublin.  I brought him to Leinster House for lunch.  Afterwards, he wanted to return to DCU to meet his colleagues for a social evening.  It was a very wet evening.  We made every effort to take him across the city.  We tried every route known to us, including the toll-bridge, but Dublin was in gridlock and it will get worse.</P>
    <P>The strategy behind DTI is to provide an attractive public transport system so an alternative is available to motorists, and light rail is an important part of it.  We have argued for some time, as the Minister well knows, that this must be an integrated strategy and I am pleased that, according to the information which has now been supplied by DTI and the Dublin Transport Office, an integrated strategy is taking shape.</P>
    <P>A weakness in today's debate is that we are discussing Luas in isolation.  Unfortunately, the Minister's officials sold the Luas system in isolation initially but now we see it is an essential part of a package to deal with Dublin's traffic problems.  However, there are other aspects which are very important.  If these are put in place, Luas can be a success.</P>
    <P>One of Dublin's main traffic problems relates to the number of cars which pass through the city. It is estimated that 50 per cent of cars going north-south or <i>vice versa</i> traverse the centre city without doing any business there.  There is no facility for that kind of through traffic, it adds no value to the city and it has a detrimental effect.</P>
    <P>The elements of the DTI which deal with the problem must be given priority and the first aspect of that is the completion of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; ring-road motorway.  The northern route will be opened in December but the southern cross <Col N="417" /> route, which is the key factor in the completion of the motorway, is held up unfortunately by a case taken in the Supreme Court at present.  I hope this matter can be resolved and work on the southern route will commence in the near future.</P>
    <P>There has also been a tremendous increase in traffic to Dublin Port.  It is good to see that Dublin has a vibrant port because that leads to a vibrant economic city.  The port tunnel access is now a major aspect of the DTI and Dublin Corporation has put in place the procedure to amend the development plan.</P>
    <P>Other aspects create traffic in the city.  We know that traffic to schools when they reopen after the holidays can generate between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of traffic.  There are also problems with Dublin Corporation's cleaning department.  The trucks which clean the streets can be seen in the middle of the city during peak hours.  That is a matter which Dublin Corporation has tried to address but it must seek the approval of the unions to operate these trucks earlier.</P>
    <P>In order to reduce morning and evening commuter traffic in the city it is important to provide quality public transport and the light rail system will play an important part in this. However, many areas of the city will not be served by that system and I am pleased to note that a substantial number of quality bus corridors will now be put in place.  It is important that these bus lanes are monitored properly to ensure motorists do not park on them.  If they do, we are back to where we started.</P>
    <P>It is essential that a director of traffic for Dublin be appointed as soon as possible, and the enforcement functions of the Garda in this regard be transferred to Dublin Corporation.  There must be the immediate introduction of cost effective traffic violation systems, improved tow away and wheel clamping systems and streamlined traffic fines.  Enforcement, which has left something to be desired in the past, is one of the most important aspects of traffic movement in the city.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the DTI package relates to the provision of facilities for cyclists.  An increasing number of people cycle to and from work and, at peak times, 3,000 cyclists cross the canals.  Cycle lanes are being made available and proposals for a new lane are before Dublin Corporation at present.  It is hoped that, when a number of cycle ways are put in place, the numbers of people cycling to and from work will increase from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the DTI proposal for traffic in the city involves environmental traffic management.  The development of a network of environmental traffic cells is a key component of this strategy.  It is a concept through which traffic will be excluded from the city centre area.  It is vital for the conversion of the city centre from a car and heavy goods vehicle dominated area to a vibrant pedestrian, cyclist and public transport friendly environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> The first of these traffic cells was agreed by the traffic sub-committee at its meeting on 21 October.  The Portobello cell is the first of six which will be put in place in Dublin.  This cell was selected as a pilot scheme for implementation during the current year and it will be completed next year.  The study area is bounded by the Grand Canal on the southside, the South Circular Road on the northside and to the west by Clanbrassil Street and South Richmond Street. This area is predominantly residential in character but it also used for educational, commercial and light industrial purposes.  The Jewish museum and the George Bernard Shaw House, which are of interest to tourists, are sited in this area and there are a number of restaurants situated on the canal.  The first phase will be completed this year.</P>
    <P>The purpose of environmental traffic cells is to reduce rat running and the volume and speed of traffic, enhance additional facilities for pedestrians, cyclists and mobility impaired and disabled people.  They are also aimed at improving safety for all road users, reduce air and noise pollution and enhance the visual environment through landscaping, etc.  When the six cells are completed, many of the rat runs used by people travelling through Dublin will no longer be available.  This will improve the environmental aspects of the areas in which they are placed.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other aspects of the DTI package which I cannot mention in the time available.  When they are put in place, however, the light rail system will play a very important part.  However, it will not succeed on its own. Only when the other measures are put in place will we be able to comprehensively deal with the traffic problem in Dublin.</P>
    <P>When I was first elected to Dublin Corporation, traffic was very low on the agenda. However, it is now the first item to be dealt with at every meeting.  Traffic problems are also a major issue at the meetings of residents' associations I attend.  People want the traffic problem in Dublin resolved.  The city should be like any of its European counterparts and people must be able to shop and carry out their business in comfort.  I have a vision of Dublin as civilised and vibrant a place where people live, work, relax and enjoy themselves and a city that is accessible to everyone.  When the light rail system and the other measures proposed by the DTI are put in place.  I hope we will witness the birth of such a city.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister and I am glad he has devoted his time and attention to this debate.  I <Col N="419" /> am very disappointed with the way the debate on the light rail system for Dublin has progressed since it was last discussed in this House.  At that time, the light rail legislation was passing through the House and I convinced myself that the Minister and his Department were listening to what was said.  There were expressions of regret that the consultation process was inadequate and there were assurances that our concerns would be addressed on a rational basis.  The message we received was that the Department had seen the error of its ways and that the debate would be carried on in a reasonable manner which took full account of the general reservations expressed by Members.</P>
    <P>What occurred during the past number of months has been the reverse of what we had been led to expect at that time.  I feel disappointed and betrayed.  It almost seems the Department formed the view that, following the passage of the legislation, it is not obliged to care about the people's thinking on this issue.  As a result, not only was there a return to the previous arrogant approach and a refusal to listen to any contrary views but there was an intensification of the attitudes about which we had cause to complain.</P>
    <P>During the summer, there was a repeated and systematic rubbishing of views which dared to question any aspect of the Luas proposal. Reasoned argument has been met with abuse, a reiteration of the assertions that have long since been shown to be wrong and systematic misrepresentation of the case being put forward by the questioner.  In the world of business, when they put forward investment projects, people expect to be questioned closely and they have their answers ready.  Those answers consist of facts which can be substantiated.  If the proposer of a project responded to every question not with facts or reasoned arguments but with systematic abuse of the questioners, the investment proposals would receive short shrift.</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald, has invested a great deal of time in researching this issue and he has convincingly shown that many of the premises on which the Luas argument is founded have no basis whatsoever.  Dr. FitzGerald may be right, or wrong.  I will not be convinced that he is wrong by someone who pours abuse on his beliefs nor by someone who reiterates the very propositions that Dr. FitzGerald has painstakingly shown to be rubbish as some kind of mystical mantra.</P>
    <P>Every week, with increasing urgency, we are informed that time is running out.  During his contribution, the Minister used similar expressions.  We are informed that anyone who questions Luas in its present form is delaying the solution to Dublin's horrific traffic problems, perhaps forever.  This is a specious argument.  It makes no sense to state that we must do anything. If we could be certain that Luas could do some good or could, at least, do no harm, we would be wrong to question it.  However, because there is a <Col N="420" /> real possibility that Luas will make traffic congestion considerably worse, we have a responsibility to question it every step of the way. The real issue is not making a decision between the underground or overground options but whether the proposal, in its present form, will make matters worse.  That is the nightmare scenario that the Department and the Luas team steadfastly refuse to consider.</P>
    <P>One thing has emerged during the summer. Those of us who questioned the wisdom of the present plans argued that the amount of street space occupied by the trams will considerably reduce the space available for cars and bicycles.  Over the summer, with their guard let down, the proposers of Luas have come clean on this.  Far from denying the charges, they now admit that this is precisely what they are trying to do.  Their dream is to squeeze cars off the streets of Dublin.  They want to make congestion so bad that people will, in desperation, use public transport.  That is the shabby little strategy that is now revealed for everyone to see.</P>
    <P>Now that the proposition is out in the open we can see how utterly foolish is that strategy.  The number of people who would switch to Luas is very limited.  As Dr. FitzGerald has pointed out, the total capacity of Luas is very small in relation to the total likely level of demand.  Luas simply could not take all that traffic, even if people wanted to use it.  What we will do, if we proceed on this route, is systematically and expensively guarantee day long, permanent gridlock across the city.  No matter what the Minister says to the contrary, that is what Luas will bring.</P>
    <P>Is it too late for common sense to prevail?  I hope not.  Realistically the only hope left is the statutory inquiry.  If that is conducted properly the shallowness of the Luas arguments will be conclusively revealed.  That is why the inquiry must be genuinely independent and carried out by an inspector in whom the public can have absolute trust.</P>
    <P>The recent study into the tunnelling option is an example of what must be avoided.  Consultants were employed to look into something on which a position had already been taken.  Some of these consultants were part of the team committed to pushing the Luas proposals.  That approach has no credibility and, therefore, their conclusions have no credibility either.</P>
    <P>The study into the Ballymun line is equally questionable.  For five months the Department haggled with Brussels over the terms of reference and would not let go until those terms were defined in a way which prejudiced the outcome. Even then the grudging nod of approval for the Dundrum option was accompanied by a public rapping on the knuckles by Brussels.  The crunch will come with the public inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Minister now has a grave obligation and I know he will give serious consideration to it.  In view of the quasi-judicial role set out under the legislation he must appoint an inspector whose impartiality is beyond question.  That person <Col N="421" /> must be open to reviewing this entire issue from scratch, without prejudice or from an entrenched position.  My hope is that, for the first time in the sorry history of this project, common sense will prevail at that inquiry.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, traffic congestion gets worse by the day.  We are entitled to ask what else is being done apart from pursuing this questionable Luas proposal.  Is there any evidence that measures which could alleviate matters are being implemented or even considered?  We cannot wait for Luas.  To judge from what I see in the streets I fear that nothing else is being done.  I wonder how much worse the congestion must become before people say enough is enough.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the debate and the Minister's speech.  I was delighted that he spoke about the environment but I have a number of concerns on that issue.  Can we accept that a 40 metre long vehicle will help the environment? Have we really made provisions for bicycles, particularly in the inner city area?  I would like to be reassured on that.  I was delighted the Minister said that the refusal to build an underground section was not a question of cost because I hope we will keep that option open.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hayes that the main issue is to build what is best for the people of Dublin. I have a huge fear of the gridlock that Senator Doyle spoke about.  We are not at the end of this road yet.  Much of the plan is worthwhile, particularly the bus corridors.  However, there is a lack of foresight in the overall plan and the city will be doomed to gridlock.  Let me leave the Minister with this Latin phrase <i>obesa non cantava</i>&mdash; the fat lady has not sung yet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>While the merits of the light rail bringing people from the suburbs are obvious, as someone who lives in the city centre, I support Senator Quinn in his concerns about whether this plan will actually make things worse.  A great deal of the plan is concerned with making the traffic situation so impossible that motorists will not travel into the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hate to say this in the presence of Senator Doyle who is a distinguished member of Dublin Corporation, but little effort has been made on two measures which could improve the traffic problem, the first of which is facilities for walking and cycling.  The corporation is to be praised for eventually doing something about the footpaths so one can walk with more comfort.  I walk to the Seanad and to one of my places of work and it is possible to walk around the city if the footpaths and traffic management are improved.  Senator Doyle is grossly optimistic about the ease with which one can cycle around the city and the amount of work done to improve such facilities. It is almost impossible and appallingly dangerous to do so at the moment.  Would it not have been wiser when widening footpaths in the city centre to have installed cycle lanes?  If one wants to cycle to one's place of work in the city centre one must <Col N="422" /> be separated from the traffic in the interests of safety.  This is not the case at the moment.</P>
    <P>The integrated approach of buses and the light rail is to be praised, however, a further extension of the bus lanes would be welcome.  It has already been pointed out that the light rail will compete with cars, so how much more competition will there be between buses and the light rail?</P>
    <P>Senator Roche is correct to mention city centre aesthetics.  I hope that option will be re-examined in view of the fact that the tunnelling need not be of such great length.  For example, the system in Helsinki contains only five kilometres of underground track which makes an enormous difference to the aesthetics of the inner city. Similarly, in Stockholm only nine kilometres of track are underground.  The problem with the tunnelling option is not insurmountable.</P>
    <P>Gridlock in the city could be prevented if the traffic regulations were enforced.  The Minister should be told that someone is parking a Mercedes on double yellow lines outside his office.  One of the staff should tell the driver to move it because I am sure the Minister does not want it there.  I live on that side of the road and have noticed it.  The traffic regulations should be enforced.  On Baggot Street one frequently sees an articulated truck double parked in order to deliver trays of yoghurt.  I have not witnessed such sights in any other European city but they are common here.  Buses cannot pull in because everyone thinks it is perfectly legal to park at a bus stop.  If one puts on flashing hazard lights, one can park anywhere &mdash; that must be part of this city's traffic code because I have seen it happen often but I cannot find it in the regulations.</P>
    <P>Clamps should be put on cars that are parked illegally.  There should also be more tow trucks. A £100 fine sharpens one's wits greatly.  I went to the fines office with a friend who parked on double yellow lines around the corner from the Minister's office.  If such fines were regularly imposed, the tow trucks would be paid for in no time.</P>
    <P>We can do an enormous amount to prevent gridlock in the city.  However, we are throwing that word around rather a lot &mdash; someone told me about being stuck in gridlock in Mallow.  I thought gridlock only happened in places such as New York but apparently it is now so bad in Ireland that it occurs in every small town.  The traffic laws should be enforced and we should see what we can do with our pedestrian, bicycle and bus transport systems before embarking on this enormous plan, which will have a huge impact on the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that more of our country cousins are not here for the debate on traffic in Dublin.  Those of us currently in the House experience this traffic on a daily or twice daily basis.  I either use my car to come into town and then walk or I use the DART, which is recognised as a good system, and I know the problems that exist and which grow worse on a <Col N="423" /> daily basis.  If we do not address them we will have ongoing difficulties in a couple of years and into the next century.  If we do not get the planning right and explore all the possibilities, we will have mayhem.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker mentioned the importance of enforcing traffic laws.  There should be a specific corps to enforce the regulations.  At present, the standard procedure is to park one's car and put on flashing hazard lights if one is, for example, leaving something in to be dry cleaned or buying something in a shop.  Skips are sometimes left in bus lanes and this adds to the traffic problem.  The Minister should consult with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to ensure that the rules are enforced.  I agree with Senator Henry that there is no quicker way to focus the mind than having to get a taxi to collect one's car from the pound.  If more people had that experience, the traffic would move more easily around the city.</P>
      <P>The alternatives to driving one's car are not good enough at present.  There are &ldquo;Nitelink&rdquo; buses and other services but the taxi service is not sufficient.  I went home last night at quite an early hour, 12.20 a.m.  I was waiting at a taxi rank in Abbey Street along with 40 other people but not one taxi was there.  My colleague, Senator Doyle, has been dealing with this at city council level.</P>

      <P>A debate on light rail is useful.  We can examine where the lines are going and what must be done.  Presentational mistakes have been made and many self-styled experts have emerged in the discussion on traffic management.  Do some of these drive their own cars?  They lecture the Minister, his officials and the organisations; are the same people able to listen?  Senator Doyle and other Members who attend the races will know the phrase &ldquo;horses for courses&rdquo;.  Some of these so-called traffic management experts have not stuck to their own course.  Not only do they wander or switch from flat racing on turf to all-weather racing, they try to jump fences at Aintree.</P>

      <P>These experts should be called to account and made to inform themselves better on these matters.  Did they speak to the Minister or his officials before giving their lectures?  The Department is always available to listen.  Perhaps some of the misinformation can be blamed on the Department but we should learn from the mistakes and go forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> Whatever plans we have for light rail should be dealt with thoroughly.  There are lines for the northside, Dundrum and the southside.  People were misguided in the past and took the short term measure.  My colleague, Senator Ormonde, knows how her constituents are affected by not having the full facilities they want.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can give a positive reply about a link-up with the DART.  There are difficulties with the parking facilities and feeder bus services at DART stations.  Often the bus leaves just as the DART arrives or <i>vice versa.</i> This service should be planned better and there should be a link between the DART, mainline rail stations and light rail.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate.  Senator Quinn made a contribution, based on his experience of business travel, which showed that lessons can be learned. There are problems with the underground system.  In an ideal world we might go for that but cost and other factors are involved.  We must sort out the problem and be better informed.  We need fewer experts and more reasoned discussion of the matters to find the best way forward.  This debate has been useful even though it is Dublin oriented.  I am sure the Acting Chairman, Senator Finneran, can travel swiftly from his own part of the country as far as the M50 but it takes a long time to cover the last few miles into Dublin.</P>

This also applies to Members arriving in Dublin at Heuston Station.  I hope the Minister will take on board the various comments that have been made.  His Department does not have all the answers and neither do Members of the House but they are giving practical advice from their own experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder why we use names such as Luas and DART.  Luas, of course, means speed and the exercise is to seek a way to get from A to B quickly but where do we start?  An integrated bus and rail system connecting with the DART has been rejected but the underground option is still being discussed for the city centre area.  The situation is so confused that there seems to be no answer, yet with all the expertise there must be a short term solution to alleviate Dublin's chaotic traffic problems.</P>
      <P>To go from my area in the Dublin South constituency, including Rathfarnham and Knocklyon, into the city centre takes two hours on any weekday.  To make a 9 o'clock appointment one must leave the house at 6.45 a.m.  It does not add up.  We are locked into a terrible position which is near breaking point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every day constituents and professional colleagues of mine raise the matter with me but I do not know where to start talking about the <Col N="425" /> subject.  We are going around in circles.  We cannot halt progress or stop building houses, yet we do not have the right transport infrastructure for a densely populated urban area.  The case involving the southern cross route has been locked in the High Court for the last ten years and the northern ring will open in a couple of weeks.  When the latter route comes onstream one can imagine the volume of traffic coming off the M50 into the southside of Dublin.  As it joins the existing suburban traffic a bottleneck will be created with cars entering the city crawling to a halt.  The matter has reached an all time low.</P>
    <P>We are seeking short term answers.  Land is available, for example, the Harcourt Street line.  I do not have any hang-up about saying that a mistake may have been made in the past concerning that line but we are now ready to look at it again.  Even if a mistake was made then, it is not a mistake to re-examine this discused railway. Why can it not be used in the short term to absorb some traffic coming from the Dundrum pocket?</P>
    <P>Last week it took only 20 minutes for people living in Knocklyon to drive to work in Dublin because of the mid-term school break.  If we provided a proper school bus service catering for every road in the area it would encourage people to keep their cars at home.  In many of the more mature areas, young graduates now have their first cars.  They are still living at home with their parents so one finds families with two, three or even four cars in the driveway.  In many built up areas houses are being rented out to graduates and young workers so five or six cars can be parked outside.  This adds to traffic congestion every morning.</P>
    <P>We cannot reach any conclusion on the merits of a light rail, underground or integrated system because we do not know the answer and neither does the Minister.  The matter is still up in the air and the Minister is as unsure about it as the rest of us.  We do not have it right yet because we are in an assessment phase.  When one questions traffic management people from the Dublin Transport Authority on a one to one basis they become unstruck in their thinking about whether or not the light rail or underground systems will work.  Different research throws up different results.</P>
    <P>We need a proper bus service to alleviate congestion.  The Departments of Education and Transport, Energy and Communications should get together to see how best we can run a school bus system that might help parents who drive their children to school.  There is a lesson to be learned because, as I said earlier, traffic from Knocklyon to Dublin flowed more swiftly when schools were closed last week for the mid-term break.  We will not be able to answer this question for the next four or five years but the short term answer is to discuss with residents' associations and local authorities how best a local transport system can be integrated for the benefit of each area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> We have failed to develop the infrastructure for an integrated bus service through Dublin's suburbs.  We must regenerate bus services in urban areas.  If you complain that buses only come every 45 minutes you will get a reply six months later to say the matter is being investigated.  I am not a negative person by nature and I think positively about how best we can find a way forward in the short term.  Luas is a long way down the road.  The underground option is still being considered.  I do not know where it will all end but we have a huge problem on our hands. It is frustrating.  Unless we get this right it will affect everybody.  With an election next year we must say how we can best answer this question. The infrastructure is failing and we cannot allow development.  We are preventing jobs being created because houses cannot be built.  There are no roads to service them and where there are roads there are no proper services.</P>
    <P>In the first instance there must be an integrated approach between the DART and the bus service.  The Department should also liaise with the Department of Education to see if a bus service to transport pupils can be provided.  A proper bus service will encourage people to leave their cars at home and that might help alleviate the problem in the short term.  However, the bigger project will come on stream but that will be far in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their constructive contributions which will be taken into account.  The divergence of views is an indication of the difficult task we confront.  They have ranged from doing nothing to providing on-street rail lines to providing an underground rail system.  Other suggestions were valuable but they are already in the public domain and are included in our implementation plans under DTI.</P>
      <P>It is worth recalling how fickle has been the public debate on light rail.  Before the DTI study was carried out light rail was touted as the answer to all our transport problems.  Prominent people, a number of whom have since changed their minds, suggested that the solution to Dublin's transport problem rested solely in light rail.  The DTI in the course of its detailed analysis and assessment of Dublin's transport problem looked at all investment and policy options and objectively concluded that on-street light rail should form an important element of the transport strategy.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand and find it difficult to accept why the DTI strategy is now being strongly rejected by people who were actively involved with the DTI.  I have no difficulty accepting suggestions when the people who make them mean what they say and are anxious to make a positive contribution to the debate.  However, I will not countenance the political hypocrisy I have witnessed in the past six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The DTI was established by the former Minister for the Environment, Pádraig Flynn, and <Col N="427" /> was overseen by successive Fianna Fáil Ministers. Is Fianna Fáil rejecting the recommendations of the body set up by that party's Minister?  The DTI carried out the most in-depth study ever undertaken in the history of transport in Dublin. There were inputs from various groups, including every relevant Department, the local councils in the greater Dublin area, CIE, the National Safety Council, University College Dublin, Aer Rianta, the Garda Síochána, student organisations, business associations in Dublin, national transport, the Council for the Status of Women, the Port and Docks Board, the Town Planning Institute and automobile clubs.  They commissioned various studies and made a valuable contribution to the DTI process.</P>
    <P>Arising from that process the DTI brought forward proposals, one of which was an on-street light rail system.  I agree with Senator Doyle that there has been too much emphasis on light rail. Light rail in isolation will not solve Dublin's traffic problems.  It is one element of an integrated plan which involves the provision of additional quality bus corridors, the extension of DART, provision of park and ride facilities and integrated ticketing and interchange facilities.  I agree with Senator Cosgrave that integration of facilities and the access people will have to other modes of transport from light rail is extremely important and they are included in the strategy.</P>
    <P>Better traffic management and enforcement are major elements of the strategy.  I accept Senator Henry's prompt and have already discussed the matter with my driver.  I told him not to park the car outside that door again and I am happy to inform the House that he is making alternative arrangements.  There is also a suggestion that we appoint a director of traffic. We are making arrangements to establish that position.  The other elements of the DTI plan are the &ldquo;C&rdquo; ring-road and the port tunnel. Approximately 18 important initiatives in the DTI package are agreed.  We must ensure that the package is looked at in full rather than isolate the light rail proposal from it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the inspectorate and the consultative process, I made it clear to the project team that it must take into account the views and legitimate concerns of local communities about this project.  On numerous occasions I have emphasised that the project can only be successfully implemented with the full cooperation and support of local communities.  It must be a partnership approach.  I have received feedback about the consultative process and, after a bad start, the comments from local communities have been exceptionally good.</P>
    <P>The project team has been meeting local people, organisations and business interests and explaining what is proposed.  I am confident that when I receive the final draft order from the CIE project team it will reflect the views of local communities and that there will be many alterations to the preferred technical routes of the <Col N="428" /> project team which are in the public domain.  I expect nothing less and local communities are entitled to nothing less.  I have met many interest groups and public representatives in the context of consultation and I have been available at all times to give the information that is available to me.</P>
    <P>I accept I am no expert on the traffic problems of Dublin.  I must take into account the professional technical advice I am given.  That advice is given by the DTI which, after detailed analysis, suggested an on-street light rail system. There is also the Semaly report.  I reject the criticism levelled at CIE.  The suggestion is that because CIE commissioned an independent study it is no longer independent.</P>
    <P>Semaly has been involved in many projects around the world which include light rail systems. They are acknowledged experts in the area.  They have stated that Dublin should have an on-street light rail system as it is appropriate to our needs. They are not strangers to tunnel systems.  The Semaly group of consultants has recommended tunnelling systems in many other cities where they were asked to prepare reports.  They were involved in the construction of 5,000 kilometres of tunnels in various parts of the world.  Semaly does not have a bias against tunnels; they looked at Dublin's requirements and decided in favour of the on-street light rail system.  They are professional, qualified people with expertise in this area.  They will not sign a report that is not factual or properly assessed and evaluated. Semaly and DTI are clearly in favour of the light rail system.</P>
    <P>The real debate is about our vision for the future of Dublin.  Do we want to reclaim the streets for the citizens of Dublin or do we want to abandon them forever to the domination of the private car?  I make no apology for saying that the dominance of the car must cease.  The city of Dublin is unable to cope with the existing number of cars, even without taking the projected growth into account.  It is not possible to keep expanding the infrastructure to meet that requirement.  The car will continue to have a place but it must be put in perspective.  The other modes of transport which must be accommodated in Dublin city should be taken into account.  The DTI philosophy, endorsed by citizens of Dublin through public consultation, is based on that fact. It foresees a living and vibrant city centre.  On-street light rail is an essential part of that vision. The only way we can get people out of their cars and onto public transport is if we offer them an attractive alternative, which the Luas project is. It will be reliable, efficient, frequent, environmentally friendly and safe.</P>
    <P>The light rail system has been implemented in approximately 500 cities around the world.  I think Senator Norris mentioned Sheffield. Initially, the Sheffield experience was a bad one as the implementation of the system was not carefully managed.  Strasbourg, Grenoble, Nantes and many other cities throughout the world have <Col N="429" /> successfully implemented efficient light rail systems which have been of enormous benefit to people in those cities, particularly in alleviating traffic congestion.  Dublin is not different from any other city.  There are problems peculiar to Dublin in terms of the construction of light rail, but all of those will be taken into account.  A project team will manage the construction of it. Their job will be to minimise the level of disruption and inconvenience.</P>
    <P>I have heard the argument that if we go underground, this disruption will not take place. The reality is that an underground system will cause more disruption.  People think that a hole can be opened at the top of O'Connell Street, the city centre can be tunnelled under and nobody will know work is being done.  The reality is that the cap of O'Connell Street must come off to allow the services to be put underneath and to allow the attachment of the rail system to electrical appliances.</P>
    <P>There will be disruption, irrespective of whether it is under or over ground.  It is our job and that of the planners and the project team to ensure the system is carefully managed and that there is consultation with interest groups, residents and local business interests.  We can then implement the scheme with the minimum of disruption to daily activity in the city.</P>
    <P>The public consultation process is under way and is nearing conclusion.  I believe it has been successful and we have learned much from it. When the final order from the CIE project team arrives, it will reflect the genuine concerns put forward during the process.  The next phase is the independent public inquiry.  I assure Senator Quinn and Senator Norris that this will be genuinely independent.  All interest groups and any person who feels they have a contribution to make can put forward their case and be heard by the inspectorate, which will be totally independent of my Department.  In appointing an inspectorate, I will consult with An Bord Pleanála.  I am adamant that all of the powers necessary for the inspectorate to do his or her job will be made available.  This will ensure that the report from the inspectorate will be independent, objective and will take on board many of the legitimate objections already raised at the public consultation stage.</P>
    <P>The inspectorate, taking due consideration of all the views during the public inquiry, will make recommendations to me, which I intend to observe.  It is not a question of the Government or me imposing our view.  We have clearly established our priorities.  It is up to anyone who disagrees with those to go before the public inquiry and make their case.  I have provided a vast amount of detailed information arising from the research and analyses of the transportation problems in Dublin, particularly the light rail system.  We have put that in the public domain and I look forward to those who have other <Col N="430" /> suggestions and proposals bringing them before the public inquiry.  More importantly, I look forward to them substantiating some of the arguments they have already put forward with the necessary detail to allow the inspector to make an accurate assessment of the pros and cons of their proposals.</P>
    <P>Sufficient studies have been carried out.  We had an underground study 20 years ago which did not achieve anything.  DTI recommended on-street light rail as the preferred approach.  We must move to the next phase, which is the public inquiry.  Arising from that, I am confident that when people who are genuine in their approach to resolving the problems of massive congestion on our streets have put forward their views and the inspectorate reports to me, they will find that the procedure has been fully complied with, openly and fairly, and that all concerns and views have been taken into account.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their interest in this matter.  We have had a number of constructive and useful debates.  It is not fair to say we are not listening.  This can only be judged when the final order from the CIE project team arrives and when I sign a light rail order.  When I do that it will reflect the genuine views and concerns which have been conveyed directly to me as Minister, to the project team through the public consultation exercise and through contributions made in the media and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As Minister, I must make an informed decision. I welcome the fact that many people have made valuable contributions to this debate, although I do not agree with their arguments in some instances.  I am entitled to convey that view through the media, based on the technical advice and the knowledge available to me from the Department.  Those with opposing views are entitled to put them forward.  I look forward to the public inquiry stage where some of these sincerely held views which have been argued vociferously must be substantiated by real, hard facts and professional advice.  If they are, the inspectorate will have to make a decision as to whether the advice and technical expertise that was available to me was correct.  I am happy to abide by the inspectorate's report arising from the public inquiry.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to make this urgent case on behalf of Universal Dehydrates Limited in Midleton, County Cork.  Some 50 jobs will be lost and the farmers growing peas for green harvesting will also lose out unless something is done.  The workers are making a plea to the company management.  I am advised that management will not reverse any decision it makes.  Some 165 farmers are in danger of not having their contract with the company renewed in 1997, following the company's decision to transfer production to France unless green harvesting peas are included in the scheme.</P>
      <P>There are 150 jobs at the Universal Dehydrates plant and 50 will be lost because area aid is not paid to farmers growing peas for green harvesting while farmers growing peas for dry harvesting are included in the scheme.  I am also told that dry harvested peas are used for animal feeds.  Pea growing in the Midleton area and previously in Mallow is vitally important to the economy of the area.  It is incredible that area aid is available for animal feed but not for food destined for human consumption.  It is unfortunate that this anomaly was not pursued earlier.  It seems it was included in the programme for a short time, but an objection lodged by the UK meant it was excluded.  I am advised by management that it has drawn up a plan for FEOGA investment with the backing of IDA Ireland.</P>
      <P>Universal Dehydrates supplies 45 per cent of the home market while 55 per cent is imported. Why is there a restriction on the export market which started when the factory was owned by East Cork Foods?  When the food section was set up by Erin Foods and East Cork Foods, which was a subsidiary of the Sugar Company, a restriction was imposed on the company to serve either the home market or the export market. This must be examined.</P>
      <P>The management has been involved in consultations to try to get the Minister's backing for the plan it has drawn up for FEOGA investment with the backing of IDA Ireland.  This is vitally important to develop the industry and retain the 150 jobs there.  I appeal to the Minister to support the application.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Sherlock for raising this important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="432" /> Area aid under the EU support system for arable crops is confined, in the case of peas, to those which are harvested in a dry state.  Vining peas, which are harvested at a green stage and subjected to air or freeze drying, are not eligible for area aid.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has already raised this matter with Commissioner Fischler with a view to having vining peas included in the area aid system.  The Commissioner explained in a detailed and comprehensive written response the reasons this was not possible.  These were that as vining peas had never been covered by a previous support régime, payment of compensatory aid under CAP reform was not justified as was the case with cereals and other eligible arable crops for which previous price supports were either reduced or abolished; the inclusion of vining peas in the arable support system would create distortions in the market and had been opposed by producers in the major production regions of the EU; and the introduction of an end use obligation, such as dehydration, would jeopardise the protected status of arable area payments under the GATT agreement.</P>
    <P>The Minister would have to point out that the exclusion of vining peas from area aid was not the main or even a significant factor leading to the decision by Universal Dehydrates Limited to discontinue the air dried operation.  This decision was taken for commercial reasons since this part of the business has never been profitable in Ireland.  The company has stated that 50 jobs will be affected but it is hoped that many of these will be saved.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that the freeze dried frozen division, which provide direct employment for up to 115 people in Ireland, continues to be profitable and has real potential for expansion.  The Department and Forbairt remain at the disposal of the company to discuss its plans with a view to possible assistance.  I assure the Senator that his points will be brought to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>That part of the business was never profitable because one sector got area aid grants while the company had to pay an equivalent amount to the growers.  This increased the price the company usually paid.  I thank the Minister for the commitment to follow up the submission made by the company.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me the opportunity to call on the Minister for Justice to create a mounted Garda unit for Dublin as a publicly acceptable and cost effective way of upgrading Garda presence in the city centre and at major events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should use technology to do a better job. The great advantage of technology is that it allows people to extend their reach.  This is <Col N="433" /> particularly true in terms of serving people in businesses such as my own or in services such as those provided by the Garda Síochána.  It has invested heavily in technology, such as sophisticated radio and telecommunications systems and computers.  This technology extends the reach of the men and women who work in the Garda Síochána.  It makes it possible for them to do more than ever before.  We must remind ourselves that technology is not only about microchips or about making multi-million pound investments.  Sometimes it can be used in a homely way and at modest expense.  The technology I talk about is mounted gardaí.  We do not regard horses as coming under the heading of technology but that is how we should look at it when we think of mounted police.  It is a technology used to great effect in many countries and I suggest we should adopt it here.</P>
    <P>On a horse a garda can do things he or she could not do otherwise.  They can see and be seen much better.  Some police forces reckon that a mounted policeman, in terms of creating a useful, visible presence, is equal to six policemen on foot.  A garda is more mobile on a horse.  He can move much faster than he could ever run and can go places a car cannot.  Mounted police have a potentially valuable role in patrolling city centre areas, particularly pedestrianised areas at night. Their usefulness in crowd control at demonstrations or sporting events is also well known.  Mounted police are not a colourful relic of bygone days, colourful though they are, but a part of modern policing methods.</P>
    <P>This is not a new idea.  I was reminded of it in Vienna three weeks ago.  Mounted police were to be seen on the streets of the city at 3 o'clock in the afternoon of a normal day.  When I checked it out, I discovered that practically every city in Europe and America has a mounted police patrol.  If anyone passing the Department of Justice earlier today ran into a cloud of smog, it would have been from the mountain of old files on this subject which were being dusted down. Apparently, it is not a new idea and has often been put forward.  However, it usually ended up on the shelf.  Everyone has always said it is a great idea, especially the Garda.  However, every time it was raised, there was a constraint on resources although it is not a costly initiative and has been costed.  The money did not exist for it and priorities always lay elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I raise this issue because the time has come to implement this idea.  If ever there were a win-win situation, this is it.  The comparatively small investment required will be repaid itself many times over.  There is a palpable need for more effective policing on the streets of Dublin and there is a vociferous public demand for it. Measures must and have already been taken and more will be taken.  I see this suggestion fitting in with the measures taken.  I do not suggest that every garda should be on horseback but rather <Col N="434" /> there should be a small unit of 12 horses for Dublin.  That may not seem a lot but its effect on the quality of policing would be dramatic.</P>
    <P>People often call for extra police measures to cope with rising crime.  There is a strong demand for more effective policing.  At the same time, people do not want Ireland to become a police state.  I was at the Ireland <i>v</i> England football match in Lansdowne Road a couple of years ago. I saw a riot occur.  Riots are infrequent in Ireland but there is a possibility that they may occur in the future.  If we are to control riots, plastic bullets and water cannons are not acceptable. Mounted police are effective in controlling riots and, if we had them available for that, it would be a good investment in the future.  Mounted police are also a way of increasing Garda presence which is acceptable to all and in a way people may find attractive.</P>
    <P>O'Connell Street is becoming more pedestrianised and it is not always the safest place at night or even during the day.  Mounted gardaí patrolling O'Connell Street would have a visibility and presence which would make itself felt.  I understand and believe the Garda approves of it.  Their height alone would have an effect which eight, ten, 12 or 14 gardaí would not.  It would have a deterrent effect.  The amount of drugs and drunkenness in the city centre sometimes gives rise to trouble which might not happen if a small number of mounted gardaí were present.</P>
    <P>There are some side benefits.  A mounted Garda unit would help promote our horse industry to the outside world.  It would provide colour on ceremonial occassions although I have been informed by Senator Henry that the Blue Huzzar uniforms have been sold to Guinness. These are only the icing on the cake.  The real advantage is it offers more effective policing at relatively little cost.  The costs have been calculated and are in the files.  I hope I am pushing an open door on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for giving me the opportunity to respond on behalf of the Minister for Justice to this interesting proposal.</P>
      <P>Methods of policing are under constant review by the Garda authorities to meet the changing needs of crime prevention and detection in our society.  Such methods are continuosly being updated in order to provide the best available resources to members of An Garda Síochána in their policing duties, including, for example, more extensive use of new technology.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, is totally committed to this continual assessment of policing methods and she is in regular consultation with the Garda authorities on the matter.  It is in the light of the overall picture of policing methods that it is intended to look at the matter under discussion in the Seanad today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of introducing mounted police in Dublin is not new, as the Senator said, and the <Col N="435" /> issue has been raised and assessed a number of times over the years.  Records show that in 1953 the idea was proposed by the then deputy commissioner Major General W.R.E. Murphy but, after some preliminary research, the matter was not progressed.  Over the years, successive Ministers for Justice have rejected the idea and the present Minister for Justice stated in response to Parliamentary Question No. 92 on 22 February 1995 that she was not convinced the benefits of having a mounted police unit in the Garda Síochána were sufficient to divert valuable resources from other policing areas.</P>
    <P>She also stated that the needs of the Garda and the public would be better served by putting available financial resources into such areas as the use of closed circuit television by the Garda. Through the use of CCTV, gardaí can be in a position to identify criminals at work in the streets and to respond quickly.  Criminals can be caught in the act on camera and this information can be useful in obtaining convictions in court.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of some of the arguments put forward by those in favour of introducing a mounted police unit.  The mounted police officer is easily seen and has a commanding presence. The mounted police officer's ability to see distances can make him useful in crowded situations and he has the ability to cover ground at a reasonable pace &mdash; faster than the foot patrol but slower than the patrol car.</P>
    <P>Mounted police can be used in various situations in patrolling city centres, for crowd control and, where appropriate, for ceremonial purposes.  This latter use is something which is dependent upon national cultures.  The Minister is aware, for instance, that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are used now for display and ceremonial purposes only, and have no police duties.  This latter use would not unduly concern us and it is for the former two uses &mdash; patrolling city centres and assisting with crowd control &mdash; that a mounted police unit may be useful. However, there could be a counter argument that the public order needs which require mounted police in other jurisdictions do not reasonably apply here.</P>
    <P>The argument has still to be made that investing resources in a mounted police unit for <Col N="436" /> the Garda Síochána at this point will bring benefits to the force over and above areas, such as the effective beat and mobile patrolling and the use of CCTV as an aid to policing.  Indeed, the use of CCTV for policing purposes has all of the advantages outlined above.  It is easily seen by the public and is a very visible deterrent to the would be criminal.  The geographical scope of such cameras would surpass that of any mounted police unit and the speed element of effective monitoring by cameras and other advanced communication technology would surpass that of a mounted police officer responding to the pursuit of an alleged criminal.  It is for this reason that the Minister has been expanding and developing the use of CCTV as an effective policing tool for the Garda.</P>
    <P>The first Garda CCTV system was installed in the Temple Bar area of Dublin in October 1995 and it has contributed to the detection of a number of offences, including public order offences, road traffic offences and some crimes relating to robbery and drugs.  The success of the system in the Temple Bar area is very encouraging and the Minister is pleased to say that tenders are due shortly for a CCTV scheme for the O'Connell Street area of Dublin.  Having obtained Government approval to provide additional funding for the expansion of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing as part of the recent anti-crime package, the Minister has approved Garda CCTV schemes in Finglas and Tralee and she intends to approve further schemes in other areas.</P>
    <P>It is for the reasons that have been outlined that the Minister has concentrated on the expansion of the CCTV in the past year. However, as already stated, methods of policing are kept under constant review and the Minister consults with the Garda authorities on a regular basis on any adaptations and innovations which could bring benefits to the Force and to the public.  The Minister has no difficulty in looking again at the whole question of the introduction of a mounted police unit for the Garda Síochána if changing trends in crime prevention and detection warrant it and if such proposals are put forward by the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 13 November 1996.</P>
