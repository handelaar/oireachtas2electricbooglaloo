      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The implementation of the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 1995, is intended to legislatively better equip the VHI for competition arising from the completion of the EU's Internal Market in non-life insurance, which includes private health insurance.</P>
      <P>The EU's Third Non-Life Insurance Directive has provided the impetus for change in the way such insurance business is conducted in the EU as a whole. Relative to other member states, the potential change in Ireland may be regarded as even more significant because our private health insurance market has developed without the presence of competition.  The directive has taken a very simple and effective path to the creation of the Single Market by providing that an undertaking authorised in one member state can, on the basis of that one authorisation, sell insurance in any other member state either on an establishment basis or by way of freedom to provide services.  The directive provides necessary safeguards, with regard to prudential and other matters, to ensure proper supervision of the business in the interests of policyholders.</P>
      <P>Most importantly in Ireland's case, the directive allowed for the adoption and maintenance by member states, in certain circumstances and to protect the general good, of specific legal provisions in so far as these do not unduly restrict the right of establishment or the freedom to provide services by authorised undertakings.  The Health Insurance Act, 1994, was enacted to implement the directive here as regards the private health insurance aspect of non-life insurance.  This Act sets down the regulatory framework within which the private health insurance business will operate and develop.  It gave the force of law to the principles which have characterised our system and served our people so well over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act provides that an undertaking pursuing health insurance business here must provide cover on a community <Col N="828" /> rated basis and must adhere to the principles of open enrolment and lifetime cover.  The Act, therefore, ensured that the Irish public will continue to benefit from the strengths inherent in our system which have been applied with great effect for the common good over almost 40 years.  These guiding principles have kept private health insurance within the reach of the ordinary person and particularly those who would be vulnerable to being priced out of a high risk system.</P>
    <P>Such a system is the opposite to community rating as under it premium levels are determined by reference to the individual risk being undertaken and considerations such as sex, age and health status are determining factors.  Risk rating does not favour the elderly and chronically ill.  I am fully committed to preserving our equitable and effective system of community rating in the interests of all our people.</P>
    <P>I consider the entry of competition into the private health insurance market here to be both desirable and necessary. I am anxious to see this occur as I believe it will invigorate and develop the business of health insurance particularly in terms of marketing, design and choice of products.  It will provide the dynamic for improvement and the continued achievement of high standards in the provision of services to the public. It should be borne in mind, however, that the opening of the market will not necessarily lead to lower premiums as there is a problem in markets generally with increasing medical costs being faced by Governments and insurance companies.  At least initially, the most strenuous competition between undertakings may be in relation to services and products rather than prices.</P>
    <P>There are companies which are interested in entering the Irish market. Understandably, before deciding on the matter, these are awaiting completion of the health insurance regulatory framework in the form of regulations under the Health Insurance Act.  I expect to be in a position to sign these extensive regulations very soon.  The implementation of the provisions of this Bill will <Col N="829" /> mean that the VHI, with its specific knowledge and long experience of the Irish market, should be better placed to meet the challenge of competition.</P>
    <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board was established and currently operates under the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957.  While the VHI's business has progressed along with the social and economic context within which it has traded over the almost 40 years since its establishment, no parallel or complementary progression has been effected in terms of the legislation under which it operates.  The 1957 Act has seen the VHI develop in a way that reflected the highly sheltered nature of its market.  Nevertheless, its contribution has been one of solid service as regards fulfilling a public need for the provision of an extensive protection to its members against the cost of hospitalisation for serious injury or illness.  Even when one allows for the specific market conditions prevailing in the past, it remains a great feat that the VHI's membership has increased up to the point where it covers over one-third of our population.</P>
    <P>The VHI has done the country a valuable and enduring service in pioneering the concept of private medical insurance with such great effect among our people.  While many changes and challenges have gone before, the creation of the open market and the advent of competition is perhaps the most crucial one the organisation has ever faced.  In order to succeed in the new environment, the VHI will have to develop and vigorously maintain those characteristics which define a successful commercial undertaking, such as a strong marketing focus, dynamic product development and adaptability to change.</P>
    <P>Anyone who keeps in touch with developments, internationally, in the health insurance area will appreciate the great extent and pace of change it is undergoing as companies vie to increase or protect market share.  The VHI must shift radically from an organisation which was developed in a highly stable environment to one of leadership in a <Col N="830" /> highly competitive market.  The Bill now before the House for consideration represents a key move towards modernising the VHI.  It will strengthen the position of the VHI in a number of major respects, which I will refer to again in this opening statement.</P>
    <P>By reference to the principles underlying the Bill, it is worthwhile to briefly consider the origins of the VHI and its development to date.  Its establishment was recommended by the advisory body on the voluntary health insurance scheme which reported to the Minister for Health in 1956.  The key objective set for it was to provide insurance against the cost of major and unforeseeable medical costs in circumstances where a large percentage of the population was not eligible for public health services.</P>
    <P>The VHI was established under the umbrella of the State as a not-for-profit body because at the time the private sector appeared unwilling or unable to operate a scheme of voluntary health insurance.  The 1957 Act provided that anyone willing to engage in the business of making available private health insurance in the State had to obtain a licence from the Minister for Health and the operation of this provision over the years saw the VHI develop as the provider of private health insurance to the general public.  The growth of the VHI has been such that its membership now comprises 1.3 million people, or 35 per cent of the country's population.</P>
    <P>The VHI is among the largest insurance operations in the Irish market. The change in the scale of its business can be readily appreciated when one considers that in 1980 it had a subscription income of £25.2 million and claims of £19.6 million and that the corresponding figures for 1995 were £232.6 million and £233.1 million.  Both in terms of cost and complexity, the business of making available schemes of voluntary health insurance has moved a long way forward since the time 40 years ago when the advisory body recommended establishment of the VHI.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> In the 1980s the VHI experienced considerable cost pressures due to factors such as high outpatient claims, rapidly rising in-patient hospital charges, increased claims payments due to steeply rising volumes, major new facilities coming on stream and declining investment income.  The culmination of this very difficult financial period was the incurring of operating deficits of between £11 million and £12 million in 1988-89.  These posed such a threat to the very existence of the organisation that the implementation of a tough programme of financial recovery became necessary.  This was successful in arresting the adverse trend in the organisation's finances but gave rise to the reduction of benefits available to members and increases in premiums, in addition to other cost containing measures.</P>
    <P>Although the VHI is not in so precarious a financial position as it was at the end of the 1980s, it must strive towards significant improvement, especially regarding its reserves.  While the board recorded a small operational surplus in its accounts for the year ended February 1995, the continuing underlying trading position gives cause for some concern.  Along with health insures generally, cost containment is a perennial problem for the VHI.</P>
    <P>Excluding high out-patient claims, which were controlled by reducing benefits in that area, the factors previously mentioned which drive cost increases are still very much in evidence. In addition to this, members of the VHI have a heightened expectation of ready access to sophisticated health care services and facilities.  There is also an unfavourable demographic trend as regards the ageing profile of VHI members, which generates greater demands for health services and consequently leads to greater outgoings.</P>
    <P>There is a wider picture relating to the development of our health services within which the contribution of the VHI over many years may be regarded. It has played a very significant role in <Col N="832" /> the development of our health services through its schemes of voluntary health insurance.  These have served to help maintain the public/private mix which has been fundamental to the growth in health service provision.  Ireland has benefited from an overall system which has provided a vigorous private sector. An environment has been developed whereby consultants provide service on the public hospital site not only for their own private patients but also for public patients.  Both the public and the private sector benefits from the mix, allowing for greater co-operation and collaboration in the provision of the best possible service to patients.</P>
    <P>The considerable degree of interdependence which exists between those involved in the delivery of health services represents fertile ground on which to improve relationships and develop consensus.  The strategy document on effective healthcare in the 1990s recognised the potential which exists to foster understanding between the healthcare sectors through the exchange of information, the co-ordination of approaches and the maintenance of uniform standards.</P>
    <P>The healthcare consultative forum was identified as the vehicle through which better communication and a sharing of understanding could be pursued as the basis for practical co-operation. I will be making arrangements soon to establish the forum as I believe it holds the potential to positively influence the approaches to the future delivery of our health services.  I am anxious that all means be explored to stimulate constructive discussion directed at achieving the prize of a shared vision of the future shape of our healthcare services for the good of all of our people.  The VHI has a significant contribution to make to this process.</P>
    <P>Globally, health insurance is an evolving business where a ready capacity to adapt to change and to seize opportunities is a prerequisite to success and survival.  In this context, and especially by reference to our membership of a wider European economic <Col N="833" /> community, it was always in prospect that the VHI was going to face a period of significant change.  In 1994 the then Minister for Health, Deputy Brendan Howlin, established the VHI review group to report to him on the strategic and operational capacity of the VHI in the context of the Single Market.  The group considered that there was a need for radical change in the VHI's business culture and approach.</P>
    <P>The review group viewed the appointment of a chief executive, who could provide leadership and who would be allowed the freedom to transform the organisation and its business culture to one of innovation, imagination and customer responsiveness, as central to effecting vital change within the organisation. It laid emphasis on the fact that it regarded the appointment of a chief executive with the requisite experience and qualities as pivotal to the entire thrust of what it considered should be done to move the VHI forward in terms of the new market environment facing it.</P>
    <P>Mr. Brian Duncan, formerly of Irish Life plc, was appointed chief executive of the VHI in February of last year. There has also been wider managerial change in the VHI with the restructuring of its top level management through the recent filling of four new director posts &mdash; sales and marketing, operations, finance and business development. These practical steps demonstrate the drive which is underway to heighten the business orientation of the VHI in a changed trading environment.</P>
    <P>It was also the view of the review group that the board of the VHI be enlarged in order that it would comprise skills and experience commensurate with those of a modern major commercial insurance undertaking.  Provision to enable this to be done is being made in the Bill.  I am not, however, at this stage addressing in the Bill the review group's recommendation about changing the corporate status of the VHI to that of a limited company with a 100 per cent State shareholding.  At a later point in <Col N="834" /> this statement, I will inform the House of my position regarding this matter and my reasons for not embarking on a conversion of corporate status at this particular time.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, both in terms of its size of membership and annual financial outlay, the VHI is a major stakeholder in our health care system.  The schemes of voluntary health insurance it has operated over the years have served to support the essential balance between public and private medicine which is at the very core of access to and quality of health care in our closely integrated system.  Therefore, it is not unusual that the Minister has maintained a broad practical interest in the strategies and policies devised by the VHI.  On top of this the Minister is the 100 per cent shareholder.  This relationship carries with it a duty to be satisfied as to the financial wellbeing of the VHI and that it is publicly accountable in the performance of its statutory functions.  Consequently, the Minister is involved in such matters as determining membership of the board and ensuring that the business of the VHI is being properly handled, including premium or product changes. The Minister is not involved in operational matters or the board's day-to-day management and commercial decisions.  The Minister's relationship with the VHI is very much concerned with the broad thrust of its proposals.  It is not my intention that there should be any greater degree of involvement by my Department in the affairs of the VHI than heretofore.  One can anticipate that in the not too distant future the influence and impact of the competitive market will be the important consideration in how the VHI conducts its affairs.</P>
    <P>Considering the context I have outlined regarding health insurance, it is vital that the VHI becomes a more market driven organisation capable of managing change and adopting to new challenges, including competition.  It must also be legislatively equipped to take prudent measures to ensure the most cost effective delivery of its schemes and <Col N="835" /> to control its claims experience.  It needs to have a board which can, with a greater range of expertise, more fully act on behalf of subscribers.</P>
    <P>The Bill will support the VHI's efforts to more effectively manage costs.  It is imperative to the retention of the system of mixed public and private healthcare that private health insurance features strongly in how services are funded.  Rising claims costs mean higher premiums, which in turn can force down the numbers able to afford cover.  Such an experience would be damaging, if not fatal, to a community rated system which relies on broadly based participation. The Australian community rated health insurance system suffered such an adverse experience which diminished the numbers of lives insured.  It also gave rise to a re-examination of the mechanisms designed to support the system of community rating.  The regulatory framework being implemented in this country has taken account of the Australian experience.</P>
    <P>I move now to the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 deals with arrangements for providers.  This replaces section 4 in the 1957 Act but retains the provision that defines the VHI as a &ldquo;not for profit&rdquo; body which has served the Irish people so well.</P>
    <P>The new section addresses a significant omission from the provisions of the 1957 Act by giving the board explicit powers in relation to making arrangements with health service providers who make available treatment and care to its members.  The 1957 Act was silent on this important aspect of the board's operations.  Accordingly, it is proposed to bridge a gap which has existed in its legal capacity as regards arrangements with service providers and to set down clearly what the powers of the board are in that regard.</P>
    <P>What is intended is that the VHI should be put on a footing corresponding to that of commercial undertakings generally in the conduct of its business arrangements with providers.  The VHI must have such powers as otherwise it <Col N="836" /> will have no basis in law on which to take prudent measures to contain costs through ensuring the delivery of quality services on the most economical basis.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of the members of the VHI that it can manage costs as failure to do so could quickly lead to premium levels escalating beyond the reach of most.  Health insures worldwide are constantly struggling with this difficulty and it would be unacceptable to expect the VHI to operate in a vacuum where the issue is one that could jeopardise its very survival.  Clearly, the provider and insurer have a shared interest in the optimum provision of services to the member/patient.  In this context there is no reason why providers and insurance companies would not be prepared to be transparent and accountable about the services they provide. Providers and insurers also have a shared crucial interest in the maintenance of a high participation rate in voluntary health insurance schemes and the continued existence of a strong ethic and culture of private health insurance among the population.  In its 1994-95 financial year, the VHI paid out £107 million to private hospitals and £60.3 million in respect of consultants' fees. The amount paid out to public hospitals in the year was £57.2 million.  Therefore, the total payout to hospitals and in respect of consultants' fees was £224.5 million.  Developments in other countries show an acceptance on the part of providers and insurers to work together in taking new approaches to how care and treatment are delivered.  Such moves recognise the importance of seeing the wider picture of interdependence which underlies the private health insurance system and failure to do so will not serve the public and will ultimately not serve any party.</P>
    <P>There were two amendments of a substantive nature which were brought forward by me in relation to this section in the Bill's passage through the Dáil. One of these allowed that, in addition to the matters already specified under the section as published, the VHI may have regard to the wider perspective <Col N="837" /> relating to services, either existing or proposed, when considering whether to enter into an agreement with a provider. This is no more than one would expect of an undertaking applying normal and sound business principles in its decision making process.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also makes provision for the VHI to undertake schemes of health-related insurance which will give it wider flexibility for innovation in the product design area.  Traditionally, the VHI has provided schemes which specifically indemnify the member, in whole or in part, against actual medical costs incurred in the treatment of injury, disease or illness.  The success of the VHI in terms of its market penetration of 35 per cent of the population, as against 12 per cent approximately of those with private medical insurance in the United Kingdom, can be partly attributed to the medical indemnity product it provides.  This is indicative of the sense of security and reassurance it offers the insured person against the uncertainties of serious illness and injury.  While this will remain the VHI's core business, it needs to have the capacity to compete against companies which are offering forms of cash based insurance such as hospital cash.  It also needs to be given the capacity to be creative in a market that demands innovation. It needs to be able to compete on a diversity of products &mdash; for instance, those intended to appeal to specific groups or &ldquo;add on&rdquo; cash products to enhance the attractiveness of existing schemes or preventive or &ldquo;wellness&rdquo; schemes.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enable the VHI to develop diverse packages of insurance in the form of a combination of indemnity and cash cover, thereby putting it in a position to be more responsive to the needs of its members and the market generally.  A key target constituency for new products should be young people and the VHI will be able to tailor packages to attract them into private health insurance.  Their participation is vital to the maintenance of a strong community rated system.  The <Col N="838" /> Bill provides that schemes of health insurance shall be subject to the consent of the Minister.  Therefore, I consider it opportune for me to state that while indemnity insurance will remain the main business of the VHI, I am disposed towards supporting it in developing attractive and imaginative products aimed at enhancing its membership and revenue situation.</P>
    <P>The other substantive amendment under this section which was proposed to me and accepted in the Dáil involved elaboration of the definition given to &ldquo;health-related insurance scheme&rdquo;. Looking at what is happening elsewhere and taking account of the views of the VHI board in the matter, the provision was defined in a considerably greater degree of detail than was originally the case.  The result was to give the VHI a wide variety of options for the formulation of packages, whether benefits are based on indemnity or cash or a mixture of both, or are funded and delivered on a capitation or other programmed basis. There was also provision included for the VHI to make cover available in respect of services in the nature of preventive healthcare or &ldquo;wellness schemes&rdquo;.  This is an area where some foreign health insurers have developed niche products.  The intention behind the Bill is to enable the VHI to conduct its business on more commercial lines. That having been said, the dimension which concerns my position as Minister with a 100 per cent shareholding in the VHI is to be recognised.  I am accountable to the Oireachtas in that regard and it is therefore legitimate for me to have an input into the policy and strategic considerations of the VHI in order to satisfy myself as to the appropriateness and soundness of any particular direction being taken.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill puts on a formal footing the practice which has operated until now whereby the VHI consulted the Minister in regard to proposed premium increases.  The section now places a duty of notification on the board; it provides that the board can apply <Col N="839" /> increases automatically after a specified short period has elapsed unless the Minister expressly issues a reasoned direction against implementation of the increases.  It is entirely appropriate that the Minister should have the capacity to have some real input in relation to premium increases which can impact on 1.3 million of our population.  The fact that the VHI has a near monopoly in the market means that it is in order for the Minister to reserve the power to intervene should circumstances warrant.  The VHI review group considered it appropriate for premium levels to be subject to regulatory approval for so long as the VHI continues to enjoy a virtual monopoly of the health insurance market. The response by the Minister to notification of proposed premium increases under the section will be prompt.  In effect, this section brings clarity and structure to an informal arrangement that has been based more on custom and practice in the past.</P>
    <P>An amendment to this section was considered by the Dáil Select Committee on Social Affairs also.  It proposed that the Minister's power to issue a direction to VHI not to implement a premium increase be exercised by regulation. I viewed this as making the process more complicated and protracted than it needed to be.  The amendment was withdrawn following discussion.</P>
    <P>Section 4 recognises that the limitation on the board's size, of not more than five members, imposed under the 1957 Act has outlived its relevance in terms of the contemporary needs of a national commercial undertaking.  This was adequate to meet the needs of a board which was presiding over a State monopoly in a stable and uncomplicated market environment.  As the trading environment has become more demanding, complex and volatile over time, and especially in view of the opening of the market to competition, the board must change with the times and circumstances.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for the size of the board to be extended to not more than 12 members. <Col N="840" /> It will therefore be possible for me, as Minister, to ensure there is available at board level the depth and range of knowledge and experience appropriate to the modern VHI.  It is my intention that the board's composition should reflect the level of skills and expertise appropriate to that of a major commercial insurance undertaking.  It is also, in my view, desirable that it should have an effective consumer input.</P>
    <P>In order to avoid having to enact a further amendment, should future circumstances have warranted the size of the board to be increased beyond 12 members, the Bill as originally published had provided for the Minister to determine the number of members by regulation.  However, having taken account of opposition to this provision as expressed to me in the Dáil Select Committee on Social Affairs, it was deleted on my amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also provides that the number of board members who are health service providers is not to exceed two persons.  Subject to the provisions of the law, it is the prerogative of the Minister to select board members.  While the VHI is about the business of healthcare, it is first and foremost an insurance undertaking.  The skills and expertise it needs to thrive are those relevant to the insurance sector generally &mdash; actuarial, financial and marketing &mdash; as well as expertise in the healthcare industry. Against this background, I am satisfied that the law should place an acceptable upper limit on the number of board members who come from a provider background.  I want to make it clear at this point that those from a provider background, employer or medical, who have served on the board have done so always with the best interests of VHI members and subscribers central to their contributions and actions.  It is not in question that a person's health service expertise and specific knowledge of the area enables him or her to make a valid and positive contribution to the work of the board.  The issue is rather one of the appropriate balance to be <Col N="841" /> struck in providing the VHI with the composition of skills and expertise at board level which will best serve the organisation's needs.  I consider that not more than two persons who are health service providers out of not more than 12 members overall represents an appropriate balance.</P>
    <P>An amendment proposing deletion of the subsection which limits the number of health service providers on the board was the subject of considerable debate in the Dáil but was not acceptable to me.  I believe that over time, and unintentionally, a drift towards a dominance of or disproportionate participation by health service providers on the board could occur.  It is right that the Bill should contain checks and balances to ensure that such a situation cannot develop while at the same time allowing for the board to benefit from the particular knowledge and expertise which providers have to offer.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this point to place on the record of the House the debt of gratitude which is owed to board members, past and present, who have worked so selflessly for the betterment of the organisation and in the interests of its members.  Their contribution is one of distinction and honour in giving generously of their time and energy for the public good.  One must also recognise the very great and effective input which the members of staff of the VHI make to the organisation on an ongoing basis.  Their industriousness, commitment and dedication is certainly one of the strong cards the VHI holds in whatever competitive battles may lie ahead. It is a great credit to the organisation that at 6 per cent of premium income the VHI's administrative costs stand very favourably in comparison to those of other like companies.</P>
    <P>Section 5 gives a statutory basis to the position of the chief executive of the VHI and in so doing underlines the crucial leadership role attaching to the position, which the VHI review group regarded as vital to effecting change in the organisation.  As I have said, the group identified the chief executive as a <Col N="842" /> key agent of change and set out principles under which the chief executive should have total responsibility for the efficient direction of all operations.  The Bill provides that the chief executive, under the authority of the board, will be the person responsible for carrying on, managing and controlling generally the administration and business of the VHI. The Bill puts the chief executive on a par with counterparts in other commercial State bodies in terms of carrying through the task of effecting and managing change for the good of the organisation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 relates to the conditions which will apply where a board member or a member of VHI staff is nominated or elected to membership of either House of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament.  It supersedes section 9 of the 1957 Act, which dealt with Oireachtas membership only.</P>
    <P>Section 7 relates to the terms and conditions of service of members of staff of the VHI.  It obliges the board to have regard to prevailing Government policy or nationally agreed guidelines in determining the remuneration or allowances to be paid to staff.  This is now a standard provision in legislation of such bodies.  An amendment to delete that part of the section requiring that the board comply with any directives from the Minister, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance, regarding the remuneration, allowances, terms and conditions for staff was withdrawn after consideration by the Dáil Select Committee on Social Affairs.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for a prohibition on the unauthorised disclosure of information. This recognises the sensitive nature of the information which the VHI holds.  It prohibits the disclosure of confidential information unless duly authorised by the board.  It does not therefore impinge on the freedom of staff to give information, as required in the normal exercise of their duties, in reply to inquiries received.  The provision reflects the need to protect commercially important information in a new and competitive market environment. <Col N="843" /> The prohibition applies not only to board members and the staff of VHI, but also to those who act as consultants and advisers to the organisation. The description of confidential information as provided under the section was made clearer by an amendment which I brought forward in the Dáil Select Committee on Social Affairs and which was accepted by it.</P>
    <P>Section 9, which replaces section 21 of the 1957 Act, enhances the accountability of the board to the Minister by reference to the information which it is obliged to furnish at his or her request. It does not, however, require the board to make available information about an individual member of the VHI or a particular health service provider.  A small change to this section was made on my proposal to the Dáil Select Committee on Social Affairs to avoid any doubt that the Minister's entitlement to receive information is superior to the provision relating to the prohibition on the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information contained in section 8.</P>
    <P>This is the first piece of legislation prepared in relation to the VHI since its foundation.  It is intended to effect essential amendments to the 1957 Act and is a significant step on the path to transforming the VHI to enable it to meet new market challenges.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I would give the House my reasons for not making provision under the Bill to change the VHI's corporate status.  I now return to this point.  I have an open mind on this matter and I am prepared, in due course, to recommend to the Government what is best for the organisation. I have set out the considerable change which the VHI is undergoing at present. This is consistent with the approach recommended by the VHI review group who, first and foremost, advocated a change in the business nature, culture and orientation of the VHI and identified the chief executive as the catalyst for this.  The group was of the view that the appropriate corporate structure for the VHI in the future would be that of <Col N="844" /> a limited liability company with 100 per cent of the shares held by the Minister. It considered the conversion to a limited company to be part of a process of radical change to encourage the development of a more innovative and commercial approach.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that a change in the corporate status of the VHI, while it would remain 100 per cent State-owned, should be further explored.  I am of the opinion that this would be most appropriately and effectively undertaken when the proposed new arrangements to enhance the expertise of the VHI at board level have been effected.  The recent restructuring of top level management should serve to assist the enlarged board in this process.  I will be requesting that the enlarged board give detailed consideration to the matter of a change in corporate status and that it submit to me such developed proposals as it may deem appropriate in this regard.  Accordingly, this is a matter in respect of which the House may be asked to consider legislation at a future date.</P>
    <P>Other significant amendments were proposed in the Dáil which are not provided for in the Bill before us and regarding which I would like to inform the House.  An amendment was tabled at the Dáil Select Committee on Social Affairs to the effect that nothing in the Competition Act, 1991, would prevent or restrict the VHI, or any health insurer, from exercising the powers or doing any of the things provided for under section 2 of the Bill.  The issue of exempting health insurers from the terms of the Competition Act, 1991, was discussed at length by the committee and the amendment was withdrawn as a result.</P>
    <P>The Dáil also considered an amendment relating to the establishment of a VHI users' commission which I considered, openly and carefully.  However, having fully reflected on the matter, I formed the view that a statutory body dealing primarily with complaints of VHI members would largely be a duplication of the independent and effective <Col N="845" /> arrangements already at the disposal of VHI members through the Insurance Ombudsman.  It was also my opinion that to take such a step now would fail to give a reasonable opportunity to the members' advisory council, recently established by the VHI, to operate and have an impact as regards the broader considerations of promoting and enhancing customer services.</P>
    <P>I consider that the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 1995, contains a balanced and measured set of provisions.  I recommend it to the House as a significant step in the process of modernising this State commercial enterprise which has a business relationship with and service obligation to such a large proportion of our population.  I am confident that, along with the personnel and structural changes within the organisation, the Bill will enable the VHI to adjust to and take best advantage of a changed market environment. I am working towards a VHI that is financially strong; adaptable and market driven; dynamic and innovative in the area of product development; having good working relationships with providers and a good customer relations base.</P>
    <P>The objective of this Bill is to make the VHI a more vibrant commercial undertaking which is appropriately resourced, in terms of its governing legislation, for the era of competition ahead.  I believe that this Bill puts the VHI on the right course to maintain its position as the main force in private health insurance in Ireland for the future.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  This Bill shows how great were our predecessors because, almost 40 years ago, they formulated a Bill which has stood the test of time.  Many radical changes have occurred in the lifestyles of Irish people during the latter half of that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is good that this Bill will place the VHI in a position to compete with outside insurance companies.  I am certain <Col N="846" /> the Minister will ensure that there is no loophole whereby an insurance company might come here and poach younger members from the VHI. Insurance companies in general only desire the business of younger people. When I was growing up insurance agents only canvassed a family for business when someone began to receive their old age pension.  At present, insurance companies do not want the business of people aged 55 or 60 years. The same situation prevails in relation to all types of insurance where people are classified in low or high risk categories. It would be a pity if insurance companies from outside could select everyone in the low risk categories, leaving the VHI to cater for high risk customers. I am sure that this will not be the case.</P>
    <P>It will be very difficult for any insurance company to provide reasonably priced health insurance in the future.  The VHI is doing a great job and deserves great credit in this regard.  A compensation culture is becoming prevalent in hospitals and elsewhere which makes the provision of health services very expensive because every decision must be checked and verified by two or three officials before an operation is performed.  This costs a great deal of money.  Sometimes I wonder where it will end.</P>
    <P>Something must be done with regard to placing a cap on services.  The Minister referred to &ldquo;cash products&rdquo; but I am not sure what is meant by this.  Does it mean that some people will be provided with money to pay for services required?  Last year some patients travelled to Northern Ireland to avail of a service which costs much less than in the Republic.  If people are offered the alternative of receiving money and can make their own arrangements with a consultant, they may be able to bargain or barter, which could result in better services.  Some years ago my local health board incurred costs in the region of £1,600 per person eligible to receive services as a public patient.  If those people were informed that they would receive <Col N="847" /> £1,600, how many would spend the money on their health?</P>
    <P>I stated previously that I am saddened by the fact that despite the billions of pounds invested in health and education, our society is less healthy. Billions of pounds of taxpayers money are being wasted by people, many of whose ailments are self-inflicted.  I do not know how we will come to grips with this problem, but we must do so.  If a person wants to have their car repaired, they seek an estimate of the cost and discover who will carry out the work for the lowest price.  The days are gone when people could simply have something repaired and pay the bill for that service.  People do not know what charges they will incur for such work. The same system must be introduced to the VHI and all other facets of healthcare service.</P>
    <P>The VHI provides cover for 35 per cent of the population and it is magnificent that it can do so for a relatively small amount.  The cost for health services in the public sector is far greater. Deputy Ned O'Keeffe recently mentioned the provision of national health insurance for everyone and inquired if it would be better and less costly if all hospitals and services were privatised?  I do not believe that it could cost any more than it does at present.</P>
    <P>I am glad that only two service providers will serve as members of the new board.  The county councils ran the health service for years at a fraction of what it cost when the health boards took over.  The health boards took over because it was said the county councillors did not know anything about it. They knew how to look after the pence and shillings and how to keep the county council within its budget.  Once the health boards took over experts were employed and it was said they would run a cheap health service because they knew what they were talking about.  However, the health boards are looking for more money each year from the Minister for Health.  I supported every Minister for Health and <Col N="848" /> every budget for the past 21 years because I know the problems they face. The taxpayer must pay for this in the long term.</P>
    <P>Many health board members are elected because they are leaders of their unions, and I do not say that in a derogatory way.  This means they are torn between which that they should wear.  It is not fair to put them in that position because if they do not carry out the union's wishes, they will not be allowed on the board.  People elected to a board should have no interest in it other than ensuring it is run as well as possible.  There should be no monetary gain and they should not be involved in any of the services it provides.  County councillors are always fair and impartial because they have no axe to grind and they know what is best in the interests of the people.  I doubt if a 12 member board will be any more efficient.  I always said six members were enough on any board because the more there are on it the more difficult it is to control.</P>
    <P>In 1980 the population was approximately the same as it is now.  At that time subscriptions to the VHI amounted to £25.2 million and claims cost £19.6 million.  In 1995 subscriptions increased to £232.6 million and claims increased to £233.1 million.  What has gone wrong over those years?  Why have people become so sick in 15 years?  I wonder if people need to go to doctors now as often as they do.  I thank God I did not have to go to the doctor with too many complaints, although I might have done so if I did not have to pay.</P>
    <P>People are now claiming against doctors.  A doctor can only do his best and he is right in 99 per cent of cases.  If tests must be carried out on these 99 per cent, the people will become human pin cushions as a result.  Where will this end?  We have now reached a stage where someone must be present when a doctor examines a patient in case of a claim.  As long as this attitude prevails we will have an expensive health service. Perhaps a commission could be set up to examine why the costs escalated <Col N="849" /> from £25.2 million in 1980 to £232.6 million in 1995 and why claims increased from £19.6 million to £233.1 million.  If we could solve that problem perhaps we could get reasonable health insurance and good health care.</P>
    <P>The VHI has changed with the advent of private hospitals.  Good hospitals had to close in towns because we were told it was not safe to take a thorn from a patient's finger without having a backup service.  However, a few years later many of those hospitals, which were only glorified nursing homes, became private hospitals.  What caused this change?  They do not have the same backup services as those in our regional hospitals.  Perhaps this should be investigated. There are two good hospitals in my health board area, Sligo General Hospital and Letterkenny General Hospital.  I do not understand why professionals in those hospitals send their patients to private hospitals when public hospitals could be paid for the use of private beds.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned four new posts for directors of sales and marketing operations and finance and business development.  I do not know how insurance can be marketed or if these posts will be successful, but I hope they will.</P>
    <P>If another 15 per cent of people join the VHI they will be in private hospitals.  Will this mean a reduction in the number of people attending public hospitals?  Will we be able to provide those who are not in the VHI with a better service?  Over my 21 years on the health boards, it worried me that a person who needs a hip replacement or other operation has to wait.  However, if they were in the VHI or had the money they could have the operation done overnight as a private patient.  I would like to see public and private patients being treated equally.</P>
    <P>If the market becomes more open, more people will become VHI subscribers, fewer people will need to use the public service and the pay off should be that public patients will be on a par with VHI patients.  People who have <Col N="850" /> accidents or need immediate attention are given an excellent service by every hospital.  Anyone who is stricken with a sudden illness can get into hospital and be treated immediately.  I have no doubt that people admitted following a road accident or heart attack are treated the same as patients in any private hospital. The public service provides an excellent service but in some instances there are long waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the VHI must have the capacity to compete with companies offering cash based insurance.  Does that mean patients can get the money and pay their own bills? If so, it is a very good idea because it means people can go to any hospital to be treated.  It is a pity so many doctors are not accepting VHI fees.  There is nothing we can do about that.  It is sad that a person paying VHI finds that when they go to a hospital, the VHI only pays so much and they must still put their hand in their pocket and pay the balance.  A group should be established to monitor the cost of operations. There is no reason people should not know the cost of different operations.</P>
    <P>I am glad that only two members of the board will be members of the medical profession.  That is a good idea because if the board wants professional advice, it can call on its staff to provide it.  These professionals need not be members of the board.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a step in the right direction and I sincerely hope it will stand the test of time.  I hope someone will pay the same tribute to the Minister and to us as I pay to our predecessors who formulated the 1957 Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for the detailed contribution he made on the Bill today.  It was also interesting to listen to Senator Farrell who has a long interest in health care.  He asked many interesting questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the EU third non-life assurance directive, the private medical insurance market is undergoing considerable change.  In 1994, the Health <Col N="851" /> Insurance Act was passed which allows for competition and the regulation of the Irish private insurance market on foot of the third directive on non-life insurance.  Until that time, the VHI had a monopoly on health insurance.  VHI subscriptions were based on the community rating principle, that is, everyone pays the same insurance premium irrespective of the risk of making a claim.  These risks grow progressively with age so community rating involves transfer from the young to the old.  That transfer is justifiable on social grounds because the old are judged to be more vulnerable economically than the young.</P>
    <P>The opposite to community rating is risk rating, whereby premiums are calculated in relation to the probability that a class of subscriber will make a claim.  In a competitive environment, it was the belief of the Government that new entrants to health insurance, either domestic or foreign, would offer lower risk related charges which would mean lower rates for young people.  Senator Farrell touched on this issue.  It was called cherry picking at the time.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies indicated that it was its view that community rating is a principle worth defending.</P>
    <P>In 1990, the European Union Commission presented its proposals for the completion of the internal market in direct insurance.  The Irish Government was successful in its submission to the Commission and, as a result, the Commission in its recognition of the social importance of private health insurance and in the interests of the general good, allowed member states to provide for community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover and related matters.  The Health Insurance Act 1994 establishes the regulatory framework within which foreign insurers wishing to pursue health insurance schemes must operate.</P>
    <P>With the implementation of the Bill before the House, the VHI, with its extensive knowledge and expertise <Col N="852" /> within the Irish market, should be in a better position to meet the challenge of competition.  The VHI was established in 1957 and its success could be measured by the fact that one in every three of the population are members.</P>
    <P>The role of the VHI in the development of the health care service in Ireland has been significant.  The availability of VHI cover and schemes pursued by the VHI has served to encourage a mixed public and private care and the common good has been served by such an integrated system of health care as it has ensured that the very best expertise and medical know how is available to all patients.  It is difficult to quantify the type of competition that will face the VHI but with more than one million customers, a huge market share by any stretch of the imagination, the VHI has a great deal going for it.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Health and Insurance Act, 1994, potential competitors have been put off by the conditions under which they operate here.  These include the stipulation I mentioned earlier, that all members pay the same premium for the same level of cover regardless of age.  This makes it difficult for competitors to target young healthy people while deterring older people.</P>
    <P>The VHI is seen as a vital arm of public policy.  VHI members contribute, through their premiums, to the cost of their own medical care.  Should members opt out or should people fail to join in large numbers the result would be sharply increased demands on our public health services.  I, therefore, believe the State should have continued to give incentives to people to join the VHI.  The decision to cut tax allowances from the top rate of 48 per cent to the standard rate of 27 per cent tax over two years in effect increases the cost of VHI premiums for many people.  Indeed, there have been many increases in VHI premiums in recent years.  The decision to cut tax allowances was made despite recommendations by the all-party joint committee against the change.  It concluded that the withdrawal of the tax <Col N="853" /> concession would be likely to have a significant adverse effect on membership.</P>
    <P>The full impact of the reduction in the tax allowance will be felt this year and next year unless the Department of Finance agrees to reintroduce the full reliefs.  As this impact is being felt, many members may wonder why they are in the VHI when they are entitled to public health care.  It must come as a surprise to everyone that the VHI was established 40 years ago and there has been no corresponding change in legislation since then.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House proposes to give the VHI explicit powers in relation to dealing with health service providers.  It will be able to add new types of cover to those now on offer. These will include cash payments to people who suffer serious illness.  Policies of this kind are already sold by many banks and insurance companies. This will turn the VHI into a positive force in the market place rather than a price taker obliged to pay what suppliers of service demand.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that it could be anti-competitive and to the detriment of VHI members who are not able to choose which suppliers they want to use. However, it is my view that the ordinary patient is not too concerned about this matter especially if it enables the VHI to exercise some control over cost which, in turn, will enable them to keep premiums down.  If it succeeds in doing this it is likely to meet with general approval.</P>
    <P>With a 6.3 per cent cost to income ratio, the VHI appears to be efficiently run but it certainly needs to recruit new, younger subscribers rather than to reduce benefits or raise premiums for older subscribers.  It is very unfair that a person who has contributed for many years should be penalised by higher charges when the time comes to be a net beneficiary.</P>
    <P>The success of the VHI depends on recruiting young members.  I was glad to note in the Minister's speech that the key target constituency for new products should be young people.  The VHI <Col N="854" /> will be able to tailor packages to attract them into the private health care service. Up to now the VHI has not been aggressive enough in addressing the market for young people.  For instance, many of us insure our own families in the VHI, but when they come to 18 years of age we let them look after their own insurance cover.  When they reach that stage the VHI does not follow them up.  I have experience of that myself. The VHI should be more aggressive in offering these packages and services to 18 year olds.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that Mr. Brian Duncan, formerly of Irish Life plc, has been appointed chief executive.  I know Mr. Duncan personally and I believe that with his experience in the insurance sector and his proven qualities of leadership, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board will be able to meet competition with confidence.  Mr. Duncan will be able to confront the financial difficulties facing the VHI at the moment, with special reference to increasing its reserves.  It is important for the future of the board that the VHI must improve its financial situation as well as increasing its reserves.</P>
    <P>I was also pleased to note in the Minister's speech that under the Bill the chief executive will be responsible for managing and controlling generally the administration and business of the VHI. This puts the chief executive on a par with his counterparts in other commercial State bodies in regard to carrying out his tasks for effective management and change.  I welcome the restructuring of VHI management, with four new directors who will be involved in sales, finance, marketing and business development.  This will help to put the VHI on a strong commercial footing.</P>
    <P>The measures in the Bill will enable the VHI to become a more vibrant undertaking as well as putting the VHI on the right course to maintain its position as a force in private health insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though we do not yet have to declare an interest, I should <Col N="855" /> say that I am a subscriber, provider, consumer and am involved in every other way in the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, so the Bill is of great interest to me.</P>
      <P>The provision of health care is one of the most important debates going on internationally at present.  As other speakers have pointed out, health care costs have increased dramatically over the past ten to 15 years.  It is interesting to see that in a paper entitled <i>Equity in the Finance of Health Care: Some International Comparisons</i>, by Adam Wagstaff of the Erasmus University in Rotterdam, Ireland is one of the countries used for comparison because of its mix of public and private health care.  In fact, we do not come out of it too badly.</P>
      <P>Private health care in this country has, to date, been organised totally by the VHI.  When it was first set up it was one of the most exemplary schemes that one could be involved in.  It was effective because at that time a large number of people were not covered by health care.  At very low cost, within firms in particular.  VHI schemes were set up which citizens could become members of.  A large number of people immediately became members and since then the VHI has enjoyed a great consumer loyalty.  It must have been doing a good job otherwise it would not have retained that loyalty.  At the same time, the State was improving its facilities considerably.</P>
      <P>While I am praising the State system now.  I hope the Minister will allow me on another occasion to criticise various areas that are still neglected.  When the VHI scheme was introduced it was extremely effective but State medicine has improved enormously since then. This means that VHI subscribers expect a great deal more than they did in the past.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the various areas that have caused financial problems for the VHI.  which ran into the most appalling situation at the end of the 1980s.  Were it not for the review body set up by the previous Minister, it would have been impossible for the VHI to pay its bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> The State picks up an enormous amount of fees for VHI and non-VHI subscribers.  This is a real plus for the VHI, but one that it is not sufficiently aware of.  For example, all preventative medicine schemes and immunisation campaigns are carried out by the State. Accident emergency services deal with private and public patients on an equal basis, so the VHI's problems are solved there.</P>
    <P>I am amazed to hear people suggesting the establishment of a type of private accident and emergency system and I dread to think how it would operate. More preferable is the suggestion, made in recent Department of Health radio advertisements, that people with minor ailments should attend their GPs rather than going to an accident and emergency service which, in general, is for really serious problems.  One of the major complaints from patients is the delay within the accident and emergency service, but that delay is because 40 per cent of those attending it are non-urgent cases.  Unfortunately, we are aggravating the situation that is being complained about.</P>
    <P>People covered by the VHI are often also covered by medical cards.  VHI contributions to some services, such as nursing and physiotherapy for elderly patients, are less generous and, I have to say, less efficient than those supplied by the public services.  In many of those cases, the public service picks up the bill for those covered by VHI.  The cost of drugs is covered for many of those contributing to the VHI but who have medical cards.  That is another saving. Others covered by the VHI prefer to go to clinics in public hospitals as not all are as bad as they are made out.</P>
    <P>However, there are major advantages for those who opt for private health schemes.  I am transposing the VHI with private health schemes because that is the main one operated in this country, although some people are covered by BUPA and the private patient scheme. An important aspect of a private health scheme is that it gives patients a choice of doctor.  To some extent general practitioners <Col N="857" /> still have some power as regards who they refer patients to in the hospital sector.  In many parts of Britain general practitioners are only in a position to refer to specific hospitals, whether they are trust or sector hospitals.</P>
    <P>We do not realise the advantage which patients have here.  Due to the non-sectorisation of hospitals into areas, patients are entitled to be referred to whom their general practitioner decides is best.  Another advantage which private health care gives patients is that they have some control over the timing of their treatment and waiting times may not be too long.  However, waiting time for private treatment can often be extensive due to the restrictions put in place by the VHI on some private hospitals, although a person has more control over when they enter hospital.</P>
    <P>Another important issue for many is privacy and it should possibly be available to all patients.  When Dr. John O'Connell was Minister for Health he brought in a charter for patients.  One of the things which was high on that list was that privacy should be available for all patients.  He did not consider that curtains around a bed constituted privacy and I support that.  It is unacceptable to question patients about their private lives with people adjacent to them, whether in the outpatients department or in wards.</P>
    <P>Costs have escalated as a result of innovations in medical technology, greater patient expectation and litigation. I was interested to hear Senator Farrell raise the issue of litigation as being a problem with health care costs. There have been considerable increases in hi-tech medicine internationally and in medical innovations.  We are only at the beginning of such innovations, particularly when one looks at the possibilities of genetic engineering.  Once a machine is available, it will be used. People often ask how they managed without a CAT scan or a MRI scanner. The greatest problem once a machine is available is patient demand for investigations. The value of such machines is <Col N="858" /> not assessed frequently enough or pointed out to the patient.  Senator Farrell said that one could come out of hospital covered with pin pricks because of the array of tests.</P>
    <P>The risks of investigations are not pointed out.  One only needs to look at litigation in the medical profession to see that often some of it involves investigations. A better assessment by the medical profession of the risks of any investigations and a better explanation about them to patients would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Another expense which comes under recent hi-tech medicine relates to the new drugs which have been introduced. It is important that these drugs are carefully looked at.  I was interested to hear that the Institute of Pharmacists at a recent seminar pointed out that Irish people were among the lowest drug users in Europe.  It was felt that the consumption of a greater amount of medicine might do us a lot of good.  There is little to show a relative increase in health with an increase in drug use. There is no need for me to tell Members that changes in lifestyle are far more important.</P>
    <P>The use and abuse of drugs within the health service must be looked at carefully. Drugs are important from both a cost and health point of view.  A recent survey in St. James's Hospital on patients with pneumonia discovered that those treated with antibiotics orally did as well as those treated with antibiotics intravenously, but the difference in cost was enormous.  It is important to treat patients with the simplest antibiotics possible because there has been an emergence of Methicillin resistant staphlococcus aureus in hospitals.  At present we only have a 7 per cent incidence of this but in Spain, where drugs are more widely used, the incidence is 52 per cent.  I gather it is not an arithmetic progression once this starts but a geometric one.</P>
    <P>We must explain to patients that repeated demands for antibiotics or other drugs can have deleterious effects on their health.  Patient demands are <Col N="859" /> high and people believe there is a cure for all ills, which is not possible.  It has been suggested that there must be more and better technology to deal with conditions. The situation should be explained to the public through the Health Education Bureau.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell mentioned litigation. The cost of defensive medicine must be enormous.  A large number of investigations are done because doctors are afraid that if the patient is dissatisfied, they will be asked why they did not do a certain test.  Sad cases come before the courts from time to time where one may believe that a certain investigation should have been done and might have been of value.  For the large number of investigations done, many others are of doubtful value.</P>
    <P>The VHI has gone through a bad time with consumers, doctors, health providers and the hospitals. The consumers believe they pay high fees but do not get much value.  The VHI made foolish promises and decided to cover people who do not suffer from what could be described as a sickness.  For example, I do not know why the VHI, in a country with the highest fertility rate in Europe, decided to cover child birth.  If there were problems in childbirth, they should definitely have been covered.  However, the expense was not examined carefully before the VHI decided to provide this cover.  If, for example, the money had been put into screening programmes for women who were in a position to have mammographies or cervical smears, these types of preventative areas of medicine could have been better served.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has caused distress to patients is that the VHI has decided what are and what are not day care procedures.  I do know how many Members have had procedures carried out on a day care basis.  Such procedures are done safely but, for many ill people, it is with some inconvenience and a great deal of distress.  Patients who are not in the whole of their health &mdash;<Col N="860" /> otherwise they would not be in hospital &mdash; must turn up before 8 a.m. and generally do not leave the hospital until 8 p.m., usually having had a general anaesthetic and possibly an uncomfortable procedure during the day.  Social conditions in Ireland have improved enormously and it is possible to discharge people.  However, if a comparison was made between public and private patients seen on a day care basis, would it be found that a higher proportion of private patients are seen on a day care basis?</P>
    <P>The relationship between the VHI and the medical profession was very bad and there were prolonged negotiations regarding the setting up of the preferred providers scheme in which approximately 80 per cent of consultants are now involved.  The situation arose because patients who were covered by the VHI and went to a doctor then received bills, sometimes for many hundreds of pounds, after they felt the doctor had been adequately paid by the VHI, felt very aggrieved.  However, the problem is that, after getting so many people into the full cover scheme, the bills to consultants appear higher than ever.  I do not know what method the VHI used to assess the worth of different matters.  However, some doctors, physicians in particular, feel they are still in an invidious situation compared to others and balance billing is the result.</P>
    <P>A third area in which there have been problems is the relationship of the voluntary health hospitals.  The ongoing crisis in the discussions between the private hospitals and the VHI is unsatisfactory. For example, St. Joseph's in Mullingar was forced to take the VHI to court before it could have its payments made.  The VHI is now in a position to delist hospitals.  However, the increase in the number of private beds in public hospitals has been important in terms of payment towards the public health system. When the Minister controls premia, he has an advantage over the public hospitals.  I hope this Bill will mean competition, but I am not sure that will <Col N="861" /> be the case.  Private health care is extraordinarily expensive.  I was in Detroit some time ago and I saw all the private hospitals closed there.  As we know, the US features private health <i>par excellence.</i></P>
    <P>The reduction in tax relief on the hotel accommodation part of the higher plans does not seem unreasonable. However, Ms Caroline Gill of the Consumers' Association of Ireland stated in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on 19 July 1994 that the alternatives between public and private health care must be examined carefully.  Consumers may decide they are not getting value for their money and other organisations coming into the country may not consider it a lucrative market in which to find business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his lengthy explanation of the origins and development of the VHI.  In common with other Senators, I welcome the Bill.  The strength of the original legislation is obvious, given that the organisation has existed since 1957 and amending legislation is only now required.</P>
      <P>In many ways we must thank the VHI for its work to date.  I do not benefit from the VHI in the same way as Senator Henry.  However, I am grateful to it because in recent years my family has had occasion to call on it.  My husband was seriously ill and the existence of the VHI was of enormous benefit to us.  It meant the cost of his health care was not a major worry at the time.  The VHI is courteous and efficient in dealing with queries and many people like me have occasion to be thankful for its work.  The Minister said that only 6 per cent of the premia went towards the cost of administration and this must compare favourably to any private or public organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VHI is facing competition and it is important that it is geared to cope with that change.  I hope it will be in a position to stave off the competition from abroad.  It is important it receives every assistance possible given the service <Col N="862" /> it has provided to the public. People would like it to continue to prosper and provide the same service. However, one aspect which must be queried is why approximately 35 per cent of the population joined the VHI compared to 12 per cent of people in Britain with private medical insurance. In EU terms, Ireland is regarded as having a lower standard of living than Britain.  How can 35 per cent of our population afford to join a voluntary health insurance scheme?  Is it because many Irish people are not aware of their exact entitlements under the public health service?</P>
    <P>For many years the view was that, unless one had a medical card, one could not receive services in public hospitals at a reasonable cost.  The public is not generally aware of the level of service available to them.  I imagine many people who join the VHI are in the lower socio-economic group and can barely afford the premia imposed by the VHI over the years.  Perhaps people wish to cover all possibilities and the VHI is viewed as insurance for the future when a person may need something done in a hurry.  People are prepared to pay VHI premia to cover that eventuality.  I am also surprised at the statistics quoted by the Minister when he stated that £57.2 million was paid to public hospitals as against £107 million to private hospitals.  I would like to see the comparative figures with regard to patients covered and treatments provided in the two areas.  Far more patients go through the public hospitals, so that while the Minister says the VHI is underpinning the public hospitals, perhaps the reverse is true.  Many of the services, equipment, nursing and other ancillary staff provided by public hospitals are not being effectively charged out to the VHI.  In this respect public health is subsidising private care.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to ascertain the cost of a foot or hip operation and it will then be apparent if a private hospital is charging over and above what would be a fair price.  Such transactions should be subjected to the same consumer laws <Col N="863" /> and rights as are applicable elsewhere. There should also be a greater scrutiny of costs with a view to ascertaining why some operations cost more and some consultants charge more than others. There should be a level beyond which increases should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the new board will have an increased membership.  The number of health service providers on the board should not be limited to two; there should be three.  In addition, the consultants, medical staff and administrators of hospitals should have a voice on the board.  Nursing care in hospitals has not been taken into account.  Nurses should have a greater say in the way our health services, private and public, are run.  They are the people who see more of the patients and what is happening. They have a good idea of what is going on and can see the flaws and faults quicker than the doctors who come and go.  They can also be critical of mistakes made in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased the Minister intends to have a greater consumer input to the board.  At the risk of being sexist I ask him to include a strong representation of women because more of them are carers in society than men.  When children or elderly people are in hospital it is often women, whether they be mothers, daughters or wives, who are in attendance.  They have a greater insight into the way the hospitals are run and usually have more practical and down to earth suggestions as to how services can be improved.</P>
    <P>There is a great need to attract young people to contribute to the health services. Children of 18 years of age who come off their parents insurance should be targeted and included.  We need their money to prop up the older generation. Our population is greying and care of the elderly will be a major problem for all of us in the years to come.  Unless the next generation is willing to partake in an insurance scheme the money will not be there for the care of the elderly.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Farrell's assertion that if medicine was privatised <Col N="864" /> the cost would come down.  Anybody who has even the slightest input to or knowledge of the American system would realise that health care in America is extremely expensive, even for the most minor and routine operations, Sometimes people find it less expensive to travel to Europe, where there is more public health care, to undergo routine operations.  There is no evidence to prove that privatising medicine would reduce costs; the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>Perhaps health costs have increased because of the lack of availability of health care.  In the 1950s many people died because of the lack of health care. We are now keeping people alive longer.  This would not be the position if the infant mortality rate today was similar to that which existed in the 1950s.  I would prefer my relations who are now living and are a cost to the State in terms of health care, to continue to live and be supported through my taxes than to have masses said for them every year.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that, if one joins the VHI, one is guaranteed a certain level of service.  Over the years, many people have been confused by developments in the service provided.  For example, at one time maternity expenses were fully paid.  Then that was cut back but reintroduced. Ordinary members of the VHI would be unable to tell for what they were covered because of these changes.  With every crisis some services are cancelled only to be reintroduced following public demand.  The VHI should make clear to what benefits members are entitled and should then offer other benefits subject to negotiation.</P>
    <P>We should encourage the broadest participation in the VHI because without this it cannot continue to survive. This is a good Bill.  It is designed to improve and help the VHI continue into the next century.  Long may it do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It might have been a little longer and more detailed and it would have been better had it been introduced after a White Paper on health insurance.  However, in <Col N="865" /> general, I welcome most of its provisions.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the growth of the VHI has been such that membership is now 1.3 million or 35 per cent of the population.  Is this due to fear or value for money?  One knows that when one has private health insurance one can jump the queue, as it were.  However, the VHI has done a good job so far in many, although not all, respects.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he will remain the 100 per cent shareholder.  Will continued State ownership of the VHI put the State in the position of being an operator in the health insurance market while, at the same time, being the regulator and effective manager of the health sector?  Surely there is a conflict of interest there.  Perhaps the Minister would explain the position further.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that he is disposed towards supporting and developing attractive and imaginative products aimed at enhancing the VHI membership and revenue.  That is a welcome development.  A number of areas could be covered by the VHI which are not covered at present.  Cosmetic plastic surgery and infertility treatment are not covered but I am aware that at least one hospital in Dublin is carrying out silicone breast implants under the guise of necessary surgery.  That is an abuse of the system.  Such things weigh the costs for people who need necessary treatments. If people want cosmetic surgery they should have to pay for it out of their own pockets unless it is absolutely essential for their well being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other treatments could be covered. There is, for example, an established cure for Parkinson's disease, a very debilitating condition.  It is provided in America and Sweden and I am in direct contact with a gentleman from my home town of Killybegs who had this operation. It was very successful and cured the condition.  There is no funding for this from the VHI.  I understand the VHI would be unable to pay for somebody who wishes to ramble around the <Col N="866" /> world for unproven operations but the VHI should look at covering operations which have proven to be effective and can be provided only in another country.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see the VHI more involved in primary health care, for example, covering the fees of psychologists who do a great job keeping patients out of hospital.  Within hospitals psychologists do much the same work as psychiatrists whose fees are covered while the psychologists' are not.  It is worth noting in this regard that many of the therapies used &mdash; for example, behaviour therapy, cognitive therapy, reality therapy and so on &mdash; were founded by psychologists and not by other professions.</P>
    <P>The composition of the board is extended from five members to 12. Although I believe small is beautiful I have no problem with that decision.  I agree with the Minister in one regard &mdash; I am a health care professional and two such professionals on the board are more than enough.  I doubt that people who are health care professionals know much about insurance and this is, after all, an insurance company.  Too frequently they get involved in inappropriate areas.  A good friend of mine owns a large number of private health care facilities in the United States.  He has a degree in hospital administration but he is not a doctor or anything else in that area and he runs fantastic hospitals.  The Minister is wise in making this decision.</P>
    <P>Confidentiality is an important aspect of this Bill.  Too frequently calls are made by solicitors in claims cases or whatever looking for delicate information without the permission of the patient.  I am glad to see that this cannot be done under the Bill.  I also agree with the Minister that there is no need for a statutory body to examine complaints. The members advisory council should be given a chance and the Ombudsman can take care of many such complaints anyway.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he is fully committed to preserving an equitable and effective system of community rating in the <Col N="867" /> interests of all our people.  He also agreed to the principles of open enrolment and lifetime cover.  These are welcome provisions but I remind the Minister that the VHI is not always everything it is said to be.  It has a number of problems from time to time.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to relations between the VHI and hospitals.  The Minister is aware that 19 hospitals are members of the Independent Hospitals Association of Ireland and they have not yet been able to conclude an agreement with the VHI this year.  The primary concern of these hospitals is the health and well being of their patients. I am concerned that the VHI has threatened to partially participate hospitals that do not succumb to its demands. This is an abuse of its monopoly position. It is also anti-competitive.</P>
    <P>If partial participation is imposed, patients will be billed for their hospital treatment and will only be able to recover part of the cost from the VHI. This will have serious implications for patients.  Indeed, some people might decide not to avail of VHI cover and opt for public hospital treatment, thereby increasing the financial cost to the Exchequer.  Partial participation could threaten the very survival of some private hospitals.  I am deeply concerned that there is an annual ritual of unwarranted aggravation by the VHI, who play this aggravation out month by month.</P>
    <P>The VHI estimates that costs will rise this year by 3.5 per cent.  The Independent Hospitals Association is seeking an increase of 3.5 per cent to cover increased costs.  The VHI has been giving misleading information when it says that private hospitals are seeking a higher increase; that is not the case.  The VHI is muddying the water by quoting higher figures which include specific requests by a few individual hospitals for the introduction of new services or the purchase of new equipment.</P>
    <P>Another problem is the issue of cover for 180 days for general care <i>versus</i> 40 days for psychiatric care.  This discriminates <Col N="868" /> against psychiatric patients.  Why should somebody with a mental illness be covered for 40 days when a person with a serious physical illness is covered for 180 days?  There is no logic in that and it is grossly discriminatory.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister, who retains 100 per cent interest in this body, will look at these problems and, knowing him as I do, he will give them his attention. I do not wish to criticise the Minister because the Bill is good and he has done good work introducing it. However, I ask him to bear in mind the problems the VHI create for people in the health care area.  It would be lovely if there was some way in which costs &mdash; when they are established &mdash; could be paid out in order to avoid the aggravation that goes on year after year with some hospitals.</P>
    <P>I also hope the Minister will look at the cover aspects.  There are abuses in the system; I have mentioned one of them but there are others.  When consultants abuse the system costs are raised for everybody else.  This should not happen but it is a fact of life.</P>
    <P>In general, the Bill is good.  It is not a long Bill but it is important.  I am glad to see it before the House and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank Senators for their general support of the Bill.  This Bill is one of three important legislative measures.  One is the Health Insurance Act, 1994, which implemented the EU directive on non-life insurance and effectively laid out the statutory ballpark for any company that wishes to offer health insurance in Ireland in competition with the VHI.  I have already explained the import of this second Bill in the context of competition.  The third are the health insurance regulations to which Senator Lydon referred and which I should be in a position to promulgate in the Oireachtas shortly.  The health insurance regulations were published last March in draft form for discussion purposes.  There have been many submissions from interest groups <Col N="869" /> and the public and one of the significant issues which has arisen is the issue of psychiatric care and the number of days allowed.  We have approached the EU Commission with a view to enhancing the provision for psychiatric care and matters are reaching a conclusion in Brussels.  I will be in a position to bring in before long satisfactory regulations which will be welcomed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The contributions made today demonstrate a shared desire and concern for the future of the VHI.  People realise it is a very important asset to the country and want its future secured.  It must progress as a financially sound undertaking. The 1957 legislation which instituted the VHI obliges it to balance its books. Although it is a non-profit organisation it must pay its way.  Premium income must meet the costs of the outgoings. There may be other more radical ways of changing the VHI than I have proposed in this Bill, but orderly and measured change is what the VHI's circumstances need.</P>
      <P>A commitment and determination exists on my part to explore and implement such further change as may be identified as beneficial to the VHI, but before I would proceed to do so I would like the benefit of the advice of a larger board which would bring in actuarial, management and accounting skills, all the skills necessary for a modern insurance company.  After the new board has settled in and evaluated the situation, I am prepared to listen to any advice it might put forward with regard to changing the corporate structure in line with the recommendations of the review group.  It recommended that while the Minister should continue to be the 100 per cent shareholder, there should be a change in the corporate status.  It will, in effect, bring the VHI into line with the structures we have in Telecom Éireann and An Post which are more removed from ministerial control and allow more freedom in the exercise of functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Farrell made a number of interesting points and his experience on <Col N="870" /> the health board is shared by many of us.  I am glad of his support for the composition of the board which limits the number of health providers on the board.  Many of us have had the experience on health boards that however excellent the medical or sectional representation may be, they have divided interests &mdash; they are expected to represent their interest groups on one hand and that may frequently conflict with their overall functions as members of a board.  Such experience on a health board has convinced me that we should limit the number of health providers on the board of the VHI.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Farrell that we should move totally to a private system of health care and have a contracting in system.  We have to retain the mix of public and private.  We can see from the experience in the UK and other countries that a total or near total dependence on the public or private system is self-defeating.  We have succeeded in developing the health services in a systematic way, benefiting from the mix of public and private systems, and that is how I propose to continue.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle raised the matter of the reduction of income tax relief on VHI premiums.  As he has pointed out, in the 1994 budget the then Government announced that income tax relief on health insurance premiums would only be allowable at the standard rate. This approach to taxation was recommended by the Commission on Taxation, the Culliton group and by the NESC.  The argument has been put forward that discretionary tax reliefs should be curtailed and when they are provided it should be at the standard rate so as to be of equal benefit to all citizens.  I was not in Government at the time that decision was taken but the decision taken in 1994 was phased in and that is continuing this year when there will be a further reduction in tax benefit.  I have no proposal, and I understand the Minister for Finance has no proposal, to change that.</P>
    <P>A number of people queried the cost and the level of premia which have been <Col N="871" /> applied.  For the information of the House it is worth noting that an increase in VHI premium of 15 per cent, which is very high, was implemented in that last two years in two phases &mdash; 9 per cent in August 1994 and 6 per cent in September 1995.  The August 1994 increase was stepped so that plans C, D and E, which comprise 20 per cent of VHI members, were increased by 9 per cent and 12 per cent and plans A and B, which comprise 80 per cent of the members, were increased by between 6 per cent and 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>The September 1995 increase was the first and only increase during my period as Minister for Health.  It was indicated to me in July last that is was proposed to make a 6 per cent increase from 1 September 1995 and I concurred with that proposal.  As Senators will note, the Bill will change the statutory responsibility on the VHI.  To date there was a formal procedure whereby it informed the Minister of an increase as a matter of courtesy.  Once informed, there was nothing a Minister could do but acknowledge receipt of the information. I am taking a formal statutory power under this Bill to reject an increase.  The mechanism will be that the VHI will indicate to the Minister it wants to increase premia.  If the Minister does nothing, after a short waiting period the premia are increased.  If the Minister intervenes he can veto an increase, or in the normal course of negotiations the Minister can ask the VHI to modify its proposal and resubmit it.</P>
    <P>I referred to the composition of the board.  I am aware the Leas-Chathaoirleach has made a case for a stronger representation of service providers.  Two service providers is probably adequate on a board of 12 people.  I would be afraid of a situation arising in which a board would become totally representational. One should consider the pressures on the Minister for Health from the different sectors &mdash; the consultants association, the IMO, the GPs, administrative staff in hospitals, the nurses organisation and unions will all look for <Col N="872" /> membership.  One could easily end up with eight to ten representatives of service providers on the board of the VHI with a conflict of interest which is not necessarily in the interests of the consumer. It is important to have the experience of the service providers on the board, but I do not want them to dominate the board and I do not want the board to be representational.  I want it to be akin to a board one might find in the private sector running a private insurance company, a commercial enterprise.  It is those skills, rather than health provision skills, which are needed in addition to the service providers.</P>
    <P>A membership of 12 is appropriate and five members would be too few. Senator Kelly referred to representation of women and that will be taken into account.  There is a directive from the Minister for Equality and Law Reform that at least 40 per cent of a board would be women.  At present two of the five are women so the 40 per cent level is matched.  I hope that level will be maintained on the restructured board.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell raised the issue of how astronomical increases occurred over a 15 years period.  I gave figures in my speech for the budget of the VHI which was about £22 million in 1980 and was £220 million 15 years later.  Senator Henry has effectively replied to that and pointed out all the developments in medicine that have taken place in the meantime.  Indeed, you made the point very forcibly, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, that there was not very good health care in the 1950s.  It had improved by the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s and is improving all the time.  The service is significantly better now across the population.  That is a factor, apart from the high cost of new technology and the increased demands on the service.</P>
    <P>A story which runs quite frequently in the newspapers was touched on again by a number of Senators here.  It is to the effect that when the market was opened, insurance companies would come from abroad and cherrypick the market.  They would offer insurance to <Col N="873" /> the young, who by definition are healthy and low-risk, and would refuse cover to the elderly and the high-risk.  Under the 1994 Bill it is illegal to do that.  Anybody offering insurance on the market has to agree to the principles of community rating and will have to offer open enrolment and lifetime cover.  This is effectively a subsidy between the generations. We look after our children and, when they come to working age, they pay a VHI contribution which subsidises the older people in the population.  In due course as they get older themselves they will become significant beneficiaries. That is not to say that young people do not become sick, do not have to go to hospital, do not need cover; we are talking in general terms.  This item of policy is enshrined in law and neither the VHI nor any other insurance company can come in and cherrypick the market because it would be illegal.  I am not proposing any change to that situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell again asked about cash products.  Some of the competition will provide cash products in the market, so the VHI has to be positioned to do that as well.  The VHI in future could perhaps pay an amount towards out of pocket expenses arising from an episode of illness.  A fixed daily sum rather than a full indemnity could be provided towards the cost of a hospital stay, but the general policy will be to continue with indemnity products rather than to provide partial cover by way of cash payments.  It will be a matter for the VHI to explore the appropriate cash products and to make proposals to me in this regard.  Under the terms of the Bill, the consent of the Minister for Health is required for the implementation of new schemes.</P>
    <P>I commend Senator Doyle's recommendation to the VHI.  Many of us have children moving into the workforce and it is usual to ask the VHI to take those children off the family cover.  Any company with any awareness of marketing would immediately write to those being taken off cover and ask them to take out personal cover, or they would find out <Col N="874" /> where they were working and ensure that they were encouraged to join the group scheme at their place of work. Significant numbers of young people slip out of VHI cover, have no cover for quite a while and are then attracted to some of the flashier products on the insurance market, which do not give them full indemnity but which might give them full cash benefit and which might also give them the impression that they are fully covered when they are not.  I am very conscious of that.  If competition comes into the market it will be market driven but it will also be marketing driven.</P>
    <P>Consumers should be very careful to find out what is actually in the package they are paying for.  It would be very easy to give someone aged 25, with that feeling of invincibility we all had when we were 25, the impression that they have full and adequate cover when they do not.  The VHI will have to watch for that as well.  All insurers will have to be clear on what they are offering to their members and will have to explain their products publicly.  Experience of health insurance operations elsewhere suggests that small print is often overlooked by the consumer and that companies can abuse their position.  Under the regulations which I referred to under the Health Insurance Act, 1994, I have powers to regulate advertising and promotion of health insurance business if there is a problem for consumers.  I will keep a close eye on it and I will do so if necessary.</P>
    <P>My Department has established very close links with the Insurance Ombudsman in regard to health insurance and these contacts will continue.  It is noteworthy also that the terms of reference of the recently established VHI members' advisory council includes reviewing all communications, including product terms, with VHI members, and suggesting ways in which they can be improved.  The VHI will have to engage in expert marketing in the future to maintain their share of the market.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell made the point that the objective is not to drive the VHI's <Col N="875" /> share of the market from 35 per cent of the population up to 50 per cent of the population, but to maintain the age-balance within its share of the market so it does not end up with all the high risk older people and very few young people.  Balance is the key factor for the future of the VHI rather than the actual proportion of the market it commands. This message will have to be communicated to future members, together with the message that the VHI, as all Senators have acknowledged, provides an excellent service.  While we have complaints from time to time, in general terms if we were asked to rate the VHI as a health insurance agency we would say that it provides a very good service.</P>
    <P>The point was raised by you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, about the difference in payments to private and public hospitals and private wards in public hospitals. There is a subsidy.  VHI insurance is deemed to cover the total cost of health care in the private hospitals.  I know there is an argument about some consultants not accepting full and final settlement &mdash; although over 90 per cent of consultants have now accepted this &mdash; but in general terms it is the intention of the VHI to cover the total economic cost of the patient in the private hospital within the limits of whatever plan the patient has subscribed to.</P>
    <P>The situation in the public hospital is different.  Effectively it is a contribution from VHI to top up an existing situation and it does not cover the economic cost. That explains the discrepancy.  There are other benefits.  If people pay for private care, to one degree they are privileged; but they are also freeing resources on the public side which public patients can then use.  It is not a straight line sum and the compatible mix of public and private is very important.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry talked about the VHI covering maternity cases and Senator Kelly referred to the arrangements that are in place for maternity cover.  Whatever about the necessity for covering maternity care, arguments could be <Col N="876" /> made in terms of marketing for covering maternity care as this would ensure that children are covered when they are born and that the family base of VHI, which depends on including young and old in the family schemes, remains in place.  If one thinks of it as a piece of effective marketing rather than a decision based on medical necessity or social necessity, it makes more sense.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senator that the rules have changed with a degree of frequency that has confused expectant mothers about whether they are covered or not.  More information will have to be provided; this will be one of the major benefits of competition.  The people who have exercised a monopoly up to now will have to sharpen up.  They will have to provide better information as well as a better service to the consumers.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed and I thank you all for the general welcome the Bill has received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>is breá liom go bhfuair mé deiseanna ar ócáidí éagsúla ó ceapadh mé mar Aire Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta, le freagracht orm i ndáil le polasaí craolacháin, teacht isteach sa Teach seo chun páirt a ghlacadh i ndíospóireachtaí faoi chúrsaí craolacháin.  Perhaps the most significant of these debates was during the passage of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, through its various Stages before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is opportune to reflect on developments since that time.  The 1993 legislation was passed and, in removing the statutory advertising revenue and <Col N="877" /> minutage limits imposed by the Broadcasting Act, 1990, addressed a then serious and growing crisis in the broadcasting, advertising, marketing and independent film production sectors. The 1993 Act also required RTÉ to make available a specific and growing amount of funding each year for the commissioning of independently produced programmes.  RTÉ's report on the first year of the operation of these provisions, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in May of last year, showed that a total of 258 hours of programming at a cost of £5.53 million were commissioned.  Independent programmes covered a number of programme stands, including features and sport, current affairs, drama, Irish language programmes, agriculture and gardening, variety, documentaries and young peoples' programming.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the generally positive tone of the report and I believe it shows the capacity of independent Irish programme makers to contribute to the schedules of the national broadcaster. The report on RTÉ activities in 1995, during which the figure for independent productions was £6.5 million, is due before 31 March and I look forward to another successful year of commissioned programmes.</P>
    <P>Another major development in broadcasting matters was the decision by Government to proceed with the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge as a separate national channel.  Senators will be aware that until Teilifís na Gaeilge can be established as a separate legal entity, RTÉ have been entrusted with the establishment and initial operation of the station.  RTÉ has appointed an advisory committee &mdash; Comhairle Theilifís Gaeilge &mdash; to advise on certain matters, such as staffing, the character of the new service and the stockpiling of programmes prior to transmission.</P>
    <P>RTÉ expects that the service will come on air on 31 October this year.  A considerable amount of the technical infrastructure has been built.  Tá tús curtha leis an obair thógála do Cheannáras Theilifís na Gaeilge i mBaile na hAbhann. <Col N="878" /> Tá roinnt de na príomh-tharchurad óirí insealbhaithe, agus tástáil déanta orthu, cheana féin agus beidh an próiséas sin críochnaithe leis na príomhtharchuradó irí uile faoi dheireadh an Earraigh.  Tá an obair i nDáil leis an gcóras ceangail tarchuradóireachta ag dul ar aghaidh go maith freisin.</P>
    <P>On the programming side, the first round of commissions was published in April 1995.  De thoradh an chéad bhabhta coimisiúnaithe, tá Teilifís na Gaeilge tar éis conradh a thairiscint cheana féin do bhreis agus fiche comhlacht léirithe i ngach cúige den tír, Tuaisceart Éireann ina measc.  De thoradh na gconarthaí seo, beidh 30 uair a chloig de chláracha nua á léiriú don stáisiún. Creidim gur sheol os cionn 40 comhlacht iarratais isteach de thoradh an dara babhta coimisiúnaithe agus go bhfuil na hiarratais sin á meas faoi láthair, rud atá fior freisin faoi na tairiscintí do léiriú Ros na Rún.  There is no doubt but that considerable benefits will accrue to the independent companies as a result.  A second round was published in September 1995 and the staff of Teilifís na Gaeilge have high hopes of success in this round also.</P>
    <P>The local radio sector continues to consolidate its position as an essential part of the choice of broadcasting services available to the Irish viewer and listener.  Senators will also be aware that the Independent Radio and Television Commission recently awarded the franchise for a national independent radio service and is in consultation with the promoters of a national independent television service.  These undertakings will, if successful &mdash; and I wish them every success &mdash; add considerably to the choice on offer to Irish viewers and listeners.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the Green Paper on the future of broadcasting &mdash; an Páipéar Glas.  The developments, to which I have already referred, provide a sound basis on which to formulate a strategy and policy for the future.  However, it would be foolhardy not to recognise that there are many challenges facing us in the future as the world of broadcasting <Col N="879" /> changes through technological development and changes in attitude to the regulation of the broadcasting sector. Our broadcasting structures are essentially 30 years old and it is time to review them.  It is vital, in attempting to devise a regulatory environment and structures for broadcasting which will last into the next century, that we set a clear philosophical foundation on which to build our regulatory structure.</P>
    <P>I have subtitled the Green Paper &mdash;&ldquo;Active or Passive?  Broadcasting in the Future Tense&rdquo;&mdash; nó mar atá san fhotheideal Gaeilge, &ldquo;Gníomhach nó Fulangach? Fáthmheas ar an Réimse Craolacháin&rdquo;. The key question for us all to address is whether in the future we become passive consumers of a product manufactured and distributed by some distant conglomerate, or are we to be active and in control of our culture and our means of expression; is broadcasting to be an essential element of a healthy democratic process or is it to become in effect an electronic dictator?  Those questions were posed at the core of the Green Paper which was derived from my general cultural policy of being democratic, participatory and interactive. On the other hand, the question arose as to whether broadcasting would be elitist, market-driven and exclusive, the opposite of my proposal.  I welcome the fact that this is a matter of some debate.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper was designed to stimulate a broad ranging and constructive debate on the future of broadcasting in Ireland.  It raised over 50 issues. These included the future and relevance of public service broadcasting; the funding of broadcasting services; Irish language broadcasting.  It asks such questions as: is the existing duopoly in broadcasting bodies appropriate for the future; should broadcast transmission be a separate commercial activity; are the statutory obligations relating to objectivity and impartiality being observed; should RTÉ radio and television be split up; what are the best structures for Teilifís na Gaeilge and where does Raidió na <Col N="880" /> Gaeltachta fit in; is there a demand for regional, local and community television services and how can they be facilitated; how are children and young people to be served by our broadcasting services; where does broadcasting fit in relation to the education system; how can editorial choice in news and current affairs programming be provided for listeners and viewers nationally in the absence of alternative national services to those provided by RTÉ and where does international broadcasting fit into the scheme of things?</P>
    <P>The Green Paper, as is the norm, did not, in general, draw any conclusions. Rather it raised issues that seemed to be important in an attempt to set the framework for the debate and, as can be seen, the many issues raised are on two levels, the philosophical and the practical. I believe that they can be reduced to three questions: what is public service broadcasting?  Is it relevant in today's broadcasting environment and, if so, can we guarantee its future?</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that I have received 130 responses to the Green Paper from a wide range of interests including broadcasters, programme makers, commentators, representative associations, trade unions, interested viewers and listeners and, of course, political parties.  I have become familiar with many of the points of view expressed and the process of developing firm proposals on the core issues is beginning to get under way.</P>
    <P>When I published the Green Paper, I had intended to follow with a White Paper in which my proposals for the future would be laid out.  However, I am concerned at the amount of time the publication of a formal White Paper would add to the legislative process.  It is now my intention to bring my new legislative proposals to Government during the course of this year.  However, there will be an opportunity to debate and comment on the definitive legislative proposals that will emerge.  Senators will appreciate that I cannot bring forward proposals for debate or take definite stances on the details of what might <Col N="881" /> emerge from the process until I have had the opportunity to bring proposals to Government.</P>
    <P>I have been clear that it is my conviction that the public service model of broadcasting with, as I have described before, its inherent democratic values is the model that will best serve the interests of Irish citizens in the future. If this is the accepted view, we will have to face up to what this may entail in terms of revised structures and funding.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of turning the first sod at the site of the headquarters for Teilifís na Gaeilge in Baile na hAbhainn.  In my speech on that occasion I referred to the debate about Teilifís na Gaeilge as being a debate about national self respect, féin mheas náisiúnta.  This is true about broadcasting and media in general.  I was particularly interested in Professor Finbar Bradley's contribution to the Teilifís na Gaeilge debate in today's <i>Irish Times.</i> Professor Bradley recognises that there is more to a broadcasting service than simply whether the service makes money.  He recognises the contribution a service such as Teilifís na Gaeilge can make in social, cultural and economic terms by the contribution it makes to national self-confidence and a spirit of self-reliance.</P>
    <P>We are undoubtedly at a crossroads in relation to the impact of technology on our lives, particularly in relation to the media.  I repeat that model which I have, to some extent, taken from the late Professor Raymond Williams's thinking &mdash; active or passive, are we to be the arrow or the target?  Broadcasting with its ability to reach into the lives of everyone on a constant basis can have a fundamental impact on how we think, how we shape our views of ourselves and of the world, how we put contemporary events into context and how we evolve our system of values.  If broadcasters who are part of and responsible to the communities which they serve and with which they interact cannot be sustained and supported in the new environment, then we are condemning our audiences to being no <Col N="882" /> more than targets for the sale of goods and services.  We, as legislators, must ensure that there will be access for Irish voices and views and that the creativity of Irish programme makers can be affirmed in a complex array of audiovisual services which is becoming available. When I speak about voices, I mean all the different voices.  We have tried to evolve to a point where we have included many people whose voices were lost before.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some Senators have been interested in subscription or pay per view television services, particularly the buying up of exclusive rights to major sporting events.  This is just one practical example of what I mean when I say that public service broadcasters with their tradition of universal reception must be supported.  I am sure many viewers would consider RTÉ to have failed in its public service remit if it did not provide coverage of the All-Ireland finals or soccer and rugby international matches.  I realise that in Britain certain events are listed to prevent them going exclusively to pay per view channels, but I cannot say at present if similar legislation would be possible or appropriate here.  One cannot simply legislate away the rights of sporting organisations, particularly international bodies. We may have to ensure that public service broadcasters can compete with the transnational services which would seek to corner the market on popular programming.</P>
    <P>As I said in chapter 1 of the Green Paper, broadcasting exists today within a set of contradictions.  One can have great expectations for broadcasting.  It can be the motor of modernisation, cultural innovation, social transformation and democratisation.  It can cultivate a healthy public sphere in which national self-confidence flourishes and is oriented towards the future as a set of challenges to be met in a progressive way.  It can critically interrogate a nation's history, culture and identity and offer a vantage point for the renewal of that heritage.  Radio, because of its relatively inexpensive operating costs compared <Col N="883" /> with television and its less daunting technology for participants, can be an essential vehicle to facilitate public communication and debate.</P>
    <P>However, broadcasting can also be a threat, putting profit motive against collective rights, deterritorialised imperialism against minority cultural needs.  It can disfigure us politically, homogenise us linguistically and depress our inclination for cultural expression.  Despite this depressing list of threats I am not pessimistic in my expectations for the future.  I am confident that we can together identify ways in which, through legislation, we can maximise the promise and reduce the threat.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar atá ráite agam, is amhlaidh go bhfuilimíd ag crosbhealach ó thaobh na teicneolaíochta de, agus ó thaobh na meán cumarsáide ach go háirithe.  Tá sé rí-thábhachtach, mar sin, go ndéanfaí breithniú cúramach ar bhonn forleathan ar an todhchaí atá ag teastáil uainn i ndáil leis na gcúrsaí seo uile.  Sa chomhthéacs sin, cuirim fáilte ar leith roimh an díospóireacht sa Teach seo inniú agus beidh mé ag tnúth go mór le tuairimí na Seanadóirí a fháil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has brought an intellectual approach to broadcasting which, perhaps, has been lacking for the past couple of decades. However, he tends to wrap his impressive rhetoric in flannel.  I do not want to take away from the Minister's sincerity in trying to improve or reform broadcasting, but several statements in the past leave a lot to be desired.  I hope the Minister will clarify a few issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks about clear philosophical foundations yet he does not explain what he means by his philosophy. He said he is clear in his conviction that the &ldquo;public service model of broadcasting with its inherent democratic values is the model that will best serve the interests of Irish citizens in the future&rdquo;.  Perhaps he could clarify his concept of &ldquo;public service broadcasting&rdquo; and whether he believes, for example, that RTÉ, which has had a <Col N="884" /> monopoly for the past 30 years, has an inherent democratic value in terms of what it gives to its public and how it decides its programming policy.  Eamon de Valera once said that when he wanted to know what the people were thinking, he looked into his heart.  I sometimes believe that RTÉ looks into its heart whenever it is deciding what the people need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Any comments I make are in the context of the arguments put forward rather than anything the Minister might say.</P>
      <P>Broadcasting, as expounded by the Minister, is sometimes conveyed as a mysterious alien force which needs to be intellectualised and which must have certain aesthetic qualities when, in fact, it is about turning on the radio or television and deciding whether one enjoys what they hear or see.  I am anxious to explore the Minister's concept of public service broadcasting and what he believes it should deliver to the listener and viewer.</P>
      <P>It is now acknowledged by all broadcasting and media commentators that we have entered a hostile broadcasting environment which threatens our Irishness and our position as a cultural entity.  I agree with the Minister's remarks that broadcasting can also be a threat to our identity.  I am confident that the future of this country's cultural identity and its Irishness are safe in the Minister's hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The imminent commencement of TV3 and the granting last week of a new independent commercial radio licence will severely test RTÉ's ability to survive. The increasing strengths of satellite television, the promise by the Murdoch organisation to launch 100 new television channels by the end of the year, the decision by the British Government to allocate 30 new digital television channels to the BBC and ITV and the imminent launch of Channel 5 will provide RTÉ with the biggest ever <Col N="885" /> challenge to its existence since its inception in 1961.  The Minister recognises this and obviously will be taking steps, in so far as he can, to protect our national broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>The onward march of tabloid TV has already breached the so-called quality threshold in the UK, with both BBC and ITV reducing the amount of transmission time for investigative programming in order to satisfy a television audience that is going distinctly down-market. The Minister and I agree that is not a development we would welcome. The Government must intervene by setting quality thresholds in programme schedules.  However, by the year's end &mdash; and sadly for the legislative process &mdash; in only one station of a myriad of choices will the Government have any role to play and that is RTÉ.  I say this in the context of the licences granted to both TV3 and Radio Ireland.  I appreciate that ongoing negotiations between the Independent Radio and Television Commission and the two sponsors involved will have to agree certain programming parameters.  I have no doubt the Minister will be directing policy in that area, as is his right and indeed statutory obligation.</P>
    <P>In the UK, Granada Television and Yorkshire Television, two of the outstanding programme makers in the area of documentaries and investigative reporting, are under budgetary threat to cut back on programmes such as &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo;, which has a very proud record.  Unless a proper financial structure is put in place I fear for the future viability of RTÉ television.  If the examples I have cited in the larger UK market are putting the quality threshold under threat, how will RTÉ be able to survive in the new environment about to come upon us?</P>
    <P>As the Minister and the general public will be aware, the former chairman of the RTÉ Authority, Mr. John Sorohan, in his annual report has signalled the difficulties that will face RTÉ.  Mr. Sorohan states that commercial revenue now represents 60 per cent of total revenue and he goes to state &ldquo;it is unsatisfactory <Col N="886" /> that the future of the broadcasting service is so dependent on a single and potentially volatile source of income.&rdquo;  This is something the Minister touched on when he referred to the commercialisation as distinct from the public service ethos of broadcasting in this country.  It is already creeping inexorably over RTÉ's budgetary position.</P>
    <P>Mr. Sorohan adds that the ability to develop and sustain improved programming services is dependent on security of expectation in relation to revenue.  In other words, give RTÉ its licence increase now, because this is the time to provide that increase, not 12 months time when further competition both internally and externally will have further eroded RTÉ's audience base.  Its lack of resources will prevent it from developing, as Mr. Sorohan again states in his annual report, &ldquo;a properly managed information service within a comprehensive range of quality programming offering a multiplicity of choice for all the citizens of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Although I know John Sorohan wrote that himself, the Minister could also have written it because there is an empathy in the aspirations both men would have in that regard.  That is exactly what the Minister has been saying here today about a comprehensive range of quality programming offering a multiplicity of choice for all the citizens of the State.  They cannot do that if they do not have the money.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record that I do not believe the Minister acted in the best interests of RTÉ and public service broadcasting by diverting £5 million of RTÉ's income to Teilifís na Gaeilge.  It was always believed that this new service would be funded from the Exchequer; yet he has removed over half of RTÉ's operating surplus for the year.  The RTÉ annual report states that this surplus is barely adequate to meet the investment required to develop and expand programming services and to keep abreast of technological change.  I hope therefore that the Minister will give some indication in this debate of <Col N="887" /> how he believes RTÉ can fund its future needs in the face of huge competition.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the decision to proceed with Teilifís na Gaeilge. As the Minister is aware, Fianna Fáil published its own position paper on broadcasting last week.  I do not intend to go into much of its detail other than to cover certain aspects of it.  I know the Minister will have read it, as he has the other 130 submissions made in response to the Green Paper.  We support the concept as it was an initiative instigated by Fianna Fáil while in Government.  I support that policy, but the information to date on how this new service will operate should be open to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the new service will transmit for three hours each evening between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. and between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. RTÉ will be required to provide one hour of this programming schedule with the remainder sourced by the new station and/or the independent sector.  While RTÉ are providing this one hour of Irish language programming they will also be expected to continue to discharge the statutory obligations under the 1961 Act.  This will result in Irish television viewers having the option to view Irish language programmes on two national channels, which is hardly a sensible allocation of scarce resources.</P>
    <P>New transmitters are currently being installed to service Teilifís na Gaeilge. Is the Minister aware of concerns expressed to me that, when operable, Teilifís na Gaeilge will directly interfere with the many deflector TV systems operating along the west coast, especially in Donegal, Mayo and the Minister's own constituency of Galway West?  The Minister is aware of the ongoing controversy in Donegal between those who are benefiting from the deflector systems and the companies who own the legal franchise to operate cable systems in their franchise area.  I suggest that the rows and arguments in that area will be nothing to the war that will break out if the new service interferes with the existing capacity to <Col N="888" /> receive multi-channel television in the west of Ireland.  The Minister may comment on that.  If it is true it is yet another example of the lack of thought and preparation that has gone into setting up the new Irish language television service.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to comment on statements made by the Ceannaire of Teilifís na Gaeilge recently that TV time could be sold to third parties, such as shopping channels, in order to generate income for the new service.  This space would be sold in the two hour period from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. when Teilifís na Gaeilge would not be transmitting Irish language programmes.  If implemented this proposal will, at a stroke, dilute the impact of Teilifís na Gaeilge as a separate channel dedicated to the promotion of the Irish language.  If the Minister had accepted RTÉ's original suggestion to allocate two hours per night of prime time television on Network Two to Irish language programming, many of the criticisms being levelled at his recent initiative could have been avoided. However, as I stated at the outset, Fianna Fáil are on board on this one and I have no intention of departing from that.</P>
    <P>A number of submissions to the Minister in response to the Green Paper referred to the continuing status of 2FM, RTÉ's second radio channel.  The Fianna Fáil position is that in order to more properly fulfil its public service mandate, 2FM should return to its original scheduling when the station commenced in 1979 and adopt a broader musical concept with the reintroduction of music programmes that reflect the various strands of interest in Irish society.  Traditional Irish music is one of the success stories of the Irish music industry in recent years.  &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; is just one example of the widespread acceptance of Irish music presented in a contemporary setting.  There is also a huge audience for easy listening and middle of the road music, which I suggest is not adequately catered for either by 2FM or Radio One.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> Music programmes contribute little more than 10 per cent of Radio One's daily output.  It is no surprise therefore that they are losing audiences to local radio.  According to today's newspapers there has been a further 3 per cent drop in RTÉ Radio One's audience figures and the total Radio One and 2FM audience figures are giving cause for concern. Not only will these audience losses continue but they will suffer a dramatic drop in revenue next autumn when Radio Ireland, with its publicly stated commitment to provide 60 per cent musical output per day, comes on stream.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an important statutory obligation to intervene in directing policy where RTÉ is concerned if it is not operating in the public interest.  I am sure the Minister would agree with that. He does have a statutory obligation to be involved in the policy of the national network, although not in its day to day operations.  After all, this is what the debate, the exercise of providing a Green Paper and subsequent legislation are all about.  The Independent Radio and Television Commission in its submission to the Minister is critical of 2FM schedules.  I would like to publicly commend the head of 2FM, Mr. Bill O'Donovan, for his successful stewardship and the management of the station, which is a success, and the dedication of his small permanent and freelance workforce.</P>
    <P>The Independent Radio and Television Commission in its references to 2FM also states that it is essential that a clear mandate should be drawn up for the station.  It also states that primary consideration must be given to its public service broadcasting commitments and that the support for the licence fee should be based solely on the station fulfilling the public service functions allotted to it.</P>
    <P>Members of the Independent Radio and Television Commission also express their concern that an increasing concentration of television is being placed in the hands of a small elite group of highly paid broadcasters.  They say there <Col N="890" /> is a widely held view that these broadcasters can, and sometimes do, wield a level of influence which is inappropriate for an individual in a semi-State organisation. There is genuine concern about these matters relating to radio and, to a lesser extent, television at the highest levels in RTÉ and a clear policy direction in the Minister's legislative proposals would be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The role of RTÉ as an ambassador for Ireland should not be underestimated. As a broadcaster of some 20 years standing and a former emigrant, I have always been conscious of the Irish diaspora and I have fought long and hard within RTÉ for increased programming that relates to Irish exiles abroad.  I congratulate those within RTÉ, such as Mr. Wesley Boyd, who have championed the cause of extending transmission facilities overseas. Hardly a month passes without a new announcement of the extension of RTÉ's international voice, most recently to Asia and the Far East.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs' subcommittee on Northern Ireland, I raised the issue of an extension of RTÉ to the North.  I was informed that our British friends were dragging their heels in accommodating an increase in transmission power across the Border.  Television and, to a lesser extent, radio is the great leveller.  It is unacceptable that significant portions of the population in the north-east of this island are unable to pick up RTÉ television.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that such is the demand for RTÉ programmes in the Belfast area that in recent weeks advertisements have appeared in local newspapers offering an aerial and installation to receive RTÉ television for the modest sum of £75.  I understand the sponsors of this initiative have been inundated with inquiries.  The Minister should make sure our transmitters are sufficiently boosted to ensure the RTÉ radio and television signal covers all Ireland.  I am aware of the international conventions, but people often ask how it is possible <Col N="891" /> that one can receive BBC radio programmes throughout most of the island. At times in the evening one can pick up radio stations in Tunisia and the north African coast loud and clear, but one cannot get RTÉ television in the middle of London or Belfast.</P>
    <P>In its policy document Fianna Fáil calls for more programmes for emigrants. These programmes should be primarily, but not exclusively, music based.  My experience proves that the vast majority of listeners to Irish radio overseas want to hear Irish music, sport and news.  The new national radio service, which will transmit on AM as well as FM, will, I hope, fill a glaring gap in this area, although I would much prefer RTÉ to develop this type of programming itself.  For example, I have long argued that the wavelengths should be split from 7 p.m., with emigrant type programmes transmitted on medium wave.  This would release the current talk programmes onto the FM band.  I am conscious this is a reversal of the usual trend as music has a greater clarity on FM.  However, due to its limitations, FM would only be picked up within the island of Ireland and this would defeat the purpose of the exercise.  I am not sure if the Minister has received any specific request from RTÉ in the area of split wavelengths, but from informal discussions over a number of years I am aware the Minister might not be adverse to a formal approach on this matter. However, perhaps the situation has changed.</P>
    <P>I welcome, as the Minister has done, the TV3 service which will come on stream before Christmas and I wish them well.  It is an important contributor to the increasing diversity of opinion in Irish broadcasting.  I particularly welcome the creation of a news and current affairs broadcasting outlet separate from RTÉ.  However, I hasten to add that the RTÉ news and current affairs output is second to none and the sponsors of TV3 and those promoting Radio Ireland will have impressive competition in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> I am against monopolies in principle, a view shaped perhaps by over 20 years of experience in Irish broadcasting.  It is, therefore, vital in a democracy and in an age where the visual impact of television is immediate that we in Ireland should have an alternative editorial view of what constitutes news.  The Minister referred to this aspect in his introduction.</P>
    <P>Sadly, RTÉ has a perception of being Dublin based, particularly in its news output, and news executives in RTÉ would be the first to admit that their efforts to regionalise news coverage has not met with great success.  In defence of the news editors in RTÉ, their contribution to this perception is more by omission than any conspiracy by the Dublin 4 set to ignore anything that happens outside the confines of that much maligned Dublin district.  One glaring example is that it snowed all over the west over Christmas but nobody outside the area knew anything about it.  However, we knew what was happening in Northern Ireland and Scotland from filmed reports.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that executives and journalists, like everybody else, are entitled to spend Christmas with their families', but television, radio and the communications industry generally is a 52 week, seven days a week, 24 hours a day service.  However, my experience has been that when I contracted to present radio programmes over the Christmas period, there were several occasions &mdash; the most recent of which was last year &mdash; on which I was required to make a 200 mile round trip from my home in County Leitrim to present programmes live.  Forgive me if I am unsympathetic to claims that, after all, it was Christmas.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister have any proposals in the short term to introduce an amendment to the Broadcasting Bill preventing the purchase of rights to our national sporting events by subscriber pay per view satellite stations?  The Minister touched on this matter and said he must examine it.  However, I ask him to expand on it a little more because this <Col N="893" /> issue is serious in terms of future sporting events in this country.</P>
    <P>I also express concern at the recent takeovers and mergers in the communications industry in the UK following the Government's deregulation of cross media ownership.  I refer specifically to the take over by Granada Television of a regional television station and the subsequent dramatic rise in the share price of Ulster Television on the London stock market.  As the Minister is aware, the market is currently in a merger frenzy and financial commentators have been speculating for some weeks on the possible takeover of Ulster Television by Granada or its other major competitor, Carlton Communications.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, UTV has a 49 per cent interest in TV3 and if that company is taken over, as seems more than possible, it will result in a UK based communications giant having almost majority control of one of Ireland's national television stations.  I am sure the Minister agrees this would not be a welcome development.  Does he have any plans to introduce legislation preventing such an outcome?</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister has received a significant number of submissions in recent months from a wide variety of sources and that he requires time to consider the many proposals put forward, as he outlined.  However, he does not have much time to implement a broadcasting strategy for the future.  I hope he does not delay his Broadcasting Bill and I look forward to hearing his thoughts in this area at the conclusion of this important debate.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House to give a preliminary view of his position in relation to the current ongoing debate about a most important industry.  As I said earlier, we may differ in the nuances, but we are in agreement on the substantive issue of protecting and nurturing a national, separate identity in a broadcasting context in this country.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  His presence is always a great privilege for Members, even if we <Col N="894" /> do not necessarily concur with his words; it would be surprising if that was the case.  In common with Senator Mooney, I declare an interest in the Bill as, like him, 50 per cent of those earning money in my house derive it exclusively from RTÉ.  Anything I say should be considered in that light, although nothing I say will contrive or contribute towards any increase in that income.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech is still, unfortunately, riddled with the rhetoric with which we have become accustomed.  It is still vague on specifics.  I admire the Minister's ability, not only to write his own speeches, which is obvious, but also to write the entire Green Paper.  If one reads it, there is no doubt that nobody else could possibly have written it or produced gems such as those contained in the Minister's speech &mdash; for example &ldquo;deterritorialised imperialism&rdquo;.  I have not heard about imperialism for many years and it is welcome and refreshing to hear it is back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I had forgotten about it. The Minister's speech is indicative of a political philosophy which he genuinely wishes to see permeate our broadcasting services.  Nobody can blame the Minister for that.  However, I do not share that philosophy and favour a different philosophy.  Neither of us will be satisfied, but I hope we will see balance in the new era.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed that neither of the previous speakers addressed the politicisation of RTÉ.  It is time we talked openly and plainly about the fact that the RTÉ Authority is a politically appointed body.  From this fact stems the whole ethos running through RTÉ. This is not the fault of the Minister, who had the privilege to appoint the recent Authority, but of all Governments.  It is a perk of the office of the Minister of the day to appoint to the RTÉ Authority those whom he considers to share his philosophy.  There is no point in pretending otherwise.  It is an unfortunate <Col N="895" /> characteristic of broadcasting in this country.</P>
    <P>Not long ago I wrote to a large number of semi-State bodies asking them to advise on the attendance of members to board meetings in view of the fact that those attending such meetings are paid with public money.  I was especially interested in RTÉ because it is the promoter and champion of openness and transparency.  I understand the chairman of the RTÉ Authority is remunerated to the amount of approximately £6,000 per year while it is £4,000 in respect of other members.</P>
    <P>To give them their due, most semi-State bodies provided me with specific attendance records.  RTÉ wrote back and told me to jump in a lake; it was not my business or anybody else's to know if members attended meetings.  These are the people who are promoting the interrogation of politicians, industrialists, trade unionists and everybody on the air every day of the week.  However, if one asks them a simple question, whether they are using or abusing public money, they advise it has nothing to do with the public.</P>
    <P>I would not mind this especially except that the other semi State bodies, with one or two notable exceptions, were transparent on this matter.  They are not beating their breasts every day telling us we have to answer questions, left, right and centre to satisfy public curiosity.  Will the Minister give a direction, make a suggestion or use whatever little influence he has over RTÉ to ask it to reconsider this decision and possibly consider whether public money is being well used and whether those involved are or are not attending meetings?  This is not an accusation; it is a question I wish to see addressed because they are being paid and it is a matter of public interest.</P>
    <P>Being a monopoly, RTÉ has, unfortunately, a strong political agenda.  It would not be objectionable for it to have such an agenda if, in the first instance, it did not champion the idea of public service broadcasting.  This is a <Col N="896" /> lofty idea; it is about balance, what the Minister calls our cultural heritage, our national interest.  It is also an intangible idea but is primarily about being fair, balanced and varied.</P>
    <P>However, the evidence that RTÉ has a political agenda is so damning that I am surprised people do not notice it more often.  For example, in terms of politics and an exchange of ideas, &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; is possibly the most influential programme on RTÉ.  Television is a powerful medium; it is much more powerful than radio and newspapers.  &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; is a very entertaining programme and compulsive viewing for most people interested in politics.  However, it is a loaded programme.  The same people with the same views appear on it time and again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not attacking her.  She is an especially able journalist with especially articulate and strong views, all of which she is entitled to.  However, are there not 1.5 million other women in the country who could appear on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;?  How could any radio or television station justify putting the same person on the one programme dealing with a crucial issue three times in four months or less?  They could not.  Mary Holland is more than entitled to appear once, but that should surely be enough.</P>
      <P>Week after week before the divorce referendum panellists in favour of divorce were always in the majority because somebody somewhere chose them.  It could not be justified by saying it reflected the balance of opinion in the country because the only indication we had of public opinion on this issue before the last referendum was that a majority of people were against divorce by two to one.</P>
      <P>Despite this we have, on what is meant to be a fair, balanced public broadcasting system, a majority of panellists on its most influential programme in favour of divorce.  Let nobody tell me this is not an agenda; it is.  RTÉ did not show balance on this issue.  In addition, I do not believe many of the broadcasters themselves or those who chaired these programmes were against divorce.  On programmes of this kind, probably four out of five participants were in favour of divorce.  This is not fair or balanced broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of high profile cases involving the Roman Catholic Church, the treatment of the Bishop of Ferns by the media generally, including RTÉ, has <Col N="898" /> been deplorable.  Nobody deserves to be treated in the way that man has been treated by the media.  He is entitled to a presumption of innocence and, as far as I am concerned, he is still innocent.  The allegations and the support for those allegations, which have been given prominent coverage, is unjustifiable.  A national broadcasting service should be even more careful, because of the special responsibilities it claims to have, when it takes on issues of this sort.  A very dangerous precedent has been set by what went on.</P>
    <P>While in this case I do not think there are any sinister motives, it ought to be said that when section 31 was removed from the Statute Book by the current Minister, we were promised without any doubt that hard questions would be asked by RTÉ.  The evidence for that is so flimsy, however, that I wonder whether we should not think again about reintroducing section 31.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provided a platform for those who refuse to denounce violence which they would not otherwise have had.  I cannot remember any interview which made life awkward for those who support terrorism.  I am open to correction, but I believe they received disproportionate coverage after section 31 was lifted.  The number of times we heard representatives of Sinn Féin/IRA on the air was extraordinary and it is difficult to reconcile with the idea of balance.</P>
    <P>Let me turn briefly to the commercial aspect of RTÉ.  For all its faults, RTÉ has done a laudable job in various areas, such as Eurovision, sport and in its instant news coverage.  RTÉ's professionalism cannot be disputed, but I welcome the fact that it will have competition in the form of a third television channel.  It is essential for the health of RTÉ and its viewers, as well as for political balance, that we should have a third TV channel.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was peppered with not unusual disdain for profit.  The Minister looks puzzled at my remark, but in his speech he said &ldquo;Broadcasting can also be a threat, putting profit motive against collective rights&rdquo;.  I am <Col N="899" /> not sure what that means.  The Minister then went on to talk about &ldquo;deterritorialised imperialism&rdquo;.  It is time we recognised that profit is a noble and natural motive and that those who disdain it are being unrealistic.</P>
    <P>We should welcome the third channel because it will be motivated by profit and, in turn, it will motivate RTÉ to further profits.  In that context, I deplore the fact that Teilifís na Gaeilge is being subsidised by RTÉ.  I had always understood, as Senator Cassidy did, that if Teilifís na Gaeilge was going to exist at all &mdash; and I question the necessity for it &mdash; it would be funded by the central Exchequer, but RTÉ, which already has difficult enough commercial problems, is now being directed to send money to Teilifís na Gaeilge which will never make a profit.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the 1993 Act with some pride and said he looks forward to another successful year of commissioned programmes by independent producers.  This is an artificial transaction. RTÉ's profits are being compelled by political direction to go to a certain area.  RTÉ cannot possibly function in the commercial world if it is being forced to send some of its profits in the direction of independent producers and other profits to Teilifís na Gaeilge while we say it must operate as a commercial body.  It cannot happen. The split, which is largely semantic, between public service broadcasting and commercial broadcasting does not really work.</P>
    <P>I remember asking RTÉ at one stage why it could not split the licence fee and the fees they make commercially.  Why can it not spend the licence fee for public service broadcasting on one channel and spend the money they make commercially on other types of broadcasting on Network Two?  According to RTÉ this was impossible for reasons which I could never understand.</P>
    <P>If we are to insist on the Minister's philosophy of public service broadcasting it would seem to make much more sense to continue public service broadcasting <Col N="900" /> exclusively funded by the licence fee and to allow Network Two to be funded by commercial enterprises.</P>
    <P>I regret the decision of successive Governments not to consider privatising Network Two.  As things stand, it is unnecessary to have two public service broadcasting stations of that sort.  The Minister could have considered privatisation. I know privatisation is a political taboo and, indeed, it is not allowed in the Programme for Government, but that taboo has been swallowed in cases like Irish Steel.  I hope the Minister might reconsider the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I always look forward to the varied contributions of Senator Ross who, in my opinion, is a distinguished contributor to debates in this House.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that Network Two should move to Cork to provide a more rural view of everything that is happening in the country.  We, in Fianna Fáil, would support that 100 per cent if that is the Minister's wish.  It is the wish of many people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would provide an overall view as well as some balance. Why should Teilifís na Gaeilge not be in Galway which is the home of much of our culture including music, theatre and the arts generally?  I fully support the idea of the station being situated in Galway but the question of how it will be funded is a different matter.  The spread of employment, the opportunities and the reward &mdash; from the station's point of view &mdash; of inheriting the massive culture that exists in those areas, go hand in hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue and I am grateful to the Minister for personally attending the House during the debate.  As a Member of the Seanad for almost 14 years I have to say that, in the early part of his political career when he was a Senator, the Minister was one of the most outstanding <Col N="901" /> contributors in the House. There was nothing more uplifting than to be in the House when he made a contribution and Mark Killilea was here to respond.  Seanad Éireann has been a good experience for many, our President was also a Member.  People seem to move forward &mdash; who knows what is in store for any Member of this distinguished House.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson, outlined how the party would like to see the broadcasting industry develop.  I have many years experience in broadcasting and I would like to know the Minister's view on the <i>télévision sans frontiers</i> debate which took place in the European Parliament last week.  The European Parliament voted on a strict quota regime.  There will be a quota of 51 per cent European made programmes with no outlet clause and the exclusion of studio made programmes from the quota &mdash; for example, &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lifeline&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kenny Live&rdquo;.  It poses a major challenge to the European Commission and to free access to stations.  I fully support anything which will retain our culture, but I would like to know how the Minister will address the quota system.  I would also like to know how radio is handling the quota system in relation to playing music recorded in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The broadcasting industry provides good quality and well paid jobs.  It is not just another service industry.  It has had a major influence on our cultural life and Fianna Fáil wants to ensure a vibrant broadcasting industry &mdash; a public and commercial sector.  It is time to take a detailed look at broadcasting which is facing intense competition from foreign and satellite channels.  We must ensure that the public service and commercial sectors survive and flourish in this new environment, otherwise the consequences will be considerable.  We only need to look at the changes which have taken place over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>My party will implement its proposals when it returns to Government if this one does not see fit to do so.  The 3 per cent levy payable to the Independent <Col N="902" /> Radio and Television Commission should be abolished.  This money can be used to provide a comprehensive new service.  We are all aware of the great efforts local radio stations make, but there are considerable financial constraints on them.  I have always said, even when my party was in Government, that too many radio licences were granted.  However, the industry has grown and so, too, has the need for local radio stations, which have been valuable in their areas.  The 3 per cent levy should be removed and used to promote a comprehensive new service.</P>
    <P>We would like a commitment to provide access to training for young broadcasters. Fianna Fáil sees the need for an integrated training plan along the lines of the Statcome report for the film industry.  Young people who are properly trained will become the broadcasters of tomorrow.  Such a proposal speaks for itself.  A five year development plan must be prepared in consultation with the owners, shareholders and senior staff of all local radio stations.  Given that plans must be made, we hope that proposal will be implemented in the near future.</P>
    <P>There should be a system of arbitration in disputes between local radio stations and RTÉ about transmission costs.  This is a lesson which we should have learned from Century Radio.  A new national radio station, Radio Ireland, will come on stream in the near future.  It will have an uphill battle and it does not need transmission problems. There is no point having duplication as regards transmitters.  Initially, Radio Ireland could pay a reduced rate but when it is up and running after three or four years, a different arrangement could be reached on repayments.</P>
    <P>We all know that the most popular programmes on RTÉ are those which have been produced at home. &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kenny Live&rdquo; have survived the test of time and are high in the TAM ratings. The new &ldquo;Lifelines&rdquo; programme is also very good.  The station has also benefited from advertising revenue.  Everyone in RTÉ, including presenters, producers, the director general, the <Col N="903" /> chairman of the authority and board members, must be congratulated.</P>
    <P>However, the situation as regards radio leaves a lot to be desired.  According to my figures which are reliable, FM 104 only plays 2 per cent Irish recorded music between 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. while 98 FM plays almost 5 per cent.  Will the Minister investigate if that is within the guidelines set out by the Independent Radio and Television Commission?  On RTÉ Radio 1 between 7.30 a.m. to 3 p.m., usually no more than four Irish records are played because it broadcasts mostly chat shows.  The policy of having consecutive chat shows will prove to be a bad idea commercially because the station is losing listeners by the dozen. People are fed up listening to bad news. There is a programme for whingers in the early afternoon.</P>
    <P>The best time to listen to RTÉ Radio 1 was when there was a strike because beautiful and uplifting music was played.  Neil Diamond will perform before 30,000 to 40,000 people in Croke Park, but how often do we hear his music played on the airwaves?  Music policy in RTÉ at present leaves a lot to be desired.  Years ago we had 800 bands employing 10,000 people.  There were seven bands in Tuam, County Galway. How many bands were there in Galway city and everywhere else?  There was only one radio station, yet bands could get more records played at that time than they can at present.</P>
    <P>The film industry has been a terrific success and the Minister has played a major role in that.  Regardless of what political function I have attended, I have always given the Minister credit for it.  The film industry is extremely important to our tourism industry but recorded material produces 50 times more income in every country than the film business.  We have the Irish Film Board and the Arts Council but we have no music council, although I am aware that an investigative analysis, under Maurice Cassidy's stewardship, is being carried out at present.</P>
    <P>There would be 10,000 jobs for young people immediately if their wares could be aired.  If one does not display the <Col N="904" /> clothes in a shop window people will not come into the shop.  The same applies to bands.  What is the point in broadcasting hard rock and pop music when teenagers are at school and there is nobody to listen but housewives or people in the 35 plus age group?  That is nonsense.</P>
    <P>We fought in this House and in the Dáil to have radio licences for rural and other areas.  We were told we would receive &ldquo;alternative music listening&rdquo;.  To this day Dublin has not received an alternative music station, despite the local radio licences that were awarded. We have 98FM and FM104 churning out the music of 2FM.  That is not alternative listening.  A person of 35 years of age living in Dublin has no alternative music channel.  I am speaking as somebody who runs an alternative music venue in Dublin for country music six nights a week.  It is very successful because 50 per cent of the people of Dublin are not being catered for on radio.</P>
    <P>There are many capable and distinguished people involved in Radio Ireland who have enormously successful track records.  However, there were many people with enormously successful track records in Century Radio and they did not play the music people wanted.  One could tune in for a minute and a half and then tune out.  If Radio Ireland does not opt for middle of the road music and music that is not being aired by other stations, I predict they will go out of business quicker than they think.  If they go for the middle of the road music they will find an enormous market.  There are 2,800 stations catering for the middle of the road or easy listening market in the United States at present.  That is where the growth market is because nobody is catering for it.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is available and I hope the Minister will do all he can for the recorded material being produced in Ireland.  One can hear Irish artists on BBC Radio 2.  One can go to England and view their playlist for each week from the Wednesday of the previous week and see the names of the Irish artists who will be played.  It is easier to get a play on BBC Radio 2 than on RTÉ at present.  That is a shame and a disgrace.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> I support the EU's call for a 51 per cent quota.  In Canada broadcast material is 45 per cent Canadian.  They are not ashamed of their country or of their people.  Irish music is a brand name all over the world and very few nations have a brand name for the music of their country.  It is reasonably easy to get a contract anywhere in the world when one is dealing with the Irish music market, particularly following the success &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; has made Irish music hip in the UK and now in America.  Up to $500 a seat was paid for the four shows which were sold out within three hours in Music City. This is not a flash in the pan; this is a highly successful musical.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take steps to rap the knuckles of anybody who is interfering in any way with the possibility of creating Irish jobs in the music industry. I call on the Minister, who is the one person with the correct attitude and who has the will to make things happen, to see what can be done.  If something is not done about 98 FM and FM104 by the Easter recess, I will call for a special debate on those two radio licences. They should be looked into as a matter of urgency as they are trying to decimate the live Irish music scene.</P>
    <P>Mick Clarkin and I employed over 130 people in this industry three years ago.  We are finding it impossible to continue recording in this country at present because our markets are based in Australia, Canada and the UK.  There is no friend of the Irish recording market in this country to display our wares. But for RTÉ television &mdash; and I am referring to Liam Ó Murchú, Gay Byrne, Pat Kenny and Gerry Ryan &mdash; we would have been out of employment for the last three years.  Why can the same not happen on radio?  What if people in radio were depending on an employer in America or elsewhere? Look at the royalties leaving the country from our songwriters, music publishers and record companies.  This money should stay in Ireland and be kept in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The music industry is a massive employer.  In the town of Moate there are 72 full time jobs in the music business <Col N="906" />&mdash; that is the equivalent of a good size factory.  All these jobs are in danger of being lost.  As somebody who has invested my life and all my resources in this industry, I say it is unreal to see the contempt in which our employment is held by the broadcasting services.</P>
    <P>I congratulate local radio stations; they are more than helpful in playing our material.  They are only too willing to interview our artists.  They get their rewards and we are able to struggle on. However, something will have to be done about the national broadcasting channel, 98FM and FM104.  I look forward to seeing what the Minister will do.</P>
    <P>I concur with Senator Mooney's call to have RTÉ wavelengths divided from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. RTÉ Radio 1's signal is received across most of the UK from 7 p.m. and many of the good programmes that were dropped for other types of programming could be broadcast to people who support Irish products abroad.  I would support the Minister taking such an initiative.  I look forward to his and to the introduction of the proposed legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome my friend and colleague, the Minister, Deputy Higgins. Like many of my collegues, I have every confidence in his ability to structure broadcasting in a way that will reflect all that is best in this country.</P>
      <P>However, I wish to offer the Minister advice following the contribution of my Government colleague &mdash; when I refer to Senator Ross as my &ldquo;Government colleague&rdquo; there should be canned laughter in the background.  When Senator Ross proposes to instruct the Minister on how to be fair and impartial, one could smile.  He is probably the best example of being fair and balanced and he practises that by being in Government and in Opposition and being an impartial recorder of the political scene at one and the same time.  He also appears to have a problem with the fact that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht happens to be cultured and articulate and has a vision of the job that must be done.</P>

      <Col N="907" /> When he purported to instruct the Minister on how to reorganise RTÉ so that the same people do not keep popping up on screen, it was difficult to restrain not only a wry smile but outright laughter.  As we know, Senator Ross is the business editor of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> in which, week after week, the same people appear and pour out the same bile on the same targets. Now and again they change targets depending on the editorial meeting on Tuesdays, but one thing is for sure: in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> they all sing from the same sheet.  At least in RTÉ opinions seem to differ depending upon the subject.  In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> they never differ.  Once the victim is agreed upon the assassins are free to do their job.</P>
    <P>The Minister need take no lessons from Senator Ross on this or any other matter.  He remarked on the possibility of reintroducing the section 31 ban and went down that old road.  The Minister was villified when the ban was removed and after the cessation of violence was announced the same prophecy that it would not last appeared week after week in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> There was never any encouragement. It made attacks on those who put the cessation together, particularly the politicians involved &mdash; the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring and, lately, the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, and the members of the Cabinet. Its agenda never changes.  One wondered at times if it wished the cessation to fail.</P>
    <P>I hope Senator Ross is watching me on the monitor, because having listened to his contribution I could not let it pass without pointing out the absolute contradiction of his position.  The Minister may write off any lessons the Senator might purport to give on broadcasting, impartiality, balance and fairness.</P>
    <P>I have a crib to make to the Minister. I do not like RTÉ interviewing itself or having little games of charades with itself &mdash; light entertainment programmes in which the same people pop up all the time.  Fellow broadcasters or their children seem to be invited regularly <Col N="908" /> to participate in television programmes. I dislike the practice as it is far too incestuous.  It makes it look like a private company.</P>
    <P>On occasions RTÉ is blatantly not on the ball.  On the day the ceasefire was announced I was in an office in Leinster House watching RTÉ 1.  Everybody was waiting for an announcement one way or another.  While the programmes on BBC were interrupted and the announcement made of the cessation of military operations by the IRA, RTÉ continued with &ldquo;Skippy the Bush Kangaroo&rdquo;.  I expected the programme to be interrupted but it was not.</P>
    <P>I rang Joe Mulholland in RTÉ to ask what was going on &mdash; why, when an event for which we had waited for over 20 years was taking place, the national television station was showing a children's programme while the BBC and the ITV were running the news as it was breaking?  I suggested that somebody was asleep in RTÉ.  About five minutes later the news appeared on RTÉ and Joe Mulholland apologised and accepted that the delay should not have happened.  RTÉ should have been more on the ball and run what was a major story.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not responsible for the day to day operations of RTÉ or even the attendance record of its board members.  In that regard, was the question put by Senator Ross put as part of his duties as the business editor of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> or as a politician? Perhaps Senator Ross would respond to that question.  Why should public servants go to the expense of giving him information which is for commercial use?  That is yet another contradiction in Senator Ross's position.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross also mentioned Teilifís na Gaeilge.  My Irish is poor but, in common with 90 per cent of the people, that never prevented me admiring the language, wanting to hear it spoken and identifying with it as a core part of what we are.  In typically Irish fashion we print millions of tee shirts saying &ldquo;Proud to be Irish&rdquo; and covered in shamrocks; we pay lip service to everything that is Irish. The development of the Irish language is a core value for us, but when we go <Col N="909" /> to do something about it the begrudgers say it is not what they want, although it has been called for since the foundation of the State.  They cloud the issue by saying they want Teilifís na Gaeilge but do not like the way it is to be funded.</P>
    <P>There is also a mindset which says, &ldquo;If it is in Irish it will be dull, staid, lack imagination and lack attraction for ordinary people&rdquo;.  If that is the case, the programme makers should be put to work elsewhere.  We have all watched foreign films which have been well produced; they may have subtitles or plots that are easy to follow and may be so compelling that one watches them.  There is no reason why people with as limited an amount of Irish as I have cannot watch Irish programmes if they are properly and professionally made and are interesting and entertaining.  I look forward to the continued development of that aspect of Irish television.  I am sure the Minister shares my view that the programmes must be the most professional and of the highest standard and quality and must be attractive to people.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the use of television in relation to education.  I am a fan of the Open University programmes on the BBC, indeed of distance learning in all forms.  When Cork Multichannel was awarded the contract to bring multichannel television to Cork it was allowed by Cork Corporation to use the public ducts on the basis that one channel would be devoted to educational purposes only, but that never happened.  I wanted a literacy programme put together through the vocational education committee, like &ldquo;Sesame Street&rdquo; from American television.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>No, an educational programme solely to do with literacy.  Having spoken to a number of organisations and people involved in work in that regard, they considered that a substantial number of people felt too ashamed to come forward and say they could not read or write.  I thought a series of television programmes with an accompanying book would be an ideal solution <Col N="910" /> to that reticence.  We got as far as employing a consultancy company to try to put the package together but in the end it proved too expensive.  There is a role for television in tackling illiteracy, which is part of the &ldquo;hidden Ireland&rdquo;. The European report on education indicates that there are 4,500 children who do not benefit from the education system. One could guarantee that a substantial number of those children have writing and, in particular, reading difficulties. Television could be used to great effect in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister poses larger questions about the future and the role of public sector broadcasting.  If one wants to restore one's faith in public sector broadcasting one should go to America. If one stayed in New York and watched the television one would want to shoot oneself after a couple of hours &mdash; it is mindless bilge in the main.  If one is lucky one might come upon a public sector channel that shows intelligent programmes about the world we live in. However, the bilge that passes for programming in America is dreadful.  There are awful programmes on which they parade every broken human being they can find and ask them, for a few bucks, to outline their whole lives, the lives of their whole families and so on.  I hope that this country will always refuse that sort of broadcasting.</P>
      <P>I have little to say in relation to the work the Minister is doing.  As a Member of the Labour Party and as a colleague we have discussed it in other places, so there is no reason to rehash it here.  As far as his brief in broadcasting, and indeed in film, is concerned, he has brought to this job a dynamism that everybody respects and appreciates. People say that the Minister is an intellectual or accuse him of being too cultured. He is all of those things, but he is also a gut politician who comes out of Galway West, something that Senator Ross and I dismally failed to do in our own constituencies when we failed to fight our way through into the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Behind that cultured exterior is one tough nut of a politician, and nobody should forget that.  I remember the <Col N="911" /> tough side of the Minister as a young tiger when he was chairman of the party.  There is a side to Michael D. that people would cross at their peril.  I again extend my congratulations to the Minister on the job that has been done so far.  If he is ever looking for advice he should not under any circumstances consult with Senator Ross.</P>

      <P>It is a great pleasure to come to the Seanad at any time and to listen to the views of the Seanad, which is a useful and thoughtful House in which to discuss issues like this.  I wish to take up some of the points made by Senators, for whose contributions I am grateful. I will come back to Senator Magner's points, but he is talking about the uses of public service broadcasting in the best structured way.  We would all like to see the power of communications used to deliver people from illiteracy, to do things that we were not able to do before.  I will come back to that point.  I support the Senator's view on what could have been done in relation to cable if it had been possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will begin with Senator Mooney's view.  I appreciate the consensus that has been building around Teilifís na Gaeilge as well as the consensus that has been building around a non-exclusive market orientation in broadcasting. The recently published Fianna Fáil paper on broadcasting accepted the principles of public service broadcasting. We should not underestimate what is at stake.  What Senator Ross has been saying is very interesting.  I like to give as much information to this House as I can.  When I became Minister with responsibility for broadcasting three years ago, at the Council of Ministers <Col N="912" /> meetings in Europe I was the only Minister in favour of public service broadcasting. Today maybe four or five have changed their position and at least another four or five are seriously worried about the consequences that they have visited on their people through indiscriminate deregulation and structures of ownership.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to my philosophical base.  I must make my philosophical base perfectly clear.  I appreciate the spirit in which the question was posed.  The big issue involved in broadcasting, in film making and the general production of culture is that 30 years ago legislation in Ireland and elsewhere was based on the concept of terrestrial broadcasting.  The boundaries of the legislated systems were coterminous with the capacity to broadcast.  Today we find there has been a convergence of ownership around a few international conglomerates.  There have been technical innovations as well as a convergence of technologies which make multimedia possible.  There have been, in addition, concentrations of ownership which are very serious.  Technical developments include fibre-optic cable link, satellite and different forms of multi technical usage across different systems, the telephonic and the televisual combining to create new capacities.  That is a new atmosphere.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross' view, which I found very interesting, can be summarised as follows: &ldquo;I consume, therefore I am&rdquo;. The choice referred to is the choice between turning something on and turning it off, which is rather like Henry Ford's choice of black, black, or black. There is much more to the argument than this; but in fairness to Senator Ross, he represents what he claims is balance but is not balance at all.  He is arguing for a market philosophy to be brought to bear on issues of broadcasting and film.  In a way this is consistent, because the point that Senator Magner makes is right; Senator Ross would like to transfer the uncritical tabloidisation that has destroyed context in the print media to television and radio.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving credit where it is due, to the independent &mdash; with the multifarious definitions you might make of that &mdash; Senator who introduced the concept.  I agree with Senator Mooney's point that it is about more than turning things on and off because the Minister with responsibility for broadcasting has to make a choice &mdash; even against the grain of what I have described &mdash; for or against diversity. When I look through the Green Paper submissions and prepare the legislation, I have to take responsibility and do what is right, not just for 1996 or 1997, or for any period of Government, but for what is right in broadcasting to bring us past this technological challenge, past the end of this century into the next one.</P>
      <P>I have already paid tribute to those who have supported me in articulating the values behind this.  People have commented on what happens when you get fragmentation and degradation of the practice that is broadcasting.  I do not want to take up the time of the House.  The movements Senator Mooney describes in relation to takeovers are very serious ones.  We hear a strange split argument from private channels arriving in the market place. When they are arriving, they are arriving in the name of competition; but when they have arrived they devour everybody else and there is a new kind of agglomeration.  The only difference is that the new agglomeration has no public responsibilities, only private responsibilities.  This is a totally destructive development in broadcasting and it is a tribute to the intelligence of Irish public representatives that there is an all-party consensus developing around the kind of values that have to be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mooney is right when he speaks about tabloid TV; I have already spoken about this.  With regard to some of his other points, I read scandalous things about my performance as Minister with responsibility for broadcasting <Col N="914" /> to which I cannot always reply.  I do not can beans and I do not own half the newspapers, but I am a public representative. I saw it stated in print that I have a role in the final commissioning for the independent sector in RTÉ.  I have never interfered in this area or in any aspect of programming.  Legislation exists which confers statutory autonomy with responsibility on me and which governs my behaviour.  Harry Truman said &ldquo;I am damned if a truth can ever catch up with a good lie&rdquo;.  This seems to be an informing principle among certain newspaper groups.  I think some of the groups who wrote these things described in a Freudian way what they would have liked to have done themselves.</P>
    <P>There will be an opportunity to discuss Teilifís na Gaeilge again in some detail.  The idea of this service was discussed widely among political parties.  I have steered decisions on it through Government.  The significant decision was made on 20 January, 1995.  There was a case to be made for the new station and there is no confusion about funding for it.  From day one it was said that one hour of a commitment would fall on RTÉ because it is the national broadcaster with the benefit which that confers through the licence fee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The status of national broadcaster also confers obligations on RTÉ, some of which are to make provision for the Irish language.  I have heard the view expressed that if certain opinions about what was or was not to be the national broadcaster had been more inclusive of obligations to the Irish language, it might not have been necessary to be prosecuting Teilifís na Gaeilge as a concept at the end of the century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the case for an increase stands on its own merits irrespective of Teilifís na Gaeilge. Interesting points were made by a number of Senators on Irish content.</P>
      <P>If broadcasters do not support what Senator Cassidy has outlined, where else can they seek support?  My thinking is to drive forward and maximise initiatives in the music industry in exactly the same way I did with regard to the film industry.  The recent changes in the forthcoming Finance Bill, as announced in the budget, were the basis of an interim report I received from Forte, which is the group I established to assist the music industry.  I neither want nor exercise intervention in programming matters.  The Broadcasting Acts lay down specific legal requirements within which RTÉ must function.</P>

      <P>The ownership of an independent television channel is a matter for the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  I assure Senators the valuable views expressed in this debate will be transmitted to the Independent Radio and Television Commission for further comment; this would be only proper.  Agreement has been reached on transmission arrangements between the Independent Radio and Television Commission and RTÉ.  Valuable points have been made and I will <Col N="916" /> bear them in mind when framing legislation.</P>
      <P>I will not comment on the point which is continually made about what is called &ldquo;political stacking&rdquo; of current affairs programmes.  The RTÉ Authority and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission are there to deal with such matters. The last thing people want is a Minister to interfere after the legislative framework is in place.  We need a Minister who says what he believes.  I have been criticised for my views; this is quite correct because we are living in a democracy.  However, people know what I believe in and I am willing to swim against the tide in trying to shape broadcasting so that it is culturally diverse and inclusive.  There are people who do not like this but they are entitled to their opinions.  Some of them are powerful and we can expect more and more conflict on this issue.  It is not appropriate for me to imagine I am anything other than the Minister and to bypass the RTÉ Authority by becoming involved in programming issues.</P>

      <P>Senator Ross raised the prohibition of certain organisations under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act.  I proposed the abolition of this prohibition to the last Government on broadcasting criteria from a philosophical departure point on what was good for the Irish listening and viewing public and what they were entitled to hear.  I <Col N="917" /> did so because I had confidence in the public, editors and the RTÉ Authority. It was certainly welcome that this facilitated a set of discussions and a framework which later encouraged people to move from one direction of prosecuting their aims to a more political discourse. It would be wrong to seek to damage the possibility of discourse at the time we need it most.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for the points they made, some of them must be transferred to the appropriate authority.  Senator Cassidy spoke eloquently; he is trying to increase the job content of the Irish music industry and I have noted his points.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with Senator Ross' point. I respect his differences with me but I disagree with him entirely.  There is one point on which he is being less than fair. The argument he addresses to RTÉ is that it should be diverse with regard to audiences, people on panels and those who discuss issues.  If people argue this, they ideally believe in tolerance and cultural diversity and it behoves them to put it into practice in their own work. The print media with which Senator Ross is associated and for which he has responsibility does not stand the philosophical, practical or moral test.</P>
      <P>When I have prepared and introduced the legislation later this year, I look forward to coming to the Seanad to hear an expansion of the views we discussed today and which I appreciate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for choosing to take this important matter on the Adjournment and welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Austin Currie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the environmental blight of the ESB overhead pylons on the modern urban landscape, the latest <Col N="918" /> study which has made a connection between health and radioactivity from ESB overhead powerlines in residential areas is worrying.  Members will be aware that recent research carried out by Dr. Denis Henshaw of Bristol University has caused considerable public anxiety at the potential risk that may occur from overhead electricity lines.</P>
    <P>The study points to the prevalence of certain types of cancer arising from outdoor exposure to radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas which would seem to be attracted to electricity pylons and the immediate vicinity that surrounds such pylons.  The difference in this study from others &mdash; and there have been close to 12,000 separate research studies in this area over the past 25 years &mdash; is that a link between electromagnetic fields given off by the presence of power lines is attributable to certain risks to the health and safety of residents who live under electricity pylons.</P>
    <P>In the past electromagnetic fields or EMFs have been linked to the increasing percentage of people who have either leukaemia or brain tumours. While the case is well made for adults there is particular prevalence of both forms of cancer among children.  The latest research in this area would seem to suggest that where families are exposed to EMFs risks to their health can occur.</P>
    <P>Members may be aware that public concern of EMFs in Sweden has led its Government to take a proactive stance on this issue.  In 1993 Swedish Government sponsored research compared two groups of people, one consisting of cancer sufferers and the other not, and showed clearly that cancer suffers had experienced much greater levels of EMF than those who had not contracted cancer.  The research highlighted that where people were exposed to EMFs there was a greater risk of contracting cancer.  Other Swedish research in this area has highlighted the risk to children from the presence of EMFs and has shown that where children are in close proximity to power lines the risk of cancer is greater.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> It is important to stress, however, that while the risk is still small, there seems to be a pattern, however small, which needs to be recognised.  I note that the Swedish Government has passed regulations to the effect that no new building construction should take place within 50 metres of overhead powerlines.</P>
    <P>While it is important not to sensationalise the latest research in this area and not to fuel public concern with regard to overhead powerlines, it is important that Government and its agencies give due regard to the debate which is on going at present.  In particular, I ask the Government to take full consideration of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland which has already conceded that the amount of radon found in some Irish homes is above the acceptable level.  Indeed, it might be worthwhile extending the powers of the Radiological Protection Institute to look in greater detail at this matter.  I am confident that where our Government believes it necessary to initiate new measures in this matter they will do so as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>The reason I brought this issue before the Seanad is that as a resident of and public representative for the south-west of this city, I am fully aware of public concern and anxiety which exists in some parts of my community regarding ESB pylons.  Those who live beneath the mammoth powerlines that straddle our community want simple answers to the complex questions which surround this debate.  I hope the research in this area, which is ongoing, will be concluded at some point in the very near future and will provide a definite response to the relevant concerns of ordinary people.</P>
    <P>Finally, I note the comments of Dr. James McLoughlin of UCD in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 17 February.  Dr. McLoughlin, a renowned expert in this field, said &ldquo;The jury is still out and the best thing to do is not to put overhead powerlines near houses.&rdquo;  At the very least, we should take his advice on board and ensure that any new planned residential developments would be quite some distance from ESB pylons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Hayes for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The report to which he referred suggests there may be a link between the incidence of certain types of cancer and increased exposure to radon gas particles caused by electromagnetic radiation from power lines.  It has attracted considerable attention and, in particular, has attracted critical comment from a wide range of authoritative scientific experts, including the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  These experts have cast considerable doubt on the conclusions of the study.</P>
      <P>Indeed, scientists researching the effects of radon have gone so far as to argue that the effects of electromagnetic fields appear to be less than the risks associated with radon &mdash; in other words, the opposite conclusion to that of the study.  For example, I would draw the attention of the House to a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday by Dr. James P. McLaughlin of the radon research group in the Department of Experimental Physics in University College Dublin. He refers to research carried out in UCD which supports other well established evidence that the presence of electric fields in a house helps to deposit radon decay products onto surfaces, thereby reducing the probability that these substances will be inhaled.  He also describes ongoing research in this area which UCD is co-ordinating with support from the EU Commission.  Professor Henshaw's study is specifically about the effect of power lines on radon and, thus, indirectly on health.  There is also, of course, an ongoing scientific debate as to whether electromagnetic fields have a direct impact on health.</P>
      <P>All significant research in this area is monitored here by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the Electricity Supply Board and, where ionising radiation is involved, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  The medical officers in my Department keep themselves informed of developments in this area and my Department liaises with these agencies in relation to the human health aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications has pointed out that power line voltages and concentrations of power line in Ireland are well below those in most industrialised countries.  In 1988 and 1992 that Department published major reports on this issue covering the latest research developments and the assessments of this research by recognised international health advisory organisations. A considerable volume of research has been carried out internationally over the years into possible adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields surrounding power lines.  The general body of scientific evidence has not conclusively established a definite link between this form of radiation and ill health.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, while it has not been possible to determine a definite link, neither has it been possible to discount any such relationship.  For this reason it is, in my view, extremely prudent that we should take all such reports very seriously and continue to carefully examine them.  I am advised that this latest study will be incorporated into the existing body of scientific literature and will be assessed by the broad scientific community.  Furthermore, research and studies in this area are carried out on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to research within the Department of Health, I would point out that the National Cancer Registry began full registration of cancer incidence and mortality in Ireland in January 1994.  Its first national report will be published later this year.  This data will be of immense importance to research into the epidemiology of the disease in Ireland and crossreferencing with any available data on relevant risk factors will, of course, be a significant aspect of such research.</P>
    <P>Should conclusive evidence emerge that electromagnetic radiation is causing an unacceptable public health risk, then appropriate remedial measures will be put in place.  Primarily, this is a matter for Departments and agencies with direct responsibility in the area. However, I would be seeking to ensure <Col N="922" /> that there was an appropriate response if any health risk was established.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for dealing with this matter.  I am disappointed the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, is not present because I believe she would appreciate the urgency of the crisis facing people in the greater Blanchardstown area.  She visited Hartstown almost one year ago to specifically address the problem of crime and vandalism in the Blanchardstown area and the urgent need to situate a Garda station there.  In view of the fact that the Minister travelled to the area to give a commitment to the people on the Government's intention to provide a new Garda station, it is imperative that she either fulfils that commitment or answers the questions I intend to pose.</P>
      <P>It will be no surprise to the Minister of State, as one of the public representatives for the constituency in question, that the Garda Síochána will be withdrawing from the local Garda station in a number of days.  This will leave an area with a population of almost 60,000 people with no local Garda presence. That is an unprecedented action for the Garda Síochána to take.  The gardaí have never before taken what might be described as such militant action.  In another unprecedented action, of which the Minister of State is aware, the local gardaí invited all public representatives for the area to a meeting in the community centre to appraise us of the intolerable conditions under which they have to work.  I have visited the station, as has the Minister of State, and have witnessed first hand the kind of conditions under which members of the Force are attempting to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I once had occasion to go the station to make a statement about an accident I witnessed but this was not possible because there was no private room available.  This was difficult but not particularly alarming.  Today, however, I spoke to a woman who had been the victim of domestic violence.  She was obliged to make a statement in the hallway of Blanchardstown Garda station <Col N="923" /> within sight and hearing of her neighbours. Such conditions could not be described as suitable for anybody in a distressed condition following an incident of domestic violence.  No one should have to provide a statement under such conditions.  The lack of space and privacy is having questionable effects on the gardaí and the community.</P>
    <P>The station might have been adequate to serve the population of 1,000 in the village of Blanchardstown when originally built, but it is now dangerously unsuitable for the number of gardaí and members of the public who use it.  The Minister of State also has responsibility in the Department of Health and I believe he will admit that the station would not pass health or safety inspections.</P>
    <P>The people of Blanchardstown are suffering the effects of a most incoherent policy on crime.  If the Minister thinks I am exaggerating I will quote from an article entitled &ldquo;Gardaí foil scheme to &lsquo;spring&rsquo; prisoner&rdquo; which recently appeared in the <i>Evening Herald.</i> The article states:</P>
    <P>A plan by teenage villains to storm a Dublin detention centre and free a notorious offender was foiled by gardaí.</P>
    <P>The article also revealed that the youth was sentenced to a four year term on 23 separate charges but, because there was no space available in Trinity House, he was sent home.  He was later sent to Oberstown House.  A Mazda 626 was then stolen from Castleknock and brought to Oberstown House in an attempt to free the youngster involved who lives in Mulhuddart.  That is our policy on crime.  I will not enter the party political arena&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe the article is from today's <i>Evening Herald.</i> I will make it available to the House.</P>
      <P>The case to which I referred is well known in the greater Blanchardstown area.  There was no space available to detain the youth at Trinity House and his friends attempted to free him from Oberstown House.  The people in the area are being left in an even more vulnerable situation because the gardaí are about to withdraw from the area.</P>
      <P>At the meeting with the Garda Síochána in Blanchardstown before Christmas, the Minister of State stated that the Minister for Justice had given a commitment that a new Garda station for Blanchardstown would be situated on the Clonmel Enterprise site.  The Minister of State accused me of being mischievous when I stated that there was a problem with that site.  I believed there would be a problem in acquiring the site because it was part of the lands owned by Dublin Corporation and was part of the scheme for the transfer of assets and lands by the corporation to the new local authorities.  At the meeting in question the Minister of State dismissed me as troublesome.  To date, Dublin Corporation is unable to dispose of the site because it is in a legal limbo. I understand that the corporation and Fingal County Council, when it comes into its ownership, are willing to dispose of the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are one week from losing the Garda presence in the greater Blanchardstown area.  As of today, ownership of the site cannot be transferred.  On the evening of the meeting I stated that there was a problem.  My views were made light of by the Minister of State <Col N="925" /> and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Burton, who stated that there would be no difficulty whatsoever, that money would be provided in the budget, tender documents issued and the Office of Public Works would soon be on site.  We are one week from D-Day and nothing has happened or can happen.  I also raised the issue of the delay by the Minister for the Environment in either determining or varying the scheme in this regard.</P>
    <P>On Thursday next there will be no gardaí based in Blanchardstown.  I request the Minister of State and the Minister for Justice to take urgent action to acquire the Clonmel Enterprise site and invite tenders.  If this is not done, the crime problem in the greater Blanchardstown area will be exacerbated and we will then be faced with an unenviable situation.  No one wishes to be held responsible for an increase in the type of events that took place in the Blanchardstown area during and after the Christmas period.</P>

      <P>If I described the Senator's remarks at the meeting to which she referred as being mischievous, I will add to that by stating that her remarks today are alarmist and verge on the irresponsible.  To state that the intention of the gardaí in Blanchardstown is to take action which will result in the people of the area not having access to a proper police service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from next week.  That is alarmist and irresponsible.  It is a slight on the local gardaí who would not <Col N="926" /> leave the local community in that position. I am glad the Senator remembered the Minister's commitment given in Hartstown almost at the start of our term of office.  We are in the process of carrying out the commitments we made at that time.  I hope the Senator listens carefully to what I have to say and that she avoids making wrong statements in the future.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to record progress on the provision of a new district headquarters Garda station in Blanchardstown.  The Minister and I fully agree that the existing station in the main street is totally inadequate for the policing needs of this developing area, and has been for a long time, even before the present Minister came to office and including long periods when the Senator's party was in office and could have done something about it.  I assure the Senator that a high priority is being afforded to the provision of a new Garda station in Blanchardstown and that the project is being progressed as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works, whose responsibility it is to procure a site and build a new station, is in negotiation with Fingal County Council with a view to acquiring a site at the corner of the main street and Corduff Lane, referred to in the question as the clonmel site, for the erection of the new station. These negotiations are proceeding satisfactorily and no difficulties with the acquisition of the site are envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of rumours circulating in the area that there is some difficulty in acquiring this site for the Garda station and that these misleading and possibly mischievous rumours are causing concern locally, particularly in the station.  I want, therefore, to state again that neither the Minister nor I have any reason to believe or suspect that there will be any problem in acquiring this site.  The Office of Public Works expects to shortly conclude an agreement on price with Fingal County Council.  While it is the case that the site in question is part of property which is the subject of transfer from Dublin Corporation to Fingal County Council.  I am assured that there will not be a problem because <Col N="927" /> of this.  In other words, once a price is agreed and the necessary legal formalities in relation to title are completed, as would be the norm in any such transaction, the site will be acquired.</P>
    <P>However, it will take further time before this process can be fully completed. I know that the gardaí will accept this is the case.  Anybody who has ever bought a house will be aware of the legal niceties involved in property conveyancing and that transfer cannot be effected overnight.  However, this is not hindering progress as the Office of Public Works is being allowed full access to the site and, concurrently with the site negotiations, planning of the new station is proceeding.  A detailed brief of requirements, which was drawn up following consultation between officials of the Department and the gardaí, has been forwarded to the Office of Public Works.  It is now a matter for that office to prepare detailed drawings and agree these with my Department and the Garda.  When this is done the Office of Public Works will immediately undertake the necessary planning consultation and prepare tender documents. Work has been proceeding and the <Col N="928" /> Minister expects construction of the new station to begin before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The need for a new station at Blanchardstown was evident long before the present Minister took office and I know that various options had been examined in a preliminary manner.  However, the Minister immediately made it one of her priorities to get something done about it.  She put in motion the search for and the acquisition of a suitable site, the preparation of plans for the new building and the earmarking of the necessary funds.  I am happy that the project is now well under way and that there will be no avoidable delay in providing the Garda and people of Blanchardstown with their much needed new station. Much as the Minister and I would like to see the building work start tomorrow, one must be realistic about these things. Planning a large and costly building takes time.  Shortcuts in design can lead to serious problems later on.  I am satisfied that the Office of Public Works is proceeding with this project as quickly as possible and that there is no avoidable delay.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 28 February 1996.</P>
