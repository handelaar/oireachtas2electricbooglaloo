      <P>I have received notice from Senator Rory Kiely that, on the Adjournment of the House today, he wishes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to instruct all district veterinary offices to release results of the brucellosis blood tests immediately.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Sullivan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to indicate the progress that has been made in the establishment of the local employment service and the linked measures for 18 to 19 year olds who are not in education, training or employment.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Enright of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The reported threat of closure to all social welfare branch offices nationwide.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Honan of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to outline <Col N="110" /> the efforts being made by the State agencies under his aegis to ensure the retention of 130 jobs in Butler Engineering.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to outline the reason the boys' and girls' schools at Scoil Bhríde, Blanchardstown, do not have a separate full-time remedial teacher.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGowan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide funding for a PE hall at the vocational school, Raphoe, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Kiely's and Senator O'Sullivan's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1 and item 17, motion 30. With regard to item 1, there will be 15 minutes per speaker, with the Minister to conclude not later than 5.45 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.  On behalf of my party I wish to express my disappointment for the employees of Packard Electric Ireland Limited.  I welcome the fact that the Government is to set up a task force.  I hope it will lead to the saving of the many jobs that unfortunately are to be lost.</P>
      <P>After 20 years of making a profit and an excellent working relationship between the company and the IDA, the company and its management should play its part in ensuring that the property and the site become a possible asset for the IDA to attract another company or companies to use them and save the jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> The visiting committee to Mountjoy Prison issued a frightening and damaging report on the prison today.  It will convince the Minister and the Government, if they still need convincing, of the need for more space to be made available.  Perhaps we will have the opportunity to discuss this issue if the Minister publishes the report.  If we do not resolve the overcrowding at the prison, trouble will continue to spread in the city and the problems of those on remand and engaged in drug related activities in the prison will not be resolved.  The report got an airing of at least 20 minutes on the radio this morning. It was frightening to listen to some of the statistics cited by a former Member of the House who chaired the committee which issued the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the question of Packard Electric Ireland Limited not be seen as a political football. Nothing demeans politics as much as people trying to play politics with unemployment.  I accept Senator Wright's remarks.  This is a matter for all parties.  There has already been a hint of somebody trying to blame the Government for the loss of jobs.  People standing for election on the basis that they can solve the unemployment problem bring us all into disrepute.  It is a problem for all of us to deal with.</P>
      <P>On another issue not unrelated to the perception of politicians, we now have a comprehensive and multi-layered structure of committees in both Houses.  Last week a difficulty arose where, because of confusion over committee meetings, speakers were unavailable here.  The same difficulty could happen this afternoon where committee meetings are timed to start at the same time as the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know where this problem should be raised; there must be a co-ordinator. The organisation and operation of committee meetings should be timed to facilitate the working of the Houses.  While I do not suggest there should not be overlapping, committees <Col N="112" /> should not clash with the Order of Business or other crucial times of the day. The present situation is becoming impossible.  The manner in which people are attempting to bilocate to fill quora at different times in different places is not doing justice either to the committees or to the workings of the Houses.</P>
    <P>Recently, some Members were unfairly singled out in relation to a Friday meeting.  It is grossly unfair to expect Senators and Deputies from the country to be available for committee meetings on a Friday.  It would be the death-knell of politics if people were not in their constituencies for at least half of the working week.  More politicians should say that publicly because there is work to be done in the constituencies. Arranging meetings for Fridays is bad; we must reassess how we order work for committees and the Houses and I ask the Leader to deal with that.  Some form of management is required so that we may work properly and effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the remarks made by Senator Wright about Packard Electric and I express the hope that the task force will be successful in attracting investment and jobs to an area which badly needs them.  I will not go over the coals which have been well racked on this matter, but we all agree the way the termination of their employment was announced was most unfortunate and unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could we have a discussion on Northern Ireland before 10 June?  It is important that we discuss it and our record on the matter has always been good in that we have always had a balanced and reasoned debate.  It is important that the Government speaks with a united voice on this matter, which is one of the things which might emerge from a debate in the House.  The situation is particularly sensitive at present and the Taoiseach needs everybody's support in his efforts to progress the path towards peace.  I was worried by remarks made by David Ervine of the PUP, which I heard last night.  It would be most unfortunate if the people he <Col N="113" /> represents felt compelled by circumstances to return to violence.  Everything must be done to prevent that from happening in addition to encouraging Sinn Féin to bring pressure to bear on the IRA to restore the cease-fire.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a matter on the Adjournment this evening.  While I do not want to take from what will be said about providing blood testing results, I appeal to the Leader to go to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter will be discussed on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>At present there is a delay of a fortnight in the submission of area aid forms.  EU schemes are being slowed down by the public service dispute. I appeal that something be done to end the dispute immediately in the interests of farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Wright in asking the Minister for Justice to respond quickly and positively to the crisis in the Prison Service.  I call on her to allocate the necessary funds for the completion of the 150 cell secure prison in Castlerea.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the crisis of funding for nursing homes.  The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, which promoted the opportunity for subvention by the Department and by the health boards, cannot work unless the necessary funds are made available.  I call on the Minister for Health to provide the necessary funds so that the health boards can make the necessary contributions to the nursing homes.  I understand from the Association of Nursing Homes that some homes will have to close their doors, which would be an unfortunate development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with remarks about Packard Electric. We discussed this matter and the rights of the workers some time ago.  It seems they have been treated extremely shabbily, particularly in relation to the <Col N="114" /> manner in which the information about the termination of their employment was released.  That was inexcusable behaviour on the part of management, which may itself have been placed in a difficult situation in the international market.  I am glad this matter has not become a political football.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question raised by Senator O'Toole about clashes of meetings, such a clash happened last week and today in the case of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  It is a pity that its meetings should coincide with the Order of Business.  I made my concern known to the committee and I was given to understand that last week's clash occurred because an important delegation from Turkey was visiting the committee.  Some of our distinguished friends from that delegation are in the Visitors' Gallery.  I am sure that you, a Chathaoirligh, or the Leader, would wish to welcome them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The good thing is that if they are here they cannot be visiting the committee.  They may share my inadequacy in terms of bilocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>They should not under-estimate the Senator's capacity for bilocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody should.  Has the Leader any intention of providing time for a debate on deserted husbands?  This issue has been raised in the media on a number of occasions in the recent past and it is of considerable concern.  A man was deserted by his wife and divorced by her in England, yet she succeeded in gaining compensation from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not relevant to today's Order of Business.  I am sure you will find some other way of raising it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will.  Perhaps the Leader would consider allowing a <Col N="115" /> debate on this general area because a considerable anomaly seems to exist.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a discussion on Northern Ireland as soon as possible. This is a period of the year when there are inflamed sensitivities there.  As a member of the Church of Ireland, I appeal to the bishops to deny permission to Orange lodges to start or to end their parades on their grounds when it is clear those parades will pass through areas where there may be sectarian flash points.  Somebody recently made this point and I thought it was extremely good.  There is a responsibility on the churches if they provide places for these marches to start and terminate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing this situation today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>We ought to discuss it as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Leader consider it appropriate to allow time for a discussion on the crisis afflicting my area of central Tallaght following the decision by Packard Electric a few days ago to pull out of the area?  Does he agree that the manner in which employees were informed of that decision represents a new low in Irish industrial relations?  Will he send the best wishes of the House to the task force which was established yesterday by the Department of Enterprise and Employment?  I look forward to a debate in the near future to discuss these important issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Veterinary livestock offices throughout the country are affected by the work to rule action of staff.  I respect the right of unions to go on strike or to take go slow action, but this has been the worst year for farming in living memory.  There have been low prices, bad weather and the problem of mad cow disease.  Approximately 10,000 farmers who have been held up by the testing process are not being getting <Col N="116" /> back their blue cards and they cannot sell their livestock.  I ask the Leader to appeal to the Minister for Finance to do something about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a discussion on that issue later this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's concern about Mountjoy Prison. Problems with regard to medical and psychiatric services in the main prison seem to be ongoing.  We tried to get a look at this visitor's report.  This is the third year running that such problems have been highlighted in the report.  Can the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House as soon as possible to discuss what is obviously an appalling problem in one of the State's main prisons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the expressions of regret concerning the Tallaght situation.  From my experience in the North of Ireland I know what can happen when multinationals come and go when it suits them because this island is on the periphery of their endeavours.  The most tolerant period in Northern Ireland's history was when there was plenty of work there.  It was a time when my own trade union was able to affiliate with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and bring organisations that had represented the majority Protestant population into all-Ireland bodies.  It was only when the multinationals began to leave the country &mdash; as Packard is doing in Tallaght &mdash; that unrest and the breakup of various peaceful manoeuvres began to take place.  The troubles in Northern Ireland can almost be dated from that time.  I join with other Senators in hoping for an early debate on this issue</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to join Senator Dardis in requesting a debate on Northern Ireland, particularly given the fast moving events we have had recently.  A case in point was the Taoiseach's speech in which he talked about an indicative time scale to give momentum to the peace process.  The Fianna Fáil Leader replied <Col N="117" /> that the Taoiseach was making a reasoned appeal to the republican movement. In the course of that debate, if it takes place, perhaps someone could explain to me the difference between the republican movement and the nationalists, because one seems to speak for the other and I get mixed up between them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I raised the crisis in agriculture, especially beef prices, and the delay in issuing results which will be raised on the Adjournment this evening.  I am reluctant to criticise the Leader but I was disappointed when, in his reply, he congratulated the Minister on doing good work. I hope he conveyed our concern to the Minister regarding the issues I raised last week.  While we have had several debates on agriculture, another such debate is now urgently required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Senator will have the opportunity of putting that on the record tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body met in my constituency this week and hosted a dinner on Monday to which three Members of the Oireachtas in my constituency were invited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what has been said about Packard Electric, and I welcome the task force which is an appropriate response to such a crisis.  It will gather the main players together to concentrate their minds on the devastation which the loss of so many jobs will cause in that area.</P>
      <P>In broadening that issue, the Department of Enterprise and Employment brought out a very good document a week ago which was circulated to Members.  It identified trends in employment and unemployment, and contains many statistics and a number of recommendations.  The Seanad should debate that worthwhile document. We respond quickly when there is a crisis in relation to jobs.  It is important, however, that we have an input into the broader debate of employment creation, particularly when it relates to the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>It is opportune that this House should debate the issue of Northern Ireland, particularly, as Senator Kiely stated, in the context of the recent debate of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. We should take note of the Tánaiste's suggestion that decommissioning be dealt with as a separate matter because it will prove a very thorny issue on 10 June and subsequent days.  There are a number of other issues which could be fruitfully debated in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that we debated the White Paper on Foreign Policy, the Intergovernmental Conference and the Presidency of the EU are approaching later this year.  This House should debate the serious probability that European Monetary Union will proceed without the involvement of the UK, Ireland's largest trading partner.  Such a development could have serious consequences for this country and it would be appropriate that we have a debate on that issue.  Will the Leader confirm that, when the negotiations take place at the Intergovernmental Conference, there will be no reneging on the Irish right to hold automatic membership at the European Commission?  There is a movement toward a two-speed, two-tier Europe and I hope Ireland will not be left behind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey my concern about a republican prisoner, Pairic Mac Floinn, who is being held at a British prison and is suffering from Crone's disease.  Mr. Mac Floinn is seriously ill and is not receiving proper treatment.  I have already communicated with the Taoiseach and Tánaiste and I now inform the Leader of the House about this man's condition.  It is important that this matter be raised <Col N="120" /> immediately with the British Home Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support requests for a debate on Northern Ireland.  If such a debate does not take place in the near future, I ask the Leader and other Members to support a call to Sinn Féin and the IRA to declare a further cease-fire. Such an action would facilitate their participation in the debate on 10 June.  It is important that the unanimous voice of this House be conveyed to Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA.  These organisations must be informed that the people of Ireland, North and South, have suffered serious deprivation in the past 25 years and that the opportunity for a cessation of violence is very important to the commercial life and survival of the community.  I ask that there be a debate on this issue in the near future.  A clear message must be sent to the leaders of Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA that no one in Ireland will thank them for being difficult at this time.  I welcome and support the Taoiseach's statement.  I am glad he took the advice of the Leader of Fianna Fáil on this matter.  The Taoiseach is now on track and we give him 100 per cent support. We must be positive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Jim Higgins, the need for detailed information from the 1996 census to be given to those who need it most as soon as possible.  It came as a big surprise to members of Limerick County Council when the planning officer informed us that some details of the 1991 census only became available some months ago.  A five year wait for such detailed information is too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also concern about the small but significant number of illiterate people in my constituency who are finding it difficult to fill out the form.  Their needs should receive special consideration <Col N="121" /> because the threat of a £1,000 fine is overwhelming for many of them who are very poor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Kelly. A number of people have asked me to fill in their census forms and many people have lost their forms because their children took them.  These people are afraid they will face a £1,000 fine.  A person must be highly literate and highly motivated to fill in the census form.  The census system should be changed to ensure that forms are filled in.  This will cost a large amount of money but the current system of handing out forms must be altered.  The enumerators leave the forms and tell people they will be fined £1,000 if they do not fill them in.  This is a disgrace; Senator Kelly made a valid point.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader of the House make time available for a debate on the conducting of the census?  Most Senators will have been approached by constituents or members of the public about various aspects of it.  An appropriate time to have such a debate would be when those matters are fresh in Senators' minds.  The appropriateness of having the census carried out on a Sunday night was widely raised in the west. Many young people who are either attending college in Dublin or working away from home go back there on a Sunday night and this would give a distorted picture of the population in the west.  Many people feel it would be more appropriate to have it carried out on a Friday or Saturday night.</P>

      <P>A number of issues raised by the Leader of the Opposition were covered by other Members, so I will not refer to each person raising them.  A debate in this House now would not be of great help to workers of Packard Electric.  However, the message sent by all sides of the House is one of great sympathy to the people concerned, annoyance and disgust at the manner in which the announcement was made, a strong sense of support for the task force and a strong sense that the company involved has a serious social obligation to help to make good some of the damage done.  I think I am speaking <Col N="125" /> on behalf of all the House in making these points strongly.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition also raised the report of the visiting committee to Mountjoy Prison.  It is important that we place on record the thanks owned by the public to these various visiting committees who, unpaid, carry out work of great public importance.  I have not yet seen this report.  However, it will be taken seriously and if time can be found to debate it in the near future, it will be made available.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole and others raised the question of committees.  It is not appropriate to the Order of Business but I am concerned about the proliferation of committees.  It is important to assert that the plenary session of either House must take precedence over any committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis and others raised the question of Northern Ireland.  Next week we have the Finance Bill which will take up most of our time but I am favourably disposed to an early debate on Northern Ireland.  I commend Senator McGowan for the support he expressed for the Government and his emphasis on the importance of a united approach in the weeks ahead.  Words are very important; they can cause problems which need not be there.  A period of silence might be no harm.  I will try to organise a debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Senator Kiely and others raised the problems caused by the CPSU strike. They are very serious problems and we are aware of that.  They will be discussed tonight on the Adjournment and I am sure they will be raised again in the near future.  Senator Finneran raised the problems in nursing homes.  I will convey his remarks to the Minister this evening.  Senator Norris raised the question of deserted husbands.  I do not have any plans for an immediate debate on that but I know the issue is of concern to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and it may be that he would like to address the issue.  If so, I will offer him the opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> Other Senators raised the question of Tallaght.  Senator Rory Kiely raised the issue of agriculture.  I do not think he expected me to attack the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry last week.  I was totally sincere in what I had to say about him and about the good job he is doing in very difficult circumstances. Senator Kiely also raised the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. It is wrong that a major event of this nature took place in the Senator's constituency and he was not invited.  I will convey that to the organisers.  If he had been in the same good form at the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body last night as he was on the Order of Business this afternoon, his absence was their loss.  It is appropriate that I make that point.</P>

      <P>The question of a debate on the employment report was raised.  I will see whether that can be done.  We have a very busy schedule over the coming weeks, in spite of what was said here last week.  Senator Mulcahy raised the issue of the Intergovernmental Conference, which we discussed at some length with former Senator Jim Dooge here recently.  In particular we emphasised that there must be an Irish Commissioner in any revised arrangements. The Senator also asked whether this House, and I in particular, could do something about getting Britain to join the European Monetary Union.  I am not sure; I will do my best but I am not sure this House is the appropriate forum.  I suspect that the House of Commons might be more effective.</P>

    <Title>Defence Review Implementation Plan: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett) Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity afforded me by the Seanad to clarify the present position regarding the review of the Defence Forces.  It enables me to deal again with issues which have given rise to misconceptions surrounding the efficiency audit group process.</P>
      <P>The Government has embarked on a major reform of the Defence Forces aimed at increasing efficiency and streamlining structures and organisation. The efficiency audit group has conducted that review on behalf of the Government. The EAG was established to examine the workings and practices of each Department with a view to recommending improved or alternative practices and methods which would reduce costs and improve efficiency.  The group comprises senior figures from the public service, trades unions and the private sector and is chaired by Mr. Tony Barry.</P>
      <P>A number of factors led to the present review of the Defence Forces. The report of the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces &mdash; the Gleeson report &mdash; highlighted a number of shortcomings in the organisation and structure, with excessive numbers employed in non-operational tasks. Similar structural problems were again highlighted by a subsequent review of military administration by the EAG.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from a changed international environment the Government adopted <Col N="128" /> in September 1993 a revised statement of roles for the Defence Forces which placed a greater emphasis on current operational roles as opposed to defence of the State against external aggression, hitherto the primary role.  Furthermore it had been apparent for some time that the rising age profile of the Defence Forces would cause problems if it were not addressed in a co-ordinated manner.</P>
    <P>Against a background of general acceptance that reform of the military organisation is necessary, together with a change in the overall role of the Defence Forces, it was decided to ask the EAG to conduct a review of the structure and organisation of the Defence Forces.  External consultants were engaged by the EAG to conduct the detailed work of the review.  To ensure that the consultants had the necessary military expertise, senior officers of the Defence Forces were involved at every stage of the selection process.  The selected firm, Price Waterhouse, provided a team which included retired Major-General Lewis Makenzie, ex-UN commander in the former Yugoslavia, and other Canadian military experts.  The Canadian military team was accepted by the Irish military authorities as having the necessary and appropriate military competence to conduct the review.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government announced its response to the report of the efficiency audit group and published a document detailing the EAG report and setting out the Government's approach to the reorganisation.  The Government established an implementation group to draw up a fully costed development plan for the Defence Forces setting out the measures to be taken during the first three years of the reform process.  I expect the entire process to take about ten years to complete.</P>
    <P>The implementation group established several joint civil/military groups to undertake the detailed work involved in preparing the three year plan.  This plan, with which the military authorities are in full agreement, was approved by the Government last March.  It is essentially strategic in nature and sets out the <Col N="129" /> parameters and objectives within which the reform of the Defence Forces will take place.  It does not go into the fine detail of the new organisation or structure, nor would it be appropriate to do so at this stage.</P>
    <P>The plan also includes a voluntary early retirement scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force but I want to make it abundantly clear, as I have been at pains to point out on many occasions recently, that there is no question of compulsory redundancy in any section of the Defence Forces.  For anyone to suggest otherwise can only be described as mischievous.  Also, the financial benefits which will accrue to members of the Permanent Defence Force who avail of the voluntary early retirement scheme are in addition to the favourable superannuation arrangements which are already in place.</P>
    <P>A booklet giving the details on voluntary early retirement was launched and distributed to all members of the Permanent Defence Force on 22 April and the first day for the receipt of applications under the new scheme was last Monday, 29 April.  The indications at this early stage are that the response to the scheme is extremely favourable and I am delighted to say that the VER scheme has been well received within the Defence Forces.  The proof of this is that within three days of the scheme opening over 600 applications have been received.  These applications are representative of all ranks in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>This review is not a cost cutting exercise. It is not being carried out in order to produce a programme of cutbacks and closures.  I want to repeat here what I have said on many occasions in the past, including in this House, in relation to barrack closures.  There is no reference in the Government decision to barrack closures.  The question of barrack closures just does not arise.  It appears to be stemming from unhelpful statements made in various quarters in relation to possible barrack closures, which are not a matter for discussion, certainly not within the first three years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> I would like to deal briefly with the roles of the Naval Service and Air Corps.  Over the past 20 years a growing appreciation of the value of our marine resources has coincided with a period of growth and development for the Naval Service and Air Corps.  In particular, the extension of our exclusive fishery limit to 200 miles offshore marked a turning point in our appreciation of the importance of the sea as an economic asset.  As a result, the Naval Service and the Air Corps have seen considerable growth and development.  With the new arrangements on fishery control measures introduced this year the workload of the Naval Service and the Air Corps is increasing.  Some time ago we reached agreement on the new EU fisheries surveillance package which, for the first time, includes an element of funding for operational costs for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The continuing success of the Naval Service in fishery protection, search and rescue and their important role in dealing with pollution threats and the illegal importation of drugs has resulted in a much more widespread appreciation of the outstanding work performed by them.  The Air Corps perform vitally important functions in search and rescue, air ambulance and security operations and, from time to time, assist in non-military operations such as the relief of distress in emergencies arising from natural disasters.</P>
    <P>Recognising the diversity of tasks performed by both the Naval Service and the Air Corps, the Government decided that, as an integral part of the process of implementing the recommendations of the EAG, separate in-depth studies should be carried out on their structure and organisation.  What I and the Government want at the end of this whole process is to have an organisation that is best suited for the discharge of the roles assigned to it.  A key objective in the exercise is to release more personnel for operational duties.  I know this is what the military personnel themselves want.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> The military authorities have now taken possession of this plan and are running with it.  They have seized the opportunity which has been presented to them to modernise and shape their own structure and organisation for the future.  What will be achieved at the end of the exercise is a modern, efficient organisation, staffed and equipped to fulfil the roles assigned to them by Government in a manner which will provide good value for money.  This objective is in the national interest; it is in the interest of the Defence Forces themselves and it is an objective which I am confident is supported by all sides of this House.</P>
    <P>Finally, I cannot let this occasion pass without paying tribute to the heroic work the Defence Forces are carrying out in very difficult circumstances in South Lebanon.  I have just returned from there where I saw at first hand how our Irish troops are contributing to the work of the UNIFIL force in trying to fulfil the mission assigned to them and also in trying to deliver humanitarian aid to those in need.  Our troops are once again displaying the courage and professionalism which we know they possess.  I am sure this House joins me in wishing them well in their most difficult task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in his task. I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the Defence Review Implementation Plan, which is long overdue. Successive Governments in recent years should have paid more attention to the conditions and development of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased the hear the Minister pay tribute to our forces in the Lebanon, from where he recently returned We are proud of their peacekeeping role throughout the world over the last 30 years.  We are also proud of their families, many of whom were very concerned in the past two weeks about the involvement of their husbands in keeping <Col N="132" /> the peace in the Lebanon.  We are proud of the manner in which they performed their duties.</P>
    <P>The report is very long and important.  I am pleased to hear the Minister say that there should be no panic regarding the closing of Army barracks.  This is a shrewd way of approaching the problem.  It will take many years to implement various sections of the report because of the neglect over the years.</P>
    <P>There has been concern in my own constituency about Kickham Barracks in Clonmel.  It is fine barracks and I am proud of the role played by the Army there.  Much of the accommodation could be used for additional purposes to those of the Army.  A member of Clonmel Corporation recently suggested that some of the surplus accommodation may be used at a future date for people guilty of minor offences instead of having them clog up our prisons, which could then be used to accommodate those guilty of more serious crime.  Perhaps the Minister will consider this proposal and discuss it with the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Doubtless the plan will generate much discussion within the Defence Forces and the political parties in this House.  There was a stop/go system of recruitment to the Army in earlier years largely because of the financial priorities of previous Governments.  It has left us with an undesirable age structure within the Defence Forces.  I hope that when the various sections of the plan are put into operation it will balance out.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the important role the Army is playing, and will play, in the years ahead, in co-operation with the Naval Service and Air Corps. on the issue of drugs smuggling and the protection of our fisheries.  In view of the importance of these areas I urge the Government to act swiftly. Given the size of the drug and crime problems the Army and Navy can play a major role.</P>
    <P>The fisheries industry is very important but it is being swamped by <Col N="133" /> Spanish boats which are everywhere. We should pay tribute to our fleet who is doing an excellent job to address this problem.  It should get whatever Government assistance it needs immediately.</P>
    <P>When all the various proposed changes have been made, the suggested savings to the State should be invested in improving the lot of the average members of the Defence Forces and the equipment they require.  My colleague, the former Minister for Defence, Deputy Andrews, established this review &mdash; and not before time.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to Civil Defence which has been neglected over the years.  That is sad because it has played an important role over the past 50 years and I would like the Minister to acknowledge that by awarding medals or scrolls.  People spent many years in the force and have given a great example to young people in rural areas, in towns and cities during the war years, in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and, in particular, when we had problems in Northern Ireland.  These people were leaders in their parishes and we should pay them tribute because they have done a great job.  It is heartening to see young people provide a guard of honour when the President or a Minister visits an area.</P>
    <P>In recent years, even before this Minister took office, there had been a lot of cheese-paring as regards support for Civil Defence.  I believe there is a problem with basic clothing and I appeal to the Minister to rectify that.  There is a great sense of pride among people who join their local FCA.  Surely the State should see to it that they get proper winter and summer gear.  There should be no penny pinching.  We should be proud of the FCA and I hope the Minister will provide help for this service in the near future.</P>
    <P>There are many problems in the Army which have been caused by neglect over a number of years.  Successive Governments have not paid enough attention to the modernisation of equipment, accommodation and recruitment. <Col N="134" /> I hope this plan will auger well for everybody concerned, and for the State. We must have confidence in and respect for the Army.  We should thank the families of members of the Defence Forces involved in UN peacekeeping duties who have made us proud.  We should see to it that their families are properly compensated.  Unlike our Army few countries can boast of such a wonderful record while serving under the UN flag.</P>
    <P>We must ensure the force is updated and supported in every way.  Young people should be encouraged to join.  It was suggested many years ago that all young people should serve 12 months in the Army, although this would be very costly and some people might not be suited.  If we could make the Army more attractive, it would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has the support of both Houses and I wish him well in implementing this plan, although it will probably take at least ten years before some of the recommendations are put in place.  It is time we started to move in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister on his recent trip abroad to visit our troops in south Lebanon at a time when a lot of anxiety has been expressed by relatives and the Army about the safety and well being of our troops in that war torn country.  It was reassuring and brave of him to visit the Defence Forces at this crucial time.</P>
      <P>This is perhaps the first time a Minister for Defence has taken on such a difficult and farreaching task which will bring our Defence Forces up to date because it would have been easy for him to leave things alone.  Over the years there have been calls and warnings from various sources about the future of our Defence Forces, but no Minister has really tackled the problem until now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming from County Longford, in the midlands, I have first hand knowledge of the Defence Forces.  Young men have always been anxious to serve in the Defence Forces but they did not get the opportunity because there was <Col N="135" /> no recruitment.  Everybody knows that if a group or organisation does not bring in new blood, its vitality will suffer.  The present plan will certainly address that problem.  It was heartening to hear the Minister say there will be a voluntary retirement scheme.  We often hear wild speculation about this and I agree with the Minister that there may be a certain amount of mischief behind these rumours.</P>
    <P>Defence Force personnel are scattered throughout the country.  The media should be more responsible when they decide to publish wild stories.  In the past 12 months we have heard stories about towns which will be severely hit by the closure of certain barracks. There was no question but that Army barracks were to close.  These stories were false and caused enormous stress to the families of Army personnel in Longford.  At the time I told local radio and local newspapers about assurances I got from the Minister that these stories were false.  However, I was glad that, in the last 12 months, I had an opportunity to reopen Connolly Barracks on two occasions.  As far as I am concerned, the media tried to close it down but they failed.  The barracks is open and long may it stay that way.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasised that Army barracks are not under review at this time and will not be in the foreseeable future.  There are other compelling and immediate problem with which the Defence Forces must deal, such as the age profile, new recruitment and equipment. A modern army the size of ours must be efficient and lean and capable of quickly changing its strategy.  The plan recognises these problems and looks to the future.  It is important and will be welcomed by the Army.  Apart from fears which have arisen, the plan is properly focused.  It is a positive development with regard to the Defence Forces and public service reform.  It combines a reduction in the overall manpower of the Defence Forces with a more streamlined organisation <Col N="136" /> which has increased operational capabilities.</P>
    <P>Many Army operations have been more suited to 40 or 50 years ago.  Every organisation, especially the Army, must move forward and acquire modern equipment and technology.  The plan tackles the age profile problem, which has been identified as requiring immediate attention.  As the Minister pointed out, there is no compulsion on any personnel to take early retirement.  This is a fair and positive way of dealing with the issue.</P>
    <P>Military personnel have given a great deal of service not just to the Defence Forces but also to communities.  It is important to towns and communities to have Army barracks.  I know at first hand of the service Army personnel have given to Longford town.  They have been involved in sports and social activities and are always willing to lend their assistance in whatever way possible. Such barracks are the life of towns. I have talked to the Minister about this issue privately.  He reassured us here that this matter must be dealt with in the overall context of the plan.  As a result of this plan, the Army will be more modern and streamlined and will offer good careers to young people.</P>
    <P>It is important that young people be given the opportunity of training in the FCA.  There are so many other activities today to occupy their time and minds. The FCA can play a vital role in giving them a sense of purpose, nationalism and discipline.  I strongly recommend to the Minister that broadening the resources, personnel and future of the FCA should play a major part in his plans.  Young people are anxious to join the FCA and to be part of our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In many countries there is compulsory army service.  In Switzerland everybody must spend at least three years in the defence forces.  This might seem shocking to us but we know that the Swiss are disciplined, well trained and well organised and this may have something to do with their army training.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on an important part of the life of the country.  Senator Belton must live a sheltered life if he did not hear more than a little rumour about the closure of barracks.  When the Government published a report last year, it was not just a rumour that a number of barracks was listed for closure.  I strongly welcome the Minister's reassurance that no barracks will close.  However, last year 19 barracks were listed for closure, including a barracks which was in the course of construction in Lifford, County Donegal.  This construction involved expenditure of over £1 million and an officers' mess had been completed. The possible closure of these barracks was debated in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to mischief and rumours and a prominent politician in Athlone.  Senator Belton must live a <Col N="138" /> sheltered life if he did not read this list of barracks.  The situation became more alarming when the Tánaiste gave a public assurance that barracks in Kerry would not close.  I want to be positive.</P>

      <P>We have a trend of thought that says this country should be neutral.  This little island has done nicely through having no alliance with European armies or any other armies.  We will mind and defend our own island and there is a lot to be said for that if it is practical.  I totally support the Government in having a leaner, more efficient and better equipped Army. However, the decision to bring in eminent consultants like Price Waterhouse was based on economic necessity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether they brought them in or not, the terms of reference are important.  The present Government is implementing the terms of reference.  The Army is so basic and important that one should not decide that the only criteria to be used for it is how much can we afford.  The average person looking at their television set understands that.  Young men apply to join the Army believing they will qualify but they are not accepted.  This is a big issue nationally.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister has decided to kill off, once and for all, the possibility of Army barracks closing. Members on both sides of the House know that it was a political hot potato. Everybody in the country knows that to close down either 15 or 19 barracks around the country was unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not happy at the provision for the FCA, which seems just a bit of lip service.  Over the years the FCA has given great service, almost free of charge.  Apart from outings, training and a special week or two in military barracks, it has cost almost nothing to have the FCA on call; yet the FCA has not <Col N="139" /> received recognition or support at any level.</P>
    <P>The Minister should spell out for the young men working on a restricted budget in the FCA that there will be no cutbacks.  The best advice I can get from young men who are committed to serve in the FCA is that there are cutbacks and serious restrictions at the moment. It is an awful mistake to dissuade such young men who want to serve and defend their country should the need arise.</P>
    <P>We should have a well organised, well trained and well equipped Army.  I am privileged to live near the coast and can see the need for a well trained Naval Service.  Every Member of the House is aware of the high standards necessary to qualify as a naval cadet.  The naval cadets are the highest professionally trained people in the country.  That is how it should be, because they are doing a job which calls for discretion and dedication. No amount of support that we in this House can give them would be sufficient.  These people are prepared to put their lives on the line whether they are called for duty at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the value of our Army, the FCA and the Naval Service. The Minister has our total support for upgrading the Army and Naval Service, as well as recognising the service the FCA has given, but what are the Minister's plans for the future of the FCA? To put it bluntly, will the Minister allow the FCA to be starved to the point where it is no longer worth a young person's while donning an FCA uniform? The young men and women who serve in the FCA should have some pride and recognition in what they are doing, but that has been removed.  The FCA is a demoralised force at the moment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's contribution and the reversal of the statement to close Army barracks.  That was a clear statement.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Barrett, to the House.  I appreciate the way he has approached legislation, such as the Harbours Bill, which was subject to some amendment in this House.  The creation and introduction of the Defence Review Implementation Plan requires someone in command who is amenable to listening and to taking on board constructive points.  While the opening contribution by Senator Byrne was balanced and fair, the same cannot be said for Senator McGowan, although nobody doubts his integrity, honesty or beliefs.  Fortuitously, I happened to be in Athlone on the day of the demonstration.  A number of people were on the back of a big truck which drew up in the town square.  They included Deputy Mary O'Rourke, who categorically said that this was the end of the Army bands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am respecting that convention. An unnamed senior person attended the demonstration and said that from now on not alone would the Army bands disappear but the massive contribution they make to music would disappear also.  Of course, this was not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know who stated that a certain number of barracks would be closed down or of which Government <Col N="142" /> that individual was a member.  However, I know there were many rumours and various people felt constrained to state that it would not happen in their backyard. I cannot recollect a statement being made by any politician or member of Government that specific barracks would be closed down.</P>
    <P>Many tributes have been paid to the Defence Forces &mdash; the Army, Naval Service and the Air Corps &mdash; not least by the Minister when he referred to the contribution of the Army in the Lebanon. Many Members recall the Army's first sojourns in the Congo and other places.  The men and women of the Defence Forces have always behaved, and carried their country's flag, in an honourable and brave manner.  I have no hesitation in saluting them.</P>
    <P>During the past 15 to 20 years the national profile of members of the Defence Forces has improved beyond measure.  There is a great deal of respect for the Army and appreciation for the work carried out by its members, whose conduct is impeccable.  In recent years we have become used to seeing soldiers escorting prisoners, large amounts of cash or surrounding and guarding banks.  Invariably their contact with the public increases the esteem in which they are held.  They are first class in the manner of their dress and display.  I congratulate each of them in this regard.</P>
    <P>Irish soldiers are internationally recognised as being extremely well trained and able to cope with the demands of the modern world.  I had the pleasure of accompanying General Norman Schwarzkopf's second in command, Major-General William Keyes who commanded the 2nd Marine Division in the Gulf War, on a visit to Irish Army Headquarters.  Major-General Keyes expressed a wish to make this visit because he knew the Irish Army by the reputation gained from its overseas work.  The reception he received in Dublin and in Collins' Barracks in Cork left nothing to be desired because the staff epitomised courtesy and friendliness. Major-General Keyes left Ireland <Col N="143" /> with very fond memories of the Irish Army.</P>
    <P>The one disappointing feature of the visit was &mdash; I mentioned this to the Minister on a previous occasion &mdash; the Collins' Museum at Collins' Barracks in Cork.  The museum is under-funded and the staff are doing their best to see that it remains open.  It is a great pity that more assistance is not provided in this regard because the museum is situated in a barracks in Michael Collins' home town.  The Department might generously consider providing extra funding to bring it up to an acceptable standard. I was very impressed by the commanding officer at Collins' Barracks who is very anxious to integrate the Army with the city of Cork and open more of the barracks to the public.  I believe Members would welcome such a development.</P>
    <P>As good as it is, the Army, like every other organisation, must change; it must become more efficient and increase its ability to respond to changing demands. Having read the plan under discussion, I compliment those responsible for drawing it up.  It is probably one of the few Government publications which is readable and written in understandable English.  It largely avoids the normal double Dutch approach of similar reports.  As far as I am concerned, no one could disagree with the objectives set out for the audit efficiency group and, subsequently, Price Waterhouse. This document was fathered by different regimes who all retain ownership of it.  One does not inaugurate such an in-depth and costly study and decide to do nothing with it.</P>
    <P>The mission given to Price Waterhouse in compiling its report is one with which all Members would agree.  The key issues outlined include the age profile of the Defence Forces, inappropriate top management structures, operational effectiveness impaired not by a shortage of manpower but by too many small units geographically dispersed, military personnel engaged on duties which could be undertaken by civilians, <Col N="144" /> too many medically unfit personnel and an imbalance in the ratio of pay to non-pay expenditure leaving insufficient funds for buildings, equipment and training.  No one, including the taxpayer, could not disagree with the list of things which must be corrected.  The report goes on to set out what it tried to achieve, which is a modern, efficient army capable of responding to current needs and pressures.</P>
    <P>There is no way the Irish Army, if its structures and equipment are not modernised, could possibly take its rightful place among the United Nations forces. There is an unanswerable case for modernisation. I am sometimes confused by contributions which suggest that the Defence Forces are some kind of enlarged FÁS scheme instead of a modern fighting force whose job it is to protect the integrity of this state and undertake very dangerous missions abroad on behalf of the Irish people.  The Defence Forces are not an employment exchange.  However, employment is vital and the approach made by this document to the objective of lowering the age profile is humane and sensible. As the Minister stated, a ten year window is provided and retirement is voluntary. The employment of incoming troops on a contract is sensible because this will avoid a situation where, in 20 to 30 years, Price Waterhouse would be obliged to complete another report.  In many ways this is an extremely sensible manner in which to go about restructuring.</P>
    <P>I note that PDFORRA and other Army representative bodies are fully involved with, and kept fully informed of, the ongoing process of restructuring. It is essential that the representatives of members of the Defence Forces are fully engaged in the implementation of phase one and subsequent phases of the process.  It is not acceptable that people's lives can be changed without consultation or agreement.  Members of the Army are no different to any other section of the community.  This fact has been recognised by the present Government and its predecessor.  The policy of <Col N="145" /> consultation and the introduction of change on a phased basis &mdash; which take account of human difficulties, early retirement, etc. &mdash; are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of this report would lead to Ireland's Defence Forces becoming modern, efficient and well-motivated. Members will agree with that objective.  I wish the Army personnel &mdash; from the Chief of Staff to the newest recruit &mdash; well in this joint endeavour and I hope they become fully involved in this process.  The Minister is wise enough, and has shown enough sensitivity in matters affecting the Departments of the Marine and Defence, to take this into account.</P>
    <P>The Headquarters of the Naval Service should be in Cork, not Dublin. However, that is special pleading on my part.  The role of the Naval Service has been outstanding.  Perhaps the Irish people should be taken out on one of the Naval Service's corvettes during a force 10 gale to see whether its members are doing a good job.  Its record in terms of protecting Ireland's fisheries stock is stupendous.  Although I have not seen recent figures, it seems at times that Spanish fishermen pay for the cadets.  This is only fair.  One ship caught so many of them that they were probably meeting a budget deficit rather than anything else.  The Air Corps now has its own distinctive uniform and command under the general command of the Defence Forces.  This is also welcome because it gives the Air Corps a sense of identity.</P>
    <P>As the British Government discovered, nothing is more difficult than trying to introduce rationalisation in a section in which there is tremendous cohesion, not just as a group but also when it is broken down into small subsections. There is great affinity to various infantry battalions and brigades, etc., and this makes the task much more difficult.  In this case the Government has wisely adopted a course of consultation and steady implementation over a phased period.  I have no doubt that at the end of the process the Army and the Government will have achieved the <Col N="146" /> mutual objective of a modern, efficient, well paid and well founded force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this important debate. This side has sought this discussion for some time, even before the change of Government, because the contents of the report of the efficiency audit group and the Price Waterhouse report were of considerable concern.  This is why a debate on those issues is appropriate and I am glad the implementation plan is before the House and that Members are in a position to consider it.</P>
      <P>I am pleasantly surprised by the broad thrust of the plan.  It covers many matters which are necessary for a modern army, but I wish to mention a number of points; I am critical of some aspects.  It was represented to me recently that the Progressive Democrats are not in favour of the Defence Forces and that we feel the country could adequately do without them.  I do not know from where that idea emerged but it is not party policy and I consider the Defence Forces essential.  They have contributed enormously to Ireland's profile internationally and over many generations they have contributed to the stability we enjoy in this country. They have also contributed to maintaining peace along the Border.  From these points of views and others, the Defence Forces are necessary.</P>
      <P>However, nobody denies the need for reform and the representative associations, which appeared before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, also made this point.  There is a wide acceptance of the need for reform.  The age profile is heading in the wrong direction and what is required is a modern, well equipped, mobile force, which can respond to needs in Ireland, and internationally when it is called upon to do so by the Secretary General of the United Nations.  I hope this ready response, which has always been evident, will continue to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lack of clarity regarding the role of the Defence Forces.  It has been defined, but how relevant is it to state <Col N="147" /> that the Defence Forces will defend the country from outside aggression?  I am sure the Defence Forces would do so and that professional soldiers would, if necessary, lay down their lives. However, although it is a minor point, how relevant is that role in modern warfare. Perhaps there is a need to re-examine it.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is the degree to which the Army must participate in Western European Union, NATO and associated bodies.  This issue can be debated more fully when the House is discussing the White Paper on Foreign Policy.  Perhaps this is where the matter should be considered. But, irrespective of the possible outcome of that debate and whatever association, or lack of association, is developed in terms of European defence, it is unquestionable that the Defence Forces will have a role to play in that area.  This role should be considered and clarified.  Another relevant point is that the focus is very much on a three or four year timescale, although there is reference to the need for a ten year view.  This ten year plan should be more clearly defined in terms of the expected position of the Defence Forces at that time and how that point will be reached.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Army's activities in Lebanon.  I am aware he visited the troops there and I am glad the decision was taken to deploy the 79th battalion to replace the previous operation. It would have been wrong, and the Army would not have required it, to hold the new battalion at home other than for logistical reasons, such as the ability to move people around.  The Army wants to go out and do its work, which it does very well.  In those circumstances, where Irish soldiers were in the eye of the storm when Hezbollah and Israel were firing at each other, it is extremely important there is some international authoritative verification of what is taking place.  The international community needs to be informed and it should not have to rely on the partisan statements of one or other party to the <Col N="148" /> dispute.  There should be a group in the middle which can make authoritative statements.  The Army was in a good position to do this and it did it very well. It also helped the humanitarian need.</P>
    <P>This underlines the patriotism that has been evident for so long in the Defence Forces.  It is taken very much for granted that we have a stable democracy.  When one considers the history of the foundation of the State, it is a great tribute to the people who were so near to a civil war &mdash; this also applies to the Garda &mdash; that power was transferred so smoothly from the then Cosgrave Government to the incoming Fianna Fáil Government without any major hiccup.  These points and our democratic freedom are taken for granted and it is one of the reasons I do not favour PDFORRA or the other Army representative organisations becoming involved in politics.  Army wives took part in the European elections before last and this was fine. However, it is important to maintain that distance between politics and the Defence Forces.  In addition, it is not appropriate for PDFORRA to be part of ICTU.  Although the trade union movement is laudable, it should be separate from the activities of the Army representative associations.</P>
    <P>It is evident that savings will result from the reduction in the strength of the Defence Forces.  This money should be used to equip and resource the forces adequately and not swallowed up in the national coffers.  I am open to correction, but representative associations also made this point.  One of the most depressing parts of the report &mdash; I agree with Senator Magner that its language is clear and easily read &mdash; is the information on the time some weapons have been in service.  I was taken aback to note that 48 pieces of equipment known as 25 PDR &mdash; I do not know what this is and perhaps the Minister could enlighten me &mdash; are in stock and that they are 46 years old.  One wonders what would happen in terms of defending the country with 46 year old artillery pieces.  It is extraordinary how <Col N="149" /> often the word &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; is mentioned in the various charts of the weapons available to the Army.  The Minister is aware that the Army must be adequately resourced.  Whatever savings are made should be put towards ensuring it has the equipment and logistical back up required by a modern army.</P>
    <P>I will not go through the points made by the representative associations to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  RACO and PDFORRA appeared before it and their requirements have been well aired.  The point of consultation is at issue here.  Senator Magner skirted around it to an extent when he said that people were informed.  Informing them is not the same as consultation.  It is important that those representative associations should be involved in meaningful consultation when it comes to debating these plans and the direction the modern Army should go.</P>
    <P>The Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association should also be taken into account.  From a reply given by the Minister in the Dáil, there are 14,748 people in the FCA, of whom 2,800 are women.  I hope more can be done to encourage women to join the Reserve Force.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the three brigade model envisaged.  Originally there was talk of having one brigade; that was not a good idea.  I also welcome what is in the document about the no closure of barracks.  I especially welcome the commitment to maintain the Army bands.  I raised this matter, about which there was widespread concern, on the Adjournment at one stage.  Army pageantry requires Army bands and I am glad that aspect has been left alone and that the Army Equitation School is to continue.  However, I have some worries about the Army Apprentice School in Naas.  It has done tremendous work. Many gold and silver medal prizewinners in the City and Guilds over a long number of years have come from that establishment and it has a valuable input.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> I also note the commitment to decentralise Departments.  I strongly urge that the Departments of Defence and the Marine &mdash; this will come as no surprise to the Minister &mdash; be relocated to County Kildare.  I looked at the numbers; they are not very large.  There seems to be centres in several areas and it would be as accessible to the Army and the city to have these Departments at the end of the motorway in Newbridge or Kildare.  I do not see why that cannot be done.  I would very much favour such a move.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also be aware that PDFORRA had worries about the five year contract.  This is relevant in the sense that it depends on the activity for which the private soldier is being trained.  Perhaps an infantryman or woman may be trained more quickly that somebody going into a specialised area of Army activity.  It would be unfortunate if they were to be lost at the end of the five year period.  Not to renew their contract in the event of them not getting promoted to NCO or sergeant level would strike me as a poor investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that 600 people have taken up the voluntary early retirement scheme and that there is no desire on the part of the Government to have anybody leave the forces other than by way of this scheme.  However, while the number of officers offering has been reasonable, this number may fall dramatically over the next few years once this hump is out of the way.</P>
    <P>The plan skirts around the recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report for a separation of the Naval Service and Air Corps budgets.  To what extent would it now be sensible to have three different services?  The system envisages the pyramid where the Chief of Staff would be at the top and everybody would report to him, and he, in turn, would report to the Minister. While that seems reasonable, to what extent would it be more sensible to have the Air Corps and the Navy more separate than they are and to have a system of Joint Chiefs of Staff, with the Army <Col N="151" /> Chief of Staff as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.  That model is used in other countries.</P>
    <P>This accountancy approach to the Army is not a good way to look at it. There is far more to the Army than this. I live within a few miles of Curragh Camp &mdash; I grew up there &mdash; and I know the contribution made by the Army to a whole series of voluntary organisations and to the life of Newbridge and Kildare.  It is impossible to quantify that contribution in financial terms, but nevertheless it has been huge and it was by virtue of the fact that those people had Army training.  It is extraordinarily easy to spot a member of the Army, whether a private or the Chief of Staff, by their bearing and their conduct.</P>
    <P>The Army makes a huge contribution to society.  That is one of the reasons I am very much in favour of ensuring that barracks in places like Kilkenny &mdash; which I am sure Senator Lanigan will mention &mdash; Clonmel and other areas are kept open.  Reference has been made to the economic benefits of barracks to the local communities, but there is also a less tangible but a significant and important benefit, which has been evident in my constiuency.  I hope the involvement of members of the Army in the life of the local areas will continue for a long time because that is central to what the Army is about, apart from its defence keeping role.</P>
    <P>My final point concerns peace enforcement as opposed to peacekeeping. This may come back to Western European Union and NATO, but peace enforcement is as important to our Army as peacekeeping.  That issue will crop up to a greater degree in the years ahead and will have to be given greater attention.</P>
    <P>I welcome this document.  However, if I had more time, there are aspects to it of which I would be critical.  We all accept that we must reform our Army. It needs good management, modern equipment and professional people who are able to do any job we give them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is timely. Our Defence Forces are a vital national resource.  They have served with distinction, not only at home but in venues ranging from the Congo to the Lebanon. All too often defence forces serving outside their countries' borders do so in an aggressive capacity, but Ireland's Defence Forces have always served abroad in a peacekeeping capacity.  This is a tradition of which we are proud.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, during the bombardment of southern Lebanon, we saw the importance of the humanitarian work performed by Irish peacekeeping troops.  Of course, modern times demand modern responses from an Army as much as from a business point of view.  The review of the Defence Forces is designed to equip and meet the challenge, not only for the 1990s but also for the 21st century.</P>
      <P>When the review was announced, there was considerable concern not only among members of the Defence Forces but also among the local communities which were alarmed about the economic and social impact of barrack closures.  I accept the Minister's commitment on this and I welcome his reassurance that there will be no barrack closures.  This issue is being raised in the area I represent. Despite the fact that reassurances have been given, it continues to be raised and it needs to be emphasised that there will be no barrack closures.  I would welcome a further reassurance to the effect that the Minister will engage in ongoing consultation with the members of the Defence Forces &mdash; this was referred to by Senator Dardis &mdash; and that he will take on board the recommendations made in the PDFORRA submission to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Defence Forces throughout the world are increasingly taking on extra duties in the realm of civil defence, sea-air rescue, etc.  Many of these duties are highly specialised and require specialised technical and managerial skills.  The Minister in his statement refers to Naval Service involvement in fishery protection <Col N="153" /> and the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs as well as the Air Corps' involvement in search and rescue operations. It is good to put this on the record.</P>
    <P>The PDFORRA document makes a number of worthwhile suggestions which, if implemented, would enhance the performance, efficiency and morale of the Defence Forces.  When a document containing proposals of this nature is debated at this level, issues can be raised which can to some extent affect the morale of the forces.  For that reason, a commitment to consultation is vital.</P>
    <P>In chapter 8 of the submission PDFORRA makes a number of recommendations which if implemented would lead to the development of a flexible and transparent career structure while also ensuring that Defence Forces personnel have the skills necessary to equip them for civilian life after their service expires.  I share PDFORRA's concern at the proposal that a soldier who does not reach the rank of corporal within five years or sergeant within 12 years should be dismissed, even if that soldier has an excellent record.  Whereas at present there is no compulsory early retirement, the implementation of that recommendation has the same effect and that is affecting the morale of the forces.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister will take on board the situation of category E personnel during this transition period who may have left the Army before agreement is reached on this document. I would like that matter to be emphasised. The proposed reforms will not be successful unless they are carried out in full consultation and partnership with members of the Defence Forces and I urge the Minister to reaffirm his commitment to such a partnership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming in today to discuss this matter.  I have been asking for a discussion on the efficiency audit group review for about nine months.  It was perceived within the Defence Forces that this review was <Col N="154" /> necessary and that there would be an up side and a down side to the review.</P>
      <P>I thought I was about to join the Army in 1956, having done my leaving certificate, but I failed my medical because I did not have enough opposing teeth.  In the week before I went for my medical I played a hurling match and some clown from Wexford knocked six of my teeth out.  If he had knocked the six opposing each other out I would be in the Army today.  However, I joined the FCA.</P>
      <P>I had the great privilege of being in the FCA at a time when uniforms were scarce.  We had the bull's wool &mdash; the old uniform &mdash; and the big boots.  When we went to Brussels to run for Ireland at the Conseil Internationale Sportif Militaire, the people in Brussels thought we were going to support them in the congo, so we were cheered all over Brussels.  I got my stripes, I kept the stripes and refused to take more.  I ran for UCD on one occasion against the Army.  The race was organised in a particular barracks and they had the function in the officers' mess afterwards.  I refused to go into the officers' mess because I was a corporal in the FCA, so we had to get the Army to move the function from the officers' mess to the NCO's mess.  Since then I have kept a close eye on developments.</P>
      <P>The EAG conclusion comes about as a result of a recommendation made by a former Government and it was timely. The conclusions that have been reached will receive a reasonably popular reception throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The age profile of the Army is too high; there is no question about that. That has to be addressed without causing great problems for present members of the Defence Forces who are too old. It is not their fault that they are still in the Army.  The structure of the Army allowed them to stay too long although they are not particularly fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relationship between the Department of Defence and the military establishment has to be addressed in a deeper way than it has been addressed in the efficiency audit group review.  There is <Col N="155" /> no doubt that civil servants, although they are civil servants of the highest quality, are not military personnel and therefore should not be involved in the top management structure.  They are working for the Government, not in a military situation.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the operational effectiveness has been impaired not by the shortage of manpower, but by having people in too many places throughout the country.  That situation must be addressed.  The Minister has said that no barracks will be closed, but it is farcical to suggest that this is the case.  Barracks can be kept open, but if there are no personnel in the barracks it is a waste of time; so suggesting that this Government will not close any barracks is not correct.  Any barracks can be kept open, but there is no point in keeping them open unless they are effective and doing a job.  Many military personnel are engaged on duties which are not of a military nature and that has to be addressed.  Luckily this issue has been addressed in the report.</P>
    <P>There are too many medically unfit personnel.  A person who is medically unfit to walk up a stairs may not be medically unfit to look at a screen and it appears that looking at television screens is now more important than being able to walk up and down a barrack square.  According to the latest reports from Washington, television screens can now be used to take rockets out.  They can sit down at a computer and just take them out.  Why does one have to be fit?  Is a person medically fit if he can look at a television, or must he be able to walk up and down a barracks square?  Must he be able to walk a quarter of a mile in 50 seconds, or is it sufficient to be able to look at a television screen for an hour and a half and to be able to blow a rocket out of the sky?</P>
    <P>There is an imbalance in the ratio of pay to non-pay expenditure, leading to insufficient funds for buildings, equipment and training &mdash; and undoubtedly, but for our UN involvement, that imbalance would be huge.  Even though we <Col N="156" /> are owed a lot of money by the UN for our service abroad, without it the Army would be totally bereft of the equipment needed for a modern force.</P>
    <P>The implementation group was told to prepare a plan for restructuring and reform of the Defence Forces which was to detail the action to be taken in the first phase.  This phase was to last three years, which is broadly compatible with the recommendations of the EAG, and was to include a voluntary early retirement scheme for military personnel. The number of staff who have sought early retirement under this scheme is far higher than the number envisaged in the EAG proposals.  This may cause problems, because when voluntary early retirement was made an option in Waterford Glass and other industries, the best people availed of it and those who would not be re-employed elsewhere did not.  In Waterford Glass, those who took the early retirement option are now employed on a part time basis as consultants where they had previously been employed as members of staff.  If a voluntary retirement scheme does not get rid of the people one wishes to remove, it will not work.  As happened elsewhere, the Army will allow good people to retire and get them back as consultants.</P>
    <P>During the first phase of the process, there will be no barracks closures, no reduction in the number of bands, the Army Equitation School will remain, etc.  This is marvellous for public perception, but it means the next Minister will decide whether there will be closures &mdash; the present Minister can quote the efficiency audit group and make no decision.  It appears the Government hopes the next Minister will be a Fianna Fáil Minister and he will have to make the hard choices.  I also think the next Minister will be from Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The present established figure for the Defence Forces is approximately 18,000 persons, although the strength is 12,750 persons.  It is proposed that 11,500 persons will be the figure for both the established forces and the strength of the forces.  The reduction is therefore <Col N="157" /> not simply from 12,750 but from 18,000 to 11,500.  The Minister must explain how he can suggest the reduction is only from 12,750 to 11,500 when the established defence forces figure is 18,000 persons.</P>
    <P>Some command headquarters are to be suppressed.  This issue will be of grave importance and Kilkenny is one of those headquarters.  The suggestion is that there should be a re-organised defence headquarters with three brigades, a national training centre in the Curragh, a logistics base in Collins Barracks, Dublin, and the Curragh, and the Air Corps and Naval Service, which will be established in Cobh.  This means everything will effectively be based in the Curragh and Dublin, but there is no logistical sense in those locations being the headquarters for the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.  It might make sense if we were under threat and the Army did not have to act as a back up to civilian services &mdash; that is, the Garda and the prison service &mdash; and on the Border, but that is not the case.  The report states that at present too many people are tied up in various levels at headquarters but the proposals will cement that.</P>
    <P>The units will be more effective and efficient, but only if they are kept up to strength.  The strength should be kept at 18,000, not the proposed number of 11,500 nor even the current strength of 12,750.  The current figure for the established defence forces is 18,000 and that will be dropped to 11,500.  Anyone who does not believe this should look at the figures.</P>
    <P>The EAG recommends that some units should be split up between two or more military posts, but this will disperse resources and tie up excessive numbers in administration if put into practice by the implementation group.  It is not possible to reduce units and numbers to maintain an efficient Army without closing some military posts and we all agree there have to be some closures.</P>
    <P>It is desirable to maintain the Army Equitation School and Army bands but they should not be kept at the expense <Col N="158" /> of operational troops, because if we do not have such personnel there is no point having bands and showjumpers. The Minister is interested in showjumping, as am I, but I would prefer to see our troops deployed on a peace-keeping mission in the Lebanon.</P>
    <P>Under the implementation group report there is no provision for an operational unit to support the Defence Forces training centre in the Curragh, but security will be required for installations such as the stores and the Army ammunition depot.  Operational troops must also be available to the various training schools for instructional exercises.  The plan is flawed in not providing an operational infantry unit outside the three brigade structure.  It also proposes the suppression of the Army Apprentice School, which provides tradesmen who are needed in the Defence Forces and has been exceptionally well used over many years.  If we are going to maintain the Army's PR units there is no way we should lose the apprentice school.</P>
    <P>I could speak for another hour and a half but I must finish.  I hope this debate continues because it is of value and has effects on everyone.  The voluntary early retirement scheme is not attractive to personnel over 50 years of age.  If one wants to allow voluntary retirement one must target those people first, but few of them have sought it.  Those who have applied are people under 50 who want to take up opportunities outside the Army.  The offer is on a first come, first served basis.</P>
    <P>A number of items must be tackled and I hope this is only the beginning of this debate, which I have sought for many months.  I also hope that at the end we have an Army structure which is suitable for our country, able to deal with peace keeping and peace enforcement problems we may encounter abroad, and that the Army will be stronger for the debates on the EAG and the implementation group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is a very useful debate because it has put some of the <Col N="159" /> matters which have been discussed over many months into context.  There have been wrong headlines and erroneous rumours.  All of us in this House have great regard for the Army and welcome all it has done over many years.</P>
      <P>We have seen changes in other organisations and bodies and the Army itself wants to change as we approach the next century.  It is important for consultations to take place and for various matters to be examined.  The role of the modern Army must be looked at and reviewed.  The roles of the Naval Service and the Air Corps have changed in relation to their various protection duties and other work, and the role of Army personnel has also changed.</P>
      <P>I support the action taken by the Minister and the Government.  The plan will be phased in over several years and there will have to be changes.  It is important for the Army to get the back-up and services it needs.  The Army has been successful in relation to the duties it has carried out at home and our long tradition, dating back to the Congo, of performing admirably in relation to peace keeping duties.  Lip service has been paid to the Army, which has been the poor relation at times and has not been as well organised or looked after. It is important that this Government has recognised the necessary and integral part played by the Army, which is changing and modernising.  I hope, following on from the consultation and review which has taken place, we will have an Army of which we can be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Times have changed, as has the traditional role of the Army, particularly in relation to Border duties.  The Army can, and should, be called upon in relation to various other duties.  The Army has a role to play in relation to shipments of money or the transfer of prisoners.  One sees gardaí escorting Securicor vans which are transporting money and perhaps there is a role for the Army there.  The gardaí would be better employed in trying to solve crimes rather than following a van for <Col N="160" /> 100 miles.  I hope people join the Garda to provide a system of justice and bring criminals to justice rather than to escort money, although that is a necessary task given the robberies which have occurred.</P>
    <P>I welcome the maintenance of the bands in the various command posts. They provide a certain amount of colour and individuality and have always provided great support for the events at which they have performed.  I hope they will be maintained and given reasonable resources.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker mentioned diversification between the peace keeping forces and the Army Equitation School. I am sure the Equitation School will receive reasonable support from this Minister and the Government to maintain its tremendous tradition.  That might mean extra capital for the purchase of horses to augment the strength of the school.  Army officers have been members of our teams for the Aga Khan and Nations' Cup championships and we have had great success in three day eventing.  The Army has played a part in the success of Irish horses over the years throughout Europe and the rest of the world.  I hope extra funding can be found for that.  We have had very good horses from time to time, but money must be made available as we are competing with Germans, Americans and others who may have an open cheque book.  If money can be made available for training young horses, that success will continue.</P>
    <P>Some barracks have been upgraded and updated.  People cannot be asked to live or work in outdated and outmoded conditions.  A scheme of refurbishment and rebuilding has to take place in certain areas, similar to that which has taken place in local authority housing. Some of the camps and barracks are quite good but there is room for improvement in some areas.  People have to be provided with reasonable and modern facilities in order to carry out their work.  I am not saying armchairs should be provided, but people must be provided with reasonable working <Col N="161" /> conditions.  I ask the Minister to look at the various areas and, within the restraints of his budget, to earmark their restoration.</P>
    <P>The Army must be provided with a reasonable supply of the up to date equipment required by a modern army.  It is important to maintain morale in the Army, which is reasonably good.  That is important for those making a career in the Army, some of whom may retire early.  We all know people who have retired early and who have used their experience in another field.  I hope morale in the Army is maintained. This country owes a great debt to people in all ranks who have played a role down through the years.</P>
    <P>I praise the present work of the Defence Forces, particularly in south Lebanon, where they are acting as referee in a match with many problems on both sides without using a heavy handed approach.  I hope our troops are protected at all times because the UN force is trying to fulfil a difficult mission at present.  It is important that we do not forget these people doing a hard job in difficult circumstances.  The courage and commitment the Army has shown down through the years is once again very evident.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on what he has done so far and he will have the support of all Members.  It is important that we recognise the need for change.  This country needs a well-trained and disciplined Army which can be sent on various missions and perform tasks.  I support what has been said and I hope this debate will provide the Minister with some ideas.  We must support the Army and listen to its difficulties.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not forget the FCA when considering these matters. Many people have benefited from and have served in it.  It is important that extra money is found to ensure that missions, camp meetings and training programmes are encouraged.  Young people should be encouraged to gain particular <Col N="162" /> expertise and knowledge.  I welcome this debate and I hope the Army will develop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Army.  I congratulate the Minister on visiting the Lebanon to see first hand what our Army personnel are doing.  The Army does us credit and brings great honour to the country when it goes abroad by doing its job efficiently and effectively.</P>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that although the conflict had ended when he visited the Lebanon, there was no communication between Army personnel and their wives during that conflict. They could not find out what was happening or get up to date information. We should have a little more consideration for these women at home with their families.  There is no reason somebody could not telephone the wives of personnel in danger zones to reassure them.  They got more information from Sky News and from RTE than from the Army.  I appeal to the Minister to look into that because it is important that people get a first hand account rather than having to depend on journalists, who are doing a good job &mdash; but only for them we would not have known as much about what was going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultants are making a lot of money from all these reviews.  Very often they are accountants and they look at cost cutting and pounds, shillings and pence rather than the human side of things.  Many people in the Army are very badly paid.  This morning a woman from Sligo said that other personnel on Border duty get £60 for each shift, but an Army man gets £40 and a sandwich for seven days work.  Other personnel get meals from hotels paid for by the State and delivered by State transport. That is not fair.  If there is a problem, the Army is a dangerous position and it must defend us.  Army personnel on Border patrol have done a great job.  If the Army was not stationed along the Border, I would not like to think what would have happened in this part of the <Col N="163" /> country.  It has had to deal with subversives and smugglers and to provide back up to Customs officers dealing with the drug problem.  The Army should not get a lousy £40 per week, which is grossly unfair.  I would be critical of the Army officer I heard this morning who adopted the attitude of a sergeant major in World War One, that is, that people knew what the Army was like when they joined and that they should take what they get.  That is not the way to talk to anybody.  Thank God that World War One attitude is long gone.</P>
    <P>It was great that 10,000 young men applied to join the Army this year. However, the reason for this is there is no work for young people and they are looking for jobs.  If a persons goes into another service, there are unions to protect them and nobody will say to them that they knew what to expect when they joined and that they can leave if they do not like it.  One cannot do that in any other section of the community. Why should Army personnel be penalised for doing this type of work?  It is time we treated them like officers because they are as responsible and are in as much danger.</P>
    <P>The Army is ensuring that our agricultural industry is kept going.  Our cattle are being exported and there is no danger of cattle being smuggled at a time when it would be profitable to do so.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this section and at those on Border duty working long hours.  He should give information to the wives of Army personnel working in dangerous areas and pay those doing back up duty on the Border.  They are entitled to this.  They are all paid from the same purse.  It is scandalous and a major discrepancy that one person should be paid £60 for a shift and another £40 a week for doing the same work.  I ask the Minister to look into this situation.</P>
    <P>We have been told that no Army barracks will be closed.  This is true, but what will happen as a result of not recruiting people?  Barracks will automatically <Col N="164" /> close because there will be no personnel to fill them.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of vandalism in this country.  There are many young thugs in this city and in every town and we have no proper place to put them.  I suggested some time ago that we should open a school for them which would be run by the Army.  Young people who do not go to school and are wild should be taken into the Army, not to be abused but to be trained and educated under proper supervision.  They could learn trades and become good technicians, mechanics or horsemen.  This would bring great peace to Dublin and other towns.  It would take these young people out of the drink, drugs and sex syndrome they are in at present.  They should be properly trained, cared for, fed and clad.</P>
    <P>There used to be four Army bands but this may be reduced to two because the Army is not training young people to be musicians.  If there is no training, how can we keep the bands going?  They are dying out because there are no people to fill vacancies in them.  The Army bands were great and were always a centre of attraction in towns they visited. It would be a pity to allow them to die and we should keep them going.</P>
    <P>Under the new system future recruitment is to be for only five years.  We should not expect people to give five years of their lives to the Army and only receive a minimal pension.  How would they be able to obtain bank loans, buy houses and look after their homes and families?  They would have no security. Five years is too short a period to expect people to give of their best.  If this proposal is implemented, unless there is some degree of security I cannot see the same numbers of people wanting to join the Army as now want to do so.  People will leave the Army after five years at a time when few will want to employ them.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this from the human perspective of how people are treated and how they do their job.</P>
    <P>The barracks in Finner, County Donegal, was almost closed 25 years ago <Col N="165" /> but was kept open because of the troubles in the North.  At the time it consisted of only a few dilapidated sheds.  If the barracks had been closed, how would we have manned and controlled that part of the Border during the 25 years of violence?  We can close things down but what price will be paid for this?  This was the attitude we adopted when we closed small schools. We thought it would be cheaper to bring children to larger schools by bus. We felt it would be cheaper to do things on a larger scale.  However, the result is that the whole system breaks down because the personal touch is gone.</P>
    <P>If young people join the Army they should be guaranteed jobs for at least ten years.  Five years is ridiculous.  We should maintain the Army bands.  I feel strongly that those on duty on the Border should be given recognition and should receive more than £40 for a seven day week.  It is scandalous that others doing the same work are paid £60 a shift.  I appeal to the Minister to consider these points and do something about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The importance of the Defence Forces for south Kildare cannot be underestimated as it is the home of the Curragh.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that we should debate the role of the Defence Forces. Recently, the Government published a White Paper on Foreign Policy.  While that document confirmed Ireland's military neutrality, it envisaged an expansion of our roles as peace-keepers and peace-enforcers in conjunction with the Western European Union and the NATO led Partnership for Peace.  I support the broad thrust of the line taken in the White Paper; but if we are to pay more than lip service to it, we need to modernise our Defence Forces.  I welcome the Minister and I commend him on his initiative thus far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has correctly outlined the challenges facing the Defence Forces.  These are the development of a force which is modern and well <Col N="166" /> equipped, flexible enough to respond to various challenges, well managed and with an appropriate command structure, and one in which professional soldiers are rewarded with a professional career. This debate comes on foot of the fundamental review of the Defence Forces conducted by Price Waterhouse consultants and the efficiency audit group. These reports outlined the problems with existing arrangements in the Defence Forces and their command structure.  Those problems include the worrying age profile of the forces &mdash; a problem which will not be fully tackled until we make a rewarding career out of membership of the Defence Forces &mdash; excessive bureaucracy and resultant pay difficulties.</P>
    <P>These issues are substantial and go to the core of the Defence Forces.  I welcome the Government's decision to establish an implementation plan to deal with these problems.  I also welcome the commitment to ensure that in the first three years of this plan there will be no barracks closures.  I was disappointed to hear Members on the other side say they should be closed as of now. We can see the benefits of a barracks to a town, especially in rural Ireland.  Barracks are as good as industries to towns and none of them should be closed prior to them ceasing to be of benefit to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis spoke about the Army Apprentice School in Naas.  It is imperative that this is kept in operation so that its benefits to the nation are maintained.  Many great tradesmen attended this school.  There is a trend in industry at present not to take on apprentices.  If we close that school we will close one of the places which has provided us with apprentices of the highest standard.  The school should be retained irrespective of what other barracks are to be closed.  One might say I have mentioned it just because it is in Kildare, but it is not actually in my constituency of South Kildare.  I have always seen its value because of my involvement in a trade.  I have seen the number of personnel who came from <Col N="167" /> the Army Apprenticeship School.  I have seen the way they fitted into an industrial pattern and are well able to look after themselves, displaying skills they learned there.</P>
    <P>I agree with the statements on the Army Equitation School.  If we are to ensure the development of our valuable thoroughbred industry it is imperative to keep the equitation centre going.  It is marvellous to see our international show jumping teams performing all over the world with great riders like Ringrose, Kiely and McMahon.  Their successes reflect not only on the Defence Forces but also on the country at large. The Minister's interest in equitation will ensure that the school will survive any recommendations and will continue from strength to strength.</P>
    <P>Central to the success of the plan for overall management of the Defence Forces is an overall reduction of personnel from 12,500 to 11,500.  The voluntary early retirement scheme is designed to facilitate this change as well as addressing the overall age profile by facilitating the recruitment of 1,000 new members.</P>
    <P>If we are to keep the Defence Forces fresh and vigorous we must facilitate ongoing recruitment to the force, which in itself opens up promotional opportunities to keep talent within the organisation. As things stand, too many men are operating at certain levels with the forces and measures must be found to restore mobility to the Army's career structure.  I welcome the proposals outlined in the implementation plan in this regard.</P>
    <P>The recommendations contained in chapter 6 of the report are also critical. The inappropriate allocation of resources to tasks is a problem which is not confined to the Defence Forces. However, if the Defence Forces are to be in a position to take on the expanded role envisaged by the Government, this problem must be resolved.  It is difficult to contest the consultants' recommendations that new procedures are required.  For instance, the use of more civilians for office-related tasks has <Col N="168" /> already been carried out to some effect within the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the proposal to centralise individual training in the Curragh. The Minister visited the area recently and he should examine the residential accommodation for Army personnel there.  I have been involved with a number of groups in the area trying to organise a housing co-operative.  The Minister is well aware of the residential problems that the Defence Forces have in the Curragh.  In such a situation the overholder cannot draw down his pension because he is in a house which is the property of the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>On numerous occasions I have requested that residents of the Orchard Park housing estate should be permitted to buy the homes they live in under the tenant purchase scheme.  Unfortunately, the last three Ministers for Defence have not seen fit to allow that.  The Minster should reconsider the situation because while it is not a case of not wanting to assist the residents, the tradition still stands.  Tradition should be put to one side in this case and residents should be given permission to buy the houses they live in.</P>
    <P>Numerous single people who retire from the Defence Forces have no place to live.  Some residential locations on the Curragh which are not used at present could be developed into homes for such people, who would then be able to enjoy a lifestyle of comradeship after their Army service.  While such people are linked to the Curragh and Newbridge, they have nowhere to go when they retire.  They can end up on the street because no one is responsible for finding accommodation for them.  An effort should be made to deal with that problem by using vacant residential areas on the Curragh for the benefit of single people who have retired from the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Training is a critical facet of a modern, properly functioning army.  As we know from other sectors of the economy, training has an ongoing effect.  It is something one does not forget, and it <Col N="169" /> must be repeated at various times during an individual's career.  I am aware that this is an expensive plan but the money must be found over a number of years to ensure its implementation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the points I have made about different aspects of the plan.  I have no doubt that the Defence Forces will benefit accordingly and that the Army will continue to represent the country proudly, as it has in the past, be it is a peace-keeping role, defending our autonomy or in show jumping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the way he is handling the changing role of the Army and in assisting morale within the Defence Forces.  I am from County Monaghan, and those who live in the Border counties are aware of the necessity of having Army barracks located there now and into the future.  I am buoyed up by the current Minister's attitude.</P>
      <P>In recent months there has been some scaremongering at local authority level with people predicting barrack closures. I am glad the Minister has moved to quell such rumours.  It is his duty to do so because the morale of the Army is important to all of us.  The Minister has never flinched about taking an opportunity to act when it was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People living in the Border counties during the BSE scare of the past four or five weeks appreciate the need for an Army presence there to assist the Garda.  At a recent meeting a colleague of mine noted that a rabbit could not find its way across the Border without being caught, and Members of the House will appreciate the reason for that.  We are faced with a huge problem arising from difficulties with beef.  If the Army and Garda were not in a position to seal off the Border we would have had mayhem.  Internationally, we have been proved right by protesting in the way we did.  We have demonstrated our bona fides to everybody who is anxious to obtain proof that we had a sensible and successful BSE policy.  When a problem with BSE arose in the UK and <Col N="170" /> Northern Ireland we took decisive action and demonstrated that we have an absolute intention to ensure Irish beef is of the highest quality.  The Army played an essential role in that regard. I recently travelled through the Border counties and saw the Army and Garda protecting Irish livestock from BSE.</P>
    <P>The role of the Army is changing and evolving, as the role of the EU is evolving. Its traditional role of defending the country from outside attacks has become irrelevant in recent years.  This fact underlines the necessity for under-taking a complete review of the role of the Army and consider the introduction of more efficient methods.  During the past five to six years it became apparent that the age profile in the Army had moved out of kilter.  Due to events in the previous decade, the average age of soldiers was too high.  People in the Army were very conscious of this.  Soldiers have an image of themselves as being lean, fit and capable of responding quickly to any difficulties or problems.  A high age profile did not match this image.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister decided to introduce the voluntary early retirement package.  I am informed that many people in the Army will be happy in this regard.  The package is good and is a voluntary measure, which means that people will not be coerced into accepting it.  I believe it will be successful and that the average age of soldiers will decrease dramatically in the near future.  I congratulate the Minister because he took decisive action which was essential and necessary.</P>
    <P>Many people who serve in the Army for a number of years appreciate the training they receive.  Those now in civilian life always remember the very good training they received while in the Army.  When I worked as a post primary school teacher many of my past pupils progressed to the Army Apprentice School in Naas.  With the changes that have occurred in the role of apprentices in industry and the new attitude to apprenticeships, the emphasis at Naas is also changing.  I know the Minister is <Col N="171" /> reviewing this situation from time to time.  I am sure that the training people currently receive at the apprentice training school is very different to that received by my earliest past pupils.</P>
    <P>The Army is highly regarded throughout the world because of its peacekeeping duties.  This gives everyone a sense of pride.  I have never heard criticism from any source about the way in which Irish soldiers behave or act.  If we consider Irish history, it is apparent that it is easier for the Army to take an evenhanded role in fulfilling its peacekeeping duties.  Such duties also attract much needed finance to the country.  It is good that the Irish Army is held in the highest international esteem.</P>
    <P>In regard to barracks, it is difficult for the Minister to consider the need for some form of rationalisation in the future because, politically, this is a very awkward subject.  I am sure that a time will come when a barracks in some part of the country will be obliged to close. I know the Border counties better than others and I must state that the Army presence is of supreme importance to a town's economy.  Once that presence is established and soldiers begin to spend their wages in local shops, a major input to the local economy is made.  The people of the Border counties appreciate the presence of the Army from the point of view of security in the towns of Castleblayney, Monaghan and Cavan. That presence is also appreciated because it brings important wealth into the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister fully appreciates and understands that people become very disturbed when scaremongering begins about the intention to close the barracks in Castleblayney or Monaghan, for example.  One can imagine the void that remains when hundreds of families are removed from an area.  An army barracks makes a contribution to a community commensurate to that of a large factory.  It is important that the Minister is successful in attempts at cost cutting and streamlining in order that these barracks remain open.  They are very <Col N="172" /> important and I thank him for his appreciation of that fact.  I commend Deputy Barrett for his actions since becoming Minister for Defence and I wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett) Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the many Senators who, in the main, contributed to this debate in a positive and constructive manner.  I will deal with the exceptions during my reply.</P>
      <P>First, I will deal with the issue of closure of barracks.  At no time did the Department, myself or anyone else issue a list of possible closures of barracks. This plan is not dependent on the closure of barracks.  There are no plans to close barracks.  I appreciate the fact that Senator Byrne accepted that this is the case.  However, there is obviously a division within his party.  I was surprised by the attitude of some of the Senator's colleagues who seemed to be extremely disappointed that barracks will not be closed.  I went to the trouble of meeting a delegation from Kilkenny, at the behest of Senator Lanigan, which included the town clerk and assured them that it was not intended to close Kilkenny barracks.  I also travelled to Mullingar with the Chief of Staff to meet representatives from the council and local chamber of commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not yet travelled to Longford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chief of Staff confirmed that Mullingar barracks would not be closed.  Apparently, my assurances were not enough for some people and the Chief of Staff had to provide confirmation.  I ask that people stop spreading rumours about the possible threat of barracks closures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Cotter stated, it must be remembered that we are dealing with families, children and people paying mortgages on their homes.  These people become terribly upset when they hear these rumours.  They often believe they will be obliged to move when the barracks closes and wonder what will <Col N="173" /> happen to them.  I request that people desist from starting rumours about barracks closures because there are no positive plans in that regard and such rumours negatively affect ordinary human beings.  I make no apologies to anyone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lanigan accused me of being cowardly about not facing up to the issue of barracks closures.  I reject this criticism.  I am not cowardly.  If I wanted to be cowardly, I would not have become involved in this matter and could have sat back for the next 12 months and done nothing.  This plan is being put in place because we have too much respect for the Defence Forces, the work they have done and service they have given.  They are great ambassadors.  We are doing it for all these reasons and because we respect people who choose the Defence Forces as a career.  They have done an excellent job over the years.</P>
    <P>I am not cowardly about facing up to issues.  The reason no barracks closures are mentioned is that this is not included in the three year plan.  It is reasonable that people are given a chance to implement phase one of the plan without having to deal with rumours about the closure of barracks.  As many Senators said, barracks are essential to the economies of many towns and if the closure of a barracks was being considered it should be discussed well in advance and cover matters such as alternative employment opportunities for the town or the use of the land for industrial development.</P>
    <P>One does not wake up one morning and say a certain barracks will be closed next year.  That is not how we do business and I hope that as long as I am a member of the Government we will not treat people in that fashion.  If the closure of a barracks is planned, it should be done properly by me or my successor &mdash; if we must face that situation &mdash; with notice well in advance and preparations for a replacement industrial activity in the town and use of the barracks.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan said a list was published, but a list was never published by <Col N="174" /> anybody dealing with the implementation plan.  Suggestions were made by a representative association that if one was to go down the road suggested by Price Waterhouse, the closure of barracks would be necessary and it identified barracks which could be closed as a result.  However, it is the representative association's business if it wants to speculate in that regard.  I cannot do anything about it; I just outline Government decisions.</P>
    <P>The Price Waterhouse report was independent and it does not necessarily follow that the Government must accept every word of it.  The Government took the report and changed many things recommended in it because that is what we were elected to do.  The implementation group was established and it produced the report the House is debating. This report is different from the Price Waterhouse report; people often confuse this point.  The Government acted on the Price Waterhouse report on the basis of recommendations from the implementation group as a practical solution to the current situation.</P>
    <P>I am most disappointed that Senator Lanigan used the occasion to state that the equitation school is a waste of time, that it should be closed and that we should not worry about horses. Members of the Defence Forces are ambassadors and the equitation school was set up to promote the Irish horse. Anybody who knows anything about Ireland knows the country is famous for horses and considerable money has been made over the years from the export of horses.  There is nothing better to see than a good horse, bred in Ireland, competing at international level with a rider wearing a Defence Forces uniform.  Millions are spent promoting tourism in Ireland and what better way to promote Ireland than with ambassadors such as members of the Defence Forces presenting a good image and sending a message about the quality of our horses?  I have no intention of closing the Army Equitation School.  I have spent my time trying to secure additional funds for it to ensure, as <Col N="175" /> Senator Cosgrave said, it has an ongoing programme of purchasing young horses which will eventually reach international standards.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion that cutbacks were made in the FCA and Civil Defence.  However, I assure the House that is not the case.  The Estimate this year shows an increase on last year in both the FCA and Civil Defence areas. There are no plans for cutbacks because the Government recognises the wonderful voluntary work done by members of these organisations.  The FCA will be the subject of a special study during phase one of the plan.  Everything cannot be dealt with at the same time, so during the first three years there will be a review of the FCA to consider how it fits into the new structures.  The Government has no intention of cutting back on the FCA.  There is no need to convince me of the valuable work it has done and how good it is for the country that people offer their time on a voluntary basis in the FCA or Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence is implementing its own plan, &ldquo;Towards 2000&rdquo;, which ensures that the activities of the organisation reflect the needs of the country in, for example, crowd control or mountain rescue searches.  It has changed its structure and it is implementing its plan.  The Government is assisting the Civil Defence as best it can and I hope that will continue.</P>
    <P>The implementation plan is not a cost cutting exercise.  It is designed to create a more modern efficient Defence Force that is capable of performing the roles assigned to it by the Government.  I hope the savings that will be made eventually will change the current ratio of 80 per cent pay, 20 per cent equipment, to 70 per cent pay and 30 per cent equipment.  This will enable the purchase of modern equipment so that the people asked to do a job will be in a position to do it.  People are trained for things we hope will never happen, but they must be trained in case such eventualities occur.  Resources must be spent on this area to ensure that if such <Col N="176" /> an event happened, trained personnel are available to perform certain tasks.</P>
    <P>One small example is the fire brigade strike in Wexford, which went on for many weeks.  The people of Wexford would have been without such a service but for the fact that the Defence Forces were in a position to move in and provide it until the dispute was resolved. Ultimately, it takes time, effort and money to train people in fire fighting and that is a practical example of the day to day role the Defence Forces can play in assisting the community.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan said many good people will be lost in the voluntary early retirement scheme.  However, this scheme is voluntary and it works both ways in terms of those offering it.  If people with essential skills apply, it does not necessarily follow that their applications must be accepted.  The scheme will be implemented by setting up a board which will assess each application. If certain categories cannot be facilitated due to a shortage of skills in particular areas, it will be a matter for the board to decide in some cases that applicants may not be offered retirement. By making the scheme voluntary, it means individuals will not be honed in on and hunted out of the Defence Forces.  This is not the purpose of the scheme.  It is voluntary in the context that people who do not want to accept it will not have to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock was concerned about category E.  People in this category are usually below the required medical standard and would not be entitled in the normal way to voluntary early retirement because they are due to be discharged from the PDF.  However, because it was known this scheme was coming up, we did not categorise people as category E so as to give them a chance of taking up the voluntary early retirement scheme.  I hope that will satisfy Senator Sherlock's concerns.  We left these people in category C so they could apply for the scheme.  This was an effort to show that we take a humane approach to human problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> Senator Farrell was totally opposed, shocked and horrified about the fact that I was introducing five year contracts for members of the Defence Forces. It was the Senator's party which first introduced five year contracts in 1993.  I was sceptical about the wisdom of this when I was in Opposition. However, people who have worked with five year contract members have told me they are excellent people by and large and there is no sense of their being part of a different group because they happen to be on a five year contract. They have integrated very well in the overall structure.</P>
    <P>However, part of our problem, which we are addressing in this review, is in dealing with the age profile.  Due to the nature of the Defence Forces, certain people cannot be guaranteed a job for life.  By its very nature, these people may for one reason or another not be capable of performing the role expected of them.  Therefore, one cannot guarantee these people a job for life.  If this is done, one will end up with a serious age profile problem, which is what we are currently trying to address.  Maybe there are better ways of dealing with this than offering five year contracts, but at least we were giving some people a start in life.  These people, as some Senators said, were and are being taught skills, a sense of pride in what they are doing, self-respect etc.  I hope those who will not be invited to continue as members of the Defence Forces will find that their training will help them in no small measure in getting employment in the outside world.</P>
    <P>If we go down the road of contracts, whether they be five, seven or ten years in length, there must be a cut off point where people will be offered a further contract.  Some standard must be set.  I have not decided if, for example, a soldier is automatically entitled to stay on if he has reached NCO level is the right way, but we still have some time to decide on it.  The concept I feared has proved me wrong, from my practical experience in the short time I have been Minister for Defence and the Marine. <Col N="178" /> We must recognise there will be a problem if the age profile gets out of control. At the end of the day, we have an Army to run with duties to perform and we must have the personnel capable of performing them.</P>
    <P>I want to see us train people, give them skills and see them perform these roles as skilled and trained soldiers, sailors etc.  We should not waste time having them carrying out duties that should be performed by civilians.  This happened for many years in the Garda Síochána before it was eventually addressed.  We are trying to do the same in the Defence Forces.  Having trained soldiers serving cups of tea to people must be examined.  Should somebody else involved in that business be doing that, letting the trained soldiers free to do the job for which they are trained? Perhaps there are areas where it would be necessary to have skilled soldiers perform certain tasks but others could be performed by civilians, which is what this exercise is trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>I gave five year contracts a lot of thought.  I am not saying we have found a solution, but at least offering a contract to those reaching NCO level is a start.  Maybe some soldiers do not want to stay on and it may suit them to leave when their contracts end.  It may be in their interest that the system currently in place will continue.</P>
    <P>I was surprised and concerned to hear Senator Farrell refer to the lack of communication between our soldiers serving in the Lebanon and their families.  I was informed that there is currently in place a comprehensive communications system with, and support for, the families of personnel serving overseas and that it has been developed over the years. Officers from each barracks around the country from which personnel are deployed in south Lebanon establish contact in as wide a range and manner as possible with these families to keep them in touch with the latest developments. We were conscious of this matter.  If Senators know of individual cases where contracts were not made with families, I would be interested to <Col N="179" /> receive information about them because I would certainly follow them up.  I am anxious that we keep in touch.  If families did not have telephones, officers from different barracks called to the homes to inform wives and relatives about the situation in south Lebanon. That is an essential part of this exercise. I was concerned to hear Senator Farrell's comments on this matter because I would not like to think this would be acceptable practice.  It is certainly not, as far as I am concerned, and I would like to have it rectified.  If Senators have the names and addresses of people who have been affected in this way, I will have their cases investigated.  We have spent much effort and time putting in place a system to keep people in touch and in communication.</P>
    <P>All personnel posted to Border units receive a special Border duty allowance ranging from £42.52 to £48.12 per week or £2,218.69 to £2,510.90 per annum in recognition of incidence of separation from families and difficult working conditions. This allowance is paid irrespective of hours worked.  In contrast, personnel who perform certain security duties in non-Border units are paid security duty allowance only on the occasions of the performance of these duties, whereas the allowance paid in the Defence Forces is paid irrespective of the hours worked.</P>
    <P>The rate of remuneration of the permanent Defence Forces, including security duty allowance and Border duty allowance, were determined by the Gleeson Commission in July 1990.  The commission expressly stated its conclusion that military duties were clearly in a distinctive category and it would not be appropriate to fix military pay on the basis of a direct comparison with the pay of gardaí, prison officers or fire-fighters.</P>
    <P>In addition, all permanent Defence Force personnel receive a military service allowance of £1,996 per annum to compensate for the special disadvantages of military life, such as liability for long duty hours, being subject to transfers, <Col N="180" /> which involves a disruption of home life, and a requirement to serve in bad or uncomfortable conditions. Again, this allowance is payable irrespective of the actual hours worked.  That is separate to the Border units.  A military service allowance of £1,996 is paid.</P>
    <P>As Senators know, personnel of the Permanent Defence Force now have representative associations which may make claims for improvements in their remuneration through the Defence Forces conciliation and arbitration scheme. In fact, the issues of security duty allowance and Border duty allowance are at present under consideration under the aegis of the conciliation council.  I wanted to put that on the record because I know there is some discussion going on at the moment.  That is the position and there is scope for discussion and consultation to take place through the representative bodies and the staff of the Department under the umbrella of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
    <P>I have tried to answer most of the questions that have been put to me.  I thank you again for affording me the opportunity of addressing the House.  If Members wish to have a further debate or discussion at any time I would be only too pleased to come here and answer any questions that individuals may have.  I think all the Senators who contributed for the courteous manner in which they received me.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann annuls the regulations made under section 3 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, because:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> (1)  they constitute a serious discrimination against the psychiatrically ill as other patients are not singled out for such a limit;</P>
    <P>(2)  the regulations give effect to a reduction of insurance cover for psychiatric patients from 180 days to 100 days a year; and</P>
    <P>(3)  the regulations fail to reflect the actual cost to subscribers of outpatient services.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 (3) of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, there is a provision for the Seanad to annul regulations made under legislation within 21 sitting days after the regulations were laid before the Oireachtas.  These regulation were laid before the Oireachtas on 28 March 1994.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a 100 day limit on cover per calendar year constitutes a most serious discrimination against patients suffering from psychiatric illness because no other patients, that is, patients receiving care under the general medical service, are singled out for such a limit.  Patients suffering from psychiatric illness must be treated no differently from patients suffering from physical illness.  It is unbelievable that this Government is enacting legislation to effect this discrimination.  These regulations represent a 45 per cent reduction in cover and are contrary to all the guidelines on psychiatric care that have been issued by the Department of Health in recent years.</P>
    <P>The signing of these regulations is a clear attack on one of the most vulnerable sections of our community.  It will, I believe, result in over 1,000 patients having to leave psychiatric hospitals each year before their in-patient treatment is complete.  Other medical illness will continue to have 180 days insurance cover.  This clearly discriminates against psychiatric illnesses such as depression, manic depression, schizophrenia, substance abuse and alcohol dependency, all of which have just as much a medical biological basis as, say, diabetes or heart disease.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> The Department of Health maintains that these regulations are necessary to enable other insurance companies to enter the Irish market.  In these regulations the Minister has followed the requirements of insurance companies, who have always discriminated against people suffering from psychiatric illnesses requiring, say, travel insurance, mortgage protection policies, or critical illness insurance.  It is one thing when insurance companies discriminate but it is another matter when the State discriminates in this way.</P>
    <P>Turning to the regulations for outpatients health cost, a component of the core service is that the regulations seek to establish on a statutory basis a limited annual minimum benefit, the level of which is notional, twice removed from the reality of the actual cost of such services to the subscriber, and which is also subject to the withholding of a fixed annual amount of benefit.</P>
    <P>In general insurance the purpose is to provide protection against unexpected costs, particularly those of a catastrophic nature.  Subscribers to health insurance expect that the statutory regulations would at least safeguard this principle for them.  However, the regulations, as now signed by the Minister, do not constitute an insurance arrangement formulated in the interests of the subscribing public.  They leave the subscriber with an open liability at the end of each service at the level of the part of the actual cost not designated as allowable for benefit purposes and for which the regulations require that a minimum benefit be provided.  There is no direct relationship with the risks experienced by the subscriber.  In these regulations signed by the Minister, the insurer is fully protected from risk while the subscriber is fully exposed.  This is surely anathema to the principle of insurance.</P>
    <P>I call on Seanad Éireann to annual the regulations signed by the Minister for Health which fail to protect the civil rights of those who suffer from a psychiatric illness and to annual the same regulations because they put the subscriber <Col N="183" /> who needs care on an outpatient basis at risk rather than the insurer.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion proposed by my colleague.  The Minister will be aware that we discussed this matter here in July 1995.  We were very seriously concerned about the provisions the Minister had in mind at that time.  At that time we asked the Minister to withhold making the regulations and to meet with representatives of various organisations involved in this area.  At that time Aware had made very strong representations and the organisation is still in communication with us as are representatives of St. Patrick's Institution and St. John of God's, which are the private institutions providing top quality care.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the Minister, he agreed to our wishes and he did look at the proposals at that time.  In view of the motion before the House he had discussion and fairly detailed consultation between then and now, but we are still not satisfied with the level of cover proposed by the Minister.  I will not go into the technicalities now, I do not wish to delay the House, but there is still the view that these proposals discriminate against psychiatrically ill patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minimum cover of 100 days now proposed will still be inadequate and, compared to the 180 days allowed for other cover, it will be seen as discriminatory against a vulnerable section of the community, people who are in need of special care.  As Senator Finneran said, the proposal is a 45 per cent reduction in the duration of cover compared to what exists at present.  The Minister has not convinced me that this will not seriously affect people who have to go back on a number of occasions during a 12 month period. When he replied to previous questions on this issue he gave figures for admissions; a high percentage of people return a second or third time during the period and to provide the necessary <Col N="184" /> cover, 180 days is the minimum required.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that where this cover will not be available or will be seriously curtailed, patients will be forced to go to the public service which, as the Minister is aware, is already under severe strain and barely able to survive.  I will not go into that because it is not the issue before us but it will mean that many of those currently in receipt of care and attention in private institutions will be forced to go into public institutions that are under pressure. It is also recognised that the cost of in-patient service and attention in the public services is higher than in private hospitals; perhaps the Minister could clarify that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come some way towards meeting the views forcibly expressed by Members on all sides of the House when we debated this issue last July.  He made a genuine effort to bridge the gap between what he originally proposed and what he proposes now.  However, he must go another part of the way to meet the demands made. I have been convinced by the representations made by Aware, St. Patrick's Institution, St. John of God's and practitioners who deal with this on a day to day basis and must be in a position to give an objective analysis.  I second Senator Finneran's motion and ask the Minister if, even at this late stage, he could examine the regulations to see if it is possible to bridge the gap between what is proposed and what is demanded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I am pleased to have the opportunity to inform Members about the real and significant protections which the health insurance regulations constitute for the public.  I do not think there is any doubt about the importance of the matter the House is being asked to consider in the motion before it.  It is crucial, therefore, to understand the broad context within which we come to be discussing the regulation of the business of health insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> This country's regulatory structure for health insurance was devised in the context of the measures adopted by the European Union to create a Single Market in insurance through its third non-life insurance directive.  The central thrust and purpose of the directive is to bring about a free and competitive market. While it contains certain provisions particular to private health insurance, it is not a health services directive but rather relates to non-life insurance services generally.</P>
    <P>In that context we must take a realistic approach to its implementation in terms of measures to admit competition to our market.  We cannot, for instance, use it to copperfasten the dominance of the VHI or to require any insurer entering the market to perform as a VHI &ldquo;clone&rdquo;.  To my knowledge everybody wants competition but there appears to be some reservations or lack of resolve when it comes to putting in place the measures to allow it to develop.  The rules for competition have been set out in the regulations and I am gratified that already one major international health insurance undertaking, BUPA, has decided to enter the market on the grounds set out.  I view this as a vital and positive development.</P>
    <P>Through the efforts of my officials and myself, the EU Commission has accepted in principle this country's entitlement to regulate the private health insurance market.  This involved considerable effort and persuasion on our part and took place against the background of a foreign insurance undertaking representing a contrary view to the Commission.  This chapter is perhaps not yet closed as it has been recently reported that the Association of British Insurers may take up the issue of our entitlement to legislate for the conduct of the health insurance business. It is important, therefore, to understand that there is a fundamental international business dimension to our private health insurance framework.</P>
    <P>As far as the Commission is concerned, competition and the performance of the marketplace are to be the <Col N="186" /> acid test.  It must be satisfied, through the experience of the market operation, that the measures put in place are in proportion to achieving the objective of protecting community rating and do not constitute an unsustainable barrier to trade.</P>
    <P>The regulations, which were made pursuant to the provisions of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, are intended to facilitate competition while protecting our core values of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover.  The regulations include a statutorily guaranteed minimum level of cover in respect of a variety of hospital and consultant in-patient, day patient and out-patient services.  Overall, the regulatory framework provides a high degree of protection to the members of the public in the context of opening up our private health insurance market to competition.</P>
    <P>The motion I am addressing claims, <i>inter alia</i>, that the regulatory framework constitutes serious discrimination against the psychiatrically ill and gives effect to a reduction in insurance cover for psychiatric patients from 180 days to 100 days per year.  In view of this I consider it instructive to look at what the market has provided up to recently as an express statutory entitlement to privately insured persons suffering from such illnesses.  The answer is, nothing &mdash; at present no minimum cover is required for any insurer trading in this country, so rather than reducing cover we are introducing for the first time a requirement that minimum cover of 100 days will be provided for the psychiatrically ill.  In the past the market was not obliged to provide for such cover on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Until the regulations were brought into being, insured persons were entirely reliant on the customary practices of the VHI as the country's sole provider of private health insurance to the public in a restricted market.  That market no longer exists by virtue of the EU's third non-life insurance directive. Under VHI legislation, the board may amend schemes of voluntary health insurance with the consent of the Minister <Col N="187" /> for Health.  Under its rules the VHI Board may alter hospital benefits on the provision of specified notice to its members.  What the VHI has provided and continues to provide to its members is cover of up to 180 days in-patient and/or day patient services a year.  The utilisation of this could be entirely in respect of psychiatric illness or general illness but could also be a combination of both.</P>
    <P>There are, however, other insurers in the market who provide indemnity cover within specific work/employee groups.  I refer to the schemes operated by the ESB, prison officers and the Garda, who between them have about 80,000 lives covered.  Under these schemes there are various arrangements relating to liability for benefit in respect of psychiatric illness.  These range from cover for 42 days a year to 90 days in any three year period.  Accordingly, varying insurance practices relating to psychiatric benefit already exist in our market and involve periods of indemnity considerably below 180 days in a year.</P>
    <P>It is the general practice of major British insurers to limit and/or extensively qualify their exposure to liability for psychiatric in-patient benefit under their respective policies.  Psychiatric benefit is not a common feature of UK health insurance and most insurers there do not cover it at all as part of their budget policies, which is the type of cover nearest to minimum benefit. Where insurers do provide cover of this kind they heavily qualify it by measures such as making payment of benefit subject to prior authorisation of hospital admissions; making payment on the basis of an agreed initial period of hospitalisation and making any extension of the period subject to further agreement; and excluding chronic or recurring disorders.</P>
    <P>I believe it to be self-evident that the period of 100 days provided for in respect of the guaranteed minimum level of indemnity under the regulations is not only reasonable but substantial in <Col N="188" /> the context of our market being opened up to competition.  In addition to this, I have a commitment that at an early date the regulations will provide for a minimum entitlement to 20 day-patient days services in respect of psychiatric treatment and care.  That is, 100 days plus 20 day-patient days.  As soon as the terms of that are sorted out, I will return with an amendment to the regulations before both Houses in order to provide for that.</P>
    <P>These arrangements represent a considerable enhancement of the 40 days in-patient cover which was the original proposal on psychiatric cover.  I was pleased to be able to respond positively to the concerns expressed by interested parties in the course of the extensive consultations held on the original proposals. I was very thankful for the debate which occurred here during the summer which drew to my attention the level of opposition to the 40 days cover. Prior to signing the regulations, I met with the authorities of the two major private psychiatric hospitals and was pleased to obtain their acceptance of the proposals.  The two hospitals concerned are St. John of God's and St. Patrick's, which lobbied Members extensively on the 40 days issue.</P>
    <P>I may add that the 100 days covers the vast majority of admissions to psychiatric hospitals.  For example, the health research board's 1994 report on the activities of Irish psychiatric hospitals and units provides statistical information on discharges and lengths of stay in private psychiatric hospitals.  Of a total of 4,209 discharges in that year, 3,781, or 92 per cent, recurred within three months.  A guaranteed minimum level of cover in respect of 100 days in-patient services in a year, therefore, represents a very significant protection for the consumer, particularly in the context of the operation of a free market and insurance practice in the area of exposure to liability for such cover.  In addition, there will be the minimum cover for day-patient services which I already mentioned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> Where circumstances arise that an insured person requires treatment in excess of 100 days, later to be increased to 120 days, in a year, and where the insurance contract does not cater for this, it is open to him or her to avail of in-patient care in public psychiatric hospitals and public community based facilities.  It is completely false to say, therefore, that persons who use up their insurance cover will have no access to psychiatric care.  They will have such access in the same manner as the majority of the population has now.</P>
    <P>The House may be interested to know that my Department is not aware of any other case, internationally, where providers of private health insurance contract to make available cover for a period of 100 days psychiatric in-patient service without pre certification and in an environment where the entire population is eligible for treatment under the public psychiatric service.  I consider that regulations providing entitlement to a specified minimum level of indemnity cover in policies to be written by commercial insurance companies constitute a protection for the public.  I further consider that, in relation to the approach taken by insurers to limiting exposure to the provision of psychiatric benefit, the minimum level set under regulation is substantial.  Given the totally new context within which our private health insurance market is obliged to operate under our responsibilities as a member of the European Union, I do not subscribe to the view that this constitutes discrimination.</P>
    <P>The concerns raised about the original proposals regarding the minimum period for treatment relating to alcohol, drug and other substance abuse have been met in the regulations.  The original proposal has been enhanced from 40 days in a lifetime to 91 days in any continuous period of five years.</P>
    <P>It is also contended in the matter under debate that the regulations fail to reflect the actual cost of outpatient services to subscribers.  This suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of what the regulations are all about.  The regulations <Col N="190" /> concerned are those relating to minimum benefits.  They are concerned with core hospital and consultant services which all insurers must cater for, up to at least the level of indemnity specified, in any policies they wish to sell in our market.</P>
    <P>Essentially, these regulations are a mainstay to community rating.  They ensure that by requiring insurers to cover a range of benefits they are prohibited from specifically devising policies designed to &ldquo;cherry pick&rdquo; young healthy lives.  Such policies could be made particularly financially attractive to the young and healthy by, for example, excluding the higher cost treatments relating to conditions associated with ageing to which the young do not consider themselves to be at risk.</P>
    <P>The regulations relate outpatient services to hospital and consultant activities which are appropriate to the package of measures involved and reflect existing market practice.  The regulations are not intended to prescribe every health service offered to the public by an insurance company.  Any attempt to do this under regulation would constitute a completely disproportionate restriction on the freedom of insurers entering the market in terms of their scope for policy design.  The recently announced decision of the major British insurer, BUPA, to enter our market on an establishment basis has served to highlight that, in the first instance, competition between insurers will be more on products than on premium prices.  Prescribing a broad range of outpatient or community care services in excess of what is already generally available in the market would not be sustainable in terms of being objectively necessary to community rating.</P>
    <P>The regulations provide for excesses and maximum payments to operate in respect of a specified range of out-patient services.  It is a matter for individual insurers to determine under their policy conditions whether these will relate to actual expenditure or to eligible expenditure, as is the current practice of the VHI.  This is, no doubt, one <Col N="191" /> of the factors the discerning purchaser of cover will take into account in deciding which company's policies best appeal to him or her.  The protection given under the regulations regarding this matter is that, in respect of the services specified, the insurer cannot have an excess above £150 for an individual or £300 for a contract covering more than one person and cannot specify that total payments will be less than £650 or £1,300 respectively.  To suggest that we should go beyond what is proposed to any significant extent is to seek to limit by use of legal compulsion the flexibility of insurers to negotiate arrangements with providers.  I believe this principle is unacceptable and would not be tolerated by any other health service interests who would, rightfully, wish to be in a position to negotiate the arrangements and relationships they choose to have with others.</P>
    <P>While I recognise the good faith and entitlement of interests to oppose regulations they regard as unacceptable, I am concerned that less than an accurate picture has been given about the measures taken in the regulations.  In the interests of putting the record straight, I want to address the matters raised by the press release which Fianna Fáil issued on 12 April.  The regulations do not put &ldquo;a 100 day limit&rdquo; on benefit for psychiatric in-patient services.  On the contrary, they provide, for the first time, a statutory guarantee to a minimum of 100 days.  Consequently, the claim that they constitute a 45 per cent reduction in cover is not correct.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the regulations increasing demand on the already overstretched public psychiatric service.  This does not present an accurate picture of the situation or developments in relation to the provision of such services.  <i>Planning for the Future</i>, the report on the development of the psychiatric services published in 1984, has been accepted as mental health policy by successive Governments.  Its implementation has led to a shift in the delivery of mental health care from a <Col N="192" /> predominantly institutional setting to a community based one.  It proposed a norm of 0.5 per 1,000 population in-patient places for short term and medium term psychiatric patients.  While bed numbers have been reduced over the period, there has been a corresponding increase in the number of community residential places available.  The level of bed provision still exceeds that set by <i>Planning for the Future</i> and remains very high by international standards. The organisational use of available resources is the issue to be addressed rather than the number of beds.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the regulations will seriously affect those suffering from substance abuse and alcohol dependence. Nothing, in fact, could be further from the truth, as the regulations give a statutory entitlement to 91 days in-patient treatment for such conditions in any continuous period of five years.  This is exactly the same cover currently generally available in our health insurance market and provided by the VHI.</P>
    <P>The sweeping claim made that the regulations, which provide for 100 days indemnity as a minimum, could result in people with serious disorders getting short term crisis treatment does not stand up to scrutiny against the recorded fact that discharges in respect of 92 per cent of in-patient stays occurred within 90 days.  This also fails to recognise that everyone is eligible for treatment under the public system.  I regret such inaccurate and unfounded claims have been made, as these must cause unnecessary concern and anxiety to members of the public.</P>
    <P>In summary, I suggest to the House that it reject the motion on the grounds that the health insurance regulations meet our obligation to provide for competition; safeguard our core values of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover; and constitute a significant protection to the public in an open, competitive market.  I recommend the regulations to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his clear lucid exposition of the situation and for making available some of his <Col N="193" /> advisers for a briefing with some Members of the House today.  I was there for part of the briefing &mdash; I did not stay for the entire briefing because I was at another briefing on the Refugee Bill but it certainly altered my mind.  It is easy for the public to get the impression that the psychiatrically ill are being done down in some way.  This perception would be unfortunate and nobody would wish to support such proposals.</P>
      <P>However, having reflected on the matter and having read the motion, it seems to me that if it were to be passed it might have serious legal implications. It appears that the regulations under section 2 would fall completely, leaving us with a lacuna.  Nobody wants this; the people would not be protected to the extent they will be protected under these regulations.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the two principal psychiatric organisations &mdash; St. John of God's Hospital and St. Patrick's Hospital.  I received a letter from Professor Anthony Clare on this matter.  I would like to read part of it into the record of the House because he would be an interested party.  The Minister has indicated that we discussed aspects of this matter before when Professor Clare and others lobbied extensively.  As a result of this lobbying the Minister has met, at least partially, the concerns expressed.  Professor Clare says:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health, Mr. Noonan, together with officials from his department, met with representatives from both hospitals, as he promised to do, when the final details of the regulations as agreed with the Trade Directorate in Brussels were drawn up.  These regulations stipulate a statutory minimum level of cover for psychiatric disorders of 100 in-patient days per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made clear that the motion fails to appreciate the difference between a minimum cover and capping cover.  There is no suggestion that that the VHI would be precluded from continuing to offer its 180 day cover.  In a <Col N="194" /> competitive market it is likely it would do so because it would indicate a considerable advantage over the kind of scheme offered by BUPA.  In the open market it is likely that the VHI will not regard this as a maximum ceiling &mdash; which it clearly is not &mdash; but, appropriately, as minimum, and will continue to offer the better service.</P>
    <P>Professor Clare continues:</P>
    <P>In addition, the cover currently provided by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board for patients suffering from alcohol and/or drug abuse of 90 days per five years is to remain as a statutory minimum cover for these conditions.  An innovation in the regulations is the stated minimum provision of 20 days per year for psychiatric day care, which is to be provided by the health insurers for insured people suffering from psychiatric disorders.</P>
    <P>Of course, the representative of both St. Patrick's and St. John of God's Hospitals regret that the minimum cover guaranteed under the regulations is not the 180 days as provided for by the VHI and we have expressed our views to the Minister.</P>
    <P>That is understandable.  After all, St. Patrick's Hospital was founded by the great dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Jonathan Swift and one of his most significant contributions was to dissolve the artificial boundaries that existed in the 18th century between medical physical illness and psychiatric illness and to allow a situation to develop where psychiatric illness was regarded as an illness and not as possession by demons or bad behaviour where people could be tortured and exposed to public ridicule in, for example, the Bedlam Hospital. Of course, they would go for parity of the physical and the psychiatric.</P>
    <P>Professor Clare continues:</P>
    <P>However, we do recognise the difficulty encountered by the Minister and his officials in his discussions with a Trade Directorate, primarily interested in insurance rather than health and <Col N="195" /> familiar with a health insurance scene across Europe, and particularly in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to this in passing but did not put all the figures on the record.  I have before me a table of cover under budget policies for the nine principal insuring agencies in Britain. Various issues are covered, including the provision of psychiatric care.  Of the nine surveyed, six make no provision whatever, one makes restricted provision and only two provide cover.  This is important because this situation does not merely cover the medical area.  It also covers the question of the competition regulations of the EU.</P>
    <P>If we were promoting only those systems that were identical to our own, the Europeans would object to what we were doing on the grounds that we were not creating a proper market.  Indeed, I understand from press reports that, in a characteristically mean minded approach, the Association of British Insurers have already attempted to sneak to Brussels.  According to one newspaper, the ABI believes that the regulations which will be imposed on any new rentals are too restrictive and anti-competitive.  The requirement to offer open enrolment lifetime cover and the use of a system of community rating allowing people of all ages to pay the same premia for the same level of cover attracted the most damning criticism.  If it attracts the most damning criticism from the Association of British Insurers it should attract the most resounding praise from the Irish consumer.</P>
    <P>The Minister correctly selected those three elements as the core values that we are seeking in this country.  We do not want cherry-picking by big British unions.  I commend him for ensuring that this will not occur.</P>
    <P>Returning to Professor Clare's letter, he states in what I consider to be the most important and significant paragraph:</P>
    <P>The requirement that all Health Insurers working in Ireland must provide, <Col N="196" /> in compliance with the Health Insurance Regulations, 100 days in-patient cover as a statutory minimum, is a major advance on the original proposals of 40 days, particularly in the light of the fact that some insurers in Europe fail to provide any psychiatric cover whatsoever.</P>
    <P>We very much welcome the introduction of a statutory minimum cover for consultant-led psychiatric day care &mdash; 20 days per year &mdash; which should help us develop a day-care approach within insurance-based psychiatry to match the excellent quality in-patient care currently reimbursed and provided. Indeed, we very much hope that we will, in the future, be able to extend the level of day-care in agreement with the Department and insurers.</P>
    <P>If we have the support of the two principal institutions providing this kind of care in Ireland, how can Fianna Fáil assume it has greater expertise than those who operate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">

      <P>That is remarkably close to delusions of grandeur.  I should be careful of it because the Senator may find herself requiring 100 days' treatment or confinement which the VHI would, no doubt, be glad to provide.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also indicated that the ESB medical provident fund, the Prison Officers medical aid society and St. Paul's Medical Aid Society, who are in the open market with approximately 80,000 members, provide less than the minimum cover, which, I repeat, is not a ceiling or a cap but is a minimum, and represents an advance.  I have been converted, I have seen the light and I am grateful to the Minister for his assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>If passed, this motion will have grave implications for the health <Col N="197" /> insurance business in Ireland.  There will be an inevitable challenge to the regulations in Brussels which will result in opening up the area in a non-regulated fashion.  Our system of community based health insurance will be prohibitive and a non-regulated insurance service will ensue.  Companies will enter the market and cherry-pick aiming packages at the lower risk categories. Higher risk categories will be heavily loaded and it will no longer be possible for the aged to be insured, despite years of payment of insurance.  Health insurance will cease to be for life and restrictions will be introduced by some companies to lower their premia.  For example, they will not cover hip replacements, heart by-passes and other expensive medical interventions.  If this motion is passed, who will suffer most? The elderly and the vulnerable.  Families will no longer have cover for certain illnesses, especially those born with genetic problems.</P>
      <P>The issue arises as a result of the EU directive on competition in the non-life insurance area which insists on open competition throughout the EU.  That was important in framing the Health Insurance Act, 1994, which provided that as far as possible our community rating insurance system which prohibits discrimination on grounds of age, sex or state of health, was maintained.  It facilitates open enrolment and lifetime cover for all under 65 years of age.  It provides that cover must have certain elements, such as in-patient, day patient, convalescent, maternity and substance abuse cover.  The initial proposal, that the regulations should cover a minimum of 40 days, was, after intense negotiations by the Minister in Brussels, increased to 100 days with an acceptance of a further 20 days for day care.  This will be introduced by regulation in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In increasing the minimum level of cover from 40 days to 120 days, the Minister has extended the limit to its ultimate.  If the regulations go beyond that limit they will seriously jeopardise the principle of regulation and open the situation to a free for all, which is the <Col N="198" /> case in other countries.  Britain and other European countries provide restricted or no cover for psychiatric illnesses. BUPA, for example, provides psychiatric cover on a restricted basis which requires express prior authorisation by the company in respect of in-patient admissions.  The cover will not in any case exceed 90 days in-patient care per year and will not extend to chronic or recurring disorders.</P>
    <P>Under present regulations, that would not be accepted in this country.  BUPA will have to cover 100 days in addition to 20 days outpatient care.  The private patient's plan, which provides psychiatric cover by means of its discreet psychiatric benefits protection scheme, can be purchased as part of most of its insurance plan.  Payment of benefit is subject to express prior authorisation and payment is made on the basis of an agreed initial period of hospitalisation in each case.  Extension of this period is subject to medical certification and agreement by the insurer.  The scheme does not specify in-patient entitlements in a subscription year and appears to operate on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>Norwich Union in the UK does not provide any cover for psychiatric illness. The Western Provident Association appears to have a limit of 28 days in-patient care.  None of these companies provides benefit in respect of treatment arising from the abuse of alcohol, drugs or other substances.  If we give these companies a stronger card in Europe and they seek to apply their systems in free market competition, what will be the response of the European Union?  If we pass this motion we will give those companies a stronger card than they already have.  Senator Norris's quote from the UK's insurance journal highlights the fact that the Association of British Insurers intends to challenge our present regulations in Brussels.  Will we strengthen their hand by extending what they view as unacceptable regulations, which the Minister had to fight hard to achieve?</P>
    <P>The association will be delighted if this motion is passed as it will have an <Col N="199" /> extra card in its efforts to deregulate the situation in Ireland.  It is interesting to note that just 12 per cent of people in the UK are covered by health insurance in comparison to 35 per cent in this country.  In the UK 70 per cent of those insured are insured through employment schemes.  As a result most people drop out on retirement at 65 years of age.  In Ireland, however, people have cover once they have enrolled before the age of 65 years and the cover applies up to the time of death.  That is not the case under the deregulated system in the UK.</P>
    <P>Brussels has accepted the insurance system in Ireland and the regulations introduced by the Minister.  They are likely to stand if challenged.  However, if we pass this motion we will make the situation risky.  It is interesting to note that the three organisations mentioned by Senator Norris which operate in addition to the VHI in this country do not give similar cover to the VHI for psychiatric or substance abuse care.  The ESB staff's medical provident fund covers to a maximum of 45 days within a fund year.  It covers 90 per cent of hospital charges for further hospitalisation within the fund year and within the fund's limit.  The prison officers' medical aid society offers cover for 90 day in-patient treatment plus 90 out-patient consultations in any three year period.  Evidence of attendance at after-care programmes must be provided and each case is subject to committee examination. St. Paul's Garda medical society covers 42 days of in-patient psychiatric treatment in any year at a maximum of £84 per day.  It covers 42 days treatment for substance abuse in a five year period.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil should look at the implications of this motion for the excellent medical insurance cover that has been built up by the VHI and which has been maintained by the Minister in the context of the open market.  We are now part of Europe and the Irish people accepted the Maastricht Treaty so we must respond to the open market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting debate.  For many years we have tried to prove and we have now succeeded in proving that psychiatric illness is an ordinary illness that is curable.  We closed down the old mental hospitals and there are new units in the modern general hospitals for psychiatric patients.  However, every other patient who enters the general hospital is given 180 days cover.  How are these two facts to be reconciled?  It is either an incurable disease which cannot be insured or it is an illness like any other. I believe it is an illness and should be treated on a par with other illnesses. There should be no such thing as special concessions.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker tried to instil fear in the Members.  The days of instilling fear are long gone.  Psychiatric illness should be treated equally.  We have heard about other insurance companies but they have private arrangements with the staff concerned.  That has nothing to do with statutory regulations.  Private staff arrangements exist in many bodies but that issue does not arise in this context. The Senator should spare his breath to cool his porridge.  The arrangements of private insurance companies have nothing to do with statutory regulations.</P>

      <P>People seeking treatment for alcohol or drug use will only have 90 days cover in a five year period.  A detoxification programme for a drug addict will last two or three weeks.  In addition they would need 90 days in Aiséirí or a similar facility.  An entitlement to 90 days treatment in five years is not a serious approach to helping a weak section of our community.  There should be more cover for such problems. I hope I am interpreting this provision incorrectly; perhaps the Minister would clarify the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of the insurance companies seems able to satisfy the consultants who require an extra payment on top of the insurance.  Normally when one pays <Col N="202" /> insurance one gets full cover; for example, if one pays an excess charge for motor cover the insurance is cheaper.  However, with the VHI one could have to pay in addition to the cover.  In the past patients were sent to the North for hip operations.  A system will have to be devised for health insurance which gives the rates for common operations.  It is wrong that someone who has been paying VHI cover all their life has to pay extra when they have an operation.</P>
    <P>This motion should be supported.  We should view mental illness as we view other illnesses.  Imposing this limit on psychiatric treatment is an indication that psychiatric patients do not deserve the same respect or treatment as other patients.  They do and we should treat them accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spent the majority of my working life in the field of psychiatric care.  In July last year I spoke in the House on the motion which called on the Minister for Health to defer the signing of the draft regulation pursuant to the Health (Insurance) Act, 1994.  I said at the time that the regulation as drafted would have serious implications for the welfare of psychiatric patients and for the future of public and private psychiatric services.</P>
      <P>The main point of contention in the draft regulations was the reduction of the entitlement of 180 days in-patient treatment to 40 days.  This was a definite case of discrimination as it was only psychiatry and the psychiatrically ill who were being singled out in terms of time allowed for in-patient treatment.  No other medical speciality was being subjected to these constraints.  In many representations I received from people working in the psychiatric service, private and public, great concern was expressed about the time regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The psychiatric speciality has always been discriminated against in the health services.  It has never received the recognition or funding to which it was entitled.  From the years I spent working in this field I know this discrimination <Col N="203" /> was always a source of extreme frustration, to say the least.  As a member of the Labour Party I do not believe that any person should be discriminated against in any way.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the draft regulations was to enable other insurance companies to enter the Irish market and, while competition is ordinarily healthy, it was the cause of discrimination against those it intended to serve in this case.  The Minister took on board the criticisms of the draft regulations aired in this House. He was able to enter into discussions and correspondence with the EU Commission about our private insurance regulatory framework and put in place the regulations under section 3 of the Health (Insurance) Act, 1994, which are the subject of this motion.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House is unfortunate.  Having listened to the criticisms last year, the Minister undertook to revise the draft regulations.  Speakers on the other side of the House mentioned that, under the proposed new regulations, VHI cover will reduce from the present 180 days to a minimum of 40 days psychiatric in-patient a year.  This is not the case.  I advise people to join the VHI and they will still be entitled to 180 days' cover.</P>
    <P>It was also remarked that we had received letters from many people, including the directors of psychiatric hospitals.  They were described as competent and caring doctors who are concerned their hospitals will have to increase costs to the patients.  The letter I got from Dr. Anthony Clare read:</P>
    <P>I am writing to thank you most sincerely for the support that you have given to myself and my colleagues working in St. Patrick's and St. John of God's in our fight to ensure a fair deal for psychiatry in the regulations governing health insurances in Ireland.  Without your active participation and energetic support, we would never have achieved the significant improvement in basic minimum cover for psychiatric illnesses <Col N="204" /> which is now stated in the regulations covering health insurance in Ireland. My colleagues at both hospitals and myself are extremely grateful to you.</P>
    <P>He went on to compliment the Minister in regard to the matter.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the Minister and his officials were severely restricted in their room for manoeuvre as they were dealing with the EU Commission which was primarily concerned with insurance rather than health.  The discussion took place in a European context where some insurers failed to provide any psychiatric cover whatever. Given the pressure the Minister was under, the requirement that all health insurers working in Ireland must provide, in compliance with the health insurance regulations, 100 days in-patient cover as a statutory minimum is a major advance on the original proposal of 40 days.  This reverses the in-built discrimination of last year's draft regulations and this was what we asked the Minister to do at the time.</P>
    <P>In addition, he stated that he is committed to the introduction at an early date of cover under the minimum benefit regulations for day care services in relation to psychiatric illnesses.  The Minister has also increased the minimum level of indemnity for charges in the psychiatric hospitals from £35 per day to the lesser of £65 or 60 per cent, and the insurance cover for substance abuse from 40 days over a lifetime to 91 days in any continuous period of five years, a welcome move.  These regulations constitute a balanced and effective basis for regulating a competitive market in private health insurance in accordance with the protection of the common good and with the thrust of the third non-life insurance directive in relation to competition.</P>
    <P>The quality of service for the patient must always be our paramount concern. In reviewing the original regulation I believe the Minister is of the same view and I commend him and his officials for adopting that view.  He should not take <Col N="205" /> my word for it.  Dr. Anthony Clare has recognised his achievements and has said the measures contained in the present regulations put into force by the Minister provide a significant protection for the general public in the context of a competitive private health insurance market.  He has accepted the Minister's package on that basis.</P>
    <P>In the light of what was contained in the original draft regulations, which came before us last year, the Minister has delivered on what he promised, that is, eradicating the discrimination incorporated in those draft regulations.  It is unfortunate that Members saw fit to undermine his achievements by tabling such a motion.  He has ensured that those who are in need are in a position to receive the best possible care and that they are not discriminated against as a result of a concentration on issues outside health care.  For these reasons, he deserves our commendations.  I do not support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members, I would have preferred no reduction in the health care for psychiatrically ill patients provided by the VHI or any other insurance company It is important to remember we had a reduction some years ago.  I remember when a psychiatric patient was given one year's cover and that was reduced to 180 days.  Naturally, the reduction in the number of days covered is a cause of concern for patients and doctors.  As the Minister said, it is important to remember this is the minimum number of days to be covered.  If a health insurer wants to continue with a higher level of cover, they are entitled to do so.  The Minister said 92 per cent of patients are discharged from hospital within this length of time, but patients may worry that they may be in the 8 per cent of cases or that they may be readmitted within a year.  It is worrying for doctors because they will be under pressure as regards early discharge; this is never useful.  This practice already exists in the physical health care area and it is depressing to <Col N="206" /> see it happening in the mental health care area.</P>
      <P>It is particularly unfortunate that a few months ago in the North-Western Health Board area a successful prosecution was brought by a family who felt their father had been discharged prematurely from a psychiatric hospital &mdash; he was a public patient.  He suffered from depression and committed suicide a number of days after being discharged. The doctor's clinical judgment was called into account.  To my dismay costs were awarded against the family.  I am sure the psychiatrist and those involved made the best judgment they could as regards clinical care.  Who is to say the length of time a person's stay in hospital will effect such a grim outcome as a person committing suicide?  Coming hard on the heels of such a judgment, I am anxious that there will not be such pressure put on those providing private health care to discharge people from hospital.  I hope the report by the inspector of mental hospitals, which will shortly be in the public arena, will give comprehensive guidelines as regards good clinical practice in such cases. Doctors are in an invidious position where they feel their clinical judgment could end in a court case.</P>
      <P>As Senator Farrell and others said, it is disquieting to see the distinction being made between physical and mental illnesses. We have being trying to bring mental illness into the main arena of illnesses to show that it is the same as any other.  Indeed, depression is the most common illness in the world and it is the most important one to address when dealing with health matters.</P>
      <P>Since health care insurers in many other jurisdictions do not cover mental health care, it is understandable that it is referred to in these regulations but it might have been better if only health care had been mentioned.  If other insurers could have specifically excluded mental health care, we might be in a worse situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When these insurance bodies begin to operate here, it is important that the Minister makes it clear to the public <Col N="207" /> that mental health care may not be covered by some of them.  We have already seen the regulations from BUPA.  People may believe that it is more closely aligned to the VHI than is the case.  Fianna Fáil has rightly criticised the level of outpatient care the VHI offers.  Until ten years ago it concentrated on acute hospital care.  It is important to note that BUPA, according to the information it has sent to date, will only focus on outpatient care.</P>
    <P>A good thing from the view point of psychiatric patients is that there has been a trend towards treating them on an outpatient basis.  For that reason, I welcome the provision of 20 days consultant cover which has been brought in with the new regulations.  That did not exist before and there was a temptation to admit patients to hospital when it might not have been essential.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of this debate is how we will deal with the possibility of managed health care policies which may take over private health care.  Are we looking far enough into the future in this regard?  We are debating this issue because of competitiveness in the marketplace.  Money and competition must be taken into account.  This debate is about insurance rather than health.</P>
    <P>What can we expect from managed health care which is in vogue in America and in some European countries?  A battle which must be fought relates to pre-certification where a doctor must get permission from the insurance company before they can admit a patient to hospital.  This happens with BUPA, a number of health insurance companies on the continent and with almost all insurance companies in the United States.  That would be a major change if introduced here.  Money and health care will be very important because the insurers will insist it is spent wisely. There will be a great cascade downwards of care from acute hospital care to sub-acute care to home care.  The outpatients situation will need to be looked it very carefully.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> Firms who pay part of their employees VHI cover &mdash; or all of it if one is in Bord na Móna &mdash; will want the best value for their money.  They will be able to look to different health care policies to see what they should get. Protocols may be given to doctors with regard to their role in health care.  There will be little choice of doctor, and patients will be more restricted with regard to who can manage their cases.</P>
    <P>I am glad Fianna Fáil raised this issue because it is at the centre of the debate we should have about whether managed health care will be introduced here and how we will deal with it.  Will the Insurance Ombudsman be involved in overseeing health policies?  Far too often we may find the public is not given sufficient information and in the small print there may be hidden difficulties for patients, which I hope the Insurance Ombudsman will deal with in the excellent way she has dealt with policies in other insurance fields.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  Until recently I thought it had been completely and satisfactorily resolved and properly dealt with by the Minister and the Department.  Some months ago there was a great deal of lobbying by families of psychiatric patients, various institutions and members of the medical profession in respect of the proposed reduction from 180 to 100 days.  Following representations I received, I made various contacts with the Minister.  Like Senator Maloney, I received a letter of appreciation and thanks from Dr. Anthony Clare.  I assumed that if he was satisfied, so was everybody else.</P>
      <P>It is important that the situation as it is be clearly put on record so that people who suffer from depression and psychiatric illness, about whom we are all concerned, are not in any way misled, stressed any further than they are already or frightened about their situation and future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should compliment the Minister and the Department for the fine work they have done, particularly in negotiations <Col N="209" /> with the European Commission, and for taking into account its attitudes to insurance, competition and free trade.  They did a remarkable job in ensuring that the 180 day period will remain in respect of the VHI.  Prior to this, there was no statutory protection or limit in respect of health insurance. Under these regulations there is for the first time a statutory limit.  What happened up to now was a result of customary practice rather than statutory obligation. This is a major breakthrough because the consumer &mdash; in effect the patient &mdash; is protected to a far greater extent than he or she was heretofore.</P>
    <P>Because of the opening up of the market, new insurance companies will enter it and possibly try to cream off its better end.  Under statute they will be obliged to provide a minimum of 100 days care, whereas the VHI will provide 180 days care.  I foresee companies being forced to increase the number of days care they provide in order to be able to compete with the VHI and this will be extremely good.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell expressed concern about addicts.  It is important we realise that the original proposal was for 40 days care in a lifetime but this has been increased to 91 days in a continuous period of five years.  The VHI gives this cover and will continue to do so in future.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry spoke about pre-certification. I agree with her and I hope the pre-certification clause which exists in other countries will not be introduced here.  The Minister and the Department should be complimented for bringing in these regulations without such a clause.</P>
    <P>Everybody who spoke on this issue is extremely concerned about patients, particularly those suffering from psychiatric illness.  We would all agree that people suffering from such illness are vulnerable and are in a fearful and stressful state.  They are the last patients we would wish to see under further stress.  It is important that the facts are repeated and that any unnecessary stress people have suffered in the last few weeks is reduced.  The Minister and <Col N="210" /> the Department should conduct a publicity campaign to further educate people about what is and is not available.</P>
    <P>At all times a public psychiatric service is available to everybody psychiatric hospitals throughout the State. This compares favourably with what is available in other European countries and in the United States.  This is a good reflection on us as a community, a Government and a State.  We all aspire to ensure that this continues in the future.  If we cannot provide in a civilised, considerate and caring fashion for those who are most vulnerable and stressed, this is a poor reflection on us as a people.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence that the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department will continue to endeavour to protect to the best of their ability those who are psychiatrically ill.  They must be complimented for what they have done in recent negotiations with the EU Commission.  It was a major success on their part to have secured 180 days for the VHI and a minimum of 100 days cover for new insurance companies entering the country.  I hope the message will go out loudly and clearly to all concerned that this is the situation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Opposition to be aware of and alert to the fact that we need to be considerate of the frustrations and worries of people who are psychiatrically ill. People in this Chamber or anywhere else should not do anything which would increase their anxieties and concerns. In light of this debate and the Minister's speech, the motion should be reconsidered by the Opposition.  I hope they will withdraw it before the conclusion of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on fighting a good battle to increase the period of care from 40 to 100 days.  Unfortunately, however, we part company here.  Senator Neville said these regulations will have grave consequences for insurers.  However, I do not share this view, but I have grave doubts about the effect of these regulations <Col N="211" /> on the psychiatrically ill.  Much comment has been made about the fact that the directors of the two leading psychiatric hospitals have accepted and welcomed them.  If the hospitals are happy, I have to refer Members on the Government side to the letter from the users, patients and groups who support those who are psychiatrically ill, and specifically from Aware, a group set up to help those suffering from depression. They are far from happy.  When the vote is called the Minister and the Government parties should consider those who have been or may be psychiatrically ill as a priority to insurers.</P>
      <P>The Garda, prison officers and ESB schemes were referred to and I have personal knowledge of one such scheme.  I wish to relate the effects on psychiatrically ill patients of inadequate insurance cover that some work schemes provide.  After 40 days cover in the Garda scheme, for example, those in St. Patrick's or St. John of God are asked to leave when they are most vulnerable. They are beginning to recover; but in the majority of cases, as the Minister indicated, they are not well, according to the statistical information.</P>
      <P>Constituents of mine have taken out credit union loans to remain in institutions like St. Patrick's and St. John of God.  Thus, not only are they paying large contributions for private medical insurance which is inadequate, but they are also taking out bank and credit loans to pay for extra cover to stay in hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those affected are, in the main, women who want to get well and return home to look after their children. However, they are terrified of being discharged after 40 days.  Reference has been made to the fact that there will be no change in the VHI and one will still receive 180-day cover, but that is wrong and misleading.  After these regulations come into force, the VHI may decide to offer 100 days cover and nobody will be able to challenge that.  What I have outlined as the experience of people in private schemes is awaiting those currently <Col N="212" /> with VHI cover.  VHI subscribers should not be led to believe that the 180 day cover will remain permanently, because it may not.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris questioned Fianna Fáil's wisdom <i>vis-à-vis</i> the two major psychiatric hospitals.  We do not claim to have greater wisdom than anybody else, but the motion claims that these regulations are discriminatory.  The basis of the motion is not that 180 days is better than 100, but that some people might require more than 180 days cover.</P>
    <P>Prior to these regulations being signed by the Minister no distinction was made between someone who had open heart surgery, a broken leg, or who happened to be suffering from depression.  A person's illness was treated until they got better.  Now, for the first time the Government has singled out one group which I regard &mdash; although I may be wrong and the Government may not like me suggesting it &mdash; as being the most vulnerable in society.  We are now about to write into legislation the fact that this group is not equal under the law and that they will not be treated in the same way as those who undergo open heart surgery or have broken their legs.  In my opinion, such people will have a right to challenge these regulations legally because they are discriminatory and probably unconstitutional as well.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at Senator Norris, who is recognised as being the champion of a specific group who have been, and probably still are, discriminated against. I have great admiration for the courageous stand he has taken and for his continuing representation of that group. A Fianna Fáil-Labour Government introduced legislation for the group he represented.  However, I cannot fathom why, as far as Senator Norris is concerned, those who are psychiatrically ill are not entitled to the same support he gave to another group and that they should be discriminated against.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage Senator Norris should reconsider how he intends to vote on this motion.  I appeal to him to support the Fianna Fáil motion, the <Col N="213" /> essence of which is that we will not support anything which discriminates and which decides that one group in society cannot have fair and equal treatment with another one.  Senator Norris should back the motion which seeks to support a group which will otherwise be classed as second class citizens under the law.</P>
    <P>Members on the Government side of the House may have quoted out of context the directors of two major psychiatric hospitals.  I wish to read into the record what Aware said about these regulations:</P>
    <P>The regulations stipulate that health insurance companies entering the Irish market would be obliged to provide 100 days cover for psychiatric in-patient care rather than 180 that is currently provided by the VHI... This is contrary to all the policies of the Department of Health for the integration of the psychiatric and general medical services...  The wrong message from the Minister who has pledged his support to reduce the rate of suicide when it is known that premature discharge from psychiatric in-patient care is a major determinant in suicide.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the person who signed this letter is a doctor in St. Patrick's.  I cannot understand why it is being suggested that those providing the services are happy.  The letter continues:</P>
    <P>Asking patients who are at a very vulnerable stage in their treatment to leave hospital, leave the medical and nursing service, with which they are familiar cannot be considered to be in anybody's interest.</P>
    <P>Members should support the Fianna Fáil motion on the basis that these regulations cannot be in anybody's interest.</P>

      <P>It was reduced in that period.  I welcome the improvement which the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has made to the draft regulations but I am not convinced they go far enough.  I hope there will be an opportunity to revisit them in future.  It is important to keep that in mind.  As matters stand, psychiatric patients will still be discriminated against and they will be entitled to just 100 days in-patient cover, while patients with medical disorders will continue to have 180 days in-patient cover.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers mentioned the integration of psychiatric and general medical services.  I appreciate that a level playing field had to be created to enable companies to compete in the health insurance market.  I also appreciate that our EU membership forces us to open up the health insurance market. However, I am extremely concerned that the EU should be in a position to effectively impose a two-tier health system on the public in the name of so-called deregulation.</P>
      <P>Health care is being treated by the European Union like any other commodity or service which must be deregulated at all costs in the name of the market. We already have a two-tier health system in which one third of patients are privately insured and the rest must rely on an under-resourced and overstretched public health system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Democratic Left has long argued for a universal system of health care free at the point of entry.  I fear that these regulations may force private patients with serious psychiatric or substance abuse conditions to seek greater care within the public system, placing an even greater strain on our public facilities. That actually happened when the decision was taken previously.  Patients in long stay private care had to find care elsewhere because they could not afford to pay, at the same time draining resources from our private facilities, which currently account for some 15 per cent of overall psychiatric in-patient provisions.  In addition, these regulations reinforce the notion that people with psychiatric disorders are somehow <Col N="215" /> less ill than those with physical conditions and are less deserving of society's care and protection.  That notion is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>When the draft regulations were initially published, concerns were expressed by those involved in the care of the psychiatrically ill.  I am glad that the Minister has responded to those concerns by making substantial improvements to the regulations and reducing the gap between the amount of in-patient cover afforded to medical and psychiatric patients.  Given the constraints under which the Minister has had to operate with regard to EU competition demands, I accept that there was no further room for compromise.  I hope it will be possible to revisit the regulations in the future.</P>
    <P>In the interim, I urge the Minister to increase the provisions for public psychiatric facilities in order that private patients who have exhausted their cover can receive the care they need and deserve.  I welcome the provision made by the Minister and I oppose the motion.</P>

I speak on behalf of the patients I have cared for and treated since 1974, in one of the hospitals to which Members referred.  I believe I have a good knowledge of how psychiatric patients or patients with mental or emotional illness feel when they see these regulations being promulgated. Senators Finneran and Maloney should also have a requisite knowledge in this regard.  Many Members who have friends or relatives who suffer from psychiatric illness would be dismayed by the lack of cover provided.</P>
      <P>To give the Minister the credit due to him, it is true that he has protected some provisions such as open enrolment in lifetime cover and statutory minimum level of cover for 100 in-patient days. That is good, as is the innovation of a stated minimum provision of 20 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> However, many speakers on the Government side of the House made play of the fact that Professor Anthony Clare agrees with these regulations.  Professor Clare actually stated that:</P>
    <P>The representatives of both St. Patrick's and St. John of God Hospitals regret that the minimum cover guaranteed under the regulations is not 180 days as provided for by the VHI and we have expressed our views to the Minister.  We regret the introduction of a disparity between the cover provided for physical &mdash; 180 days &mdash; as against psychiatric disorders &mdash; 100 days.</P>
    <P>Why is this happening?  We are informed that it is because of the European Union or pressure from Brussels or large insurance companies.  If that is so, how is it possible to make an arrangement to provide 180 days cover for physical illness and only 100 days for mental illness or psychiatric disorders? Why is it not the same for all patients?</P>
    <P>If the Minister had two relatives, one suffering from a physical illness, the other from a mental disorder, the person with the mental disorder would be discharged without cover long before the person with the physical illness.  I do not blame the Minister for this problem, which essentially is due to a mindset, not to rules or regulations.  The basis of this mindset is that mental illness is in some way less terrible than physical illness. I have worked with people with psychiatric problems for over 20 years and I can state that mental illness is just as painful, as debilitating and, ultimately, as fatal as physical illness.  There are many people with physical illness who have a good mental outlook. However, there are many people with a mental illness who suffer as a result of physical illness.  The entire lives of such people are adversely affected because of their way of viewing the world.</P>
    <P>I have seen extremely rich people &mdash; multimillionaires and people who own huge cars, estates and houses &mdash; cringing and crying in the corners of psychiatric wards.  How can the Minister state <Col N="217" /> that those people do not feel hurt for 180 days?  If cover can be provided for people with physical illness, it must also be provided for those with mental illness. This is not a party political issue. It involves a mindset which states that people suffering from one illness are less important than those suffering from another illness.  I cannot accept this because it is not true.  The Minister has done well up to a point, but he has not gone far enough.  I am not making a political point against him.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that this problem has been forced upon us by Europe.  I am a European at heart and was a member, and vice-chairman, of the Council of the European Movement.  To me, membership of the European Union means that I have a say in events and should not be dictated to by mandarins in Brussels.  Words uttered by the Minister in Ireland are just as strong as those uttered by a Minister in Italy, France or Germany.  How is it that Ireland always fares well in negotiations on the CAP and Structural Funds?  It is because we enter such negotiations convinced that we can obtain the money we require. We negotiated fisheries quotas on the basis of the country's historical catch and made fools of ourselves and will never catch up.  The issue under discussion represents a similar situation.  If we relent now, we will never get back what we are giving away.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter, which involves people cringing in the corners of psychiatric wards who hear voices, are depressed or wish to kill themselves or someone else.  Is the Minister stating that such people do not suffer as much as those with physical illness? Most people suffering from a physical illness regain their health more rapidly.  If left alone, most physical illnesses, except the most severe, cure themselves.  This is not the situation in the case of psychiatric illnesses.  Psychiatric patients continue to suffer.  It is to cater for those people that extra cover should be provided.  However, even that provision of 180 days is too small.  Some adolescents require care on a long-term <Col N="218" /> basis and the 180 day provision represents the bare minimum.</P>
    <P>I give the Minister credit for his actions, but if he were Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry we would not be having this debate.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and other Ministers fight in Brussels for what they believe in.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, is as tough and intelligent an individual as one could meet.  Members have seen him operate and know what he is like.  If only he could believe that patients with psychiatric and mental illnesses suffer as much if not more than those with physical illness, the Minister would renegotiate the position.  I request that he do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate following the emotive plea from Senator Lydon, who has more experience of this matter than many Members.  When I became familiar with the concerns expressed by Aware &mdash; the association helping to defeat depression.  I reconsidered the statements made during a similar debate in the House on this subject on 19 July 1995.  We all accept Senator Lydon's point that we must not belittle the psychiatric care required by people suffering from depression.  It must be ensured that they receive as good a service as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on 19 July 1995, the reason for the introduction of this entire area of legislation was to introduce &ldquo;customer benefit, marketplace and competition&rdquo;.  I welcome this move because competition will improve the service given to those seeking to insure themselves against ill-health.  The regulations appear to establish, particularly in terms of the adjustments which have been made, a great deal more than was originally planned.  For example in the future, organisations offering health insurance on a private basis must provide a minimum of 100 days cover.  At present, the ESB staff medical provident fund offers a maximum of 45 days, while the Prison Officers Medical Aid Society offers 90 days in three years. <Col N="219" /> Clearly, these are not as good as the minimum of 100 days which will be required.  Another example is the St. Paul's Garda Medical Aid Society, which offers 42 days in five years.  A minimum of 100 days is much better than those figures.</P>
    <P>In Britain, the BUPA scheme offers much less.  It has over 45 per cent of the market, but in no case does it exceed 90 days in patient care in a year.  In Ireland, it must provide 100 days. PPP Healthcare in Britain, which has 27 per cent of the market, also offers far less than 100 days.  The Norwich Union, which has 9 per cent of the market, does not provide any cover at all.  If it comes to Ireland, it must provide 100 days.  The Western Provident Association offers 28 days in five years.  If it comes to Ireland, under the regulations it too will be obliged to provide 100 days cover.</P>
    <P>At present the VHI offers 180 days and the valid concern expressed by Aware, other organisations and the motion is that, because it will be obliged to offer 100 days, it may reduce the 180 days to 100 days.  In a competitive marketplace, where one is seeking to gain insurance cover and attract business, it is likely that the minimum requirement of 100 days will not become the maximum.  If a prices board states one must not sell a product for more than a certain price, companies often decide that is the price they must not exceed, but they will compete in the market-place by offering a better price.  In this area it is likely the VHI will see this gap in the market and ensure it attracts more business than competitors which will enter the marketplace.</P>
    <P>In this context, is the requirement fair and likely to succeed?  The adjustments made by the Minister in increasing the minimum from 40 to 100 days serves the purpose of creating a market which will demand attention from those considering taking out insurance.  It will ensure there is a valid marketplace in which organisations will be forced to offer a minimum of 100 days, which they do not have to provide in Britain or elsewhere. <Col N="220" /> It is likely that existing Irish companies, such as the VHI, will continue to offer more than 100 days, and perhaps the maximum of 180 days.  On this basis, I cannot support the motion and I must support the Government's effort to achieve its aims in the regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to discuss the insurance regulations covering psychiatric patients.  This is the third time I have contributed on this topic and I accept the Minister has substantially improved the level of cover for in patient hospital care for psychiatric patients by increasing it from 40 to 100 days since the issue was last addressed in the House in July.  I also welcome the increase in insurance cover for substance abuse from 40 days over a lifetime to 90 days in any continuous period of five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In negotiating the regulations with the European Commission, I welcome that the Minister sought to protect our core values of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover.  Everybody values these core aspects, which the VHI operates, and wants them maintained, given that the market will be open to competition.  In common <Col N="221" /> with Senator Quinn, I agree that competition will be good for the industry.  The British company, BUPA, has already moved into the Irish market.  My problem is that the regulations still discriminate against the psychiatrically ill.  It is the only sector which has been singled out in this way and these patients are being treated unfairly compared to any other sector of the population.  As other Members said, they are discriminated against by insurance companies throughout Europe, and Ireland should take the lead in ending this practice.  It has not existed in this country and we should not change to a system which discriminates against such patients.</P>
    <P>The regulations, such as 100 days for in patient care for psychiatric patients, were set out by the Minister for Health and the Department and it is not right to infer that this action has been forced on us by the European Commission. The Commission adjudicated on whether the Irish Government had the right to introduce regulations under Directive 92/49 EEC.  It did not comment on the details of the regulations. The last time this matter was discussed the House was given the impression that the Government and the Minister had no choice in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, that is not the case.  I am concerned that these changes will affect the future availability and quality of private psychiatric care in Ireland.  The Minister does not propose to set minimum cover periods in any other area of treatment.  By taking this action with regard to psychiatric illness, a certain group of patients will be discriminated against in a way which would be unthinkable if any other form of illness was involved.  For example, a proposal to limit the number of days patients having by-pass or hip replacement operations could spend in hospital would be unacceptable.  It is not acceptable in the area of psychiatric illness either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> In Ireland insurance cover and benefits for patients with psychiatric illnesses have been more or less in line with general medicine.  This had led to the development of different psychiatric services in Ireland than other countries and we should be proud of this fact.  For example, in the United States President Clinton's task force on health has attempted to examine treating psychiatric illnesses in the same way as other illnesses.  They seem to be moving towards the situation which pertains in Ireland, but we seem to be moving away from something we should value.</P>
    <P>It is also ironic that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform intends to introduce equal status legislation before the end of the year.  This will guarantee equal treatment in the provision of goods and services to everybody, irrespective of gender, disability, race, etc. It is odd that one arm of the Government is introducing legislation to give equality to everybody while the Minister for Health is introducing regulations which fly in the face of equality.</P>
    <P>As other Members said, this matter involves a vulnerable group which does not tend to speak up for itself.  Many of these patients and their families have been in contact with us and they are most concerned about this matter.  I understand the Minister's difficulty in trying to protect our core values of community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover etc. and also to regulate the activities of health insurance companies, but it is possible to do both of these without discriminating against a specific group of vulnerable people like psychiatric patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed the Minister did not stay in the House for the whole debate.  This is in itself a slight both on it and this serious issue.  In his contribution the Minister made a few statements which I wish to comment upon, if not challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of increasing the cover from 40 to 100 days, the 40 day figure was only a provisional one.  We never reached this situation.  It was never <Col N="223" /> realistic or on the cards for the Minister to claim that he negotiated this increase from 40 to 100 days; this is stretching credibility.</P>
    <P>The Seanad's debate on this matter in July demonstrated to the Minister the opposition to any change in cover for psychiatric patients.  It is disappointing that the Minister did not return to this House before he signed those regulations. This House told him at that time that it was unhappy with his approach to this matter.  While the Minister took that on board, he did not come back to this House.  He signed the regulations without returning and that is a pity.  If he had listened to the full debate and then considered these regulations, he might have come to a different conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also been somewhat economical with the truth with regard to the impact of the regulations.  He suggested that 92 per cent of psychiatric discharges from private hospitals occurred within three months.  He used this statistic to imply that the vast bulk of discharges were within the 100 day limit.  However, if one examines the statistics more carefully, one will find that these figures only apply to the first time in a year that a patient might have been in a psychiatric hospital.  It does not take into account any further periods spent in the hospital and the Minister did not address this at all.</P>
    <P>Those of us with any experience in the psychiatric service know that remission takes place.  Two, three or four admissions can take place inside a four week period, but it is a different case if it is taken cumulatively.  If this is taken to its conclusion, people will be excluded from psychiatric care for periods <Col N="224" /> of the year.  It is misleading for the Minister to use those statistics in that way; and, even at this late stage, I call on him to disclose how many patients will be affected by these changes.  It will be many more than he admits.</P>
    <P>On the provision for outpatients' benefits, the regulations as they stand put the subscriber to health insurance, and not the insurer, at risk.  That point has been made clear in this debate.  The provisions for outpatients are anti-consumer and should not be signed into law and I am amazed that any Minister would have done this.</P>
    <P>Many speakers outlined the great difficulty any person would have in discriminating between one type of illness and another. Why anybody should have different cover because they have a mental, as opposed to a physical, illness is unbelievable and I find it hard to comprehend.  I am amazed at the approach taken by the Independent Senators on this matter.  They have stood up and fought for minorities through the years and have been the spokespersons for the downtrodden. However, it seems the weak and those in our community who cannot speak for themselves have been forgotten and there is nobody to speak for them.  My party has put forward a credible performance on their behalf tonight.  I still expect Members of this House to respond to the downtrodden and that we do not discriminate against those who have the misfortune to suffer from mental illness.  They should be treated in the same way as anyone with other forms of physical disease.  I recommend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing this Adjournment Matter and welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Sometimes these matters are unsatisfactory because the Minister comes in with a prepared briefing. I ask this Minister to answer the questions I put to him, irrespective of whether they are dealt with in his notes.</P>
      <P>Hardship is being caused to farmers who, because of industrial action in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, cannot obtain movement permits to which they are entitled and consequently cannot sell their stock, which is one of the most acute but sadly not the only problem caused.  This industrial action has led to chaos in the services administered for farmers.  The permits are needed to certify the disease-free status of herds for TB and brucellosis.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say there is no need for a free movement test because of his senior Minister's new scheme, but that is a fiasco.  Farmers will not buy stock, especially dairy stock, unless they know it is disease-free.  At present they cannot trade and for months they have held back stock because of the appalling price on offer.  The history of and reason for this position have been minutely documented in this House &mdash; the slashing of export refunds last autumn and the BSE crisis which swiftly followed have been the subject of considerable debate, mainly initiated by Fianna Fáil. The net result for farmers was a catastrophic drop in cattle prices.</P>

      <P>If Senator Dardis would like some time also, he is quite welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that farmers who could not sell cattle because of the closure of foreign <Col N="227" /> markets now cannot sell them because their herds are locked in by the Department.  Some calves held by the Department broke down in disease and will not be released.  These have been held for up to two months.  Will the Minister instruct the district veterinary officers to release tomorrow the results of whatever tests are carried out?  It must be done immediately rather than next week.  I want the Minister to give a positive reply.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to pick a worse time for this fiasco.  On top of an incomes crisis farmers now have to endure a cash crisis.  The number of farmers in financial difficulties is growing daily.  I again plead with the Minister to take the crisis cases out of the administrative quagmire.  Farmers have been put in this intolerable position through no fault of their own and the least the Minister can do is to ensure a special channel for the most desperate cases.</P>
    <P>This is a far cry from the promises in the farmers charter, which was launched with such euphoria one would think they would never have a bad day. Where does the charter stand now &mdash; has it gone out the window?  Farmers who cannot sell their cattle think so. That PR exercise is no good to them now, when they are short of money.  It is ironic that the seed of industrial unrest in the Department lay in the charter.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry announced a host of extra services for farmers but the service they want is to sell their cattle &mdash; the other services are worth nothing to them.  They want to carry on their business economically.</P>
    <P>It is now apparent that the Minister failed to consult with those he expected to provide an extra level of service, namely, the staff in his Department.  The Minister for Finance introduced an embargo on recruitment, which caused the problem, yet at the same time the Minister for Social Welfare announced in a journal &mdash; not <i>An Phoblacht</i> or The Workers Party newspaper, he does not use them anymore &mdash; that he needed <Col N="228" /> five people in his Department to assist him with his constituency work.  Is that consistent with a Civil Service embargo, especially at a time when the agricultural community and others were suffering?</P>
    <P>This instance of gross insensitivity was only the latest in a series of industrial relations gaffes by the Minister. The first that staff in the Department heard about plans to decentralise to Johnstown Castle was when the Government announced the decision to the media.  This happened again in Tallaght yesterday &mdash; it was the media who told the Packard workers they were going to lose their jobs.  The Minister, Deputy Yates, was not even in the country when the Johnstown Castle decision was announced.</P>
    <P>With no disrespect to the Minister of State, why is the senior Minister not here for this important matter?  He is already responsible for spending £600,000 of taxpayers' money on special payments to staff in his Department. This money, paid before Christmas, was payment in advance for overtime, the purpose of which was to clear backlogs which had arisen.  Another backlog has arisen since this industrial dispute. Farmers have rung their vets for test results but vets have been told by the DVO in Cork that the results are not being released.  The Minister should have the power to tell them to release their results.  In some instances clearance have been advertised but had to be cancelled because of this problem.  The backlog has arisen because the Minister, in opening farming offices to the public in the afternoon, has diverted staff from their normal duties.  The farmers' charter has proved an unplanned and uncosted fiasco, the most expensive photo-opportunity in the history of Irish agriculture. The estimate does not take account of the approximate £250,000 spent on the launch.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Rory Kiely for sharing his time with me as I want to add my voice to this call.  This has been one of the worst years in living <Col N="229" /> memory for Irish agriculture, with bad weather and bad prices even before the BSE crisis.  Farmers have faced huge problems over the last five or six months.  I ask the Minister of State to appeal to the Minister for Finance to solve this problem.  I respect people's right to strike or go slow.  However, this has been the worst year ever for agriculture. If more attention was paid to the problem it could be solved.</P>
      <P>I know of many cases of people who were locked up due to brucellosis or TB eradication, had a long winter and now cannot sell their livestock.  The bank manager is complaining, they have no fodder and the local Department office will not give out the blue cards.  This is our major industry and it is in crisis.  I appeal to both Ministers on behalf of the national interest and these people who have suffered enough.  Will they have to go to further expense?  The bank managers do not believe them at this stage.  Departments are no longer believed by bank managers because agricultural schemes, such as REPS, are in place today and gone tomorrow. Bank managers no longer believe farmers who say they have a grant in the pipeline.  I do not blame them because it is a result of the carry-on of the present Minister.  It is all press conferences and spin doctors now, which is of little use to family farmers who have to make a living.  I appeal for a speedy solution to this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Rory Kiely for allowing me to contribute on this matter.  I want to bring two cases to the Minister's attention.  The first case concerns a farmer who has decided to retire from business and has a large dairy herd which he got tested for tuberculosis and which was found to be tuberculosis free.  He got blood tests taken, sent them to Cork and nothing happened because of the dispute.  He now cannot sell his dairy herd.  In the second case lesions were found on an animal in September.  Two tests were taken and it was found to be TB free, but the farmer cannot get his cards from <Col N="230" /> the local office.  That is totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>As Senator Rory Kiely said, the farmers' charter, which was launched with a huge degree of hype, is now in absolute ruins.  If the unions had been properly consulted at the time some of these difficulties might not have arisen.  There has been a deferral in the time scale for applying for area aid for tillage farmers. There have been huge problems with the maps not being properly processed. I appeal to the Minister to do what he can.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry indicated in the Dáil last week that it was a matter for the Minister for Finance.  That is not good enough.  It is within the Minister's Department and it is up to him to find a solution.</P>

      <P>I remind the House that 1995 was a record year for farming. It was unfortunate that we had the BSE scare this year, which was totally outside the control of our Minister.  However, other sectors, such as sheep, pigs and, I hope, dairying, are doing quite well at the moment.  The beef sector is providing us with major difficulties.  I agree with Senators that the CPSU could not have chosen a more difficult time for the farming community in which to call a strike.  It is totally unfortunate and very unfair.  Farm families with very low incomes are faced with ruination if the strike is not lifted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial implications for the Irish economy of the BSE scare were <Col N="231" /> recognised by this Government and have been dealt with as a top priority measure.  In an effort to mitigate the disastrous effect of the closure of the international and national markets, strenuous efforts were made by the Minister and the Government to persuade our European partners of the need for measures to stabilise the market. The result was the EU Commission agreed to open the intervention markets for 100,000 tonnes of beef during the months of April and May.  To date, our industry has been awarded tenders for about 8,000 tonnes, equivalent to some 25,000 cattle.  This was a major achievement and it is to be regretted that the programme of industrial action did not have due regard to the importance of this national issue and did not refrain from any action taken in pursuance of a pay claim which would have the effect of preventing the sale of animals to this intervention market, which by its nature is temporary, or, alternatively, would prevent the export of animals to international markets, bearing in mind the strenuous efforts which have been put into keeping these markets open.</P>
    <P>While the excellent service provided by the CPSU must be recognised, I greatly regret the action being taken, which is having a severe impact on the farming community.  The action has serious implications, including the following. Tests have ceased in virtually all counties since farmers are reluctant to pay for tests when they cannot get identity cards or test result in many cases. Many farmers are unable to sell cattle as the cards are not in date.  Area aid applications are not being processed.</P>
    <P>This situation is wholly unacceptable against the background of ongoing talks between the union and the Department of Finance at the Labour Relations Commission.  When the Department of Finance agreed to these talks, there was a clear understanding that problems arising would be addressed.  It has been a long standing and laudable practice in the trade union movement to suspend any action which might cause hardship <Col N="232" /> while talks are in progress.  It is unfortunate the CPSU has not seen fit to do likewise on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I realise that industrial action by its nature causes disruption.  However, in my view, the interpretation by the CPSU of the type of industrial action to apply, especially in the case of the disease eradication programmes, is unnecessarily rigid.  A more realistic interpretation would allow clerical staff to undertake the aspects of the new scheme which applied prior to 1 April. This would allow trade to continue unhindered.</P>
    <P>As the Seanad is aware, talks are continuing at the Labour Relations Commission in order to resolve the dispute. Indeed, the Government has already signalled its preparedness to end the embargo which was the initial cause of the dispute.  In this context, I am surprised the union has persisted in its action in all Departments.  In particular, I am amazed it has refused to address the immediate problems arising for the agricultural sector.  It showed co-operation in that it said it would not obstruct the intervention system.  However, this makes no sense when it is obstructing cattle movement which will prevent many farmers from delivering their cattle to factories.  These include many low income farmers who now face financial disaster.</P>
    <P>The talks between the union and the Department of Finance are continuing at the Labour Relations Commission.  It has been clearly signalled by the negotiators that the separate claims on behalf of their members in my Department will be addressed in the context of the central talks.  In these circumstances I see no genuine reason for the continuation of the industrial action in my Department.  I am, therefore, calling on the CPSU to call off its industrial action now, or, at the very least, to cease the specific actions in the disease eradication area which are preventing animal testing and movements of animals and actions in the area aid schemes which may in due course lead to problems with premia payments for farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, the proposals for a local employment service arise from the main recommendation of the NESF Report No. 4 on ending long-term unemployment, which was published in June 1994.  The main tool in this is the use of mediators who will be based in communities and who will advise and guide the unemployed through the various routes to gaining employment.  I welcome the fact that the Government responded positively to the NESF report by announcing in March 1995 the setting up of the local employment service and by allocating £6 million in that year, which included £1 million for local training and education funds, with the other £5 million coming from the Department.</P>
      <P>However, reading the Revised Estimates for the Public Service, I am disappointed to note that only £1.37 million was spent in 1995, not even one-third of the allocation.  Why was this the case? Were there problems in setting up the service and have they been overcome?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the progress that has been made in the 14 areas where the scheme has been set up.  I also welcome the allocation of ongoing funding for 1996.  Two of these areas are in my part of the country &mdash; one is in County Clare and the other in County Limerick.  The scheme in County Clare is significant because it is one of only two that have <Col N="234" /> been established in non-partnership areas.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the County Limerick scheme has been setting a lead in many ways in the operation of the local employment service.  It was launched by the Taoiseach approximately one month ago and is operating in association with the Paul Partnership, one of the partnership companies.  It has already appointed six mediators and contact points have been established from where the mediators will operate.</P>
    <P>The work of the mediators is the most important development in this proposal. An unemployed person can approach a mediator for help.  Such people, especially if long-term unemployed, face a jungle of schemes, programmes courses and various routes back to work.  Much of the time their self-esteem, interview skills, work experience and the kind of personal contacts they have are low and they have great difficulty dealing with the problem of getting back to work.</P>
    <P>The job of the local employment scheme mediator is specifically to help people address these problems and anxieties.  They must provide an all round package of support addressed to the individual's needs rather than simply putting the menu and options on the table.  The important thing about the service is that it is tailor made, geared and targeted towards the individual's needs rather than simply providing a supply led or a demand led scheme.  It, therefore, has much potential in this area.</P>
    <P>This outreach work is an important new development.  I ask the Minister to ensure it gets the full support and the kind of back up that will be needed.  I welcome the detailed references to the local employment service in the new document from his Department, <i>Growing and Sharing our Employment.</i>  There is a strong commitment to giving it the necessary support.</P>
    <P>It is especially important that early school leavers are given special attention. There are very high levels of unemployment, especially for those who <Col N="235" /> leave school without either a high level of education in terms of the length of time they spend in education or obtaining accreditation or qualification. In consequence, many such young people face a lifetime of unemployment if there is not positive intervention.</P>
    <P>Their needs are varied, for example, they may require specific training.  In view of this, it is important the Government monitors the scheme with regard to those aged 18 and 19 years so that gaps can be filled where they arise.  At this stage we probably do not know what the needs of young people will be, and it will be necessary, therefore, to continue to monitor it on a long-term basis.  There is also the danger that these young people fall into the trap of low wage jobs where, in many cases, they can be exploited because they do not have high levels of skills or qualifications. This is something that will have to be monitored also.</P>
    <P>The local employment service will not in itself solve our unemployment problems but it can make a fundamental difference to the prospects of the long-term unemployed and to vulnerable young people.  Our record on job creation has been good in relative terms, despite the problems about which we are aware today in Packard Electric Ireland Limited.  However, even though we have made progress in terms of job creation, the rising tide does not lift all boats.  Much of the good work that has been done has not made any material difference to long-term unemployed people.  It is important, therefore, that we have a targeted scheme, such as the local employment service, which will deal with the problems in a practical way.  I am anxious that it should be supported and monitored effectively.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to the service.  I hope he will be able to reassure me that the scheme will be supported and continue to be implemented in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the <Col N="236" /> Senator for raising this issue.  I understand the frustration at the speed of getting a service of this kind into operation. However, the difficulty with such a service is that the core of it provides that proper plans be put together at local level, that they be based on proper consultation with all of the interest groups involved and that there be a careful working through of the priority groups. This would include the kind of people they would wish to serve, how they would best see a tailor made service developed in their area, the identification of the contact, the physical locations and the recruitment of staff, including trained staff.</P>
      <P>Much time, more than was expected, had to be devoted to getting plans that were seen to be sufficiently focused. This involved working with a wide range of groups to achieve this consensus.  The start up phase followed.  This is why only £1.4 million was spent in 1995.  While several plans had been approved, only three were in a position to draw down cash with services on line.  However, the position is continually improving. Eleven of the plans are now approved and we expect that they will be operational in these 11 areas by the end of this month.</P>
      <P>I have before me a rough outline of the details of what is in place.  There are seven outlets ready for business.  These are the local employment centres, which would have intensive guidance available to them.  A further four are in preparation and temporary accommodation is being put in place for a further five. In the first ten of 11 areas, 58 staff have been appointed, In addition, 11 contact points are ready for business and another 44 specific contact points are in preparation.  A great deal of work has advanced and we are in a position to have a good start up by the end of the month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It took time because we were not willing to commit to something that was going to be half baked without being properly thought through at local level. We also wished it to be satisfactory from our perspective in that we wish to <Col N="237" /> see this as an effective mechanism for tackling long-term unemployment.  This means that there had to be interaction between my Department and those who were going to put the service in place.</P>
    <P>The other element has been to secure co-ordination, co-operation and the necessary secondment across all State agencies.  The key issue is to achieve greater co-ordination and co-operation in the delivery of services, and the preparation of the plans in different areas has already contributed to this.  There is greater co-operation among the main service providers and that has helped to ensure that this will be a successful initiative.</P>
    <P>The principle is to move from providing programmes and expecting people to slot in with them, even if they are square pegs in round holes, towards basing programmes on the needs of clients by developing a profile or career path tailored to the person's needs.  That is a dramatic change in approach and requires intensive counselling levels. The ratio between counsellors or mediators and clients will be about 1:125.  The service will therefore have to be developed slowly.  However, when the service is fully operational in the 14 areas, I expect it to impact on thousands of people each year.</P>
    <P>The Senator is also correct in pointing out that an effective guidance and counselling service that will bring people to a point where they are ready for employment and will lead them into jobs is not in itself an answer to long-term unemployment.  We must also pursue other measures, some of which are outlined in the paper to which the Senator referred.  The paper looks at specific impediments in the labour market which are holding back access to employment, reducing incentives to take up work and reducing incentives for employers to create employment. There is an ongoing programme by Government to continue the process of reducing the cost of creating employment and to make it more rewarding for those who take up employment.</P>
    <P>In the paper we have also outlined <Col N="238" /> certain areas where there are serious problems to be overcome, such as the case of single people who often find it difficult to get onto the bottom rung to work their way up because of the low rewards at that stage.  We are looking at the possibility of introducing an income supplement for single people at the entry point to work.  The idea would be to get more people in at the entry point and to help them work up the employment ladder.  There are obviously concerns that it might create a low wage sub-culture, but getting into employment and working one's way up is important so we are keen to pilot this in unemployment blackspots.</P>
    <P>There will also be a need to look at other aspects of how we address unemployment. The budget, for example, has introduced the concept of targeted subsidies for the long-term unemployed. Those types of subsidies will primarily be sold through the local employment service in the key 14 areas and it will be one of the measures the services will have at their disposal to advance their clients.</P>
    <P>I am confident we will have an effective programme in place this year in each area.  It will not be a quick fix.  We must recognise that tackling long-term unemployment, which has grown continuously during recent years of strong economic performance, will be a slow job.  We have halted the growth in long-term unemployment but we must bring the graph line back down and that will require work over a long period.  I am convinced we can do it.  We must address it.  Otherwise we would rule out a large portion of our people from realistic participation in the economy.</P>
    <P>The Government announced in the budget that measures would be introduced aimed at 18 and 19 year olds who are not in education, training or employment.  We are working on the detail of that initiative with the Department of Social Welfare and FÁS. Important elements will have to be put in place before it can be effectively implemented.  Having an adequate data base and information technology to set <Col N="239" /> up an effective register would be an important first step.  The aim of the programme will be to provide opportunities for 500 young unemployed people at any one time.  After six months unemployment it would be a requirement that they register with FÁS.  We will then move to provide them with realistic options as to how they can advance their employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that we start to address the problems of 18 and 19 year olds who leave school without adequate qualifications and who, if they do not get into employment rapidly, can slip into a very interim relationship with the labour market and are at serious risk of disadvantage and becoming long-term unemployed. The key is to try to head off entry to long-term unemployment before the corrosive effects of a long period out of work take hold.  That will be an important element of this programme and it will be built on the same principle of the LES &mdash; trying to create <Col N="240" /> a programme that is well tuned to the needs of the client.</P>
    <P>It is a new departure in policy and the NESF, rightly, recommended it. Senators will have to be patient in seeing it get off the ground and becoming effective.  However, in the long term it is one of the means of ensuring that the substantial moneys we devote to training and employment schemes is really impacting for the long-term good of the people rather than providing a type of treadmill which they get onto for a while before leaving without permanent improvement.  The approach is right. We want to ensure that when we put it in place it will have the confidence of the public.  That is why it is taking longer than I and the Senator would have liked.  Nonetheless, the time that has been devoted to preparing the ground work has been well used and will repay itself in the long-term impact of the programme.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2 May 1996.</P>
