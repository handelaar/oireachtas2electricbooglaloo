      <P>Before commencing today's business, I am sure Members would wish to join me in welcoming a parliamentary delegation from the Russian Federation.  We hope your visit to Ireland will be fruitful and successful.  On my behalf and that of Members of Seanad Éireann, I welcome you and hope you enjoy your visit to our shores.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Reynolds that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide funding in 1996 or 1997 for the first phase development of a residential hospice service for the North-West Hospice.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Enright of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to raise the concerns about the treatment of prisoners in Israel and, in particular, the recent Supreme Court decision allowing prisoners to be subject to physical ill treatment by the police.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they can be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Russian delegation and hope they benefit from their visit to Ireland. In the last ten days major announcements have been made by the Government concerning radical changes in the Department of Justice as to how justice is administered.  The establishment of a courts commission and a prison authority has been announced.  Many Senators have strong views on the announcements and have a major input to make before either of these two major changes are implemented.  Will the Leader afford the House an opportunity to debate both the announcements as well as changes within the Department of Justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in welcoming our Russian guests and hope they enjoy their stay.  I hope they have not brought their weather with them but it appears that they may have done so.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's call for a debate on the issue of justice.  I know we will debate the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, today but what I have in mind is a more wide ranging debate.</P>
      <P>On several occasions the Leader has indicated to us that he would be prepared to have a debate on monetary union and European integration. When can we expect to have such a debate?  Has the Leader any up to date information on when we might expect to debate the Credit Union Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader pass on the wishes of so many of us, that our negotiators will ask the Unionists to think again on their policy of IRA arms decommissioning before allowing Sinn Féin into talks?  Anyone with any military experience will appreciate that the Unionists are asking for unconditional surrender.  These are the terms that were asked of Nazi Germany in World War II.  As a consequence of that decision, as our honoured Russians guests will know, hundreds of thousands of lives were needlessly lost and Nazi Germany was reduced to rubble.  Such thinking asks an army to show a white flag. Decommissioning has a place on the agenda but top of the agenda is conflict resolution between the 15 per cent of Northern people who voted for Sinn Féin and the rest of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The first item the Leader announced was Second Stage of the Bill to amend the law relating to criminal proceedings in the District Court and the other courts and to enable the Minister to make rules for the regulation and good government of prisons.  How does the Minister for Justice have such a function in light <Col N="639" /> of the announcement by the Taoiseach last week that he proposes to appoint an independent non-statutory board to take responsibility for the administration of the courts and the prison system?  The Government has already decided to take responsibility from the Minister for these two important functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those points could be made during the Second Stage debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not.  The Minister has no function in this regard.  She is not empowered to deal with this matter because the Taoiseach stripped her of her responsibilities for the administration of the courts and prison service.  She cannot take this Bill today because a week ago the Taoiseach announced she was no longer responsible for this area.  I ask the Leader not to take Second Stage of this Bill until we know who is answerable to this House. Otherwise, the confusion which already exists will be greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>On 18 November the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, launched the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  We have waited a long time for this report.  In view of its importance, I ask the Leader to arrange time for a debate as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader if the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has any plans to settle the dispute with CIE.  The workers are entitled to the last phase of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, which is 2.5 per cent.  I cannot understand why CIE will not pay those people their entitlements.  This has happened many times in the past when strike notice was served but CIE did nothing about it. It seems the county will be brought to a standstill coming up to Christmas.  The city was gridlocked last Tuesday.  Nobody is talking to the workers although CIE will probably talk to them during Christmas week.  This problem must be solved because it is causing hardship for business people in Dublin.  It seems that CIE is incapable of running a transport system.  If it cannot do it, it should be handed over to a company which can. The Minister should instruct CIE to talk to the workers and pay them their entitlements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Senator McAughtry.  We all know it is important to try to understand the other side's view and to reach a compromise.  The Mitchell recommendations on decommissioning offer that type of approach to resolve the conflict.  It is important that we speak out to ensure the extreme view does not prevail and that some attempt is made to reach a compromise and understand the other point of view.  Senator McAughtry made that point and we should support him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="640" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the points made by my colleagues Senator Wright and Senator O'Kennedy on the Order of Business. We have not been involved in the controversy over the delisting of a judge from the Special Criminal Court.  The Leader of the House will agree that we on this side of the House have supported much of the Government's legislation in the law and order area where it has been worthy of support.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Leader that it would be an insult to the House and a farce if we were to discuss and debate legislation which will be, in effect, made redundant by a Government decision.  The Taoiseach made it clear in the Dáil that, when legislation was passed, the Minister for Justice will only be in charge of policy matters regarding prisons and courts and not administration.  This Bill before us involves detailed administration of the courts and the prisons.  Section 18 specifically grants the power to make prison rules.  I understand the Leas-Chathaoirleach might be inclined to say that this is a matter for the debate but it is not.  This is a matter for order in this House.  I hope the Minister is not trying to hoodwink us or pull the wool over our eyes by having this Bill passed today and then doing something else at another level.  This Bill must not and should not be discussed today.  If the Minister and the other side of the House try to force this, it will make a mockery of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the argument the Opposition makes about the Bill.  If procedures in the courts and court system are to be changed, it will be necessary to bring in legislation.  It will always be necessary to bring such changes to the Houses of the Oireachtas regardless of what bodies are in charge of our courts system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I wish to complain about the Bill before us.  Some of it is relevant and necessary but large sections are controversial.  The Government's decision to change the governing and regulation of the prisons is a fundamental one which affects this legislation.  It is difficult for us to debate this issue when we do not know what will be the Government position.  This Bill should be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>During the summer, the Minister for the Marine announced he had decided to award the contract for the west coast search and rescue service to a new company.  There is now considerable doubt as to whether the company will be able to provide, from the end of this year, the adequate service we had under the old arrangement.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Marine to clarify the situation as we do not wish to see the service downgraded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Russian delegation, especially the Russian Ambassador who has been a good friend to us in Shannon and has helped us <Col N="641" /> develop business through the airport and trade generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on prisons.  I was at the concert last night in Mountjoy Prison.  There is something wrong with a system when brilliant people such as those who, within three weeks, put on that show are behind bars.  We need to discuss why these people are in prison.  Judging by their appearance and the way they spoke and performed, they should not be there.  Many of them are professional actors and it is a pity that their professionalism is not channelled in a profitable way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Exit stage left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time there was a system whereby they could be rehabilitated rather than taking up places in Mountjoy.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Bohan in calling on CIE to do something about strikes.  CIE management seems to have a habit of frustrating its workers every Christmas and at peak periods.  It should not plunge this country into crisis at Christmas. People have enough problems without trying to drive into town.  This is an emergency and CIE should solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, deal effectively with incidents such as the one that occurred last week?  The Garda Síochána hired a coach at substantial expense to bring ten prisoners to Mountjoy Prison.  Seven gardaí accompained them.  The Governor of the prison had to put beds in the corridor for the prisoners. In the morning he said there was no room for them and gave each of them a voucher to take public transport home.  They were at home before the gardaí who escorted them to the prison.  It seems farcical.  Some of the ten prisoners were charged with breaking and entering.  Is this Bill a cosmetic exercise or will it deal effectively with the problem?  Nobody believes the system works. Will this Bill have any influence?  Will it deal with the problem of crime on the ground?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes I can, but, as we see it, the Bill will not deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Russian Ambassador and his delegation to the House.  I agree with Senator Bohan as regards the 2.5 per cent of the <i>programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> for CIE.  Will the Leader tell the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications that we cannot break agreements with workers? Business people depend on trade at certain times of the year and we are now approaching one of those times.  City centre trade must be supported and we must not allow revenue the Government <Col N="642" /> is depending on to be lost because a section of a semi-State or State operation is not being run successfully.  The Minister has not been shy in taking steps in the past and he should do so now. This area should be examined immediately.</P>
      <P>Last week we asked for a copy of the proposed Luas lines in the city centre.  I am the transport, energy and communications spokesperson for the largest Opposition party and I still have not received this.  Is there a reason for not allowing this side of the House to have a copy?  I understand it was available to the Government side of the House.  Will the Leader ensure that this side of the House receives a copy of that and the traffic control systems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House impress on the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht the importance of providing grant funding to groups providing Irish language programmes and courses outside Gaeltacht areas?  There are many deontaisí and grants for people who promote the Irish language in Gaeltacht areas.  With the advent of Teilifís na Gaeilge there is more emphasis than ever on the promotion of our language.  Ach taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht níl aon chabhair nó deontaisí le fáil ag grúpanna nó ag daoine atá ag plé le cursaí Gaeilge.  The Minister should examine the situation and make funds available to groups in various parishes outside Gaeltacht areas.  There would be more activity in such programmes and accordingly our language would be promoted more strongly outside the Gaeltacht.  Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister and my colleague in the Galway constituency, Deputy Higgins, to consider promoting the Irish language outside Gaeltacht areas by the provision of deontaisí for groups promoting the Irish language through adult education programmes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Members in extending a welcome to the delegation from the Duma and to the Russian Ambassador.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Bohan's concern.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, shares my view that the action of CIE management with regard to the final payment of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is inexplicable.  The management has an obligation to ensure that any action on its part will not exacerbate the problem.  It does not have a good reputation in that regard and I hope wiser counsel will prevail.  Its current position is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to address the point made by Senator O'Kennedy and it is not my intention to be flippant.  There are lawyers and we must listen to the advice they give us.  This House is not the Four Courts and most of us are not lawyers.  I understand Senator O'Kennedy's point in so far <Col N="643" /> as I understand the jargon contained in Bills that come before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

I had the honour, with Senator Bohan, to be in Russia during the last presidential elections and I will shortly report to the Seanad on many of the innovative and constructive ways in which the Russians do their business.  We can learn much from their form of parliamentary democracy.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House put the following issue to the Minister for Justice?  In the last number of months there has been growing concern about the number of lethal knives available in society, particularly among young people.  There was an incident in Nenagh two weeks ago in which somebody was stabbed.  These knives are on sale at relatively cheap cost.  A sum of about £4 will secure a lethal knife.  A campaign has been launched&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Bill that is before us today, like Senator Magner I am a lay person compared to some Senators who give the impression that no Bill should be introduced and that there should be no regulations.  Sections of this Bill extend <Col N="644" /> periods of remand in custody and the Opposition had no objection to that.  Are they now saying it should not come before the House?</P>
      <P>Senator Mulcahy made a good point on the entitlement of the Bill.  He said that Senator O'Kennedy was right to say that the Minister for Justice had no right to come before the House with this Bill. If so and if he agrees that the Minister is entitled to introduce policy relevant to courts and prisons, is it now the case that we agree to the provisions of this Bill &ldquo;to make provision for the affixing of a seal to orders ... to enable the Minister for Justice to make rules for the regulation and good government of prisons, and to provide for related matters&rdquo;?</P>

Is it proper to have a debate on local government costings before the Estimates are considered by the Cabinet?</P>
      <P>Questions should be put directly to the management of CIE by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  The workers are not getting the money to which they are entitled because of a change in policy.  It is only right that the Minister should say if this is so.</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis echoed Senator Quinn's request for a debate on currency and the European Monetary Union.  That debate is confirmed for 4 December 1996 but it will not conclude on that day.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McAughtry was supported by Senator O'Sullivan in his plea to the Unionists to reconsider their policy on decommissioning and to work within the framework of the Mitchell principles.  I also support this call.  Senator O'Kennedy raised a point which gathered stream as the morning wore on.  I would like to remind <Col N="646" /> the Senator that the Order of Business was conveyed to Members last week.  Nothing has changed since then.</P>
    <P>This House works on the basis of courtesy and co-operation.  As Leader I would have expected that if there were real and substantial difficulties I would have been informed in good time so I could see for myself if there was a problem and make other arrangements if necessary.</P>
    <P>It is not my function to adjudicate on the content of Bills.  That is a matter for the House. The House achieves this by deliberation, listening to the Minister and putting questions and if at the end of all that the Opposition or other Members are not happy, they have procedures open to them.  This is democracy.  The procedure is called a vote.  I have no intention of changing the Order of Business.  If we are beaten in the vote so be it. If the Seanad has to adjourn because the Opposition at this late stage introduced this objection, which is not substantiated, then so be it.  The Opposition can take responsibility for frustrating the work of Seanad Éireann.  I think better sense will prevail and I appeal to Senator Dardis in particular, whose party believes in a rational approach, to accept that the place to debate this is within this House.  If there are problems we will talk about them and the Minister is here to reply.  This type of pre-emptive strike serves nobody's purpose.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock asked for a debate on the status of people with disability and I would welcome such a debate and will make time available.  Senator Bohan talked good sense on CIE as did other Senators.  I will convey his views to the Minister.  The House spoke with one voice on this issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy made the same points as Senator O'Kennedy.  Senator Daly raised the question of the west coast.  If the Senator does not succeed in raising this on the Adjournment I will make time available or find out some details for him.</P>
    <P>I do not have the information on the Luas lines requested by Senator Cassidy but I will try to find out for him.  We all look forward to Senator Hayes' report on parliamentary reform in the Soviet Union and a debate on the use of knives as weapons would be useful.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will be aware of the Minister's commitment to introduce Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bills periodically.  The aim of this is to facilitate the speedy introduction of measures to enhance the operational efficiency and effectiveness of criminal law and procedure.  The Minister recently set up an advisory group on criminal law and procedure made up of people with appropriate expertise and whose remit is to provide the Minister with ongoing advice in this regard.  I am happy to have the opportunity of bringing this Bill, which is the first Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, before the House.</P>
      <P>Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 17 have as their objective the reduction of the amount of time spent by gardaí on court and court related duties, and the amount of resources accounted for by these duties.  The sections will relieve gardaí as far as possible of non-operational duties in the courts and help to ensure a greater presence of uniformed gardaí in our communities.  They will also speed up aspects of court procedure in criminal matters.</P>
      <P>A significant proportion of Garda time, especially in the Dublin metropolitan area, is accounted for by the need under existing criminal procedure in the courts for the prosecuting garda to attend court in person to give evidence of arrest, charge and caution on the occasion of the first appearance of an accused before the court. Many of these attendances occur outside the members' rostered duty periods and, therfore, the requirement to attend court involves the payment of overtime which could be better spent on crime prevention and detection.</P>
      <P>Section 6 allows gardaí to give evidence by certificate of certain procedural matters, including evidence relating to arrest, charge and caution, with the purpose of relieving them from the obligation of attending in person in court to give such evidence orally.  In practice, this evidence is rarely challenged.  In the case of a serious offence, where the prosecuting garda opposes a bail application, he or she will need to be in attendance to give reasons bail is opposed. Overall, I am satisfied however that in most cases of first appearances before the court of accused persons, under the provisions of section 6, there will be no need for the prosecution garda to attend court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that where the court considers that the interests of justice so require, <Col N="649" /> the court may require the arresting garda to give <i>viva voce</i> evidence and adjourn the proceedings for that purpose.  That can be done at any stage in the proceedings.  This very necessarily reflects the importance attached by the courts to oral evidence.</P>
    <P>At present, when a person is arrested, the Garda has discretion under the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, to release the accused on station bail to appear in the District Court &ldquo;at the appropriate time and place&rdquo;.  The difficulty is that it is unclear whether the existing provision refers to the next sitting of the District Court or some time and place considered appropriate by the Garda.  In practice it operates with reference to the next sitting of the District Court.  Frequently, that next sitting of the court will be at a time when the arresting garda is not on duty and the garda will have to attend in court, thereby giving rise to overtime costs.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the Garda may release a person on bail from a Garda station to appear before the District Court at the next sitting or any sitting within 30 days of the next sitting of the court.  This will give the Garda more flexibility with regard to court appearances and help avoid the need for Garda overtime on these duties which could be better spent on operational duties.</P>
    <P>Section 4 extends from eight to 15 days the existing statutory limit for remanding an accused person in custody on that person's second or subsequent appearance before the District Court. No change is being made with regard to the period that a person may be remanded in custody on a person's first appearance in court as the accused must have the opportunity to obtain legal representations and advice before the longer remand period comes into effect.  Where the accused person consents to continuing remand in custody, the upper limit will continue to be 30 days.  The section does not affect the law relating to periods of remand on bail.</P>
    <P>Section 4 enables a court to remand an accused person in custody for a period less than the proposed maximum of 15 days in certain circumstances.  I have no doubt that there will be occasions when a court feels that in particular cases it should bring an accused before it more quickly than the maximum period permissible.</P>
    <P>Remands in custody are a very frequent feature of the criminal process before a case is ready to proceed to a hearing.  Currently, a considerable amount of Garda time and manpower is taken up with attendance in court for appearances of accused persons on remand.  Much of the time, there is no likelihood of the substantive hearing proceeding especially where the preparation of a Book of Evidence is involved.  The provision for longer remand periods will result in a significant saving in the time spent by gardaí in court attendance.</P>
    <P>Section 5 addresses the problem of the long distances which a remand prisoner escort &mdash; which can comprise one Garda driver and two <Col N="650" /> gardaí, although this will vary &mdash; is often required to cover and the implications this has for Garda time and resources.  At present when an accused person is remanded by, say, the Galway District Court, that person will normally be held in Mountjoy Prison, and the next and all subsequent remand appearances of that person will be before the District Court in Galway.  This can involve a full day's duty for each of three gardaí bringing the prisoner from Mountjoy to the court in Galway and back later that day to Mountjoy.  The requirement that a remand appearance be in the court having jurisdiction in the case gives rise to a heavy commitment of Garda time and resources.</P>
    <P>Section 5 will allow the District Court having jurisdiction in a case to remand an accused person in custody to an alternative court in the District Court district in which the prison where he or she is being held is located or in an adjoining District Court district.  This should result in substantial savings in costs of transport and Garda time, especially where the court of jurisdiction is a considerable distance from the remand prison.  In future, where an accused is remanded in custody by, say, the Galway District Court and that person is held in Mountjoy, it will be possible for the court to remand that person to appear at the end of the initial remand period in a District Court venue in the Dublin metropolitan district. The Bill allows subsequent remand hearings to be conducted in the Dublin court in this example. When the case is ready to be heard, the section provides that the alternative court will have the power to remand the person to a sitting of the court in the District Court district in which the offence was committed or where the person resides or was arrested.  I am confident that this provision will yield substantial savings in Garda time and expenditure on these duties.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with section 17 of the Bill.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1951, provides that a person arrested on warrant or charged following arrest without warrant must be brought before a District Court judge as soon as practicable.  If arrested on a warrant or charged following arrest without warrant after 10 p.m., a person may be brought before a District Court judge the following day before noon.  What this 10 o'clock rule means is that, if arrested on a warrant or charged following arrest without a warrant before 10 p.m., the person must be brought before a District Court judge that night.  This means that arresting gardaí in these circumstances must attend court almost nightly in the Dublin metropolitan district.  I have been concerned for some time about the consequences of this recruitment for Garda and judicial time and court resources.  The all round cost of the night court system is considerable.  Perhaps even more important is its effect on policing levels in the community especially at night.</P>
    <P>To address this problem, section 17 provides that it shall be sufficient compliance with the requirement to bring a person before a District Court judge as soon as practicable if a person, <Col N="651" /> having been arrested on a warrant after 5 p.m. or having been arrested without warrant and charged after 5 p.m., is brought before a judge of the District Court not later than noon on the following day.  I am satisfied that this procedure will operate in such a way that there will be no need for courts to sit at night for these purposes.</P>
    <P>There are many statutory provisions empowering the courts to issue search warrants to enable the gardaí to search premises for various items, including stolen goods, firearms and many other specific items such as video recordings and racist material.  A good example is the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, which provides for the issue of search warrants in respect of drug trafficking offences.</P>
    <P>However, there is no general statutory provision for the issue of search warrants in relation to the commission of serious offences such as murder or rape.  I am very much aware that this can have serious implications for the detection by the gardaí of the most serious types of offences.  This has been a noticeable deficiency in the criminal law for a long time.  Section 10 will remove that very serious impediment to criminal investigation.</P>
    <P>The section contains a provision for the issue by a judge of the District Court on the sworn evidence of a Garda inspector or a garda of a higher rank, of a search warrant for the search of any place and any person found at that place where the judge is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidence of certain specified serious offences is to be found at that place.  This will enable the gardaí to search for and seize evidence such as knives in cases involving, for example, murder or an offence involving serious bodily injury, false imprisonment, rape or any offence set out in the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 12 is to replace section 28 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, with a new section.  The proposed section provides for the taking of palm prints and photographs by the gardaí following the conviction of a person. Section 28 currently provides for the taking of fingerprints only.  The new provision will be of assistance to gardaí, for example, in a case where a person reoffends and leaves a palm print but not a fingerprint at the scene of the crime.  I believe the gardaí should have as complete a profile as possible of a convicted person so that person can be subsequently identified if he or she reoffends.</P>
    <P>Section 13 amends the Criminal Law Act, 1976. That Act allows a member of the Garda to use reasonable force to compel a person to comply with a requirement to stop a vehicle, including the placing of a barrier or other device in the path of a vehicle.  That power relates to a number of offences specified in section 8 of that Act.  The power does not extend to the offence under <Col N="652" /> section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, of unlawfully taking a vehicle.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have been concerned for some time about motor vehicles being taken without the consent of their owners and used in the commission of crime.  They have been looking at means to reduce the amount of damage caused by the drivers of these vehicles.  They are satisfied from tests carried out that a tyre deflating device known as the stinger, which is in use in other EU countries, will prove to be an effective way of addressing the problem.  The use of the stinger in these circumstances is permitted by section 8 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, so that all that is required is to add section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, to the list of offences specified in section 8 of the 1976 Act.  The effect of this provision will be to allow the gardaí to use this new device to stop vehicles unlawfully taken by so-called joyriders.  The stinger will be used by trained gardaí under very strict supervision under Garda guidelines.</P>
    <P>Section 2 has two separate purposes in amending the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  Section 4 of that Act specifies that where a member of the Garda Síochána has enough evidence to prefer a charge against a person who has been detained under the provisions of that Act, &ldquo;he shall without delay charge that person&rdquo; unless the continued detention of the person is necessary in connection with an offence other than the one for which the person was arrested.</P>
    <P>This has given rise to difficulties particularly in two areas.  First, it seems to be the case that this can be interpreted too rigidly and members of the Garda Síochána may proceed to prefer a charge before the matter is fully investigated.  Secondly, an issue has been made in court in some cases that evidence should be declared inadmissible because it was acquired while a person was detained after there had been sufficient evidence to prefer a charge.  Generally, the courts have concluded that the section, in effect, should be interpreted widely and that a person need not be charged while an investigation continues which could have a bearing on the evidence that might be sufficient to ground the charge.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of section 2 makes it clear that the detention should be strictly related to its being necessary for the purpose of the investigation and that the person should be released when the detention is no longer necessary for the investigation of the offence, rather than when there is enough evidence to charge, unless the person is to be brought before a court in connection with a charge or is to be detained in relation to another offence.  The amendment, in reality, does little more than restate the law as interpreted by the courts but should have the advantage of making the position clear to those operating these provisions.  The Criminal Justice (Drugs Trafficking) Act, 1996 contains a similar provision and this opportunity is being taken to restate the law in regard to offences under the 1984 Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" /> Paragraph (c) of section 2 arises from recent court decisions in regard to periods of detention under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984. Section 4 of the 1984 Act provides for detention periods of six hours from the time of arrest under the section and a further period not exceeding six hours if a garda not below the rank of superintendent has reasonable grounds for believing that such further detentions is necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also provides for the suspension of the reckonable detention period for the purposes of rest and medical attention.  The effect of paragraph (c) is that where a person being detained under section 4 attends court to challenge the lawfulness of the detention, the time during which that person is absent from the station shall also be excluded in reckoning a period of detention permitted by this section.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 of the Bill concern certain powers of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Under the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, the District Court may try a person charged with certain scheduled indictable offences if it considers that the facts constitute a minor offence, and the accused consents to summary disposal.  The Director of Public Prosecution's consent is necessary for summary disposal of only a few of those indictable offences and in general these are the less serious ones.  The consent is not necessary for summary disposal of a range of serious offences including robbery, burglary, forgery or indecent assault.</P>
    <P>The existing law in this regard appears anomalous and section 8 provides that the Director of Public Prosecution's consent shall be required for the summary disposal of all indictable offences scheduled in the 1951 Act.  In a given case, where the facts known to the prosecution reveal a serious offence, this will allow the Director of Public Prosecutions to refuse his consent to summary disposal of the matter.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1951, also provides that when a person is convicted of an offences he or she may admit guilt to other offences and ask that they be taken into account in deciding punishment by the court.  When an offence has been taken into consideration the accused cannot subsequently be prosecuted for it.  The gardaí and prosecution who are present in court may have no knowledge of the offences that the accused wishes to have taken into account and may be unable to provide the court with information on the seriousness of the offences.  In these circumstances, there is a risk that over-lenient sentences could be imposed due to inadequate consideration of offences &ldquo;taken into account&rdquo;. These offences may be more serious than they appear.  Section 9 provides that the Director of Public Prosecution's consent will be required before offences, which are not the subject of the charges before a court, may be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the main remaining provisions of the Bill.  The purpose of section 11 <Col N="654" /> is to remove any doubt that may exist, however remote that fingerprints or palm prints taken by electronic means cannot be used in evidence.  It also provides that a photograph or a fingerprint or palmprint certified by the member of the force who took it shall be evidence of the matters stated in the certificate unless the contrary is proved.  This means that it will not be necessary for the garda who say, took a photograph, to give oral evidence in court that the photograph is that of a particular person.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 18 is to provide a single enabling provision for the Minister for Justice to make prison rules dealing particularly with the treatment of offenders.  The provision will replace the existing enabling provisions which are set in legislation dating back some 120 years.  Draft new prison rules have been prepared by the Department of Justice and were published in 1994 in the policy document <i>The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan.</i>  The new enabling provision is required in order to avoid any possible complications relating to the Minister's power to make these rules.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment in the policy document <i>A Government for Renewal</i> that &ldquo;the proposed new prison regulations shall be referred to the Dáil Committee on Legislation and Security&rdquo; and the Bill provides that these rules will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the normal way.  The new rules, when implemented, will replace the 1947 rules for the government of prisons which are to a large extent obsolete. These new rules will reflect the practical requirements of a modern prison system and will benefit both prison management and the prisoners.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 19 is to enable the District Court to provide itself with a seal and to provide that an order of the District Court which has been sealed and authenticated by the signature of a District Court clerk shall be a record of the decision of the District Court.  The difficulty with the existing procedure is that each order must be signed by the District Court judge and, of course, this can take a considerable length of time.  The section will continue to allow the record of a decision to be an order signed by a judge of the District Court but, in addition, it will also provide that an order affixed with the seal of the District Court and authenticated by the signature of a District Court clerk shall equally be a record of a decision of the District Court.</P>
    <P>A similar provision applies in the Circuit Court under rules of court.  In that court, orders may be sealed and authenticated by the signature of the county registrar.  The section will help to improve the administration of the District Court.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is just one element of the Minister for Justice's law and order response to crime.  It is an important measure for reform of the criminal law, however, containing several practical measures which have as their objective the improved use of Garda resources and the <Col N="655" /> strengthening of the capacity of the Garda Síochána to respond to serious crime, and greater efficiency in the operation of the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>Other criminal law reform measures which will be brought before this House include a Criminal Law Bill updating the criminal law and clarifying the Garda Síochána's powers of arrests which is currently before the Dáil, and new Bills dealing with non-fatal offences against the person, juvenile justice, criminal insanity and fraud.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the views of Senators on the Bill which I commend to the House.</P>

      <P>This is not the first time the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, has dealt with a criminal justice matter in this House.  However, everyone in the House understands why he is here today instead of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.  I was going to call her the real Minister for Justice but that might be an insult to the Office.  One presumes the reason the Minister, Deputy Owen, is not here is because she is embroiled in a serious controversy which we, on this side of the House, have so far not sought to introduce.  There is no profit in so doing.  It is a matter of record that the Opposition in this House has been supportive of Government activity, such as it has been, on law and order questions.  That will continue to be the case.</P>
      <P>I mention the other controversy because it has to be said that, to a certain extent, discussing this Bill makes a mockery of this House.  In his attempt to bail the Minister for Justice out of her current difficulties, the Taoiseach is on record as saying that the organisation of the courts and prisons will be taken from the Department of Justice and run by independent bodies.  If that is the case, perhaps the Minister could explain why we are discussing this Bill which directly refers to the organisation of the prisons and the courts. Will we be back here discussing similar topics in a few weeks' or months' time when this Government decides to introduce more legislation on the organisation of the prisons and the courts?</P>
      <P>This is not the first time the Government has made panic reactive type announcements on law and order.  Ms Veronica Guerin was murdered on 26 June 1996.  Six days later a bail referendum was announced.  Why did it takes that length of time?  Six days later it was decided to accept the Fianna Fáil Bill on the freezing of criminal assets. A few days into the present scandal the Government made a panic reactive announcement that the courts and the prisons would be reorganised.  Why does it always take a crisis for this Government to make announcements?  It does not inspire confidence in our system of law and order or in our justice system.  This is seen as Government not by action but by reaction.  Perhaps criminals feel safe until the next crisis when panic legislation will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> Why has it taken so long to introduce this Bill? On 11 May 1995 the Minister for Justice announced that this Bill was imminent.  She said: &ldquo;Preparation of a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill... is at an advanced stage.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from Deputy O'Donoghue's speech on this Bill in the Official Report of the Dáil on 25 July, 1996, column 928. We have delays and panic action and reaction.</P>
      <P>The Government has failed because it cannot present a comprehensive plan of action in this area.  It has accepted in substance two Fianna Fáil Bills in the criminal justice area, the most important of which was the freezing of criminal assets legislation which the Government was stampeded into agreeing after the murder of Ms Veronica Guerin.  It knew it was so out of touch with public opinion on law and order that it would have been seen to be even more foolish, lethargic and redundant had it not accepted Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill.</P>
      <P>If there is a note of anger in my voice it is because I feel that by discussing this Bill today we do no service to the integrity of Seanad Éireann.  We will probably be back here again, if this Government is to be believed, to amend this Bill in the light of new legislation.  Sections of this Bill may need to be amended if the bail referendum is passed and the Minister has already published an outline of the legislation required in that event.  However, she did not publish draft legislation which would have added to the debate on the bail referendum.  I tabled an amendment to the legislation on the bail referendum which stated that nobody would be refused bail for more than 60 days.  However, the Minister assured me that a time limit was not required in the bail referendum because legislation would be introduced.</P>
      <P>I welcome certain sections of this Bill, particularly section 5 which relates to the jurisdiction of District Court and place of remand.  The amount of Garda time which has been wasted is a disgrace, as Senator McGowan said this morning.  I welcome sections 8 and 9 which relates to the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions in certain matters.  The provisions in section 10 relating to search warrants should have been made a long time ago. I also welcome section 11 which deals with the electronic recording of finger prints and palmprints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the certificates of evidence relating to certain matters.  One of the critical moments in our jurisprudence in relation to the prosecution of an accused person is the arrest. Many cases are thrown out of court because a judge finds that a person has not been properly arrested.  As a practising barrister with first hand knowledge of these matters, I do not accept the <Col N="657" /> Minister's statement that in practice this evidence is only rarely challenged.  Section 6 should be studied carefully.  This side of the House will support all measures to reduce the time spent unnecessarily by gardaí in the courts when it could be better spent apprehending criminals. This section is not appropriate to our system of justice.</P>
    <P>There is a long line of authority in Ireland, England and throughout the world on the validity of arrest.  Article 40 of our Constitution states clearly that as citizens of Ireland we have liberty and freedom.  An arrest must be made strictly in accordance with law and proper procedure. Given that background, I believe it is inappropriate that evidence of arrest will be allowed to be given by certificate.  Perhaps the Minister, in replying, will tell me I am overstating the case and that is not what section 6 intends.  I will raise this matter to a greater extent on Committee Stage but it seems that evidence of and compliance with the correct procedures will be able to be given by certificate in court.</P>
    <P>One of the best known ways of giving evidence by certificate in court relates to drink-driving cases where a certificate is handed in by the prosecuting garda to the judge concerning the level of alcohol tested in the laboratory.  However, that is a strictly technical matter and is not on a par with the taking of someone's liberty.  If something has been said to the contrary by my colleague in the other House, Deputy O'Donoghue, I am prepared to disagree with him because I feel so strongly about it.  It goes to the kernel of every criminal case.</P>
    <P>The making of prison rules is totally premature given that an independent body for the prison service may decide that its want to make a different set of prison rules.  The Minister said in the Dáil that she will be responsible only for prison policy.  The making of prison rules it not a matter of policy but of organisation.  Are we discussing and approving rules written in draft form by one body only to have another body write a different set of rules?  If that is not a waste of time and making this House redundant, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>Some sections of this Bill which streamline various administrative court matters are welcome although they are overdue.  However, this House has no business discussing a criminal justice Bill which has been made redundant by the Taoiseach's words in the Dáil.  Does this Government have any coherent plan or strategy for dealing with the crime crisis?  Does one part of it know what the other part is doing?  Can we expect any further announcements in the criminal justice area?  Is something else to be taken from the Minister for Justice, such as responsibility for the running of her Department?  Is the management of the Garda Síochána to be taken out of her hands and an independent body set up?  Is that next?  We are entitled to know exactly <Col N="658" /> what is Government policy on criminal justice. We are entitled to consistency and planning.  This Government has made many panic and reactionary announcements in this area which were not considered or prepared but taken from the emergency drawer in answer to the corresponding crises.  I am sure there are more announcements in that emergency drawer waiting for the next crisis to set in.  This Government has made itself a patchwork criminal justice policy in order to survive.  That is what it is about.  It appears that this Government is not about policy or action but survival.  There is nothing the Taoiseach will not do and the Minister for Justice will not announce to save her skin or the Government's collective skin.  Have they no honour or pride?  People are suffering under this patchwork criminal justice policy.  In so far as this House, under protest by Fianna Fáil, has been forced to discuss this Bill which will be shortly redundant, the Government stands accused not only of having no policy but of wasting Oireachtas time as well.  We have seen in the other House how the Government deliberately devised a strategy to have ruled out of order legitimate questions on the scandal of the delisting of Mr. Justice Dominic Lynch. Unfortunately, we have seen today the Government frustrating the attempts of Fianna Fáil to use time constructively.  The Opposition has not challenged one Government Bill which has been good and positive.</P>
    <P>In so far as certain sections of this Bill are useful, they will be supported but, in so far as this Bill is redundant and wastes time, it will be opposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address the points raised by Senator Mulcahy now and by others on the Order of Business.  This Bill governs procedures within the Garda and other areas covered by the Bill.  It amends Acts of Parliament such as the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967 and other enactments, to give effect to Article 11 of the Council Directive 91/308/EEC of 10 June 1991 of the European Communities on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering.  The Bill amends Acts and implements EU directives.  The new court and prison authorities will not have power to do so.  It is only the Houses of the Oireachtas which can amend Acts and these amendments are key provisions in improving the efficiency of the Garda and the courts system. The new authorities announced by the Taoiseach are dealt with under the Bill, if the Senator is concerned about them.  If I had a problem with a section of a Bill when I was on the Opposition side of the House it was always dealt with when I raised it on Committee Stage.  It would be wrong to throw the baby out with the bathwater because of concern about one section.  It is important this Bill is enacted immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> Senator Mulcahy asked whether we would have more Bills of this type.  The Minister announced in the Dáil that she would regularly update and amend these Bills to improve their efficiency.  She made it clear this would occur once every 12 months.  In her Dáil speech she said this was the first of many other provisions to ensure the ongoing improvement in the efficiency of our courts system.  The Minister of State said it today&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my first sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The reply to the Senator's question, which was expressed as a concern and a criticism, is that other similar Bills will be produced.  The Minister of State stated there will be ongoing improvements to the systems in operation in the courts and under the Acts which I outlined earlier.</P>
      <P>Senator Mulcahy asked why the Bill took so long in coming before the Dáil.  I cannot account for the eight years prior to 1995 when this Bill was announced but within two years of the Minister taking office, she has brought the Bill before the House.  Changes are taking place.  One of the Acts being amended goes back to 1924. The Minister, in two years, has introduced changes that Fianna Fáil failed to implement in the previous eight years.  I am surprised that the approach is not to deal with the specifics of the Bill on Committee Stage but rather to throw out 22 sections.  Senator Mulcahy is prepared to throw out 22 sections because of his concern for one section.</P>
      <P>The Bill is another link in the comprehensive approach by the Minister to the crime problem.  I compliment the Minister, the Minister of State, and the Government on the excellent work being done in this area since taking office, in particular the work done throughout 1996 which will go down as the year the Government and the State cried &ldquo;stop&rdquo; to crime.  It is time the tables were turned on the criminal elements and notice was given that we are serious in stopping the growth of crime and reversing the rot in society.</P>
      <P>The Bill will make a sizeable contribution to the fight against crime, not least because the central part of its intention is to reduce the time spend by gardaí in the courts and, as a consequence, make Garda resources available on the streets and in rural Ireland.  I have often seen gardaí waiting to give evidence in court for hours and sometimes days.  It was a great misuse of State resources which should be employed on the streets.  This Bill will enable that to happen and there should not an objection to it.</P>
      <P>The problems in the criminal justice system did not happen only in recent times.  The system has been crying out for reform for many decades and it has remained practically unaltered since the foundation of the State.  There is no quick solution to our outdated criminal justice system or to the crime problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> It is vital we have more prison spaces.  There have been more prison spaces provided already this year than in the previous two to three years. Up to 180 places have been provided this year and around 50 have been provided in the past three years.  The Government is committed to providing 850 places in total, which is almost a 25 per cent increase in our prison capacity.  It is vital there are more probation and welfare officers, more gardaí and full use of up to date technology.</P>
    <P>Some months ago, the Minister for Justice announced the involvement of helicopters in the fight against crime.  Perhaps she could provide an update on developments in that area; I have raised this point in the House over a number of years.  The proposal that the Airs Corps and not the Garda will be responsible for the piloting of helicopters has been examined in other countries. This has been debated throughout Europe and it is agreed that it is more effective for gardaí to pilot helicopters than a third party.  If the garda are trained pilots, because of their training, background and skills, they can react and respond to the developing situation, rather than a third party waiting for an instruction from a garda with them.</P>
    <P>We must ensure there is an efficient system guiding and controlling the work of the Garda. We must ensure the courts are efficient and justice is meted out fairly and properly.  There must be a comprehensive programmed to tackle the drugs problem which not only involves the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State but also the Minister for Education and the Minister for Health.  Some months ago when he was in this House the Minister of Health outlined in detail the work he is doing.  We have also seen proposals from the Minister of Education.  There is a comprehensive and all embracing approach by this Government to the drugs problem, which is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, we had an almost simplistic approach to the drugs problems as a criminal issue to be dealt with and controlled by the Garda and customs officials.  Health and education had only a minimal role, if any.  This Government has recognised that health and education have a major role to play in tackling the drugs problem and it must be complimented on this.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is the first Minister to look at the macro position of crime and to implement a comprehensive programme of change.  The Minister, the Minister of State and the Government have prioritised the battle against crime and they have the determination and conviction to see the programme through. The Minister of Justice will implement a programme of reform, not only in the criminal justice system but also in her Department.  I welcome the fact that she has decided to introduce a regular and, if necessary, comprehensive annual Bill similar to this.  It will facilitate the speedy introduction of measures which are considered necessary by the Garda, the <Col N="661" /> legal practitioners and others working in the legal area.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important element of the response of the Minister to the problem of crime. I welcome the provisions which facilitate the reduction of the amount of time spent by gardaí on court and court related duties.  They will relieve gardaí as far as possible of non-operational duties in the courts and ensure a greater presence of uniformed gardaí in communities.  There will also be more flexibility with regard to court appearances.</P>
    <P>Gardaí will not be obliged when there is a further remand in a case to travel all over the country to courts.  The Minister of State gave the example of a garda who had to travel from Dublin to Galway.  The case was heard in the District Court in Galway but the prisoner was on remand in Mountjoy so the garda had to travel to Galway.  This is a simple but necessary change.  It ensures gardaí will not be obliged to spend up to a day sitting in a car in order to take a prisoner across the country only for the prisoner to be further remanded in custody.  The provision for longer remand periods will also ensure more efficient use of Garda time.  The change in the night court system will ensure that gardaí and others are not tied up all night with cases, as happens in the present outdated system.</P>
    <P>I am not a legal practitioner but I was surprised to discover that there is no statutory provision for the issue of search warrants with regard to the commission of serious offences such as murder and rape.  Such a provision is long overdue and is welcome, as is the extension of provisions relating to finger and palmprinting.  They are simple and practical changes which one would have thought would have been made decades ago but we had to wait until this Minister took the initiative to make such changes.</P>
    <P>Joy-riding has been a major problem in the community.  I compliment the Garda on how they have tackled it.  There was almost an epidemic of joy-riding incidents some years ago and the gardaí have managed to control and reduce the problem to an extent.  Their work in that regard deserves our recognition.  The provision for the use of what is called a &ldquo;stinger&rdquo; to deflate tyres will further assist them in their task.  There have been too many fatalities and injuires of both innocent and guilty people as a result of joyriding. The level of fatalities is unacceptable and any provision that will lead to a reduction in that level is welcome.  The Minister of State said special training will be provided for the gardaí who will use this equipment.  People have a legitimate concern about the effects of deflating tyres in a car travelling at high speed but I am confident that the gardaí will be given access to the experience and knowledge gleaned from other jurisdictions where this equipment is used.</P>
    <P>The provision regarding the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions to other offences being taken into consideration in awarding punishment is also a practical measure.  The <Col N="662" /> practice of somebody announcing that other offences could be taken into account when the accused was being sentenced for a minor offence is hardly acceptable.  The Bill will allow the DPP to give his view on whether the crimes as stated should be further investigated.  Somebody who is convicted of a minor offence can state that a more serious offence occurred which he wants to be taken into account when sentence is being passed.  That serious offence might just be mentioned without full details of the crime or its impact on the victim being available to the court to be taken into account when sentence is passed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for introducing it.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I object in principle to this House being asked to adopt legislation which the Government has already indicated it intends to remove from the remit of the Minister for Justice, in whose name the legislation is being introduced. The purpose of the Bill is set out clearly in the Title.  It is &ldquo;An Act to amend the law relating to proceedings in criminal matters in the District Court, for that and other purposes to amend the Courts of Justice Act, 1924...&rdquo; and other Acts dealing with courts and their administration.  The Acts are set out in the Title of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second basis for my fundamental objection is the fact that the Title also states: &ldquo;...to enable the Minister for Justice to make rules for the regulation and good government of prisons, and to provide for related matters.&rdquo;  It is clear that this Bill will enable the Minister for Justice to make rules regarding the operation of the courts and for the regulation and good government of prisons.  That was the purpose of the Bill when it was introduced in the Dáil some time ago. However, last Tuesday, 12 November 1996, the Taoiseach told the Dáil, according to the Official Report, Vol. 471, Col. 653: &ldquo;An independent and permanent board to be known as the Courts Service will be set up within a week on a non-statutory basis&rdquo;.  If one is to accept the Taoiseach's assertion, that independent board must now be in existence.  He continued: &ldquo;That body will be put on a statutory basis as soon as possible.  Its function will be to manage a unified court system.  Its chief executive officer will be recruited through open public competition.&rdquo;.  In case there be a doubt as to the total mess the Minister for Justice and the Government have generated in this area, the Taoiseach added: &ldquo;Responsibility for the prison service will be transferred from the Department of Justice to an independent, permanent, statutory board.&rdquo;.  The only thing he did not say about responsibility for the prison service was that it would be set up within a week.  However, one can interpret from the fact that the two boards are referred to together that the same intention applies.  It is an offence to this House, in light of the circumstances that have been discussed in the Dáil since the publication of this Bill, to ask the <Col N="663" /> Seanad to pass legislation in the name of a Minister who will have no further powers in this area as a result of the change in roles and responsibilities announced by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will not be enacted because it would be the first time the Oireachtas would be asked to effect powers for a Minister on prisons and courts in the knowledge that the Minister would have no power in this area in the further and would be unable to deliver, according to the Taoiseach's statement in the Dáil.  Perhaps even today she is not the person in charge.  The Taoiseach said that, as of last Tuesday the independent statutory board would be dealing with the administration of courts and perhaps the prison also.  That is the greatest nonsense I have ever heard in my experience of over 31 years here, including spending considerable time in Government.</P>
    <P>I object in principle to that Minister being given any further power or role in this area even if she had the powers the Taoiseach says she will no longer have.  She has proven to be derelict in the discharge of her constitutional responsibilities.  Anyone with any experience of procedures in Government will know one of the most basic responsibilities.  When a Minister brings a proposal to Government for Cabinet decision, it is formally circulated to other Ministers and the agenda is very clear, as it was in this case.  The agenda would mention a proposal by the Minister for Justice to terminate the appointment of Judge Dominic Lynch, in this instance.  I regret he is involved in this because I have known him since studying for the Bar in the late 1950s.</P>
    <P>That is the fundamental function of a Minister in any precedent one wants to consider.  When one's proposal to Government is adopted, and I had this experience many times, the practice is that the departmental officials wait outside the Minister's office when he or she returns to hear whether the proposal made to Government has been adopted.  The departmental officials here today must be familiar with this.  Having been informed the proposal is adopted, they immediately implement that Government decision, which is constitutionally binding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing so already.  It is quite clear that to ask another House of the <Col N="664" /> Oireachtas to give further powers to a Minister or Department found to be in dereliction of their duties runs totally counter to the constitutional obligation of legislators.</P>
      <P>Another element is the constitutional function of the Minister for Justice.  The obligation is clear to anyone who looks at the role of the Government in the Constitution.  It is mandatory and specific.  The Attorney General also has a role in the Constitution: &ldquo;There shall be an Attorney General who shall be the adviser of the Government in matters of law and legal opinion&rdquo;. It is not discretionary but mandatory.</P>
      <P>When both of those constitutional functions have not been discharged as required under the Constitution, attributing blame to officers of the Department flies against every principle of Government in this or any other State.  To invite a stranger in law, which is what the distinguished Mr. Seán Cromien is, to examine the functions, administration, execution and effectiveness of the Department of Justice compounds the original breach of constitutional responsibility.</P>
      <P>It shows no respect for the constitutional obligations of both the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General.  Could anyone seriously expect that, despite the detailed examination carried out by those two people, who are eminent in their own fields, they could, as strangers to the constitutional obligation, make a finding that the real dereliction was the dereliction of the constitutional function of a Minister or an Attorney General?  Does this Government seriously think it can pull the wool over our eyes, as legislators, some of us with considerable Government experience, and the public generally, by inviting strangers to make findings? Those gentlemen are strangers to these Departments.  Did we really think they would say that the Minister and her immediate officials were at fault in not effecting this Government decision, which they sought and got? Nonetheless, we are being asked to give more powers to that Minister, despite the clear announcement that she will no longer be responsible for this area.</P>
      <P>Section 18 states: &ldquo;The Minister for Justice may make rules for the regulation and good government of prisons&rdquo;.  We are now giving discretion to the Minister to make rules for the good government of prisons.  At the same time, the Taoiseach, who leads the Government in collective responsibility, has announced his intention to set up an independent, non-statutory board to do just that.  What kind of constitutional nonsense is this?  I do not mind if the Government, which has shown it is completely unaware of constitutional obligations, tries to involve private citizens to clear up a constitutional mess.  I know both private citizens, one particularly well, and have a high personal regard for them.  The Government has no right to try to undermine the role of the Oireachtas and ask us to give legislative effect to something that will be passed on to another body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> That is why I raised this on the Order of Business and asked that it be removed from our agenda.  The only point I make for the Government is that when this Bill went through the Dáil, it predated the disclosure of the greatest constitutional mess that has occurred for some time.  As of that time, even through one would have doubts about the capacity of the Minister for Justice one could say that this Bill was constitutionally appropriate and the Oireachtas could pass it in the knowledge that there was no constitutional breach involved.  However, now that the Government has said it is changing all that, I protest at the way the constitutional function of the Oireachtas is being undermined by being asked to give effect to this.</P>
    <P>Suppose that the non-statutory board is not set up before next Tuesday, we will be giving powers to the Minister which she will exercise for a day or two, if she has not been relieved of that responsibility.  Surely we are entitled to a proper presentation on the matter.  I have great respect for the Minister of State but on a matter of such importance the Minister responsible must be aware, if she is ever to be aware of her constitutional function, that she is obliged to come before the House and clarify the position. Nothing in the Minister of State's statement is remotely relevant to the discharge of ministerial responsibility.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill it will be possible to transfer the case of someone arraigned before a District Court to a different District Court and, on the face of it, that makes sense.  I would not normally object to it because I want to see the speedy administration of justice.  However, as a result of the Taoiseach's statement, the administration of our judicial system is the responsibility of an independent, non-statutory body.  We cannot ignore the fact that it will play a role in how the courts are run, how many justices will be sitting and how the business of the courts will be properly expedited.  Nonetheless, this House is being asked to pass legislation which ignores that fact and pretends that the Minister for Justice and her Department will be responsible for this.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there has been pressure on the Minister during the last week.  There has also been unfair pressure on her officials and an attempt to take responsibility away from the Minister and her office where it belongs. Obviously the Minister's officials had other things on their mind.  They knew that the Minister had set up an internal investigation to allocate blame. I have more respect for officials because I have experience of working with them since I first became a Minister in 1970.  I have been in six or seven different Departments since then and I object to them being used and abused.  They are part of the executive function of Government.  I also object to the Oireachtas being used and abused and being asked to pass a nonsense.</P>
    <P>I only became aware this morning that I would be asked to look at this but there is no precedent for any Minister coming into the House to give <Col N="666" /> effect to the main purpose of a Bill in the knowledge that she has been, or is about to be, stripped of responsibility for those areas by the Leader of her Government.</P>
    <P>This Government undermines the Constitution everyday.  It may not do so deliberately but either from lack of experience or respect for the constitutional function of Government, it is getting into a bigger constitutional minefield everyday.  It has no right to involve the Oireachtas in the same constitutional mess.  I protest in the strongest possible way and I will oppose this Bill at every section.  The Bill should not have been brought in and until such time as the Minister and the Government can clear up their own constitutional mess they should leave us out of it.</P>

      <P>When a Bill is before us we should use the opportunity to put forward our views irrespective of the confusion surrounding it.  I believe this Bill will require radical reform.</P>
      <P>It amused me to listen to Senator Mulcahy.  He seems to be playing on both sides of the court.  At one stage he criticised the Minister for the delay in bringing this legislation before the House and then decried her for bringing it before the House too soon.  It seems to be a general complaint that the Minister is criticised for delay yet when she acts she is accused of knee-jerk reactions.  You cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>The Minister has introduced a wide range of crime legislation.  We are inundated with legislation and I often wonder if the time has come to assess what we have passed.  There has been such a rush of legislation that there are bound to be errors in it.  That is a very serious thing to say but we cannot undermine our role as legislators and our duty to examine legislation in the full sense of the word.  It is time for an investigation and assessment of what we have done to date so that we can avoid any so called knee-jerk reactions and identify clear areas of need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not bad legislation.  I would have had more difficulty with some provisions which were passed without much mention.  This Bill deals with practical issues and, in that sense, I would not fault it.  As to whether we are transferring powers from the Department of Justice to an independent non-statutory body, I have a bee in my bonnet about this because we, as legislators, are forever giving powers to independent bodies that should belong to Government and both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I wonder are we doing the right thing.  If you have a complaint about planning you go to An Bord Pleanála; if you have a complaint about Revenue, you have to go to the <Col N="667" /> Revenue Commissioners because the Minister for Finance has no say in the matter.  If you want a national primary route to be built, as I do in Cavan-Monaghan, the Minister has no say in the matter and you have to go to the National Roads Authority.  Every day of the week it seems that we pass power from elected representatives to unelected and unidentified individuals who operate behind closed doors.  I am seriously concerned about this because the politicians take the flak for what is wrong with the country but the reality is that we have very little say in what is happening.</P>
    <P>How often do we address a particular problem by passing it on to somebody else?  It may well save the day in the short term but it creates problems down the line with which I am not at all happy.  I want that on the record because I feel very strongly about it.  There is no point in decent people entering politics to try to do something for the country when it seems they could achieve more by being appointed to some board where they have all the power they want and are not answerable to anybody.  If there are problems in the Department of Justice we will not solve them by passing them on to somebody else.  These problems must be addressed at departmental level.  The Department must operate effectively, regardless of what are its powers.</P>
    <P>The legislation before the House today is very practical.  I see no problem in any measures that would release gardaí from tedious court appearances and allow them to get on with the job, that is, to create a peaceful and safe society for our citizens.  They should not to have to endure sitting in courts throughout the length and breadth of this country day after day, doing nothing but swearing on evidence that they arrested the individual before the judge.  That is a waste of valuable time when there is so much more they could be doing.  This legislation, which hopes to resolve many of these issues, is more than welcome.  It will definitely improve efficiency in the court system and it will enable many gardaí to spend more time detecting and investigating crime, to be more available to the public and to be seen on the street rather than asking them to attend court day after day.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the new system of written certificates to evidence the garda's arrest, charge and caution of the individual.  That is a very practical solution to a very difficult problem. The extension of the period of remand to a maximum of 15 days is another practical solution to the problem of the arrested person and the gardaí who arrested him or her having to attend court every eight days.  This was not necessary and the extension of the period of remand does not offend justice.</P>
    <P>There should surely be a greater concern in relation to other aspects of the bail laws than those currently receiving public attention.  We do not seem to have a maximum period on detention prior to trial under the current and proposed <Col N="668" /> legislation.  What is proposed is very small fry in terms of being remanded in custody for a period of up to 15 days before being brought before a judge.  I have no difficulty with that as much more serious issues are at stake.</P>
    <P>The other practical proposals in this Bill relate to search warrants.  It is clear that gardaí often had difficulty with the technicalities of obtaining a search warrant in terms of the type of offences they were hoping to detect.  Since that was often challenged in court at a subsequent date, it is sensible that the legislation should give the gardaí comprehensive powers of search in relation to all serious offences including, among others, as the Minister stated, serious bodily harm, kidnapping and rape.</P>
    <P>Measures relating to the powers of the DPP will probably require further amendment.  I am not sure what might be entailed but at least something is being done in relation to the requirement that the DPP should give his consent for the summary trial of indictable offences.  This is a serious matter and it should not rest with the individual, perhaps through ignorance of the system, to accept a summary trial when he or she is entitled to a full hearing.  It is important that justice is not only done but is seen to be done and that this matter be referred to the DPP on every occasion.  I have no difficulty with that.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very practical and strengthens the capacity of the gardaí to respond to serious crime. Anybody who visits the courts, especially in this city, knows only too well that you often see more gardaí than civilians in court because of the system in place.  One problem I am aware of is the requirement to bring the accused back to the court of original arrest from remand.  As remand prisoners are usually held in Mountjoy, this involves a day trip for the arrested individual as well as a number of gardaí and serves no element of justice whatsoever.  It is simply an old procedural rule.</P>
    <P>The new provision is beneficial because it will allow the accused person to be brought before the nearest District Court pending trial at which stage he or she will be brought to trial at the court in the district in which the offence occurred.  The possible downside of that provision is that the courts in the metropolitan District Court area may be further inundated with remand appearances which may cause difficulty in terms of the practical administration of the courts in Dublin.  I wonder how that will work.</P>
    <P>I hope to get clarification from the Minister on section 14 of the Bill which deals with the definition of sexual offences.  What is its purpose? This is not specified.  It deals with some reforms, I presume in relation to definition, but I do not know what they are.  I hope this is an expansion of the definition in terms of bringing together the various criminal laws to make it easier to determine where such an offence has occurred so that charges do not fall on technicalities.</P>
    <P>We, as legislators, sometimes deal with a public that does not understand the system; this causes <Col N="669" /> me concern.  However, it is not a problem in relation to this Bill.  We are dealing with practical elements that will speed up the administration of justice and allow the Garda to be more effective.</P>
    <P>The public often seems to think that the Government is doing nothing or that the system is radically faulty.  At the same time, we have brought in a proposal to change the bail laws; I believe people think the new bail laws will solve all crime.  In the region of 9 per cent of crimes are committed by those on bail and the public should understand that this measure can reduce crime by that percentage.</P>
    <P>It is important for efforts to be made to inform the public about existing legislation.  In the last number of years we have brought in a wealth of criminal justice legislation which has tackled crime in a very effective way.  Until the public becomes aware of what has been done in this area people will labour under the misguided and misconceived notion that the system is very faulty, which is not the case.  We have made many efforts to tidy up the system and to update what was a very old system of justice in order to deal with the realities of crime today.</P>

    <P>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>(2) In carrying out the functions conferred by this Act, the Director shall at all times have regard to:</P>
      <P>(a)  the need for Ireland to have an advanced telecommunications system which is competitive internationally in terms of price, availability, range of features and quality;</P>
      <P>(b)  the need to regard the satisfaction of the interests of customers as the ultimate objective in providing and maintaining a telecommunications system;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  the need to ensure the maximum practicable level of competition in the provision of telecommunications services, consistent with the objectives of (a) and (b) of this subsection, and in particular to identify, prohibit and penalise any actions by any telecommunications provider which in the opinion of the Director might have the <Col N="670" /> effect of raising unreasonably the cost of entry to the market by any potential competitor;</P>
    <P>(d)  the need to ensure fairness as between the providers or potential providers of telecommunications services, and in particular to identify, prohibit, and penalise any actions by any telecommunications provider which in the opinion of the Director may constitute the abuse of a dominant position;</P>
    <P>(e)  the need to provide for an arrangement under which all providers of telecommunications services contribute financially to the maintenance of the universal service obligation by the national telecommunications system overall, and for the Director to revise from time to time the definition of universal service obligation having regard to the national requirement for an advanced telecommunications system.</P>
    <P>(f)  the need to ensure, in the interest of facilitating rural development, that no part of the country is disadvantaged competitively by virtue of its location, and in particular to ensure that the universal service obligation is progressively extended to include an uniform tariff countrywide, and</P>
    <P>(g)  the need to ensure that &ldquo;access to customers by both traditional telephone lines and cable systems is open to all licensed telecommunications providers at prices which the Director deems to be fair.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a comprehensive amendment.  Despite the harmless sounding Title to the Bill, this very important and path finding legislation will create a watershed in the history of Irish telecommunications. At present, the Minister and the Department control and regulate a vital sector of our infrastructure.  Now, however, very important powers are to be transferred to an independent regulator who will need to operate within a broad policy framework.</P>
    <P>If the regulator is to be genuinely independent as the Bill requires, he cannot rely on either the Minister or his Department to provide a policy framework.  Equally, we cannot expect the regulator to make up policy as he goes along because this would put an inappropriate burden on him.  If he is to have any credibility the legislation establishing his office must set out the broad parameters within which he is to work.  The amendment seeks to do this.</P>
    <P>We are ploughing new ground here.  We are used to dealing with legislation which gives the Minister powers of one kind or another.  In such cases we do not have to include a policy framework in legislation because that is for Ministers and it is a role they value highly.  We are also used to legislation providing for the <Col N="671" /> establishment of semi-State bodies.  Here again it is sufficient only to set out the powers in legislation because the policy framework is provided by the sponsoring Department.</P>
    <P>However, an independent regulator is different.  It is not his job, as it is the Minister's, to make policy.  However, because he is meant to be independent he cannot rely on the sponsoring Department.  Unless the legislation provides the policy framework we are asking the regulator to proceed without guidance.  This would be very unwise.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that we control the regulator's every move, rather I propose a broad policy framework within which he would have freedom of action.  This is what the amendment seeks to do.  It contains seven strands.  The first sets an overall national objective within which the regulation is to take place.  It is &ldquo;the need for Ireland to have an advanced telecommunications system which is competitive internationally in terms of price, availability, range of features and quality&rdquo;.  This makes it clear that the overall objective is to make Ireland competitive in telecommunications and also to make clear that &ldquo;competitive&rdquo; means more than just competing on price.</P>
    <P>The second strand introduces the customer.  It makes clear to the regulator that, ultimately, the regulation must be in the interests of the telecommunications customer, not the provider or the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  The legislation should tell the regulator that his boss is the customer, not the Minister or the shareholders of Telecom Éireann's companies.  The customer's interests must be paramount first, last and always.  This is the only way for Ireland to get the best telecommunications system, one that is run by the market itself.  We must make the system customer driven because in the past it has been bureaucracy and technology driven.  The regulator must be told this, but this is not, and will not be set out in the Bill, unless this amendment is accepted.</P>
    <P>The third strand is about competition, which is the driving force for the changes in telecommunications.  We must establish the principle that competition is good in itself and part of the regulator's role should be to actively encourage this.  He should be given the responsibility of ensuring that existing players in the marketplace do not seek to restrict the amount of competition by making the cost of anything to part of that market so high that it will scare people off.  This is a time honoured way of restricting competitive activity.  For example, artificially low prices can be offered so competition is not worthwhile.  This part of the amendment will ensure that new entrants come into the marketplace.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> Paragraph (d) of the amendment deals with the relationship between the players already in the marketplace.  My aim is to establish the principle of fairness between competitors as the bedrock of the regulatory policy.  This should be spelled out in the legislation.  For over 70 years, Departments have regulated sectors in the interests of the semi-State companies under their aegis.  Given that this must change, there is no point having a regulator because he must treat all competitors equally, regardless of whether they are State owned.  He must be able to penalise competitors, State owned or otherwise, which seek to abuse a dominant position.  The monopolist culture dies hard and State or quasi monopolies often play very dirty when it comes to competing in the marketplace.  The regulator's purpose is to stop that for good.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) relates to the universal service obligation.  Telecom Éireann has such an obligation; it must provide a service to everybody, wherever they live.  It is a vital national interest that this universal service be maintained in the free market environment.  There is a great danger in that regard if this is not spelled out in the legislation.  However, it would be impractical to demand each provider to deliver it.  My amendment suggests that each provider should contribute to the cost of the universal service obligation although only one may use it.  This would address the cherry picking problem but still open the marketplace to competitive forces.</P>
    <P>It is also important to realise that it may be necessary to change the definition of universal service in the future.  At present there is considerable pressure from the telecommunications providers for the notion that the obligation only applies to what they call simple dial tone and not to more sophisticated forms of telecommunications services, such as ISDF.  By giving the regulator the power to define the obligation and redefine it as necessary, and by imposing on him the overall obligation to put the customer first, the universal service obligation will be protected in the future.  It would be disastrous if the concept of universal access to telecommunications services was diluted as the telecommunications industry becomes more sophisticated.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (f) addresses this vital regional issue head on.  Anybody with an interest in rural development understands the importance of this matter in terms of the revolution in telecommunications.  The industrial revolution resulted in the flight of people from the land towards cities and large towns where business and work were available.  In recent years, various incentives have been given to coax industry away from urban areas but, as a nation, we have not been successful in that regard.  The telecommunications revolution offers the possibility of arresting the drift from the land and perhaps even reversing it because sophisticated <Col N="673" /> telecommunications can make location an irrelevant factor in business.</P>
    <P>It is possible for a wide range of services &mdash; the sector where jobs will be created in the future &mdash; to be provided from afar.  It is not necessary for them to be in the same room.  This provides a potential opportunity to reverse the current balance of advantage between urban and rural areas, but the snag is that this vast potential could be completely destroyed by pricing which handicaps rural areas.  The objective should be to have a uniform tariff nationwide and this should be set out in the Bill.  There are already uniform tariffs for mobile telephones and access to the Internet.  An objective for total uniformity across all telecommunications services, perhaps to be achieved progressively, should be set.  If we are serious about rural development, this simple policy direction will create jobs in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (g) relates to the cable system, to which insufficient attention has been given.  There has been much talk recently about who should own Cablelink.  Many people say Telecom Éireann should sell it to somebody who will use it to offer competing telecommunications services. However, that is not the real issue.  The key national issue is the same whether Telecom Éireann continues to hold Cablelink or is forced by the EU to divest itself of it.  Will different providers be able to compete in cable?  Under the current liberalisation, the local loop to customers' houses, which is owned by a telephone supplier, must be opened to all competitors who can but access at fair rates.  Cable should be treated in exactly the same way.</P>
    <P>No matter who owns it, cable should be a highway that it is open to anybody who is prepared to pay for it.  The price should be set by the regulator.  It would be bad for the country to take Cablelink away from one monopoly provider and give it to another.  It should be opened to competition.  This is particularly important because cable offers new technical possibilities which old fashioned telephone lines cannot provide.  Within the next few years, probably within the next ten, cable will become the predominent means of delivering telecommunications services in urban areas.  In addition, telephone lines will, in effect, be practically obsolete.  If this happens, the cable franchise will become intensely valuable &mdash; much too valuable to restrict it to only one player.  We can ensure that the future thrust of policy is in the correct direction if my amendment is accepted. I commend the amendment to the House.  I am not wedded to a particular form of words and I will not press the amendment if the Minister is prepared to take my ideas on board and introduce amendments on Report Stage which will satisfy my deep problems with this matter. The amendment is necessary and I look forward <Col N="674" /> to hearing the Minister's view.  I may not have used the correct form of words or put it in the right place but nobody, including the Minister, will disagree with the amendment's objectives.  I am anxious these matters are included in the Bill during Committee Stage.  However, if that is not possible, I am anxious the Minister returns to them on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  Senator Quinn's contribution provided food for thought and I agree that this area must be customer driven in the long-term because, ultimately, this is where major success lies.  The part of the amendment which deals with rural renewal is of particular interest to me.  Urban renewal has done much in a short time.  This scheme was agreed and implemented by all parties in power in recent years and it has transformed parts of cities and towns.  The good it has done in terms of long-term employment and investment is beyond belief. Investors would not have invested in such parts of towns and cities had there not been tax incentives.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn correctly referred to the bias against those operating businesses in Mullingar or Longford as opposed to the capital city in terms of telephone charges.  All parties support rural renewal but cost is a major problem.  The success of businesses in rural areas keeps overheads down.  However, one of the biggest overheads today is communications and there is an enormous difference in telephone charges.  I, and the Minister of State who comes from the midlands, fully support&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is unfair that people living in rural areas do not have the same opportunities as those in Dublin, Cork or Galway.  The world has become a global village in terms of communications.  In the marketing world, with which Senator-Quinn would be familiar, goods are marketed through the medium of television. If a person has a telephone, fax and other necessary equipment, they can run an office from their home in a rural area.  People can make a living and rear their families in rural areas because it is cheaper to operate from one's home than from an expensive office in a city.  There are enormous opportunities for the self-employed to create employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> The day has come for a uniform telephone charge to be introduced.  Because the economy is so buoyant, we should encourage the Government to introduce this immediately.  The time has never been more favourable to do so.  I concur with Senator Quinn's proposals on opening up the cable area and I support his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Quinn's amendment.  It is important to establish broad parameters in the legislation as it is the only way this can be done in an ordered manner.  The objectives Senator Quinn outlined in his amendment are ones to which I subscribe.  It is reasonable that the director should be guided by the legislation because we are making a distinction between somebody who is independent and somebody who is under the &ldquo;control&rdquo; of the Department.  That independence must be circumscribed by certain broad policy parameters and this is a good place to insert them because it removes any room for ambiguity.</P>
      <P>Subparagraph (f) of the amendment, which struck a cord with me, states:</P>
      <P>... in the interest of facilitating rural development, that no part of the country is disadvantaged competitively by virtue of its location, and in particular to ensure that the universal service obligation is progressively extended to include an uniform tariff countrywide, and</P>
      <P>That is something to which the Minister of State, as a socialist, should readily subscribe.  Looking at the history of the State and the public services which have been put in place, for example, the ESB or the transport services, we can see that one of the greatest achievements of those services was that they did not disadvantage people living in remote areas.  Services were provided to those people on an equal basis to those living in the city.  That is important because one of the factors of rural depopulation is that people are required to pay more for doctors, veterinarians or groceries by virtue of their location.</P>
      <P>The State has an obligation to ensure equity so that people are not at a disadvantage.  That is the intention of this subparagraph and it is something to which I subscribe.  The amendment also deals with the need for competition in the system.  For those reasons and others, I support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Quinn on opening up this debate.  I am sure the Minister of State will welcome the opportunity to respond to the points raised by Senator Quinn's comprehensive amendment.  The discussion in the other House on this issue tended not to stimulate debate in this area, which is surprising.  This is innovative legislation in that it establishes the office of director of telecommunications <Col N="676" /> regulation which will regulate one of the most revolutionary developments we face.  That may sound like a cliché, but we are on the information super highway and moving at a fast rate.  Things are happening so fast that we, as legislators, must ensure the checks and balances to which Senator Quinn refers are put in place.</P>
      <P>This is not a multi-million pound industry, but a billion pound one &mdash; we are talking monopoly money.  The players at international level are so huge that their turnover exceeds our GDP.  In that context, I welcome Senator Quinn raising these issues.  I am not sure if the Bill will be able to accommodate everything he requires, but Fianna Fáil supports the thrust of the amendment.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister's view on a uniform tariff.  While this was dealt with adequately by Senator Cassidy and Senator Dardis, I would like to add another dimension to this proposal.  My sympathies lie not only with those in business in the midlands but with those on the periphery, on they islands, and those attempting to establish businesses and industries in economically depressed regions.</P>
      <P>There is no question whatsoever that the high cost of telecommunications is a contributing factor.  I do not wish to over emphasise or exaggerate its importance but it is definitely a contributing factor when decisions are being taken on where businesses should locate.  I am sure the Government, irrespective of its political colour, will wish to ensure there is the broadest possible spread of industrial development across the country.  Anything that inhibits that development should be addressed as a matter of Government policy.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Quinn, I do not anticipate that this initiative will be introduced tomorrow but in the context of the policy directions which the Minister will be placing before the new director, it should be fundamental public policy.  There should be an aspiration towards accelerated development of uniform charges.</P>
      <P>The other area of particular interest is that of opening telephone lines and cable systems to all licensed telecommunications providers.  Will the Minister of State indicate in his reply the remaining period of the MMDS franchises?  This question arose in the debate on Committee Stage in the Lower House but the Minister was unable to provide the information then.  He said, quite correctly in my view, that other channels were open to Deputies if they wished to table parliamentary questions.  I am not sure if parliamentary questions were tabled in the Lower House nor am I sure whether the Minister was able to inform himself about the remaining franchise periods.  While this does not have a direct bearing on section 3, it does have a certain bearing on section 4 so I am signalling my intent in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="677" /> My reason for raising this issue is that we have moved beyond optic cables as they are currently operated and are now dealing with fibre optics. This has occurred in my home town of Drumshanbo in County Leitrim and is a microcosm of what is happening across the country.  Telecom Éireann installed a fibre optic line system from Carrick-on-Shannon into Drumshanbo which will continue north towards Donegal.  In effect, that means that if Drumshanbo was able to host the Eurovision Song Contest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was including the local hostelries in the infrastructural aspect of the question.</P>
      <P>This confirms the point that Senator Quinn made concerning developments in this area.  This is a small town in the north west where if any major event occurred that required modern technology, be it a visit by the President of the United States&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or even a visit by the Minister of State, a media crew could swiftly access its home base using modems, laptops or other systems.  That is an example of where we are currently.  Small town Ireland can now communicate with the world.</P>
      <P>In that respect, there should be some debate within Government on subparagraph (g).  This an opportunity for the Minister of State to give us an indication of Government thinking on what will happen.  For example, our near neighbours in the United Kingdom have already enunciated a policy on digital broadcasting and the use of fibre optic developments there.  Technologically, Britain is behind us in terms of telecommunications and, strangely enough, it is trying to catch up because we have jumped the technological divide.</P>

    <P>We were so far behind a decade ago that we jumped the existing mechanisms and went straight for state of the art technology.  Therefore, in some cases we are ahead, yet we do not have a public policy on how we will cope with all these technological innovations.  Senator Quinn has provided a valuable public service in tabling these amendments so that a debate can be stimulated <Col N="678" /> in this area.  Like him, I am anxious to hear how the Minister of State views these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  Senator Quinn has proposed a detailed and extensive amendment to section 3 of the Bill which sets out provisions applying to the functions of the director.  The Senator's amendment proposes to set down parameters for the director in carrying out his or her functions. I welcome the opportunity to spell out in detail Government thinking on the development of the regulatory structure and policies.  These are of immediate concern to the telecommunications sector but are also critical to the development of other areas of the transport, energy and communications portfolio.</P>
      <P>I remind Senators of the purpose of section 3 of the Bill.  At present the telecommunications functions of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications include: overall policy and development of the telecommunications sector; shareholder functions in relation to Telecom Éireann and regulatory functions.  The Minister is currently defined as the national regulatory authority for the purposes of EU and national law.  The Minister will retain overall responsibility for telecommunications policy and shareholder functions in Telecom Éireann under the proposals contained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The functions of the director of telecommunications regulation will be those created by this section of the Bill, those transferred from the Minister under section 4, and additional functions which the Minister may confer on the director in future as may be appropriate.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to provide a clear statement of the director's functions, allow for a smooth transition in the hand over of functions from the Minister to the director, give scope to the Minister to transfer other functions to the director as long as these are incidental to the functions transferred in the Bill and provide a clear framework of responsibilities for making radio frequency plans by the director.</P>
      <P>I recognise the desirability of Senator Quinn's proposals in the development of a medium to long-term framework for regulation generally. Notwithstanding this, some of them require further development.  For example, there needs in particular to be a clear distinction between what is meant by policy functions which are being retained by the Minister and the regulatory functions which are being transferred to the director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to draw attention to the emerging regulatory framework for telecommunications at EU level.  This has major implications for our domestic policy and legislation.  The purpose of establishing an independent regulator and conferring the regulatory functions of the <Col N="679" /> Minister on that office is to give effect to EU directives with respect to the development of independent regulatory arrangements, and the Government's stated objectives for telecommunications regulations in the short-term.</P>
    <P>Given the detail of the amendment, I want to address the proposals on a point by point basis.  I will also try to cover the points made by other Senators.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (a) of the amendment would provide that the director should have regard for the need for Ireland to have an advanced telecommunications system.  Nobody has any argument with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is accepting that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for Ireland to have an advanced telecommunications system is a matter of Government policy and more specifically the responsibility of the Minister.  In setting up an independent regulator for the sector the Minister is retaining responsibility for the overall development of the sector.  The Bill transfers the Minister's regulatory functions to the director and thereby separates these regulatory functions from his shareholding and sectoral policy functions. The director's duty will be to carry out fairly the functions set out in the Bill and in the enactments listed in the Second Schedule.</P>
      <P>My point is not that the paragraph is unacceptable in itself; I believe the definition of policy to be contained in legislation must be more extensive, allow for a more dynamic evolution of policy, if at all possible be consistent with cross-sectoral considerations and must, in the interests of the independence of the office of the regulator, be seen to be separate from the exercise of his or her functions.  The place for the definition of the policy regulatory interface should be the legislation dealing with the establishment of a multi-sectoral regulator which has been announced by the Government and is at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subparagraph (b) of the proposed amendment provides that the director should have regard to the interests of customers in carrying out his or her functions.  This provision creates problems for a number of reasons.  First, the interests of telecommunications customers are pursued both by the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Ombudsman whose remit extends to this sector. In the longer term, it is important that in defining the role of the regulator in a multi-sectoral framework, the relationship with both of these bodies will be defined in substantial detail. Second, growing competition in the sector will benefit the customer by ensuring that service providers supply services which meet customers' needs at the highest quality and lowest cost they are in a position to provide.  In a competitive <Col N="680" /> situation, companies that fail to satisfy customers' needs will not prosper.  The role of the regulator is to ensure that there is fair competition, thereby ensuring the interests of the customer.  Third, the amendment proposes to put an obligation on the director to have regard to divergent customer interests which apply across the sector.  There are different levels of customer and different customers have different interests.  There is a balance to be struck and the proposed subparagraph may not represent the best approach for dealing with the issue at this stage.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (c) seeks to ensure that telecommunications providers do not thwart emerging competition.  This matter is addressed in existing and emerging EU law and in existing Irish competition law.  Where EU law already addresses this issue, the relevant functions are being transferred to the director in the Schedule to the Bill.  For example, existing EU law provides that tariffs charged by dominant players in telecommunications markets for leased lines must be cost orientated and based on a proven cost accounting system.  The responsibility for this currently lies with the Minister but it will be transferred to the director under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Where proposed EU law addresses this issue, in the process of transposing that law into national legislation, appropriate powers will be conferred on the director to monitor and enforce fair pricing.  At present, there is a draft directive on interconnection and a further draft directive amending the voice telephony directive.  When these are transposed into national law, the relevant function of monitoring charges for interconnection and other telecommunications services will be conferred on the director.  It is clear, therefore, that the director will have sufficient powers to ensure prices are reasonably related to costs but by the means I have already set out and by means of the price cap order which is provided for in section 7.</P>
    <P>The Senator's proposed subparagraph (c) addresses the same issues, so while I sympathise with the general thrust of the amendment, I am convinced this Bill is not the appropriate place for such wording.  It is a matter more appropriate for statutory instruments transposing EU law and further telecommunications legislation which will be introduced next year.  In addition, I am concerned that the wording suggested might conflict with existing competition law and the functions of the Competition Authority in enforcing that law.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (d) of the Senator's proposed amendment raises many of the same issues as paragraph 3, so my comments on that paragraph apply here also.  Existing and emerging EU law addresses the issue of potential abuses of dominant position.  For example, that law obliges dominant operators to make services available to competitors on a non-discriminatory basis and to <Col N="681" /> enter into certain arrangements with competitors, in other words, third party access.  Any necessary authority to give effect to these provisions will be conferred on the director when these directives are transposed into Irish law.  I am also concerned that the suggested wording in this subparagraph might conflict with existing competition law and the functions of the Competition Authority in enforcing that law.  The director will have sufficient powers and duties to deal with the concerns expressed by the Senator.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (e) of the proposed amendment seeks to empower the director to establish a universal service funding arrangement and to redefine the universal service obligation from time to time.  It is intended that telecommunications service providers will contribute to a universal service fund to meet the net costs of making a defined minimum set of telecommunications services available at all points in the State.  Draft EU legislation deals with this issue.  The appropriate powers and functions will be granted to the director when that legislation is transposed into national law.  I agree with Senator Quinn that the scope of the universal service obligation is of vital importance. However, this is a policy decision and is recognised as such in emerging EU legislation.  It should remain the responsibility of the Minister and the Government to set and redefine it.  The powers and functions being transferred to the director are regulatory in nature and not policy ones.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (f) of the amendment provides that the director should have regard to the interests of rural development and that the universal service obligation should be extended as necessary in this context.  While it is a worthy objective, I am concerned about the rationale behind it and I argue it is not appropriate at this time.  This proposal suggests an interventionist regime for the director.  It is not intended that this would be the case.  An element of flexibility will be afforded to service providers in relation to tariffs while ensuring the maintenance of the principle of universal service.  The tariffs which service providers will charge for services, which are subject to competition and where there is no dominant operator, will not be subject to price control.  For those services which have no competition or where there is a dominant operator, a price cap will apply which will ensure a reduction in tariffs while, at the same time, providing some flexibility to the service provider.</P>
    <P>The first price cap order will be made by the Minister rather than the director and it will specify an adjustment factor of 6 per cent.  This means Telecom Éireann's prices will fall by at least 6 per cent each year for the period of the price cap.  Over the five year period of the price cap, Telecom Éireann's prices will be forced to fall by a minimum of 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> As regards universal service, it is the Government's policy that the principle of universal service should be maintained, developed and expanded, where practical, as competition increases and technology changes. The necessary legislative provisions for this will be laid down in further legislation next year and will incorporate EU requirements.  The Director will monitor the extent to which the universal service obligation is being met and the cost of doing so.  The director will also review from time to time the definition of universal service obligation, having regard to Government and EU policy, and make changes where necessary in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The Government has reaffirmed its strong commitment to ensuring that the public and businesses have access to voice telephony and leased line services at reasonable rates and that free access to emergency call services is readily available throughout Ireland.  Public pay telephones should continue to be widely distributed.  The key question is what will drive tariffs towards a uniform national rate faster? Will it be the universal service obligation or competition?  My view is that it will be competition.  We should not permit ourselves to hang too many policy objectives on the universal service obligation because this has been shown to have longer-term negative competitive implications. The universal service is and will continue to be is central to Irish telecommunications policy, but so is competition.  The emerging EU framework on competition directives will define how far national Administrations can go in developing the universal service concept in a competitive framework.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (g) of this amendment provides that the director should have regard to the need for fair access pricing by service providers to existing Telecom Éireann networks.  As competition develops, there will be a need for fair access by service providers to the networks of their competitors.  The Minister's responsibilities in respect of leased lines are being fully transferred by the Bill.  More importantly, the draft interconnect directive, currently under discussion at EU level, will define the future responsibilities of the national regulatory authorities with respect to interconnect generally. These requirements will be speedily transposed into Irish law when the EU directive comes into force.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issues raised by this comprehensive amendment.  The Senator's proposals are either in the course of or have been adopted in emerging EU legislation.  In the Irish context, the broad thrust of the argument is both relevant and valuable in terms of the development of this sectoral policy. However, it belongs in legislation which will establish a multi-sectoral regulatory structure <Col N="683" /> early next year, in the comprehensive telecommunications legislation which will be prepared next year and in the statutory instruments which will transpose EU rules on the competitive framework for telecommunications.</P>
    <P>While I cannot accept the amendments proposed, the Government is committed to the bulk of their content as will be seen in the statement on regulatory principles for telecommunications issued last January.  I am also prepared to commit the Government to taking on board the broad thrust of the amendment in the development of the legislation referred to.  I regret taking so long to reply but it was a comprehensive and detailed amendment and merited such a reply.  I will deal with the points raised by other Senators as briefly as possible.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators asked about Cablelink. The Government is committed to the accelerated development of Cablelink into a multimedia platform open to other service providers.  The two principles are accelerated development and a multi-user framework where all would have the right to use the cables for a fee.  The Government has agreed to this and will implement the substance of Senator Quinn's amendment in the context of the strategic alliance with Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>I have some information on the effect of a universal charge for telephone services which demonstrates the difficulty of implementing it as quickly as we would like.  There are two broad options.  One is to impose local call charges for all calls but the problem is it would cost £2.1 million per week.  The effect would be that Telecom Éireann would be broke and its competition would complain of below cost selling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The alternative is to impose the first option together with a new charge to retain Telecom Éireann's revenues.  That would lead to a 40 per cent increase in local call charges. Competitors could not compete on trunk calls because of Telecom Éireann subsidising such calls from local calls and new competitors on local calls would eventually erode Telecom Éireann's revenues.  The new competition regime will, over time, bring in competitors who will provide services from Galway, Kerry and Donegal, for example, to anywhere else in the country and this will force down prices so that there may well be, in effect, a universal tariff.  That is the best way forward.  The immediate consequences of applying a universal charge can be seen.  The capping of prices will reduce them generally by a minimum of 30 per cent over the next five year period.  That is a minimum and competition may well force that down further.  The six per cent per <Col N="684" /> annum reduction over a five year period may also have that desired effect.</P>
      <P>The duration of MMDS licences varies between licensees and the information on that was given to the Deputy who sought it in the Dáil. I do not have the information with me today but I will provide it to the Senator.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn complained that the director did not have a map but I say he has a very detailed one.  We are taking functions from the Minister and giving them to the director who will operate independently.  We are also creating some new functions for him which are clearly defined.  He has a clear map and must operate within it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed answer.  The Bill does not give the director a map, but it is promised in legislation he proposes to introduce next year.  However, the Minister told us this was promised last January.  That worries me because, it is now November and it sounds very like other cases where Bills were promised and have not yet been seen and I have been a Member of this House for almost four years.  I do not believe it is good enough to expect us to accept a promise made last January which is now being made for the new year.  The Minister said last January that it would be introduced very soon.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1. states:</P>
      <P>(2) In carrying out the functions conferred by this Act, the Director shall at all times have regard to:</P>
      <P>(a) the need for Ireland to have an advanced telecommunications system which is competitive internationally in terms of price, availability, range of features and quality;</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he has no argument with this.  If that is so, I do not understand why it cannot be written into the Bill.  The Minister said it will be in the legislation next year but it should be in this legislation because it will do no harm and no one disagrees with it.</P>
      <P>Subparagraph (b) of the amendment concerns the customer.  This makes it clear that, in the final anaysis, the regulator is acting in the interests of the customer rather than telecom providers.  We have been discussing fairness and independence with which I agree entirely.  I have no problem with the regulator being independent and fair. What I suggest in this amendment is fully in line with the thrust of the Strategic Management Initiative introduced by the Government some months ago and also with recent ministerial policy.  It is necessary to state it explicitly in view of the anti-customer activity by various organisations in the telecom area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have come from a culture where the number of telephones we could have was <Col N="685" /> rationed.  We were grateful when someone used their influence to get us a telephone.  I am sure no one in this House would have ever done anything like that.  We were used to being rationed and did not actively think of the customer as the person who created the demand. We must change our attitude and, if we are to do so, we must spell it out.  If we say we want an independent regulator who will be fair to the various providers concerned and do not mention the customer, then we are not acting in our best interests.</P>
    <P>That is close to the substance of subparagraph (c) of this amendment.  It establishes the principle that competition between telecom providers is a good thing.  It is recognised as the principal mechanism of change.  The regulator should act as a midwife helping the birth of new competitors. However, he or she must do more than that.  For example, the regulator should ensure fairness between two competitors, just as a referee does in a boxing match although it might be like a Thai boxing match with two or three in the ring.  The regulator should not only be fair to those in the ring but should be proactive in seeking other competitors.  If this element can be incorporated, we will have a healthier telecommunications industry acting in the interests of the customer.</P>
    <P>We all grew up with a State-owned airline of which we were proud.  Britain had a state-owned airline of which they were proud.  We wanted to protect our airline and ensure we were acting in its best interests and the British wanted to do the same.  We came to an agreement with the British that there would be a British Airways flight and an Aer Lingus flight between Dublin and London and that there would be competition between them on that route.  For many years that was the only competition and, if I remember correctly, the fare was £239.  Then it was decided to allow greater competition.  Peter Sutherland must take the credit for doing this in Europe.  We now have competition between British Midland, Ryanair, Cityjet, etc.  I heard on the radio this morning that, last week, Ryanair had a very successful campaign where they sold thousands of tickets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 80,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They sold 80,000 tickets at £39 each.  We all believed ten years ago we were acting in the best interests of the State and the taxpayer because we ensured Aer Lingus made money.  British Airways ensured they made money for their taxpayers also.  Looking at what happened, we were not acting in the interests of the customer.  Aer Lingus is now successfully competing with others on the Dublin-London route, in the interests of the customer and the taxpayers who are shareholders in Aer Lingus. That is an example of the importance of the customer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I worry when the Minister says he will cater for the customer in legislation promised last January <Col N="686" /> which will be introduced next year.  I do not believe we can take that as a promise.  The Minister must accept this House has difficulty with any promised legislation which is dependent on the passing of this Bill.  This is not acceptable and is not in the customer's interest.  The Minister has already said he has no argument with subparagraph (a) so I assume he accepts the principle of it.</P>
    <P>We should not allow the Bill pass through this House, particularly after the Government's Strategic Management Initiative, if the customer has not been mentioned but will be in promised legislation.  The proactive encouragement of competition rather than just relying on fairness is also important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister began by saying he recognised the desirability of the proposed amendment.  He then gave reasons for stating it could not be done.  There seems to be inconsistency.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (7) (b) states that the director must:</P>
      <P>... comply with decisions made by the Minister and specified to be necessary to enable the State to discharge its obligations as a member of an international organisation or as a party to an international agreement.</P>
      <P>Why do we need further legislation to deal with EU law?  Under that section, we agree to be subject to EU provisions and it would be inconsistent for the legislation to be other than in accord with them.</P>
      <P>As regards the Ombudsman and the Competition Authority having certain functions, I do not see why we cannot confer duties and obligations on the director which will allow him to exercise discretion as far as competition or dominance is concerned.  That is not inconsistent with having a Competition Authority or Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>The question of the customer is a central part of Senator Quinn's amendment.  It is now becoming apparent that the telecommunications industry will be the last vestige where the customer will not be king.  Agriculture has made that transition as a result of BSE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I have consistently said in this House that it is long overdue.  In 1994 I put down an amendment to the An Bord Bia Bill, asking that a consumer be put on the board.  This was not supported.  I do not have to defend my record in that respect.  Will this be the last place where the interest of the customer is not the most apparent and dominant one?  Will we go back to creating State agencies that are there to serve themselves?  I am not suggesting that is the <Col N="687" /> intention behind the Bill.  The amendment is reasonable and should be accepted.  It is important that the customer's right be recognised, which is consistent with the right of the person who is living at a remove in a rural area.</P>
      <P>Under subparagraph (d) of the proposed amendment the director may ensure fairness between providers, etc., and penalise any actions by any telecommunications provider which, in the opinion of the director, may constitute the abuse of a dominant position.  I do not see anything wrong with conferring this power on the director. Why it is necessary to involve the Competition Authority or the Ombudsman?  We frequently implement legislation which impinges on other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the responses to it, my first statement must have been confusing.  Neither Senator has taken on board anything I said.  They blithely ignored and confused what I said.  For example, I did not say, and I am not saying now, that the required policy to have the best telecommunications service in Ireland should await other legislation.  What I am saying is that everybody says that.  This is clearly stated in Government policy and there is no need to include it in the Bill.  Bills are for implementing policy, not stating it.  We have legislation to implement policy.</P>
      <P>A clear map of functions is set out for the director.  It is not dependent on legislation next year or in future years.  It is contained in existing EU and Irish law as it now applies to the Minister and as it is formulated in this Bill.  The Senator constantly confuses the role of the Minister, whose remaining responsibility will be policy, and that of the director.  He seems to want to transfer all the powers the Minister has at present as a shareholder, regulator and policymaker to the director.  The director is a regulator, not a policymaker.  This country still elects people to formulate policy.  I do not propose, and the Senators should not propose, that we remove the policy making role from the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what they are suggesting. The effect of Senator Dardis' suggestion would be to give this huge policy role to a regulator.  The director's job is to regulate, not to make policy; our job is to formulate policy for the regulator. Are Senators suggesting that we should tie the hands of policymakers by stating the policy in the Bill &mdash; effectively writing it in stone &mdash; or are they saying we should instruct the director as policy evolves?  I am saying the latter and it is something with which the Senators would agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion that we are anti-customer because the customer's name is not up in lights, as it were, is nonsense.  The thrust of the legislation is to take power away from a monopoly and to create competition in the <Col N="688" /> interests of the customer, not in the interests of the providers.</P>

The purpose of EU law is to ensure the customer gets a better deal.  We have seen that in the airline business, as Senators have described, and in other areas.</P>
      <P>The House should be conscious that this legislation represents the biggest shift in power in this country probably since the war.  We are proposing to introduce legislation next year that will remove huge wedges of power from the Oireachtas and the Minister and give it to unelected people who will be described as independent and will have a minimum of accountability to the Oireachtas or the public.

It should also be conscious of how far out it should push that parameter and whether it wishes to transfer policymaking in addition to regulation.  No matter what one does the regulator will have a certain policy role through the form in which he will implement regulations.  Senators must be conscious of that.  We must decide how much power we want to retain or if we wish to reduce these Houses to the status of local authorities where county managers, as opposed to the regulator or policy makers outside, have the power rather than the people elected by the public.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State says the two provisions will strengthen the Bill.  That is what we are trying to do and it is the Government's policy as outlined in the strategic management initiative.  I cannot understand why the two provisions are not included in the Bill.  They would strengthen the Bill and provide a road map, which I believe is missing, to the regulator.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (c) of the amendment is also important.  It refers to &ldquo;the need... in particular to identify, prohibit and penalise any actions by any telecommunications provider which in the opinion of the Director might have the effect of raising unreasonably the cost of entry to the market by any potential competitor&rdquo;. The best example of what this provision refers to is airlines, because we are familiar with airlines operating in non-competitive situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Ryanair started a route from Knock to London, Aer Lingus altered the fare on the Dublin-London route whereby passengers who wished to continue to Knock could do so for an extra £10.  That was aimed at ensuring that Ryanair could not succeed on that route.  There is no way anybody could run a route from Dublin to Knock at a fare of £10, yet Aer Lingus charged an extra £10 on the Dublin-London route for passengers flying on to Knock.  It is an example of low pricing which should be in the customer's interests but is clearly aimed at ensuring no <Col N="690" /> competitor comes into the marketplace.  That is the practice to which the amendment refers.  The regulator should have the power to be able to identify such practices and say they are not acceptable.  They might appear to be in the public interest but it is not in the public interest to use competitive pricing to such an extent that a company puts a competitor out of business by preventing him from competing.</P>
    <P>I have only discussed paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) and I am disappointed that the Minister of State has not understood the point we are making and has not said he will try to include it on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Quinn.  This House has had experience of what happens to Minister's interpretations of legislation.  I do not doubt that the Minister of State's interpretation in this regard is the same as Senator Quinn's. However, it is not stated in the Bill.  When the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, was before the Seanad, Senator Mooney and I advocated that a certain procedure be included in it.  The Minister of the day agreed but the procedure was not included.  The interpretation of that Act by judges and legal practitioners is different because the correct interpretation was not stated in the Bill. There is another precedent in the case of the Arts Council.  That body has a different interpretation of the legislation from that of the Minister of the day who introduced it, the former Deputy Charles Haughey, with regard to originality, artwork and copyright.</P>
      <P>Unless something is clearly stated, as can be seen from the experiences I quoted, it will not be implemented.  Different interpretations can be made and the spirit in which legislation is brought before the House might not be the spirit of opportunistic people who might use it for purposes which do not reflect the legislation's good ideas or common sense.  All legislation must make sense.  The Minister of State should look at Senator Quinn's proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Usually Senator Quinn's amendments are reasoned and argued well and this is no different but there is a lack of balance in some of the comments he made, particularly about Telecom Éireann.  There was a time when getting a telephone was a great favour.  Members of the Oireachtas spent a lot of time trying to secure telephones for individuals or private businesses.  The suppliers of the service &mdash; the workers of Telecom Éireann &mdash; were constrained by a number of factors.  One was that the infrastructure was not there to provide the telephone service we should have had.  Another element was that the Government did not provide sufficient funds to update the telecommunications area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that respect, there was a lack of balance in Telecom Éireann in 1996.  Now, if one goes into any Telecom Éireann sales office, one is in a <Col N="691" /> commercial building with telephones of different prices and colours.  There has been a sea-change as I am sure Senator Quinn accepts.</P>

      <P>The other point on competition I specifically address to Senator Dardis.  My concept of the free market is that one competitor tries to put another out of business and take that business.  Those are market forces and let nothing get in their way.  That is the credo.  In the case of a company who can fly into Knock for nothing, if they can do it and make money Senator Dardis' party has consistently said let them do it.</P>
      <P>The main thing to be achieved is control of the market if the market forces allow one to do so. Senator Dardis cannot have it both ways.  The customer can sometimes be ill served by the market.  It is the function of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with some of Senator Magner's definition of market forces but would he and the Minister of State not agree initially that market forces are about providing services to the customer who ultimately decides if it is the right or wrong product and that one gobbles up the others until there is only one left?</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn made play of the operation of a competitive element on the Dublin-London route.  I am not misinterpreting or criticising what he said.  It is a historical footnote.  As an emigrant, I know it was the <i>cause celébre</i> of the 1960s and 1970s.  There was no competition on the Dublin-London route.  A cartel operated on that route between Aer Lingus and British Airways.  It was so successful that it became the most used route out of and into Ireland.  The pricing structure on the route subsidised all other loss-making routes out of Britain and Ireland.  It was a national scandal aided by acquiescent Governments on both sides of the Irish Sea.  A cartel operated against the interests of the consumer and especially against Irish emigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to other airlines.  I hold no brief for them but it was Ryanair who broke up that cartel.  Ryanair deserves our gratitude for <Col N="692" /> that if nothing else.  It led the way in liberalising airfares across the Irish Sea.  Since then Peter Sutherland has, as EU Commissioner, has gone into liberalisation, but even then national airlines resisted and continue to do so.  However, that is a side issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn's point was that we could have a similar situation unless safeguards were put into this Bill.  One could have two or three main operators and that could work against the customer.  I raised this briefly on Second Stage and both the Minister of State and Senator Dardis have alluded to customer rights.  The Minister of State said that the Ombudsman and the Director of Consumer Affairs are responsible for protecting consumer rights.  I raised the issue of a users' council or consumer council in the context of the National Cultural Institutions Bill, 1996 but it may not be possible to pursue it on this Bill.  However, in light of the Minister of State's remarks, does he not see a need in future legislation for some form of public watchdog if, as he rightly says, there is and will continue to be a significant transfer of ministerial powers out of the elected area to the non-elected area?  I welcome the Minister of State's note of caution. It is refreshing to hear a Minister of State, irrespective of political complexion, saying in this House that we should exercise caution as legislators.</P>
    <P>He is correct in his analogy of where real power lies at local authority level; it is not with elected members but with county managers and the executive.  We are already on that slippery slope.  A continuous dismantling of policy decisions that were the remit of elected representatives has meant implementation of those policies has moved farther and farther away from the centre of legislative power.  This started in the mid-1980s.  Despite, or in spite of, our rush toward progress and the proper framework for national prosperity, there is a need to ensure that we do not have, as the Minister of State pointed out, a sequel to &ldquo;1984&rdquo; in 2084.  By that time there could be multinational corporations and non-elected individuals making all the decisions and not Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Is there any policy on digital television?  What is the state of development of the fibreoptic cable network here?  The Minister of State has touched on this and used the term &ldquo;multi-use&rdquo;. Presumably in following legislation the Government's position on the area of digital television will be spelt out.  Will RTÉ television be given the same development rights as the BBC have been granted by the British Government in developing terrestrial digital television services? Given the Minister of State's comment that &ldquo;There will be an accelerated development of Cablelink&rdquo;, as a result not only of the physical development of the cable network nationwide will there be an opportunity for competing <Col N="693" /> television production companies to provide television services to the consumer?  As matters stand, it is an astonishing situation.  Cablelink is a monopoly with hundreds of thousands of subscribers.  Relative to our population, we have one of the highest penetrations of cabling in Europe.  With the exception of some weekend service on Cablelink, there is no alternative to RTÉ television.  Why is there no Cork, Galway or Dublin television service on cable?</P>

That has been rectified and this reinforces the point made by Senator Quinn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  A number of Senators raised the issue of the consumer.  The consumer is not best served by a regulator whose role is to take over the regulatory functions of the Minister.  The law <Col N="694" /> is there to provide competition.  The regulator will operate under that law to ensure fair competition and so the consumer will be well served.</P>
      <P>I do not think the regulator should subsume the role of the Ombudsman or the Director of Consumer Affairs.  It is the intention that consumer councils will be established in the regulatory commission framework and that they will have an input.  These people are dedicated to protecting consumer rights.  To suggest that the regulator should also be the consumer's champion is not possible because one is giving him contradictory roles.  His role is to ensure fair competition under EU and Irish law.  The Ombudsman and the Director of Consumer Affairs will ensure that the regulator performs his functions to the consumer's benefit.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators raised the abuse of dominant position.  We have very specific competition law to deal with this matter so there is no point in adding it to another Bill.  Senators also mentioned that there was a Bill promised last January and we might never see it.  This is true; I cannot predict the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I can give some educated guesses.  The regulatory principles were set out by the Government last January.  The Government had a number of options at that stage.  It could have retained the regulatory regime within the Department's and the Minister's remit.  If it did, it would have to sell all the companies as EU legislation does not allow one to be owner and regulator.  All parties in Government are opposed to mass privatisation but are agreed that some joint venture and privatisation would be allowed for the benefit of the original parent company. Arising from this, there is a need to give the regulatory function to an independent body.</P>
      <P>If the Government had gone the other way it could have kept the regulatory powers within the Minister's remit.  I believe the Government made the right decision.  The laws required for that are detailed and complex, and cannot be produced at the drop of a hat.  Oireachtas procedures are complicated enough but to bring a Bill before the Oireachtas is also a very complicated procedure. There are many checks and balances to be made which take up time.  The more complicated the law the longer this takes.  This is complicated legislation because we are proposing a three-person regulatory commission which will oversee the regulation of the utilities sector.</P>
      <P>Some Senators mentioned digital television and regional broadcasting.  I am not kicking to touch or looking for a place on the Irish rugby team but these matters are in the capable hands of my colleague the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Cablelink operates in Galway and we have an extensive cable system.  It is not of the highest quality and needs to be upgraded.  I assure the House that, within the near future, people other than the present owner will have access to that upgraded system.</P>
      <P>I want to return to the need to insert detail into this regulatory legislation.  We did not do this in the case of the airlines, instead we transposed very similar EU legislation into Irish law.  We did not do any of the things Senators have asked me to do with this legislation and they noted the benefits for the airlines' customers.  I have no difficulty with the policy statements Senators are making.  If there is any place suited to it, it is this omnibus regulatory commission.  In that context I would see it as desirable.  This is a relatively narrow measure to transfer the regulatory powers of the Minister to an independent regulator.</P>
      <P>The market is not about customers but about making profits for those who operate in it.  We can seek to regulate that market and give a level playing field, as far as possible, to the operators. The competitive forces that will be created will augur well for the customer, but we must not fool ourselves.  The market is about making profits for the operators.  We want to ensure there is a system in place so that the market and competition will benefit customers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the job of the regulator is to ensure fair competition.  If he does that he will serve the customer.  I do not understand why we do not actively pursue that.  I am concerned about the promise of omnibus legislation.  I do not believe we should pass legislation on the promise of omnibus legislation later on.  The Minister will agree that it is wrong. It would be better to have omnibus legislation first and introduce this legislation later.  It has not happened this way so on that basis let us protect ourselves by making sure we include it in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I have a problem with the area of competition. Subparagraph (e) of my amendment states that the director shall at all times have regard to:</P>
      <P>the need to provide for an arrangement under which all providers of telecommunications services contribute financially to the maintenance of the universal service obligation by the national telecommunications system overall...</P>
      <P>The Minister gave a glib answer and gave the impression that he was expected to do it right away and that it would cost many millions of pounds.  That was not proposed but we must do something in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Competition will never solve the problem of the universal tariff.  We will not solve it because it is unlikely to be economical.  I would like to claim that I came up with this suggestion; I did not.  It is an EU suggestion but I thought it was brilliant.  All of those in the business who do not want to provide a universal service because it does not pay to do so must contribute towards the company providing it.  I had some experience of this when I was in An Post.  We made very strong arguments that it cost An Post a lot to deliver to remote areas.  It was not fair to expect us to do that and compete with couriers who only delivered in the Dublin area.  We had a very strong case.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes that all others in the marketplace should contribute towards the cost of the universal service so that the one who is obliged to provide the universal service, in this case probably Telecom, receives funds from the others.  This avoids the cherry picking problem.  I believe in this way we can reverse the tide of the industrial revolution.  For example, a brilliant young designer from County Leitrim who wants to set up a design workshop can only afford to do so in a big city at present because it is too costly to do it in Leitrim.</P>
      <P>If we could steer towards a universal service at a universal tariff by charging all those in the market with the obligation to subsidise those providing the universal service, that young designer could, with modern technology and telecommunications, set up a design workshop in Leitrim, Clifden or Kerry, and deal directly with Paris, London, New York or anywhere else.  That was not possible a couple of years ago.  Although it is possible now, the price may be so prohibitive that it is, in effect, impossible and nothing has changed.</P>
      <P>There is an opportunity here to reverse that trend.  We must stitch into the legislation the obligation:</P>
      <P>...to ensure, in the interests of facilitating rural development, that no part of the country is disadvantaged competitively by virtue of its location, and in particular to ensure that the universal service obligation is progressively extended to include a uniform tariff countrywide,...</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> Subparagraph (g) of my amendment deals with cable.  It states that the director shall have regard to:</P>
    <P>the need to ensure that &ldquo;access to customers by both traditional telephone lines and cable systems is open to all licensed telecommunications providers at prices which the Director deems to be fair.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is not enough that Cablelink will allow other users onto its system if the price is not deemed to be fair.  That should be part of the legislation so that others who wish to provide services on that system are not outpriced by the owner or operator of the cable.  The future of telecommunications is quite likely to be cable and I would like to make sure it is open to everybody who wishes to enter that market.</P>

      <P>We have been discussing the difference between regulation and policy almost to the extent of suggesting that there is some clearly defined line between the two; there is not. If policy is enacted in legislation, it then becomes regulation.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak on Senator Quinn's remarks in respect of technology.  One of the ways of arresting the rural decline &mdash; it has existed for so long it is questionable if it can be arrested &mdash; is through the use of technology.  We have heard about the concept of &ldquo;telecottaging&rdquo; whereby people can work from home because of the availability of high speed technology and communications equipment.  The possibility exists to transform rural living as Senator Quinn said. People can live in rural areas if that is where they choose to live and can work effectively from home.  For that reason the spirit of subparagraph (f) of the amendment should be taken on board.</P>

This is a very costly investment and I am curious to know who will bear the cost.  Will it be the new alliance, for example?  Will they be responsible, as effectively, they own Cablelink?  Has the Minister any idea what this will cost?  Are we talking about hundreds of millions of pounds? How long will it be before this is completed so that the competitive environment that Senator Quinn is talking about will be created?  Are we to wait until the next millennium?  If so, we would be in real danger of falling behind.  Does the Minister agree that, in the overall context of these <Col N="698" /> and his subsequent proposals for next year, a significant overall cost factor is involved, specifically in relation to upgrading Cablelink?</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn mentioned the difficulties An Post had in trying to introduce a market force element into its services. Introducing that element of commerciality to social instruments such as CIE has important public policy implications.</P>
      <P>However, I do not understand the point Senator Quinn is making in subparagraph (g) which states:</P>
      <P>the need to ensure that &ldquo;access to customers by both traditional telephone lines and cable systems is open to all licensed telecommunications providers at prices which the Director deems to be fair.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My understanding was that the whole purpose of the drive to introduce competition into the market was that the market would determine the fair price.  If the director wants to determine the price, why introduce competition?  Why not let the director use comparisons elsewhere to deem a fair price?  There is either real competition or there is not.  The Minister of State said it is the specific job of other agencies to ensure there is a level playing pitch and fair competition.  If that is not the case the market is distorted.  However, if the market is not distorted the price should be determined by the elements in the field.</P>

      <P>To clarify the point, as I said earlier, the question of who owns the cables is not important &mdash; Telecom may continue to own Cablelink &mdash; as long as outsiders have access to them.  However, if the owner is also in the market, he or she may impose a prohibitive price to stop outsiders using them.  The point of having a regulator is that he can ensure the price is fair.  If the owner is in the marketplace he can charge a high enough price to make sure that others cannot use them.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for tabling this omnibus amendment.  I appreciate its importance which has been reflected by the debate in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government accepts the universal service obligation and has set it down in its policy position and will continue to pursue it.  A uniform tariff is desirable but I explained to the House the difficulties in implementing it.  If a formula can be found to introduce that without greatly upsetting present customers in the main user area in order to give an advantage to rural areas, I would be delighted to hear it.  However, in time, competition from others, with Telecom Éireann, will create that climate.  That may not happen as quickly as is desirable but it is one way towards <Col N="699" /> it.  However, I cannot see a method of introducing it forthwith without causing major disruption.</P>
    <P>There will be a clear obligation on the owners of cable systems to allow third party access to them.  The regulator will determine a fair price for that access where there is disagreement between the two parties.  It is similar to third party access to gas.  If Roadstone wanted to bring gas through the Irish interconnector and the Bord Gáis pipes and Bord Gáas wanted to charge it an arm and a leg for that access, Roadstone could refer that price to the gas regulator, who, until the Bill is enacted next year, is temporarily myself.  I would then adjudicate on that and deem a fair price for transporting gas through that system. Owners of cables will have a similar obligation.</P>
    <P>Money for upgrading the system will come from investors.  However, it is the business of the present owners to organise the investment.  We will encourage the present owners to do that.  My officials advise me it could take as long as three years to get a top class system, which is different from what we have now.  I do not understand the technicalities of the difference but it has to do with fibre optics and so on.  I do not know very much about it.</P>

I am simply saying that most of it is either already covered or is a policy statement.  I am not sure that primary legislation is the place for policy statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in what the Minister of State said about how the owners of cables must make the system available to third parties.  Sky Sports, which is now available through Cablelink, having made an agreement with its subscribers has now added an extra cost for certain events.  Would it be within the director's remit to deem whether such an action is fair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to the Minister of State's response on the undeniable need for the upgrading of the Cablelink network to provide access to other providers in a competitive environment.  We are talking about a sum of money between £50 million and £150 million &mdash; I appreciate he cannot be more specific.  The owners, who are effectively Telecom and the new strategic alliance, will now be responsible for financing this development.  It seems to me that they may not be able to finance it out of existing resources but will have to borrow.  Bearing in mind that a main criticism made of this Bill in the other House, to which I and others alluded on Second Stage, was the absence of access by private investors to an equity base in Telecom, will the Minister consider selling off a share of Cablelink to the Irish public to finance its development costs?</P>
      <P>I make this proposal in light of the stated view of the Minister of State that what was needed in the strategic alliance was not money but expertise.  However, in this case money is plainly needed rather than expertise.  Would selling off a percentage of Cablelink to Irish institutions which operate pension funds and private investors, or directing Cablelink to do so, not give the Government an opportunity to provide the access which many people want?  That would open up the sharing of a State utility among the general populace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to emphasise, as I did on Second Stage, that I am not an advocate of full blown privatisation.  Personally and philosophically I am opposed to full blown privatisation.  However there are occasions where, for a variety of reasons, it is in the State's interests to sell portions of State bodies, as happened with Greencore and Irish Life.  There were no ideological differences in <Col N="701" /> those cases, although there may have been arguments about value.  Does the Bill provide a mechanism for the eventuality of privatisation or is it purely a matter of policy on which the Minister, on advice from the Government, would have to decide?</P>

      <P>The question of hijacking the All Ireland Finals and making them so expensive that only a handful of people would be able to view them would be for the television authorities to decide; it would not be the responsibility of the regulator.  Nevertheless I would dearly like to see regulation in this area and I will support the Minister if he introduces it.  That people can purchase events of enormous public interest and then blackmail the public into paying huge prices for the pleasure of seeing them is outrageous.  I like to take a drink and I smoke, but those who do neither often have to view sporting events in pubs, which they do not want to visit.</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) The Radio Plan shall include provision for the creation of a short wave radio station.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and I exchanged views on this on Second Stage.  I wish to express my appreciation to him for not only taking on board this issue but other matters on the broadcasting area I raised on Second Stage, and for communicating by letter with his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, not only outlining my views but also endorsing on a personal level much of what I said.  I am grateful that he took the time and effort to do this. Perhaps something positive may emerge.</P>
      <P>I may have made a <i>faux pas</i> with regard to the organisation to which I referred that concluded the television deal on sport.  I understand it may have been the Football Association of Ireland rather than the GAA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsections (5) to (9), inclusive, of section 3 deal with the transfer of the Minister's current regulatory powers with regard to frequency spectrum management to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.  These functions regarding broadcasting services are confined solely to the assignment of the appropriate radio frequencies and the appropriate locations for the transmissions of the broadcast services concerned.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for broadcasting policy and content rests with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Any decision to establish a short wave radio will involve, in the first instance, an expression of interest by some operator, RTÉ or otherwise, to establish such a service.  The formulation of policy would then be a matter for the Minister.  It would only be on the finalisation of such a decision that the Director of Telecommunications Regulation would become involved from the point of view of licensing frequency usage for such a service.</P>
      <P>I agree that a short wave radio station is a good idea.  I have passed on the Senator's sentiments to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht; a copy of the letter is available to him. Although I support the intent of the amendment, this Bill is not the appropriate place for such a wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the question of the separation of policy as distinct from facilities.  It is an inherent flaw in the make up of Government administration, which cannot be addressed here, that one Department is responsible for the creation and implementation of broadcasting policy while another is responsible for providing the facilities under which that policy is to be implemented.  It is long past time to ensure that, after the next general election.  The incoming <Col N="703" /> Administration should seriously address this contradiction.  It is not best practice to have a continuance of the present situation.</P>
      <P>We are dealing here with enabling legislation which will establish a director who will have specific functions in the context of the allocation of frequencies.  The Minister is ultimately responsible for that, yet my request, which it is legitimate to debate in the House, cannot be acted on by the Minister because it is not within his area of competence as it is a policy, not a technological, objection.  There is no technological objection or inhibition to establishing a short wave radio station.  The Minister of State has said it is a matter of policy. He outlined the ludicrous position whereby the idea must be initiated by a provider.  This means RTÉ because there is no competition in the national context.  It must initiate a request, not to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications but the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht who, in turn, will reflect on it and decide whether it is in the interest of the greater good.  He will then communicate with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to set in train the technical details of the decision.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to open up the debate &mdash; this matter was not addressed in the other House &mdash; and I will return to it.  I do not intend to pursue the amendment because I realise the impracticalities which would be placed on the director.  However, there must be some movement in this regard.  If the debate did nothing else, it specifically stated for the first time that if there is to be a short wave radio station service operating from this country, RTÉ in the first instance must make a specific request to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I hope it will do so sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>The difficulty with making the type of Government infrastructural changes the Senator mentioned is that Departments and Ministers are protective of their patches.  One is inclined to hold on to one's patch because any movement out of it may result in a lessening of one's authority and a reduction in the matters for which one is responsible and the actions one wishes to take.  However, the trend in other European countries is to separate the two areas. This is already the case in Ireland.</P>
      <P>RTÉ is not the only body which could initiate the idea of an Irish short wave radio service broadcasting all over the world.  Anybody could purchase their programming from RTÉ or other local or regional broadcasters under a licence and broadcast it.  Anybody can initiate it in the same way as Radio Tara, which broadcasts from a mast in Ireland.  If it had space on its airwaves, it could transmit Irish programming.  Perhaps that would make better use of the mast.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Minister said anybody could initiate it.  When I read it first I thought it was an interesting idea but, having checked it out, I question whether it is likely to be a flier.  The trend is towards a two way system and the Internet/World Wide Web appears to be the direction that is being taken.  The ability to communicate in that way is likely to be much more attractive than short wave radio.  I may be wrong and some people may be keen on it and make a commercial go of it.  If so, I am delighted by the Minister's comments.</P>

      <P>I endorse Senator Quinn's remarks and I welcome the Minister's clarification.  Given that the matter has been clarified, somebody may put forward a viable business plan which would make it workable.  The Minister has cleared up any doubt or confusion which may have arisen that, given the monopoly position enjoyed by RTÉ in a national context, there may not have been access to other providers.  The Minister clarified that access is available if somebody wishes to initiate the idea. A journalistic colleague of mine, Mr. Michael Cummins of the <i>Connaught Telegraph</i> in County Mayo started, and has continued, the lobbying on this matter.  He held a number of seminars on it and the Minister, who comes from County Mayo, will be aware of his initiative in this regard, which I applaud.  Perhaps there will now be some developments in the area.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (7) (b), line 40, after &ldquo;agreement.&rdquo; to add</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Such agreements shall have regard to the quality of reception required by Irish citizens abroad to access Ireland's national medium wave stations.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to a matter I raised on Second Stage. The Minister is familiar with this issue and I thank him for his generous initiative following my contribution on Second Stage.  He repeated my point in his letter to the Minister.  I assume the Minister's reply will be that this matter is outside his area of competence but until the position is clarified, my impression is that, under the section, the international obligations we will enter are two way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on Second Stage that one of the main reasons it is difficult to pick up medium wave RTÉ radio in certain parts of the south and south east of England and parts of north western Europe is not just the international conventions which limit our transmission area but that some of our partners in Europe and some of the signatories to the conventions outside Europe are not playing the game in the same way as we are playing it.  They are crashing in on our signal and if there is to be a regulatory body and parameters to which we will adhere at international level, we <Col N="705" /> should at least ensure there is some policing of the obligations of other member states in relation to the allocation of frequencies.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure an attempt is made to ultimately secure an improvement in the reception of RTÉ and Radio Ireland when it goes on air next year.  These two stations are primarily accessible outside Ireland because the local radio stations use FM rather than medium wave.  This has limited transmission in terms of its geographical spread.  The amendment provides an opportunity to address the ongoing debate among the Irish Diaspora.  The discussion has not gone away &mdash; it is similar to votes for emigrants &mdash; and it will exist until the problem is solved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mooney's point is fair. The Minister was generous on Second Stage. However, he can be sure that many emigrants wish to listen to Irish radio.  I question RTÉ's commitment to agreements, given the level of facilities and infrastructure in that organisation. A strong emphasis is put on FM rather than medium wave reception.  I do not understand why RTÉ does not give more consideration to that aspect, particularly from a technical point of view. Many programmes are relevant to emigrants.</P>
      <P>From 7 p.m. each evening, many programmes are exceptionally good and I hope more emigrants are listening to them.  However, unfortunately, emigrants who are only a few miles away cannot hear them despite modern reception facilities and communications systems.  I know people who live in the British midlands, Bradford and south London who want to listen to Irish programmes, such as Senator Mooney's programme.</P>

I question the commitment of RTÉ and whether it is aware of the number of people who want to hear Irish programmes on medium wave but who cannot.  While RTÉ does a good job, it could do better.  Given the number of people working in the station, it should be able to provide this service.  Senator Mooney is right in this regard.</P>

      <P>It is recognised that effective use of radio can make an important contribution to <Col N="706" /> telecommunications development.  The purpose of section 3(7) is to ensure that the Minister retains a policy role by providing that the director be obliged to prepare, publish and implement a plan for management of the spectrum subject to general policy directions issued by the Minister. In issuing such policy directions, the Minister will have regard to appropriate international obligations and agreements.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the general intent of the amendment.  I agree with both Senators on the importance of radio as a medium of contact with Irish citizens abroad.  I assure the Senators that the very nature of Ireland's involvement in international agreements and organisations dealing with frequency management is designed to get the best deal for Ireland having regard to all the constraints imposed by the nature of the radio frequency spectrum.</P>
      <P>The amendment is not necessary or appropriate to this Bill.  Any policy decision on national broadcasting for reception outside this jurisdiction is a matter for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and RTÉ.  I have informed the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht of the Senators views on the issue.  On the question of crashing into our signals, the Department is not aware of any such occurrence and I would like to hear about specific instances.

    <P>I have a vested interest in this area not because I was a broadcaster in another life but because I was an emigrant and lived abroad for seven years. Senator Cregan, Senator Magner and I have said on many occasions that we have been frustrated by being unable to pick up the signal in south-east England.  The reason for the amendment is <Col N="707" /> that I can pick up other signals from a similar distance within the European Union.  We are part of an international agreement on the allocation and strength of frequencies &mdash; the departmental officials may be more aware of the technical detail than any of us.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why in an era of modern communications &mdash; Senator Cregan's point was well made &mdash; only a few miles down the road, one cannot hear our national network.  Surely representatives of our Government sitting on these international bodies and who regularly review frequency allocations could fight a little harder?  We are only talking about a slight increase in transmission power, not about something which will be broadcast to, say, the Indian Ocean which, incidentally, the 600 kW strength station in Dublin is capable of doing.  We are only asking that it be broadcast a few miles down the road.  Why should sympathetic engineers working the night shift &mdash; Senator Cregan said it is at night that most people wish to listen to our national station &mdash; unofficially tweak the knobs?  That should not happen.  We should fight our case at these international meetings.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State said this matter did not come within the brief of this legislation.  This is a farce because, although this Bill relates to communications, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is responsible for stronger signals from RTÉ.  Communications should be the responsibility of one Minister.  Is MW relevant to arts and culture or communications?  The Minister of State said this is the responsibility and policy of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and RTÉ.  I hope policy introduced by the Minister will be implemented by the director and that policy introduced by either House will be implemented by RTÉ.  I do not believe that is happening and that RTÉ is answerable to us.  The Minister made a good point about not taking power away from those who represent the people.  Senator Mooney spoke about a power station 600 kW in strength, yet one cannot get MW in Castletownbere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) to ensure that Ireland's national interest is protected as a member of an international organisation or as a party to an international agreement.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that this amendment relates to amendment No. 1.  If one falls at Beecher's Brook, it does not necessarily mean one is out of the Grand National.  The amendment affords me the opportunity to again put on record what we spoke about in the earlier amendment.  I appreciate the commitments the Minister has made.  The reference to RTÉ confuses me a little.  I understand RTÉ only implements policies; it does not create them.  It is possible that some people in RTÉ have a different view of its role.</P>
      <P>I understand RTÉ is limited by the agreements into which Ireland enters.  I am not familiar with them as that is a technical area.  I have no idea, for example, what the parameters are under which our medium wave transmitter operates.  Is there a map of Europe, as Senator Quinn referred to earlier, showing footprints &mdash; which is the term used for satellite transmissions &mdash; which states &ldquo;thus far you shall go, and no further&rdquo;?  Is there any flexibility in this area?</P>
      <P>Senator Cregan made a valid point.  My wife comes from Castletownbere and I visit the town regularly.  While it annoyed me intensely initially, it fascinates me now that they had to install repeater stations into the south west in order to be able to pick up FM radio signals.  Strangely enough, one cannot receive medium wave because the signal varies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The major success of the penetration of Radio Kerry and County Sound is primarily, though not exclusively &mdash; I would not wish to diminish the quality of their programming &mdash; because of the technical inability of people in the south west to pick up a continuously clear signal from RTÉ radio.</P>
      <P>Ireland's national interest should be protected when we sit on these international bodies.  I understand the representation on these bodies is continuous.  They do not meet once every four or five years although they may do so to review the situation.  However, there is a permanent or standing committee to monitor these matters.  It is a grey area and one with which, because of its highly technical nature, most members of the public and, I admit, most Members of the House, are not totally familiar.  In the context of this amendment, it would be useful for the Minister of State to outline how these decisions are arrived at and whose interests they serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> I appreciate that national frequency allocations involve a delicate balancing act and that they are, as the Minister of State said on Second Stage, a finite national resource which most European Governments jealously guard.  It is, however, unacceptable that a station operating from Germany should have full access to the island of Ireland while our national station cannot be heard a short distance across the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Under section 3(7)(b) the Minister may, following consultation with the director, issue directions in writing requiring the director &ldquo;to comply with decisions made by the Minister...&rdquo;. Amendment No. 4 adds a third subsection as follows:</P>
    <P>(c) to ensure that Ireland's national interest is protected as a member of an international organisation or as a party to an international agreement.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is in the context of telecommunications which is why I did not specify the wording in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In the area of frequency management members of international organisations are normally the member states as represented by their Governments.  This Bill does not change that.  The <i>status quo</i> will remain with the Minister being the signatory to such international agreements on behalf of the State. Membership of such organisations is, in itself, designed to ensure that Ireland's national interest is taken into account and is protected.  The section already provides that where the Minister signs any such agreement which gives rise to obligations he may direct the director, that is the regulator, to carry out the actions necessary to fulfil these obligations.</P>
      <P>I assure the Senator that the very nature of our involvement in international agreements and in organisations dealing with frequency management is designed to get the best deal.  I hope Senator Mooney will agree that there is, therefore, no need for the amendments he has moved.</P>
      <P>On the specific points he raised, frequency management is a matter for my Department while broadcasting policy is a matter for the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. We try to get the best deal we can and, by and large, we succeed.  There are spots where we have not succeeded and these require attention.  As part of the international co-ordination, however, constraints are placed on us and others concerning the power, height and direction of transmitters required.  I take the Senator's point that if one country can transmit all over Ireland why can our national station not do so?  That question requires attention.</P>

      <P>We seek to promote and protect Ireland's national interest.  My Department is in charge of frequency management and, therefore, the Minister or his representative represents Ireland at international level.  The buck stops at the Minister's desk as far as getting the best deal is concerned.  We seek to do that and will continue to do so.  We have been relatively successful although there are areas that can be improved upon.  We must get agreement from others before we can improve them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to exaggerate the difficulties faced by Ireland as a peripheral EU member state having to negotiate with larger countries that have greater resources including a multitude of transmission facilities far in excess of our own.  A country such as Germany, with a population of 80 million, can argue logically that it needs powerful transmitters to cover the whole country.  However, since our accession to the EU we have been treated as a special case both because of our peripheral location and the emigration of our people.  In recent years this has been directed more towards Europe than towards traditional destinations such as the United States. I do not want to get into that argument but let us say there are increasing job opportunities on the European continent which, traditionally, were not there for Irish people.  A greater migratory factor is now involved and more people see themselves as migrants rather than emigrants in the European context.</P>
      <P>This leads me to the conclusion that Ireland's message and image should be exploited to the fullest via the propaganda nature of radio, to put it bluntly.  All these factors should be taken into account in agreements which the Minister of State decides upon.  What we are looking for is small in the European context.  We are only seeking an extra boost in power to ensure that the United Kingdom is covered initially and perhaps parts of north western European also.  It is not just because of what we want but because, as the Minister of State acknowledged, it must be a two way communication.</P>
      <P>May I assume that the director will now be responsible for representing Ireland or will it be someone from the Minister's office?  If so, who is that person or persons?  How many of them are there and how often do they meet?</P>

      <P>May I draw back slightly from what I said to the Senator earlier?  When deciding upon frequency management and our national interest we consult with RTÉ, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, and the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  That being said, the buck stops at the Minister's desk in my Department.  I do not have detailed answers to the questions raised but I will get them for the Senator.  The director will not be responsible for policy as this will remain part of the Minister's remit.  I do not know the name of the official who will attend the meetings and I do not know how often they will meet, but I will get that information for the Senator.</P>

Has RTÉ made representations to the Department to improve the signal for the Irish emigrants in the UK?  Does it receive representations on an ongoing basis or when did it last receive them? Has this matter arisen in discussions between the Department and RTÉ?</P>

      <P>I want to ensure that our national interest is protected.  RTÉ currently holds a monopoly licence for national broadcasting and it is also involved in the development of overseas broadcasting, which is looked after by Mr. Wesley Body's department.  New technology has been introduced, such as satellite and telephone broadcasting.  RTÉ has advertised through the Irish media in Britain that its programmes may be accessed by these two methods.  Yet, despite the existence of a strong lobby in this regard, RTÉ has not pressed the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to improve the arrangements between Ireland and other European countries.  I do not want to put the Minister or RTÉ in a box, but it is long past time this issue was addressed.</P>

      <P>In page 4, after line 45, to add the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10) The Minister shall have regard to the quality of reception of radio frequencies allocated under international conventions.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister about cross-Border transmissions and about Radio Tara to which we referred on Second Stage in the context of the quality of reception of radio frequencies.  Has agreement been reached on cross-Border television reception rather than radio reception? There is an ongoing demand for the improvement of radio reception in the North.  I appreciate its more glamorous colleague, television, has been getting more press, and rightly so because the old cliché of a picture telling a thousand words is as true today as it was when it was first coined for the printed media.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell us when this agreement will come into effect.  Are there similar agreements for radio?  The proper placing of transmitters might improve the signal into Northern Ireland which could then be extended to the north of England and Scotland.</P>
      <P>Ireland currently has one long wave frequency which is operated by Radio Tara.  RTÉ, and therefore the State, has a share in it.  I am not a regular listener to Radio Tara because it is aimed at a preteen market and I do not fit into that marketing niche.</P>

      <P>I may be slightly beyond it but I have discovered that my nine year old daughter, who is a big Boyzone fan, changes stations on my car radio.  For weeks I could not understand why the station had been moved from RTÉ to the 252 frequency.  The fact that she was inclined to tune in to Radio Tara rather than 2FM says a lot about the adequacies or otherwise of our national radio station.  Could a case be made to extend Radio Tara's frequency, because of the clarity of its signal, into approximately two-thirds of the UK and to produce programmes of special interest to the Irish in Britain on the long wave channel?</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that Ireland's case at international conventions is made on the basis of its peripherality and its large diaspora. The main reason we have not introduced votes for emigrants is that there are so many Irish people overseas who might decide to vote in multi-seat constituencies.  The Tánaiste said he would not like to wait for the box from Brooklyn to decide the final seat in Kerry North.</P>

Although we pay lip service to the idea of helping our emigrants and we express concern about their welfare, whenever opportunities arise to help them we put all types of obstacles in the way. Surely, in this age of modern technology, it is not beyond the technical capacity of those involved in broadcasting to ensure that the Irish in Britain get a strong clear radio signal from Ireland?  We should not allow the present situation to continue.  RTÉ has no clear access into England as English television channels have into Ireland.

Negotiations are continuing about the siting of required masts and equipment and concerning an improved RTÉ radio signal into Northern Ireland.  Long wave radio is, by its nature, intended to cover long distances and Ireland has rights to the 252 wave length.  The use of that is a matter for broadcasting policy which brings us back to the separation of provision and use.</P>

    <P>The purpose of international agreements on frequency spectrum is to optimise the use of a scarce resource, to minimise interference and to <Col N="714" /> maximise reception quality for all.  Among other things, they include good frequency management principles.  Within these constraints, our objective is to maximise the benefits to the State from any such agreement.  Our track record on this issue is very good.  Section 3(9) states that the Minister must have regard to good frequency management in giving directions to the director.  Both amendments appear designed to achieve the same effect as this subsection.

The director has wide-ranging powers under the section.  The effect of establishing the office of director will be to reduce the annual cost of management, etc. which is £250,000.  The collection of existing telecommunications, radio communications and cable television fees will be transferred to the director.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, there has been a long standing debate and conflict in my area between the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the community as a result of the efforts of South Coast Community Television.  The reason it did not get a licence is because someone said it interfered with the UHF frequency.  It is a service provided to 20,000 to 25,000 households in the Cork and Waterford areas and is a community effort as well.  As there seems to be no technical objection to South Coast Community Television in that it does not interfere with existing frequencies, does this mean that the power transferred to the director will give him an opportunity to consider this matter and review the situation?  If so, I welcome and support that.</P>

      <P>The Minister, if I interpret him correctly, will act in the role of director until one is appointed.  There is a great deal of discussion and debate on the capping of pricing, which the Minister referred to earlier.  I discovered that Telecom Éireann, through its Eircell subsidiary, in the last adjustment of prices in October, planned to introduce a charge of 40p per call for directory inquiries for domestic as well as Eircell customers.  When I checked with Eircell, I was informed that the Minister had intervened and directed Telecom Éireann not to proceed with the implementation of that charge. If that is the case, the Minister is to be complimented.  It was a small line in a list of rebalancing and readjustments of prices which would definitely have had a big impact on Eircell customers who do not have access to telephone directories.  I know they use the directory inquiry service a lot.  One can imagine what the cost would have been at the end of the month.  My understanding is if anything of that nature were to happen between now and the 90 days, and an attempt was made to implement certain elements of this Bill before it was enacted, the Minister could introduce an order.</P>

      <P>The Minister makes the first cap order.  The lifetime of that is five years, unless the Minister asks the director, who will be subsequently appointed following the passing of the Bill, to do otherwise.  It is a minimum of 6 per cent per annum and is for a basket of goods in that category.  The Minister may request the director to vary the order.  If he does, the director is in charge.  That can only happen after two years as there is automatic control by the Minister up to then.  In the interim, the Minister has the same powers he always has over Telecom Éireann &mdash; he owns it and can tell it what to do.</P>

He had to make the changes, not Telecom Éireann.  It was his responsibility to sanction the changes.  The Minister can also direct changes to take place. The capping order will direct downward movement of 30 per cent over five years in real terms, which is a real reduction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Farrell.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. R. Kiely) Acting Chairman (Mr. R. Kiely)">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue on the Adjournment because of a sense of frustration expressed by members and supporters of the North West Hospice who have been requesting funding for the pallative care service in Sligo for the past year and a half.  I also raise it because a relative passed away a couple of weeks ago in Sligo, at a very young age.  The care he received from the hospice was outstanding and will never be forgotten by his wife and family.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister of Health, Deputy Noonan, has, on numerous occasions, committed himself to providing funding for the care of cancer patients.  He also listed this as one of his priorities when he became Minister for Health. The North West Hospice covers an area including counties Sligo, Leitrim, south Donegal and north Roscommon.  This must be one of the most rural areas covered by a hospice care service in any part of the country.  It has an aging population which makes care more difficult to provide because there are many more patients in need of it.</P>
      <P>Since 1989, when the North West Hospice was established in the Sligo, Leitrim, south Donegal and south Roscommon area, 800 families have been offered home care.  That service now employs a full-time doctor and four nurses in addition to running a full-time public information office.  Sixty-five per cent of the £200,000 annual cost of that service is provided by the general public living in the area.  In the past year the public has also provided £380,000 to construct and renovate an eight bed residential hospice for people with advanced cancer.  None of that money was provided by the State.  North West Hospice is only asking for funding in the 1997 Estimates for two or three beds in the building it has provided.  It is worth nothing that £61,000 of the funds expended by North West Hospice in the past 12 months to provide that unit went on VAT paid to the State.  It is also worth nothing that, in its ten year history, North West Hospice and its clinical staff have been net contributors to the State through taxes, PRSI and VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North West Hospice seeks equity and fairness from the State and to be treated the same as other residential hospices for funding purposes.  It is not good enough that, for five months this summer, nobody in authority could <Col N="719" /> clarify the future direction of hospice services in the north-west.  It is not good enough that the proposed phased opening of a residential hospice service by the North West Hospice had to be postponed last month.</P>
    <P>The situation has changed in the last couple of days following the announcement by the Minister for Health of a commission on cancer strategy.  I have been in regular contact with the programme manager, Mr. Richard Greene, who gave me a commitment that he would give priority to the North West Hospice with regard to funding.  Mr. Greene sent a letter to the North West Hospice within the last couple of days suggesting that it contact the North-Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>One year ago, on Wednesday, 22 November 1995, North West Hospice presented a two volume submission, fully costed and running to over 100 pages, to the chief executive officer and deputy chief executive officer of the North-Western Health Board, Mr. Manus Ward.  North West Hospice was specifically requested by the deputy chief executive officer at a meeting in June 1995 to provide a costed proposal to provide eight beds.  When it was presented to the health board, North West Hospice was told that it would be in time for the 1996 Estimates.  A year has passed since that proposal was submitted.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Department of Health, in conjunction with the North Western Health Board, to ensure that palliative care in the north-west region is given adequate funding for the provision of beds in the building that has been provided by North West Hospice, adjacent to Sligo General Hospital.  Frustrations are strong in the voluntary organisation and I appeal to the Minister to provide money in 1997.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion.  The North-Western Health Board leased some of its property to the hospice and the hospice has done wonderful work with it.  I toured the premises recently.  It has a fine four bed unit ready to be used.  There is a private room for use by patients in the last week or so of their illnesses.  There is also a room in which the next of kin can stay and a small reception room for their use.</P>
      <P>The work of the hospice on the centre is second to none but it is hamstrung for money.  It has done marvellous fund raising work and the people of the north-west have been very good in donating funds.  However, the hospice cannot run the service on fundraising alone and if we are serious about helping people who are ill with cancer and need treatment we should provide the necessary funding.  North West Hospice has given a wonderful field service, as I call it.  Its members travel to see patients and try to keep them as long as possible in their homes.  That is a wonderful service because most people wish to stay at home for as long as they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unit in Sligo is second to none and I appeal to the Minister to accede to the hospice's request for funding.  If the Minister visits Sligo, the staff <Col N="720" /> of the hospice will be delighted to show him what they have done.  They have done a super job on a shoestring budget.  I appeal to the Minister to support this motion to provide funding for the North West Hospice.  Other hospices throughout the country are getting far more funds.  Sligo is at the bottom of the list even though North West Hospice deals with a large rural area with rough terrain which involves large mileage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Members of this House will be aware that, since taking office, the Minister for Health has identified cancer as one of his major priorities.  Funding has, therefore, been provided for the development of cancer services as part of the ongoing enhancement of health services in recent years.  In relation to the North-Western Health Board, services for cancer patients are already being enhanced and, on the basis of service priorities agreed with the North-Western Health Board, £275,000 has been provided for the development of oncology services in the North-Western Health Boards area.</P>
      <P>In relation to the development of hospice services in the north-west, I understand that the planning process is already well under way and that a report on hospice services in the North-Western Health Board area, in the context of the recommendations in the national cancer strategy, is being prepared for consideration by the health board's standing committees at their meetings in December 1996.  The report will include a set of priorities for the development of palliative care services as defined in the recently announced national cancer strategy.</P>
      <P>Voluntary groups play a valuable role in the provision of services to cancer patients and the North-Western Health Board recognises this in the support which it provides to the hospice groups in its area.  The board has committed funding on an annual basis to the North West Hospice in addition to the provision of hospice beds in the board's community hospitals, as well as staff training.  The health board also donated the accommodation for the residential hospice unit.  Taking into account the important role of groups such as the North West Hospice, I understand that the health board's cancer plan will set out proposals regarding the role, function and funding for the voluntary organisations, the North West Hospice and the Donegal/Foyle Hospice, in the proposed future organisation of the services in the board's area.  In this regard, I understand the health board has already met representatives of the North West Hospice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of further development of hospice services in the north-west will fall to be considered in the light of the priorities identified by the North-Western Health Board.  The board's priorities will form the basis for future improvements in services for cancer patients in the north-west.  I am sure that the North West Hospice will continue to maintain contact with <Col N="721" /> the North-Western Health Board in the development of plans for the enhancement of cancer services in the north-west.  Members will appreciate that, having regard to the present state of discussions as I have outlined, it is not possible to respond directly to the question raised by Senator Reynolds at this stage.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Judgment of Israeli Supreme Court.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent decision by the Supreme Court in Israel has very serious implications in that it now grants legitimacy to interrogators using physical force to extract information from prisoners.  No democratic country can allow a person to be physically abused while undergoing interrogation.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the Irish Government influence the Israeli Government to have this particular judgment of the Israeli Supreme Court examined and legislation brought before the Israeli Parliament preventing such conduct by the police force.  A three judge panel made the decision permitting this conduct.  One of the judges on the panel was Aharon Barak who, in the past, has shown commendable commitment to civil liberties, which makes this disappointing.  I recognise the problems being faced by the Israeli Government, the police force and the Israeli people who have been victims of a succession of suicide bombings in recent years that have led to the deaths of numerous women, children and security forces members throughout Israel.  These suicide bombings tend to harden public opinion and the Israeli people understandably want further tightening of security measures.  They must, however, be within the law.  In a democracy, the rule of law must be applied in a fair and impartial manner.  It applies to the man in the street but it equally applies to the police force.</P>
      <P>Amnesty International has stated that the methods of interrogation used against Palestinians regularly include physical force, shaking prisoners violently, preventing people from sleeping, tying people's arms and making people stand for long periods with their heads covered.  This can go on for days.  The person who was detained and whose case led to the Supreme Court decision was Muhammad Abdel Aziz Hamdan.  The Israeli police say that he is a member of the Islamic Jihad.  I cannot say.  It is recognised that the Islamic Jihad is part of the extremist Palestinian group.  These people's conduct is deplorable and not to be condoned but the rule of law must prevail.</P>
      <P>We, as a democratic Government, highlighted abuse by our neighbours in mistreating Irish prisoners in British jails and brought the matter to the European Court of Human Rights.  This is not right and cannot be permitted in any jurisdiction with which we have diplomatic relations.  We should use our influence to ensure that such methods of interrogation are not permitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is concerned by reports of the ill-treatment of prisoners in Israel, particularly the recent decision of the Israeli Supreme Court that Secret Service investigators can use physical force in the questioning of a Palestinian detainee as well as previous decisions to permit the Israeli security services to use physical pressure in the interrogation of suspects.</P>
      <P>There have also been recent disturbing television reports of an incident involving beatings and abuse of prisoners by Israeli security forces.  I am pleased, however, to note that the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, has reacted strongly to this incident and promised that the full rigour of the law will be applied against the soldiers involved.</P>
      <P>While Ireland and its partners in the European Union freely acknowledge Israel's legitimate security concerns, they cannot be used to justify measures which are contrary to the norms of international law and respect for human rights.  In the case of the incident to which I have referred, not even the soldiers involved would appear to have claimed that the men whom they so severely maltreated posed any kind of security threat.</P>
      <P>Israel is a democracy and has a rule of law.  It clearly enshrines respect for human rights in its legislation and has ratified a number of relevant UN conventions, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  It has to be said that it is also an open society which permits human rights organisations to operate freely and that such organisations in Israel are very vocal.  We fully expect Israel to live up to its commitments in the international instruments and to the standards which it has freely set itself of a normal democratic society.</P>
      <P>Apart from the treatment of prisoners, the Government is also concerned by the fact that a large number of Palestinian prisoners are still in detention, despite Israel's undertaking under the terms of the Interim Agreement which it signed with the Palestinians in 1995 to release, as a confidence building measure, those prisoners in three stages.  The European Union's Council of Ministers in their declaration of 1 October called on all sides to the Middle East peace process to fulfil all their commitments under the first phase of the Interim Agreement in a timely fashion including the release of Palestinian prisoners.  The Union believes that any failure to fully implement the terms of the Interim Agreement in relation to prisoners and, with the closures and the continued growth of settlements, mistreatment of prisoners can only serve to create resentment among the Palestinian population.  This resentment creates a fertile breeding ground for those groups who use violence to oppose the Middle East peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> The Government is also concerned in this context with the continued detention of a large number of other prisoners, most of whom are Lebanese held in poor conditions in prisons in Israeli-occupied South Lebanon.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that the European Union has close political and economic links with Israel and that the Union is committed to maintaining and depening this relationship.  In this context and on the basis of a common commitment to the furtherance of the Middle East peace process, a new generation Euromediterranean Association Agreement was signed with Israel on 20 November, 1996.  The new Agreement, like the others which have been signed with Tunisia and Morocco and the others which are being negotiated in the context of the Barcelona process with Mediterranean countries, is based on an open acknowledgment that respect for the principles of democracy and human rights will guide the domestic and external policies of both parties and that these principles constitute an essential element of the Agreement.  It is our <Col N="724" /> sincere hope that the EU's relationship with Israel can be consolidated through the early ratification of this new Association Agreement by all EU member states.</P>
    <P>The Government expects that Israel, like other states with which the European Union hopes to make such Euromediterranean Partnership Agreement, will agree to freely engage in discussions with the Union on human rights issues.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has met with both Prime Minister Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Levy recently in the context of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union.  In these meetings he has stressed the EU concerns about the treatment of the Palestinians and the future of the peace process.  The Union will continue to underline to the Israeli Government the importance of improvements in human rights, including concrete steps to improve the treatment of prisoners and the early release of Palestinian prisoners.</P>
