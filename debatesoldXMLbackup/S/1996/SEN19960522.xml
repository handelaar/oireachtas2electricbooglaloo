      <P>I have notice from Senator Cashin that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P> The need for the Minister of Health to consider the difficulties being experienced by the speech and language therapists who are seeking a pay review comparable with other graduate health care professionals.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran on the following matter:</P>
      <P> The need for the Minister for Education to provide a remedial teacher service at Athleague and Fuerty national schools in County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take item 1 until 6 p.m. and item 19, motion 29, between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.  For the <Col N="930" /> information of Members, it is hoped that next week we will take the Merchant Shipping Bill, the Powers of Attorney Bill, which started in this House, the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill and to conclude statements on Civil Service reforms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for the list of legislation and items with which he intends to deal.  There are two issues arising on today's Order of Business. In light of the national crisis facing the beef industry and requests from my colleagues Senators Kiely and O'Kennedy for a debate on the matter, would the Leader give time next week for this House to express its views in support of the industry?  It would be much appreciated on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>How will item 7, the Freedom of Information Bill, be dealt with in the future?</P>

      <P>I could help Senator Finneran by asking not to waste his time with his Adjournment matter.  The answer he will get is that no remedial teachers will be appointed this year; he can save himself the trouble.  It might take three pages, but that will be the answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the request for a debate on the beef industry but I would extend it to the wider food industry.  There is a huge amount of confusion as to what people are eating and what is safe, as well as the impact on the industry itself.  People need information and a debate would help but, as I said, this is relevant not only to the beef industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last week there have been two international reports &mdash; one on passive smoking and another on the implications of taking salt in one's food.  The report on passive smoking, which concluded <Col N="931" /> that it was not dangerous, was subsidised by the tobacco industry and the report on salt was subsidised by the food processing industry.  People are entitled to know the source of such information.  A wide debate on the beef and food industries would provide information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the call for a debate on agriculture, particularly the beef industry.  When this crisis broke I said it was the most serious economic crisis facing the State since the economic war. People laughed but I believed that to be the case and I am even more confirmed in that view now.  It is important for us to say that Irish beef is safe and can be eaten with confidence.  Unfortunately, saying it does not mean consumers will necessarily be reassured.  Nevertheless, it is important.</P>
      <P>We have been asking for statements on Northern Ireland.  Obviously we do not want to do anything which would be less than sensitive in the lead up to the elections.  However, in the period before the forum sits in Northern Ireland, it would be useful to debate this matter.  I thought the Leader had indicated that he would attempt to do that and I ask him to confirm that he will provide time for the House to discuss the matter before the forum sits.</P>
      <P>We should congratulate Eimear Quinn, the people who won the Eurovision Song Contest and Brendan Graham who wrote the song.  We have become almost blasé about winning song contests, nevertheless it has been the practice in the past to congratulate the winner.  I ask the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Tourism and Trade to reconcile two positions.  It is regarded as desirable that we spend a large amount of money hosting the Eurovision Song Contest &mdash; and I think that is right &mdash; but not on hosting the World Equestrian Games.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the beef industry.  The present situation is very bad.  We had debates on Digital, Aer Lingus, Packard, Telecom, CIE and Irish Steel.  The problems facing the beef industry are potentially worse than all of those combined. Cheap political point scoring will solve nothing.  The problems in the beef industry began with the revised CAP and GATT negotiations and were compounded by the way the industry was handled through the years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>The dairy industry was well handled by the co-operatives &mdash; it was diversified, standards were raised and cowboy operators were cut out.  If the beef industry had been handled in the same way it would be better off today.  The problems have been made worse by BSE.  We should debate the issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader convey to the Minister for Justice the outrage at the transfer of 150 gardaí from Dublin to the Border region to combat cattle smuggling?  It is an important task but one would expect it to be a matter for the Customs service.  If it cannot undertake the task we have an Army of 10,000 highly trained personnel doing very little.  It would not take a nuclear scientist to recognise a truck load of cattle coming across the Border at night.</P>

      <P>Has the Senator a question for the Leader of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only last week two little girls were mugged by a gang of young girls in Tallaght in Dublin.  Ten gardaí are to be transferred from the Tallaght station to the Border instead of supplementing <Col N="933" /> the numbers of gardaí in Tallaght.  The transfer of 150 gardaí out of Dublin given the present crime level is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's request for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to attend for a debate on the beef industry. I was in America last week and I met two buyers of Irish beef, one from France and the other from Germany, who do not buy Irish beef now, not because of any doubt about the beef but because they can only advertise their own home beef in their supermarkets.  It is not enough for us to believe our beef is safe; we have a big job to do in selling it.</P>
      <P>In that regard, I ask the Leader to congratulate the Minister for appointing a consumer representative to the board of An Bord Bia.  He had difficulty accepting that suggestion when he was in this House but his having done so last week is evidence of his belated recognition of the importance of having a consumer input.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House should bring forward the debate on European Monetary Union.  Monetary union will arrive suddenly and we have not had a chance to debate it.  We need to do so soon.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis in congratulating Brendan Graham and Eimear Quinn.  I urge the Minister for Tourism and Trade to recognise the value of hosting the Eurovision Song Contest in Ireland because it is of great benefit from a tourism perspective.  The number of people who viewed the win as a failure was worrying.  I extend my congratulations to the winners; we should use it as an opportunity to increase our trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader draw the attention of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to the opening hours of the National Library?  It opens on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 2 p.m. and at 9.30 a.m. on the other weekdays. Many people go to the library to read <Col N="934" /> find it closed.  It should open at the same time each morning.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader consider having a debate on the recent Amnesty International report?  As he is aware, a number of listed countries, with whom we have diplomatic relations, are involved in major breaches of human rights and carry out systematic torture.  A debate would enable us to exert our diplomatic influence on these countries to cease these practices which are outrageous in this day and age.</P>
      <P>I agree with the leader of the Fianna Fáil group that an early debate on agriculture, and particularly, the beef industry, is important.  I hope we will all be of assistance to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It is essential we recognise he is making tremendous efforts in this difficult situation.  I hope he will be successful at the July meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers in obtaining the £60 million package he is seeking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Having called consistently over the past month or so for a debate on agriculture, it is most encouraging that people now realise the seriousness of the position, especially in the beef industry.  A Dáil debate on agriculture is to take place next week in Government time.  I appeal to the Leader to arrange a debate in Government time here next week.</P>
      <P>I would like to be associated with Senator Dardis and Senator Quinn in congratulating Eimear Quinn and the composer, Brendan Graham, for winning the Eurovision Song Contest.  I support the call by the Mayor of Limerick, Deputy Kemmy, that the next Eurovision should be staged in Limerick.  I hope the Leader will convey this to the proper authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The group chaired by Justice Susan Denham on the workings of the courts has reported to the Minister for Justice and suggested an independent courts authority.  I would not like this to have the same fate as the suggestion by the Whitaker committee 12 or <Col N="935" /> 14 years ago that there should be an independent prisons authority.  I with-draw the request I made last week asking the Leader to find out what happened to the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee's report because everybody seems to know what is in it, which is much the same as appeared in previous reports.  Will the Leader find out from the Department of Justice if there is any intention to establish an independent prisons authority?  This suggestion was also included in the five year plan.  A period of 14 or 15 years is a long time, even for legislation like this to be brought forward.  It is difficult to get answers from the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>For some time we have been asking for a debate on Northern Ireland and now would be an opportune time.  The House should make a clear statement on the issue and a debate will give us an opportunity to do that.  The tourist season is starting in Border areas.  It is vital that the House expresses a clear view that there is no room for people who engage in double talk and whose replies lack clarity, whether they are Mr. Gerry Adams or Mr. David Trimble.  Ordinary people want a voice and want to be heard.  We should give a clear signal that we want negotiations and a settlement in the North so that people can go about their day to day business.  I appeal to the Leader to provide the House with an opportunity to make a clear statement on where it stands on the troubles in the North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are heading into summer when a large number of outdoor events will take place.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Tourism and Trade to approach the insurance companies to see if anything can be done about the exorbitant rates of public liability insurance which people who organise small gymkhanas, church fetes, etc. are charged?  Such costs mean that many events cannot take place.  There is a need for public liability insurance but <Col N="936" /> people tend to make insurance claims even for small injuries.  This was highlighted the other day when a court ordered that £75,000 be paid to a lady who hurt her foot when a jug fell on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem with the quality of the public water supply in certain places, including Kilkenny.  As a result, supermarkets have increased the number of types of bottled water on the shelves.  They no longer sell water in one litre bottles, but in five litre bottles.  Perhaps the Leader could ask the Minister for Health for a guarantee that bottled water is pure or that it is analysed in the same way as the public water supply. Many bottled waters could be more contaminated than the water we are asked to boil from the public water supply.</P>
      <P>The third matter I want to raise concerns a letter written to <i>The Irish Times</i> today by the Charge d'Affaires of the Nigerian Government as a result of an application by three Members of the Oireachtas to go to Nigeria to study the conditions in Ogoniland and in Nigeria generally.  They were refused permission to enter that country.  The Charge d'Affaires said the Government in Nigeria is trying to ensure that human rights violations do not occur and it is complying with all human rights practices.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator knows that does not arise on the Order of Business and he should find some other way of raising the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;spoke about the arms it tried to purchase for its police, <Col N="937" /> who work with the Nigerian police who kill people in Ogoniland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Nigerian Government to allow people from this country to visit Nigeria to study conditions there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As my party's spokesperson on arts and culture, I want to be associated with the complimentary remarks about Mr. Brendan Graham and Ms Eimear Quinn.  We all join in wishing her every success in her music examinations.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey our congratulations to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht who moved quickly to scotch any suggestion that this country would not host the Eurovision Song Contest next year.  This is another example of Irish begrudgery. For someone who was involved in the country music version of the Eurovision for many years in the 1980s, it amazes me that there was never any suggestion that Ireland should not compete or that those who competed should not try to win.  On each occasion, the jury voted on the merit of the song and the performance, which also happened last weekend.  For anyone to suggest that we should not acknowledge this outstanding achievement would be a gross disservice to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be remembered that tourism numbers have increased significantly over the past few years, particularly in Dublin, and this owes something to our success in the Eurovision.  I congratulate the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, who said on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last Monday night that we should host the Eurovision next year and worry about finding the money later.  I am sure he was not attempting to be cavalier with the taxpayers' money, but we would all <Col N="938" /> agree with the message he was conveying.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader request the same Minister to come into this House and make a statement on the confusion over the changes in section 35 of the Finance Act as it applies to the film industry? There is a public slanging match going on in the media between the Minister, anonymous spokespersons in his Department and the financial people in this city.  They are at odds with each other as to whether the benefits, or otherwise, of section 35 will accrue to this country in the long term.  The allegation is that Ireland is no longer a player when it comes to big feature film productions such as &ldquo;<i>Braveheart</i>&rdquo;.  The Minister has done outstanding work and I wish to compliment him on his initiative in going to Hollywood to talk with the film people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of what is happening would the Minister come to this House and make a statement to clarify the position because what is going on at the moment is very bad publicity for this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was late for the Order of Business but I was engaged in unique and very important, critical discussions with the beef and cattle representatives of all sectors.  In that context I ask the Leader of the House to convey to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry before we have a full scale debate here, two or three important elements in the ongoing discussions at Brussels level; first, that he would distinguish in all his statements between the position in Ireland and the position in the United Kingdom.  I have heard many statements from the Minister in recent times and he seems to be preoccupied with solving what is a critical problem in the United Kingdom, but we are of a totally different dimension and I hope the Leader will convey that to the Minister in his <Col N="939" /> ongoing discussions not only because of the actions we have taken, and which they never took, but also because that sector is much more important to our economy than it is to the United Kingdom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We may have an opportunity of having such a discussion here but before that happens there would be ongoing negotiations.  Second, the GATT restrictions should be looked at in the context of matters that have arisen since that agreement was entered into that could not have been anticipated at that time.  The Commission has the responsibility for opening up renegotiation.  Will the Minister focus particularly on requesting the Commission to open up renegotiation on certain limited elements in view of the unanticipated and critical consequences not just for farmers, or for beef processors but for this economy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator, those points would be more relevant to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to add my congratulations to the Irish entrants in the Eurovision Song Contest and I would like to think the people here appreciate the selflessness and generosity of the British jury in awarding no points because they quite clearly saw&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there was going to be a £3 million deficit on this win.  Not many wins carry a deficit with them but this one is going to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I would like to raise concerns the beef industry &mdash; it has reached such a pitch that it is really a tragedy now.  The European partners <Col N="940" /> have been soured by the attitude of the British Government as was evidenced only recently.  However my inquiry probably arises from my newness in this Chamber.  From time to time I find myself wondering about our MEPs. They clearly are doing their job and they are in contact with people in Government and their views are being sought, but they could tell us a good deal about the mood over there as it changes.  Is there such a thing as a bulletin from our MEPs to keep us abreast of the mood and the feelings in Europe?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the remarks made by Senator Henry <i>vis-à-vis</i> the report by Justice Susan Denham on the court system. Senator Bohan referred to crime and the movement of gardaí.  In many cases this situation is aided and abetted by a Dickensian court system which is in dire need of reform.  When the report is considered by Government, I hope the Leader will encourage the Minister for Justice to appear before the House and inform us in detail of her intentions regarding its implementation.  I believe that &ldquo;justice delayed is justice denied&rdquo; and if the component parts of the justice system are deficient, the entire system will collapse.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Quinn's point, it is pure nonsense to suggest that if Europe provided us with a showcase we would debate whether to accept it.  This would be like giving £3 million to the Germans.  If we spend money, it will be spent in Ireland with the purpose of employing people, filling hotel bedrooms, etc.  It is crazy to even contemplate the Senator's point.  I am glad the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, sensible man that he is, would grasp the opportunity to showcase this country throughout Europe and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Wright on the need for a debate on agriculture.  I wish to be associated with the remarks of <Col N="941" /> Opposition Members who referred to the performance of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates.  He has been outstanding during the current crisis.  I would welcome the opportunity to hear him express his views in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators raised a number of issues.  I agree with the request made by Senator Wright and others for an early debate on the beef industry.  I doubt that time can be made available for that purpose next week but I hope it will take place within the next two weeks.  Senator Magner's point echoed that made this morning by Mr. Tommie Gorman who stated that there is general confidence and relief that this issue will be handled by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, on behalf of the European Union and Ireland during the coming months. A debate on the issue would be helpful, but this is a national question and there is very little difference between the views of interested parties as to the desired outcome.  There will be a debate on the matter at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright also raised the question of Senator Roche's Freedom of Information Bill.  I am not in a position to make Government time available in the immediate future.  However, I will facilitate Senator Roche in some way.  I am aware that he wants to change the current procedures of the House whereby only one Private Members' Bill can be introduced by any group at any given time.  If the matter is brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges it will meet no opposition from me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised the issue of Northern Ireland and I agree with him in this regard.  I do not agree with Senator McGowan because a debate on Northern Ireland before the elections could, unwittingly, cause harm, distraction or provide ammunition for people who wish to distort statements made in this House.  I am open to the possibility <Col N="942" /> of having a debate on the matter following the elections.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators, including Senator Dardis, raised the question of the Eurovision Song Contest.  The general view of Members is one of delight that Ireland won and we congratulate those who performed the Irish entry.  To suggest that we would not host next year's contest would be an act of madness, ingratitude and a vote of no confidence in ourselves.  I hope the contest is held in Ireland, even if, as Senator Rory Kiely suggested, it takes place in Limerick.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis also raised the issue of the World Equestrian Games.  The reasons the Government prudently did not support the games have been well stated.  If the Senator wishes to raise the matter on the Adjournment, however, he might obtain further information.</P>
    <P>I will convey Senator Bohan's sense of unease to the Minister for Justice at the transfer of gardaí to Border areas. The Senator has consistently and constructively raised his general concern in the House.  Next week's Private Members' Time is in the name of the Progressive Democrats and will deal with the justice issue.  Members will be provided with the opportunity to express their views at that stage.  A motion relating to the Department of Justice has also been tabled for the following week.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn raised the issue of beef and consumers.  The An Bord Bia Bill will be taken during this session and I will allow ample time for a debate on the matter so that Members can air their concerns.</P>
    <P>I agree in principle with the call for a debate on European Monetary Union. From experience, however, I know that debates on this issue have been badly subscribed to.  I will discuss the matter with the Senator who raised it and attempt to arrange a debate before the end of session.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright expressed concern about access to the National Library for the purpose of carrying out research.  I will convey his concern to the excellent <Col N="943" /> Director of the National Library.  I do not propose to make time available in the immediate future for a debate on the Amnesty report which he requested, but I am sure the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which he is a member, could debate that matter.</P>
    <P>Senators Henry and Magner raised the issue of the Denham report.  I am keen to provide time before the end of this session for a discussion on that important report and to allow us to hear the views of the Minister and the Government on it.  A radical overhaul of the courts system is long overdue and this is a sane, balanced and sensible report.  I will make inquiries on the proposal for an independent prison authority, although I do not think it is in the pipeline at the moment.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan raised the issue of Northern Ireland, to which I have referred.  Senator Lanigan raised a number of issues.  I agree with what he said about the Nigerian Government.  He might discuss water quality in supermarkets with other Members of the House. I will pass on his comments on public liability to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raised an important question on section 35.  I suspect a motion on the Adjournment would be a good way to elicit the information from the Minister, whom I am quite sure would like to discuss the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised the question of beef.  Senator McAughtry raised a question about Members of the European Parliament.  There is a provision for Members of the European Parliament to be invited to this House to share with us some of the concerns they are experiencing in Europe.  If that was thought advisable it could be activated.</P>

      <P> In page 3, lines 25 and 26, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) any deliberate disposal in the maritime area of vessels, aircraft or offshore installations,&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following amendments are being proposed: section 1 to be amended to extend the definition of &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; to include the dumping of offshore installations; section 4 (1) (a) to be amended to allow for the continuation of the complete ban on the disposal of offshore installations at sea, subject to section 5; sections 5(1) (a) and 5 (2) to be amended to enable the Minister, after consultation with other Ministers, to grant or refuse to grant a permit for the disposal of off-shore installations; and section 5 (1) (b) (ii) is being amended to require the Minister, when deciding to grant or refuse to grant a permit in respect of an offshore installation, to consider the exceptions to the provision of such dumping as set out in the new part 2 of the Second Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part 2 of the Second Schedule sets out the exceptions to the prohibition on dumping of offshore installations in accordance with the provisions of the OSPAR Convention as follows.  First, permits may only be granted in accordance with the relevant applicable decisions, recommendations and all other agreements adapted under the <Col N="945" /> convention.  Second, permits may not be granted if the offshore installation contains substances which result, or are likely to result, in hazard to human health, harm to living resources and marine ecosystems, damage to amenities or interference with other legitimate users of the sea.  Section 5 (12) and (13) are new subsections which provide that the granting of permits on a case by case basis in respect of offshore installations may only come into operation by way of a Government order which must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Government adopts a precautionary approach to the protection of the marine environment.  In the absence of sound scientific evidence that the dumping of offshore installations does not impact on the marine environment, we must legislate for the complete ban of sea disposal of offshore installations.</P>
    <P>Contracting parties to OSPAR, with the exception of Norway and the UK, adopted an agreement on a moratorium on the disposal of offshore installations at sea.  Norway and the UK have, however, agreed informally to be bound by the terms of the moratorium.  We will be pressing in OSPAR for a continuation of the current moratorium. Indeed, we will be seeking to make the current ban obligatory on all OSPAR states by having it formally enshrined in the convention.</P>
    <P>I would regard a situation involving unregulated dumping by the international community as inappropriate given the irrelevance of maritime borders for the impact of marine pollution. While the Bill extends the limit of Irish control in relation to dumping from 12 miles to 200 miles, and in some cases up to 350 miles off the Irish coast, I would be very concerned about any future unregulated dumping of offshore installations by international communities in areas immediately outside our maritime area.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the Bill matters have progressed somewhat within OSPAR.  An internationally sound basis for selective dumping may emerge <Col N="946" /> which allows for an authoritative risk categorisation of installations.  This will determine which installations may or may not be dumped.  It may well include regulatory controls underpinned by an internationally agreed monitoring and policing regime to oversee the identification of offshore installations which could be considered for dumping, the identification of suitable dump sites, preparation of the installations for dumping and the dumping operations themselves.</P>
    <P>A special working group of OSPAR experts is currently studying this issue. The EU is also preparing a report on the matter.  Thus, while it is our policy to maintain the ban, the alternative of a properly controlled international dumping regime may emerge instead.  On that basis I propose these amendments to the Bill which will allow for this possible outcome following a review of the future of the complete ban.  They are being proposed to allow Ireland to adhere to future international conventions if it emerges that an internationally accepted regime is adopted for the disposal of offshore installations. However, I do not foresee such dumping in our maritime area.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald questioned the amendment during the debate on Second Stage.  I undertook to address his concerns by requiring that commencement of the new provisions regulating the sea disposal of offshore installations be debated and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This will provide the Legislature with the opportunity to revisit the issue in the light of international scientific investigation. I assure the House that a Government order will only be proposed on the basis of total satisfaction that an internationally agreed and environmentally safe method of disposal is available.  If it is not available the ban under section 4 will remain. Senator Fitzgerald indicated on Second Stage that such an approach would satisfy his concerns.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendment. The proposal significantly strengthens the Bill.  The Minister will be aware that there is sizeable interest in offshore oil exploration, especially on the west coast.  Already, a Norwegian oil rig is operating off the west coast of County Clare and County Galway.  There were indications yesterday that there would be further sizeable investigations in a number of areas in the Connemara bank, west of County Galway, which would necessitate the boring of a number of exploratory wells.  The likelihood of pollution arising from these operations must be guarded against.  Will the Minister assure the House that it will be possible under the proposed legislation to control any dumping that may take place from installations, in addition to the dumping of installations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite happy to give Senator Daly the assurance he is seeking. I draw his attention to section 4 of the Bill which provides that a person who deliberately disposes of, or permits the disposal of, in the maritime area an offshore installation or any substance of material from any such installation will be guilty of an offence.  Similarly, the dumping of toxic harmful or noxious substances from an offshore installation, a ship, etc., is also prohibited, so the dumping of any material of that kind from an offshore installation is prohibited under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1a:</P>
      <P> In page 4, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) in the case of Harbours under the Harbours Act, 1996;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage, I drew the Minister's attention to the fact that since the Bill was initiated new legislation governing harbours passed through both Houses and, as far as I am aware, has finally been enacted.  To ensure that the new commissions and harbour authorities <Col N="948" /> which have been established here are brought under this Bill, I proposed this amendment which I feel is necessary to bring that Act into line with this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>According to legal advice available, Senator Daly's proposed amendment is not appropriate.  A harbour authority is defined in the Harbours Act, 1996, as a harbour authority within the meaning of the Act of 1946. It is, therefore, the 1946 Act that defines a harbour authority.</P>
      <P>Section 83 of the Harbours Act, 1996, provides that references in any enactment to a harbour authority shall be construed as including references to a company established pursuant to the new Act and to the local authority to which the harbour or harbour authority is transferred by way of order under the Act.  The amendment proposed by Senator Daly is not necessary as the matter is already covered by the Harbours Act, 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is assuring me that it is not necessary, I will with-draw it.  I want to be sure about that because there are a number of questions arising from the Harbours Act, 1996, with regard to particular harbours.  It was believed that when the new harbour company was established in Kilrush, County Clare, for example, the old Kilrush Harbour Authority which existed under previous legislation would disappear. That has not happened.  The existing harbour authority in Kilrush &mdash; that is, the Kilrush Urban Commissioners &mdash; might read this debate because they are still under a misapprehension as to whether they exist.  I do not know whether that is deliberate.  For the sake of clarity, we are satisfied that the new companies will be covered and that is really what I have been trying to establish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the new companies will be covered because they are <Col N="949" /> defined in the Harbours Act, 1996.  Any harbour authority is defined as a harbour authority within the meaning of the 1946 Act, which dovetails with this Bill.  Second, section 83 of the Harbours Act, 1996, provides specifically that references in any enactment &mdash; which would include this one &mdash; to a harbour authority shall be construed as including references to a company established pursuant to the Harbours Act, so the new harbour companies are included.  It will also include harbours that are transferred to a local authority, for example, if Kilrush is transferred to the local authority, it will apply similarly to the local authority which takes charge of that harbour.</P>

      <P>Section 5 (1) (a) was amended in the Dáil to provide for consultation by the Minister with any Minister of the Government when assessing an application for a dumping at sea permit. Legal advice at the time was that this amendment should be made to provide for broader consultation when applications for dumping at sea permits impinge on areas of responsibility of other Government Ministers.  The amendment I now propose is consequential on section 5 (1) (a).  Section 5 (4) as it stands provides for consultation by the Minister with the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications only when deciding to amend or revoke a permit.  The proposed amendment provides that the Minister may consult with any Government Minister that he considers appropriate.</P>

      <Col N="953" />  In page 8, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c)  The Minister shall cause to be published in at least one national newspaper a list of the permits which have been issued in each year.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that notification of the applications issued each year will be published in a national paper.  There is growing concern about, and a deep interest in, permits of this nature.  We had much discussion on the Refuse Bill about procedures for objections and for notifying the general public about proposals for licences for refuse collection, but there does not appear to be a similar mechanism in this legislation.  While a register is provided for under the previous subsection, there does not seem to be any necessity for the Minister to publish such a list either in local or national newspapers.  Can the Minister satisfy me that this is unnecessary?  Would the list be too long to publish?  Can he clarify the situation?  I would prefer if the granting of these permits were more transparent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5(9)(b) of the Bill provides that a register of all dumping at sea permits issued must be maintained and be open to inspection by the public free of charge at all reasonable times.  In addition, access to information on the 1993 environment regulations necessitates the utmost transparency in all such matters.  Information is readily available on an ongoing basis.  Detailed information is available to all members of the public at all times, therefore, I do not consider it appropriate for the Government to go to the extra expense of publishing information which is already available.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

Where is it proposed to keep the register?  If it is held at the Department of the Marine in Dublin it will be difficult to access, especially for people who want to see what dumping permits have been issued for the Shannon Estuary or off the Cork coast.  It is a long way to go.  If the register is available in local authority or fishery board offices it might help to avoid a situation where I would have to insist on newspaper publication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the purpose of Senator Daly's amendment.  He is concerned that certain people would require this information but it would only be a limited number.  The Minister could advise local fishery boards who has been granted permits in their areas. That is one way the matter could be dealt with.  People interested in fishing and the sea in general will not face a great difficulty because of this.  Most people know that information relating to marine issues can be found at the Department of the Marine.  At this stage most people have fax facilities and faxes could be sent to people who seek information. If such a situation were to arise, I ask the Minister to urge his officials to fax the information to the people concerned. I agree with the Minister as to the cost.  The cost of publishing a notice, particularly in national papers, is prohibitive. If an advertisement had to be put in every time a permit was issued, it could run to quite a bill at the end of the year.  I do not think this is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of permits runs to about 20 a year and many of them are for maintenance dredging in harbours, capital works etc.  There is no difficulty as the register is kept in the Department.  The regional fishery boards are part of the consultation process which leads to the granting of a permit and they are supplied with a copy of the permit.  This means they have the information.  Anybody who has an interest in a dumping at sea permit can <Col N="955" /> request one from the Department &mdash; this happens already &mdash; and copies of the permit are then issued to them.</P>
      <P>I do not have any difficulty with the principle of what Senator Daly is seeking here.  I agree that information of this type should be readily, and publicly, available.  Apart from the issue of cost, I am not so sure that putting an advertisement, with a list of permits issued for the year, in a national newspaper for one day is the most effective way of making this information available to the public.</P>
      <P>Under this legislation, we are required to maintain a register of the dumping at sea permits.  Any member of the public may see that register and copies of the permits issued.  We regularly supply permits to interested parties and members of the public who request them.  The regional fishery boards get copies of the permits as a matter of course.  We are repeatedly reminded that we are entering the information age when access to this type of information will not necessarily be on the inside page of a national newspaper but will probably be more appropriately available through the Internet.  If Senator Daly is happy to accept my assurance that I envisage the issue of permits as precisely the kind of information that would be available through such means, I will give it to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to lose a night's sleep over this, and I will certainly not divide the House on it.  We should endeavour to bring the public more into this arena.  The recent Waste Bill incorporated an elaborate mechanism to keep the public informed.  Even before waste licences are issued, there has to be public notice and people have the right to object, but in this legislation, that course of action is not being followed. Where we are dealing with legislation which will not be amended for another 20 years, it would be wise if the public were made aware of what is taking place, especially in our coastal areas. While I do not disagree with Senator <Col N="956" /> Taylor-Quinn, we heard about quite an amount of dumping, not so far from our locality, after it had taken place.  Had the public been aware of these operations, there may have been a different attitude adopted by the local community. We want to avoid a situation where, say, somebody goes to the register for a specific reason and discovers that a permit has been granted to dump disused army guns in their neighbourhood.</P>
      <P>What the Minister is doing here is modernising the 1981 legislation to bring it into line with international conventions. Perhaps he is not taking account of the broader picture, where issues of dumping have an impact on the locality and the public may wish to know what is taking place so that they can object if they wish.  They need to know.  In this section I am not certain they are given the opportunity to know what is happening.  Unlike the Waste Bill, this legislation is certainly not giving them the opportunity and the right to raise objections or to voice appeals.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with the principles expressed by Senator Daly.  I agree that information of this type should be easily accessible to the public and they should know where to get it.  At present it is available on request in the Department and in the regional boards.  I have no difficulty considering, between now and Report Stage, copperfastening in the Bill some way of making this information more readily available.

      <P>In view of the Minister's assurances, I withdraw the amendment. I thank the Minister for the constructive way he is dealing with this issue. However, I believe the section should be expanded so that notice be given, not only when the permits are issued, but when it is intended to issue them; this happens in other areas.  The public should be made aware and given an opportunity to raise objections and to appeal, perhaps to An Bord Pleanála, if they are not happy with a particular decision.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;Where the activity to which a permit is granted under section 5 has not been commenced within a specified period that permit shall cease to have effect.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> What I am endeavouring to do here is to give the Minister power to revoke a permit when it is not used within a specified period.  The Minister already has the authority to revoke permits so this may not be necessary.  However, he does not appear to have the power to invalidate a permit if, after a certain length of time, it is not being availed of. It would be better to have some control over permits so they would not just lie around for years.  There should be a more specific time limit.  The Minister might look at the possibility of terminating a permit if it has not been utilised within a three or six month period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides that the Minister may grant a dumping at sea permit for the dumping of a specified substance within a specified period.  The permit ceases after a specified date.  The marine licence vetting committee will recommend to the Minister the period during which a particular substance should be dumped, taking into account shipping, fishing and recreation interests as well as any other considerations they consider relevant.</P>
      <P>No start up period is specified in the permit.  This is because bad weather, technical difficulties with a vessel or other problems over which the applicant has no control could cause problems for starting up within a specified period. However, an applicant may not continue dumping after the completion date specified in a permit.  The type of permit issued provides that the dumping may take place within a certain time frame. That is done to comply with fishing, shipping and other requirements.  If the dumping has not commenced by the completion date the permit lapses.  Similarly, if the dumping is not completed by the completion date it must cease and a new application made for a permit, either to continue dumping or to dump at another time.</P>

      <P>There is no question of a dumping at sea permit continuing <i>ad infinitum.</i>  The permit states the time within which the dumping may take place.  If it is not carried out within that time frame the permit lapses.  If, for example, there is a delay in starting the dumping and it runs right up to the completion date the permit lapses and the applicant is required to make a new application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10b:</P>
      <P> In page 9, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following new paragraphs:</P>
      <P> (g)  An Officer of the Central Fishery Board so appointed shall be an authorised officer for the purposes of the Act.</P>
      <P>(h)  A Regional Fishery Board may appoint an Officer of the Board to be an authorised Officer for the purposes of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has identified certain bodies which can appoint officers.  The Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards are under the jurisdiction of the Minister of State and in the normal course of events would be covered by the section.  I presume the Marine Institute is in a similar situation. I want to ensure, through these amendments, that the Central Fisheries Board, or indeed any one of the regional fisheries boards, would have the authority to appoint an officer to implement this legislation.  If the Minister of State tells me there is sufficient power under the section as it stands, the matter will be settled.  Why was it necessary to identify <Col N="960" /> the Marine Institute and not the Central Fisheries Board?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards have an important role to play in the assessment of applications for dumping at sea permits.  An official from the Central Fisheries Board is represented on the marine licence vetting committee which assesses all dumping at sea permit applications.  The relevant regional fisheries boards are also consulted in respect of each application.</P>
      <P>Fisheries aspects of dumping at sea permits are considered in great detail by the marine licence vetting committee. This committee will submit recommendations to the Minister in respect of applications.  The recommendation will include conditions of permit which will include fisheries concerns.  The Bill already makes provision for the appointment of a wide range of technical and scientific experts as authorised officers, including fishery experts from the Marine Institute.  These authorised officers have the expertise and competence to enforce provisions of the Bill.  I therefore do not consider it necessary to burden the central and regional fisheries boards with additional duties when their concerns in relation to the impact of dumping on fisheries are taken on board, both by the marine licence vetting committee and by authorised officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the Minister of State's reply and I certainly will have to press the amendment.  I am aware that the Central Fisheries Board will be represented on the vetting committee, which is not a statutory committee. It is an <i>ad hoc</i> committee established by the Minister within the Department.  It has no statutory powers or functions of which I am aware.  To the best of my knowledge, it is a type of ministerial subcommittee that has been established within the Department. There was talk of such a measure when I was in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> Our proposal is to include a provision in the statute which gives the central or regional fisheries boards the same type of power as the Garda Síochána.  There have always been complaints and comments about the fact that the Garda authorities do not appear to give the same attention to fishery matters as the statutory fishery officers.  There were calls for more Garda involvement in local fishery protection and conservation. Some of the corporations need to be monitored on a local basis.  A local officer appointed by a regional fisheries board would be in the best position to give advice and guidance to the vetting committee and the Department.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how it would be an enormous burden on the fisheries boards.  I realise that they already operate under severe financial and personnel restrictions. However, these matters would be vital to local fishery and other interests connected with the activities of the central or regional fisheries boards.  I am at a loss to understand why the Minister cannot identify them and specify what we are proposing here.  If he wants time to look at it, I will give him all the time he wants between now and Report Stage.  It is vital that he does so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Daly.  He is quite right about the role the Garda play with regard to pollution. Whenever one takes up a newspaper and reads about the pollution of a river, it is always the fisheries boards which are on the scene and monitoring the situation. They are set up properly to deal with these matters.  Members of the Central Fisheries Board would have been on the some of the main monitoring committees but it is not the same thing.  The Minister is not really giving power to the Central Fisheries Board. In light of the fact that the boards are the main monitors of pollution in rivers and so on, I support Senator Daly's amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The officers of the Central Fisheries Board already <Col N="962" /> have an extensive amount of work and they are fairly stretched to do what is statutorily expected of them as it stands. They already have statutory obligations in relation to the pollution of inland waters.  Applications will be seriously evaluated by the Department of the Marine and the fisheries boards will have an input.  Therefore, one assumes only strictly evaluated licences will be issued.  The burdens the Senator wishes to place on the Central Fisheries Board, the regional boards and their staff would be unnecessary.</P>
      <P>It would be wise to pass the Bill as it is and if at a future date a situation was to arise where this provision proved necessary, the matter could be reviewed.  The amendment is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn with regard to the workload of the boards.  A lot of the fish which come into our rivers &mdash; white trout and salmon, for example &mdash; come from the sea.  We do not know whether the fish may have picked up some of the diseases brought into the rivers through pollution at sea.  Many arguments have been advanced about where diseases of the white trout stocks and the salmon stocks came from.  It is possible that the diseases could have been caused by pollution at sea.  Although the workload of the fisheries boards is high, they are responsible for pollution in the rivers. Pollution in the rivers can be directly linked to dumping at sea.  I support the amendment.  The fisheries boards should be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Fisheries Board and the regional boards have an important function in relation to pollution control in inland waterways. There have been two serious incidents recently resulting in major fish kills on the Shannon system at Lough Derg.  I envisage that the fisheries boards will play an increasing role in policing the pollution of inland waterways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Daly's amendment seeks to extend that function to pollution at sea. <Col N="963" /> While the fisheries boards have functions which extend to the 12 mile limit, this Bill deals with dumping at sea in an area that extends out to 350 miles.  The officers of the fisheries boards must give their priority attention to the protection of our inland waterways and it is unimaginable to give them a function which could see them working far out to sea. That would be to stretch the role of the fisheries boards far beyond what was intended.</P>
    <P>The Central Fisheries Board and the regional boards have a role in relation to the issuing of dumping at sea permits covering the issues Senator Fitzgerald addressed.  Fish come into our inland waterways from the sea and what happens at sea has an impact on our inland waterways.  That is why the fisheries boards are involved in the consultative process leading to the granting of a dumping at sea permit.  That is an important role which they will continue to play.</P>
    <P>The enforcement of breaches of the legislation are in question here.  If somebody dumps without a permit or is in breach of the conditions of a permit, certain authorised officers must have powers.  The powers are set out in this section and include boarding the vessels, arresting them, taking them to port or out to sea, holding them and bringing people before the courts.  A great deal of thought was given to deciding who would be appropriate to exercise these functions.</P>
    <P>Scientists in the Marine Institute, including those in the Fisheries Research Centre, are appropriate as are officers appointed by the Minister.  The Garda is deemed appropriate because a vessel may be brought to port and arrests may have to be made.  The Navy is also deemed appropriate.  The Radiological Protection Institute is also appropriate because the dumping of radiological materials and nuclear waste is banned in the Bill.  The harbourmaster of a harbour and the harbour authority are also appropriate.  There is no function officers of Central Fisheries <Col N="964" /> Board or the regional boards could perform that is not already provided for by one of the other categories.</P>
    <P>This is not an appropriate area in which to extend the role of the officers of the fisheries boards. There are areas in which the roles of the fisheries boards may need to be changed and extended.  That will be considered in the context of the review of the services and structures currently underway in the Department.  However, extending the role of an inland service far out to sea and giving it an enforcement power is not appropriate, particularly when the fisheries boards already have a role to play in the decision on granting a permit.</P>

      <P>The authority of the fisheries boards stops at the 12 mile limit.  Where does the authority of the Garda or the Army stop?  I would have assumed that their authority also stops at the 12 mile limit.  Dumping at sea could take place 350 miles out to sea. A member of a regional fisheries board would have to be treated in the same manner as a member of the Garda or the Army.  It is not a case of just inspecting a vessel on shore because the section refers to going out to monitor dumping and to make sure it takes place in the right place.  If the powers of the Central Fisheries Board and regional fisheries boards stop at the 12 mile limit, I would be under the impression that the powers of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces also stop at this limit and that they cannot go out 350 miles.  I think only the Naval Service has power beyond the 12 mile limit &mdash; if I am wrong the Minister can tell me.  The Minister correctly stated that the jurisdiction of the Central Fisheries Board stops at 12 miles and it would be mind <Col N="965" /> boggling to think of its jurisdiction extending to 350 miles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more worried about this section now than I was originally.  If the Minister said earlier that he could appoint an officer of a regional board or the Central Fisheries Board, I would have accepted that.  Will the officers who are to be appointed under this section be new personnel or will existing personnel be reassigned from duties they are already undertaking?  The Minister made a good case for accepting these amendments.  He said that the whole problem was a matter of enforcement. The Minister may not have details of the licences which were issued in the last year or so, but would I be right in taking it that at least half, if not more, of these permits were probably for within the 12 mile zone, where fishery boats have jurisdiction?  Enforcement of existing permits and ensuring that no illegal dumping takes place without permits will prove difficult for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works will soon begin to work on new landing facilities in Cappagh and Kilrush and on Scattery Island.  More than likely they will remove a sizeable amount of spoil from these sites.  Will they require a permit from the Minister to carry out this dumping?  If so, would it not be sensible for the local regional fisheries officer to ensure that this takes place according to the permit issued?  I am not asking for additional work to be done by conservation staff because they are already worked to the bone and find it difficult to undertake the work they must do at present.  However, in my view this is part of their normal routine duties and would be sensible in a situation where the Minister's difficulty will not be setting down legislation but ensuring that <Col N="966" /> its terms are complied with and that it is enforced fully and effectively.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána is specifically identified in the section as having this responsibility.  I am not sure how it will be able to carry this out.  In the days of the bicycle a garda would not have been able to cycle ten or 12 miles to sea.  The bulk of these licences must be issued within the 12 mile zone, in which regional boards have responsibility and where most of them have patrol boats at their disposal.  It would be sensible and wise for them to be part of the overall scheme of things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A little realism should come into this debate.  We should look at the reality of fisheries boards, their officers and equipment and how they operate.  Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Daly are reasonable and sensible fellows who are familiar with reality on the ground, at sea and on rivers and lakes.  My mind boggles to imagine fisheries boards vessels with their equipment going beyond the 12 mile limit up to a distance of 350 miles. Are we looking for casualties among fisheries boards officers?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Daly referred to the work which is to take place in Cappagh and on Scattery Island.  Regional boards are responsible for any pollution which takes place within their jurisdictions and they must be aware of this all the time.  This Bill proposes to extend the limit to 350 miles and this is most welcome.  This will require high powered naval vessels.  The helicopter service which the Minister for Justice will introduce shortly and Air Corps helicopters will also be available to survey the situation.  The case for the amendment has not been strongly made by Senator Daly and Senator Fitzgerald and I do not think they are too serious about it.  I am not sure officers of fisheries boards would welcome this additional responsibility.  Senator Fitzgerald <Col N="967" /> knows the work they must do in his area.</P>

      <P>The Minister identified the harbour authority and the Bill contains the words &ldquo;within the jurisdiction of the authority&rdquo;.  I would have no difficulty adding to the amendments the words &ldquo;within the limits of the jurisdiction of the board or the authority&rdquo;.  The only reason I did not do this was because there may be difficulties in identifying where jurisdiction begins and ends, especially where two boards meet in the eight, nine, ten or 12 mile limit.  It is not accurate for Senator Taylor-Quinn to say that fishery boards do not have some equipment.  The Shannon board, with which we would be most familiar, had an excellent and effective naval vessel for fishery protection duties and for enforcing fishery regulations on the Shannon Estuary, as the Senator knows only too well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This vessel has operated a short distance out in the Atlantic where there are many difficulties.  These officers are specialists in the area.  Some of them have worked in fisheries for many years and they are familiar with boats.  The situation of the Garda Síochána is not similar.  It has a special squad for search and rescue, but to my knowledge it does not have specialised people <Col N="968" /> for this type of operation.  I do not know of any Garda divisions with facilities for enforcing the terms of licences for dumping spoil from a harbour five or six miles out in an estuary.  The Garda Síochána does not have such resources, but the regional fishery board has.  I do not know why we are making this argument because I thought it would have been dealt with in the legislation.  The Minister mentioned the vetting committee in relation to the issuing of a licence. I am not sure if the vetting committee has any statutory obligation.  As far as I know, it is an <i>ad hoc</i> committee which was established in the Department to advise the Minister.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider the amendment.  Perhaps I could table an amended version on Report Stage to limit the jurisdiction of the regional fisheries boards within the area of their authority defined under statute.  I am even prepared to withdraw the amendment about the Central Fisheries Board and allow the regional fisheries boards to do it.  We are being as fair as we can about this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my fault.  I have no difficulty considering it before Report Stage, but I do not want to raise expectations.  There is a logical reason why each of the categories of authorised officers are included in this Bill.  If somebody is carrying out a dumping operation in normal circumstances &mdash; for example, dredge spoil &mdash; the question must be asked if they have a permit. That is straightforward.  However, where enforcement is required, more complicated questions must be asked, such as is the dumping being carried on in the appropriate site and are the conditions being complied with.  Officers from the Department and the Marine Institute are the appropriate people to make a judgment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, for example, somebody dumps material without a permit 100 miles out to sea in our maritime area, they will be spotted by camera surveillance which has been undertaken around the clock by the Air Corps.  This makes information available which would not otherwise be available.  The Navy can then apprehend whoever is dumping illegally in our maritime area.  That is why the Navy are included.  Similarly, if a vessel is brought into harbour, the harbour master has a function to fulfil, which is outlined in other legislation.  The Garda is involved because if somebody is brought into harbour for illegal dumping activity, they may have to be arrested.  The Garda may have to go on board the vessel and bring them before the courts.  The Radiological Protection <Col N="970" /> Institute is included because of the danger of dumping nuclear materials.  It is the competent authority to deal with this and its functions are set down in the Radiological Protection Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Daly want me to include a provision in the Bill that a regional fisheries board shall appoint an officer of the board to be an authorised officer for the purposes of this legislation.  I can imagine a scene somewhere off the coast of Clare where an officer from the Marine Institute says the dumping complies with the permit but the officer appointed by the regional fisheries board says it does not.  Not only would there be two appointing officers but two appointing authorities.  I know Senator Daly will draw my attention to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and other people who make such appointments.</P>

However, I am not convinced that either officers of the Central Fisheries Board or a regional fisheries board should be authorised officers for the purposes of this legislation.  I will think about it between now and Report Stage. Senator Daly and Senator Fitzgerald have already seen some of the flaws in their amendment and have mentioned redrafting it.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for listening to our arguments. On Second Stage Senator Cashin mentioned the dumping of ballast water. <Col N="971" /> The dumping of ballast water could happen on the Shannon, as far as Limerick, or between New Ross and Waterford. Other pollution could happen in those places as well, which are now under the jurisdiction of the regional fisheries board and the Central Fisheries Board. The Garda Síochána is included in this legislation.  Rivers, such as the Shannon, the Barrow and the Nore are rich in salmon and other fish.  There are two instances where Central Fisheries Board officers would come into play and maybe there is other legislation that gives them the power in cases like that but these two instances would clearly give them the authority and they should have the authority to act.</P>

      <P>If, for instance, the new commercial Limerick authority, which may be more disposed towards commercial than fishery activities, were involved and it was written into this legislation that a harbour authority can appoint an officer, that officer may be more disposed towards commercial activity <Col N="972" /> within the harbour than considering any ill-effects that activity might have on the fishery interests &mdash; not alone salmon and trout fisheries but aquaculture and the development of mariculture which is expanding.</P>
      <P>The Marine Institute has one boat, the <i>Lough Beltra</i>, which is involved in a series of worthwhile projects some of which were announced earlier this year. The institute plans to have a new boat at their disposal but at the moment it has one boat for the whole coastline. The Minister of State knows that better than I do; he knows what the programme is.  I was critical of those proposals when he announced them because there was not one research project into the problems connected with pollution in the £2 million programme.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister of State saying that under section 6, because the boards are statutory and report to him, he could appoint officers of the board to be authorised officers?  He did not make it clear.  Is he appointing new officers under this section or will he be using existing personnel or reallocating them to deal with this matter?  These are the issues that concern us.  I cannot accept that the fishing interest is not a valid one which must be taken into account when considering the issue of dumping licences.  These amendments are not only desirable but essential.</P>

      <P>Yes, that is the intention. The question of ballast water is not specifically dealt with in this Bill; it comes under the Sea Pollution Act.  It is an area that is currently under consideration by the International Maritime Organisation and is getting quite a lot of <Col N="973" /> attention because of the long distances many vessels travel now and the potential environmental problems that are associated with ballast water from one part of the globe being discharged in another.

I also said that there were specific reasons the other categories were being included as authorised officers.  I am prepared to think about the issues that have been raised.

They had bad conditions, bad pay and were not respected by the general public who shot at them, abused them and tried to terrorise them.  In this case where we are identifying certain people who will have some responsibility in a matter as serious as this, and where they will have such impact on one of our major natural resources &mdash; our fisheries &mdash; it is vital that they have a role and a responsibility and they be identified and clearly written into the Bill.</P>

      <P>Under section 7 (2) the Minister or the authority may bring a prosecution.  I would like the Minister of State to clarify that.  The point I made on earlier sections is that there may be a feeling abroad that the new commercial harbours especially may be more oriented towards commercial activities at the expense of the conservation and protection of a valuable resource like fisheries.</P>

      <P>Under the Harbours Bill which has passed both Houses of the Oireachtas the new harbour companies are being given certain statutory obligations not only in relation to the commercial activities in their ports but also for the protection of the environment and the amenities in the harbour areas.  The harbour authority will not have an entirely blinkered commercial focus and the harbour master in particular has certain functions in relation to environmental matters, such as dumping and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 (2) provides that, where an offence was committed, proceedings may be brought by either the harbour authority or the Minister.  In the <Col N="975" /> unlikely event that a harbour company did not take proceedings against a person who dumped waste in a harbour, the Minister could initiate those proceedings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>An amendment to section 11 was passed by the Dáil to make provision for the Attorney General to prosecute offences committed under the Dumping at Sea Bill because of the international and diplomatic complications which can arise in cases of this kind.  Until now such offences were prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Offences under the Dumping at Sea Bill are not like ordinary offences in our jurisdiction and may involve relations with other countries. It is important that the Attorney General be involved in the actual prosecution because he sits with the Government and is aware of the diplomatic and international perspectives involved in prosecuting such offences.  Maritime law is a very specialised area and is traditionally dealt with by the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is consequential on section 11.  Section 10 (2) (b) of the Bill, as it stands, provides that a judge of the District Court will have jurisdiction to try an offence summarily when the Director of Public Prosecutions consents. As section 11 provides that the Attorney General will prosecute offences under this Bill, it follows that the Bill should be amended to provide that the District Court should have <Col N="976" /> jurisdiction to try an offence summarily when the Attorney General consents.</P>

      <P>Section 15 repeals the 1981 Act.  During the Second Stage debate I stated that it would not be desirable to completely repeal the 1981 Act on the basis that the new Bill might not be adequate to deal with situations which may be covered under the old legislation. In the past legislation was repealed and it was discovered that the new legislation could not deal adequately with problems that arose.  I understand that two Acts which referred to the Minister of State's Department's responsibility for aquaculture were found to be inadequate in this regard. Despite this fact, however, he has introduced a third Act of that kind.  The 1981 <Col N="977" /> Act is not a very old piece of legislation. If there is any question about some of the new provisions, it might be more useful to see how the Bill operates before dispensing with the 1981 Act in its entirety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1981 Act is being replaced by this Bill.  There is nothing in the 1981 Act that is not covered by the new Bill, which goes far beyond the provisions of the previous legislation.  This Bill is a much stronger piece of legislation than the 1981 Act and effectively bans the dumping of all materials with the exception of dredged spoil.  It greatly limits the materials that may be dumped at sea and such materials can can only be dumped on foot of a permit.</P>
      <P>This legislation goes far beyond the scope of the 1981 Act and draws upon the increased environmental awareness which came about during the 1980s and the early 1990s.  It also draws on the considerable agreement at international level to replace the Oslo and Paris Conventions, which dealt with dumping at sea, with a combined convention called OSPAR.  The primary purpose of this legislation is to enable Ireland to ratify the OSPAR Convention and it completely replaces the 1981 Act.  It is better to achieve our aims in this way rather than introducing an amending Act, the provisions of which would be unnecessarily complicated and would constantly refer to the earlier legislation.  Where possible, it is desireable to have a single comprehensive piece of legislation which is easy to consult, understand and access.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we conclude our deliberations on this section, I wish to draw the Minister of State's attention to an inadequacy in the 1981 Act concerning the public in general.  In the past permits were granted, by and large, without the public being given a responsibility for or input into developments in this regard.  Perhaps the Minister of State might consider before Report Stage whether it might be desireable to include a section to give the general <Col N="978" /> public a say in decisions on the granting of permits before they are issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated earlier, this Bill goes far beyond the scope of the 1981 Act.  It extends Ireland's maritime area from 12 to 350 miles and completely bans the dumping of toxic, noxious and radioactive materials other than in cases of limited background radiation or those approved by the Radiological Protection Institute.  The Bill also limits the dumping of material at sea to a large extent.  It establishes a regime where the type of dumping that may be permitted is extremely limited.  There is no point in anyone applying to the Minister for the Marine for a permit to dump noxious or toxic materials.  Such applications will be unsuccessful because they cannot be permitted under the legislation.</P>
      <P>The critical difference between this legislation and the 1981 Act is that this Bill bans a range of materials from being dumped in the sea.  For example, under a procedure in this Bill one must apply to the Minister for a permit to dump dredge spoil from maintenance dredging of a harbour.  An extensive consultative process is undertaken and underpinned by a scientific evaluation. For example, the dump site is normally assessed independently to ascertain whether it is suitable to take the material.  As we discussed earlier, a register is kept of dumping permits and that information is accessible to the public.  I am, as I mentioned earlier, prepared to consider ways in which that might be made even more accessible. The bottom line as far as this legislation is concerned is that dumping at sea, particularly the dumping of poisonous materials or materials which would damage the marine environment and food chain, is banned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very strict procedure is being set down in this legislation covering the limited circumstances where an application may be made to dump material at sea. Very stiff penalties are being set down for breaches of the legislation.  The courts are being given unlimited powers to impose fines which will reflect the <Col N="979" /> cost of undoing the damage caused by illegal dumping at sea.  Similarly, there are powers in the Bill whereby vessels found dumping at sea may be taken in and held until the damage has been undone or the cost has been paid.  The Bill also covers vessels which are loaded or flagged in this jurisdiction and which dump anywhere in the world.  It is very tight and advanced marine environmental legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The First Schedule lists what can and cannot be dumped. The dumping of fish at sea is a problem because it cannot be avoided.  At certain times of the year fishermen catch large amounts of fish &mdash; probably mackerel or blue whiting &mdash; for which they are entitled to be compensated.  An inspector from the Department of the Marine inspects the fish and sprays them with a dye and the fish are then taken out to sea again.  I have no problem with that because it is said of us that &ldquo;dust thou art and unto dust thou shalt return&rdquo; and the same line could apply to fish &mdash;&ldquo;fish you are and unto fish you shall return&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want our fishermen to be too restricted because we make them dump the fish.  The Minister is going to Dingle at the weekend because he wants to see Fungi, and he will be very welcome.  However, I am sure he will be approached by two fish factories there which have problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is a very modern and up to date factory which processes shellfish. They are obliged by law to grind the empty shells in a crusher and take the <Col N="980" /> resulting small pieces to the dump.  They have been in business for the last couple of years, but to date they have not found a satisfactory crusher.  They were dumping the shells off the side of a cliff in a place where nobody would see, but objections were made to that.  I helped them out, as did the harbour master in Dingle, and the shells now have to be dumped at sea, which is an extra cost for the factory.</P>
    <P>The second factory processes mostly fish.  A new sewage treatment plant was opened in Dingle a year ago, which is magnificent.  However, nobody warned the fish processors about it and they are now faced with huge costs as a result. The minimal amount of sludge which goes from the factory into the sewage treatment plant renders the plant inoperative because the fish oil prevents the bacteria in the plant from working.  The council has to install a new gadget and has already written to the owners of fish factories in Dingle stating they will have to pay £140 a day to allow the main waste from the factories into the treatment plant.  An extra cost of £140 a day is a great deal of money for a fish factory. If they had been told about this in advance, or if those planning the sewage treatment plant had done their job properly, they would not have to pay this cost.</P>
    <P>Those two problems are related to dumping at sea.  The shellfish processor has nowhere to dump the shells.  Údarás na Gaeltachta tried to help him find a suitable machine to crush the shells in accordance with the regulations.  He would buy a machine tomorrow morning if he could, but he has tried three or four machines which all broke down.  He is faced with the huge cost of dumping the shells at sea.  The other factory owner is also faced with a huge cost.  I am sure the Minister will be told about these problems at the weekend.</P>
    <P>In regard to the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fish we have to dump at sea every year, will fishermen be restricted in this dumping?  Will they have to go through the paperwork required for a permit?  Will they have to <Col N="981" /> pay money which might make it not worth their while to catch these fish? The fish have to be dumped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that these are exceptions to the general rule. A couple of years ago there was a sizeable amount of pollution along the west County Clare coastline when waste oil or waste material from washed out tanks was dumped.  The Minister has not made the necessary resources available to ensure enforcement of the proposed legislation.  It is not his fault as he is limited by the Minister for Finance in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is time a message was sent to the Minister for Finance that on such matters substantial costs are involved, because we have been unable to identify some of the sources of this oil pollution. Clare County Council and Kerry County Council are still awaiting substantial settlements from the Department of the Marine for oil clean ups which they had to undertake on the beaches at Kilkee, Lahinch, Ballybunion and along the coastline due to the licensed or indiscriminate washing out of tanks in the high seas.</P>

      <P>It will not be possible to do this under the exemptions contained in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  Paragraph (b), which refers to inert materials, is concerned with materials of natural origin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  It will not be possible for oil to be exempted. On the question of resources, we would all prefer if there were more resources <Col N="984" /> available for environmental protection of all types, including marine environmental protection.  However, improvements have been made in this area.  The provision in the Bill puts the onus for paying for the cost of pollution on the polluter and includes provisions for the seizing of the vessel from which the pollution comes and the impounding of that vessel until either the clean up has been completed and paid for, or the owner or master has paid a bond or a security for the amount that is estimated it will cost to carry out the clean up.</P>
      <P>The most recent example of oil pollution was the case of the <i>Sea Empress.</i> We monitored the situation from the moment the ship ran into trouble in Milford Haven.  We were in regular contact with the UK authorities, had an officer present on the site and had close liaison with the meteorological service, obtaining regular reports on wind direction, weather conditions etc.  We also had aerial surveillance in the Irish Sea to establish if there was any movement of the oil slick.  When some of the oil eventually appeared in the form of little particles, the Marine Institute undertook its own independent investigations, travelled to Milford Haven, compared the samples and was able to establish a case for the local authorities concerned which enabled them to lodge a claim with the insurers of the ship.</P>
      <P>There has been a considerably improved capability with regard to surveillance. There is now a clear policy that, irrespective of the source of the pollution, ultimately it is the polluter who must bear the cost of the clean up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the cases I mentioned, the polluter could not be identified. Senator Taylor-Quinn, who is a member of Clare County Council, will be aware that the council did a clean up and was expecting reimbursement &mdash; it continues to await it, two or three years after the event &mdash; from the Department of the Marine, as this was the understanding under which the work was undertaken.  Perhaps the Minister of State could investigate the matter to <Col N="985" /> ascertain if it is possible to reimburse the council at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Clean ups have been a consistent issue with local authorities in that the expenses incurred by them remain outstanding for a considerable number of years.  It is an unsatisfactory situation, especially when it is so important to maintain what are essentially resort areas which depend on a good seaside environment for tourism purposes.</P>
      <P>Given the progressive approach adopted by the Minister of State within his Department, I hope he will have these matters investigated and will encourage the Department to be more forthcoming on the making of payments to local authorities.  It is a significant issue for them, especially when they face so many other expenditure demands.</P>
      <P>It is important that priority be given to environmental issues.  There is a danger that if moneys are not paid the importance of such issues will decrease, which is not wise.  We are all becoming increasingly aware of the need to protect our environment and to maintain standards.  It is important that every Department plays its part in this.</P>
      <P>The Second Schedule to the Bill is interesting.  I hope that by 1998 all local towns, especially those currently dumping raw sewage into the sea and the rivers, will have secondary treatment plants in place.  The Minister and the Government are proceeding seriously to ensure this.</P>
      <P>Why is there an exclusion for aircraft and vessels to 31 December 2004? Senator Fitzgerald spoke earlier about returning to the earth what is the earth's and to the sea what is the sea's.  The constituent parts of aircrafts and vessels did not emanate from the sea.  The sooner this exemption can be lifted and brought closer to the year 2000 the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>First, with regard to the issues raised by Senator Daly and Senator Taylor-Quinn, where local <Col N="986" /> authorities find themselves faced with the cost of a clean up operation and it is not possible to identify the polluter, I want to inform Senators that I will be submitting some proposals in that regard to Government shortly which I hope will be helpful to the local authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>Second, the exemption for vessels and aircraft until 31 December 2004 is that which is provided for in the OSPAR Convention. Therefore, after the year 2004, which I hate to remind everybody is less than eight years away, it will not be possible to dump aircraft or vessels in the sea within the OSPAR area.</P>
      <P>In practice, as far as Ireland's maritime area is concerned, the State does not give permits for the dumping of aircraft or vessels, so it does not actually arise.  The existing position with regard to Ireland's maritime area is that there is no dumping of either aircraft or vessels. I must say I cannot recall any application in recent times for the dumping of either aircraft or vessels, so it does not arise in practice in Ireland's maritime area.  The provision is in this Bill in order to comply with the general provisions of the OSPAR agreement.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> That Seanad Éireann notes the continuing efforts of the Minister for <Col N="987" /> the Environment in his efforts to reduce the number of fatalities and accidents on the roads; and welcomes his new guide to road safety in Ireland as a welcome contribution in tackling this major problem.</P>
    <P>There have always been deaths on the road.  A small headline in a newspaper stated recently that road fatalities show increases.  It reported that the number of deaths on Irish roads for the first three months of the year increased from 81 in 1995 to 91 in 1996.  The size of the headline was small but the numbers were not.  In 1995, 437 died and over 9,000 people were injured as a result of road accidents in Ireland.  That is the worst death rate since 1991, representing an average of 36 per month. The injury numbers, though showing a marginal improvement, do not offer much comfort.  The reality is that the vast majority of these accidents could have been avoided by road users, whether it be drivers, pedestrians, cyclists or motor cyclists.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency in this country to take road traffic accidents for granted. It is true that they have always existed and always will.  However, as a society we have a duty to minimise the number of accidents on our roads.  To this end I congratulate the Minister on the measures he announced earlier this month.  The Minister is absolutely correct to identify the number of deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents in this State as unacceptable and to make an issue of this problem despite the high level of public indifference to it.  I welcome him to the House and commend him on the stand he has taken on this issue.</P>
    <P>Earlier this month the Minister published two campaigns on the area of road accidents &mdash;<i>Road Safety Together</i>, a campaign to promote road safety awareness and a guide to road safety engineering in Ireland.  Both have been compiled after extensive consultation with the Department of Justice, the Garda Síochána, the National Roads <Col N="988" /> Authority, the National Safety Council and the Irish Insurance Federation.  All are agreed on the importance of emphasising the responsibility of the road user. The cost of insurance claims and litigation is tremendous.  If it could be reduced, it would reduce the cost of policies for road users.  Any increases will only increase the cost of insurance for everybody.</P>
    <P>The measures announced in this plan involve a transference of responsibility for road safety to the county councils. Local authorities already play a significant role in the promotion of road safety.  They are involved in everything from road construction to the school warden system.  Under the new scheme local authorities have agreed to take on more responsibility for road safety.  In addition the Minister envisages the establishment of local authority led teams comprising engineers, gardaí and teachers to promote road safety at a local level.  The obvious advantage of such an approach is that the focus of delivery will be at the most appropriate level.</P>
    <P>The school warden system has got off to a great start.  Not only do they regulate traffic flow, they also increase awareness among young people of dangers on the road.  The young wardens involved in carrying out this work see for themselves the dangers facing the public.  They are on the crossings, taking up positions, being watchful of traffic and allowing their school mates to move from the schoolyard across the road in safety.  I compliment the work done by the county road safety officers together with sponsors and the teachers in the schools who monitor the day to day running of the scheme.  It is good to see young people taking care.  They are glad to have the responsibility and it will do them and everybody else good.  These measures complement the media campaign to be run by the National Safety Council.  That campaign will highlight the dangers of drink driving and speeding and should be targeted especially at young drivers, whose involvement in <Col N="989" /> accidents is disproportionate to the number on the road.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiatives underway in relation to driving training.  The driving tests and the registration of driving instructors should go some way to improving the standard of new drivers and should impact considerably on the quality of new drivers coming on to the road.  Hopefully, it will also mean a reduction in the large number of road traffic offences which must be dealt with by the courts.</P>
    <P>The publication of the guide to road safety engineering is also welcome.  Its purpose is to provide information to local authorities on how they can minimise road accidents on new roads in their areas.  We have seen considerable improvements in the quality of our roads, both nationally and locally.  This improvement is set to continue, thanks again to the recent package announced by the Minister for further work on our non-national roads.  It involves a record amount of money.  I thank and compliment the Minister for giving this money to the local authorities to improve the standard of our county roads over a number of years.  I support the Minister's decision to ensure that these roads will be subject to close scrutiny with a view to reducing their capacity to cause accidents.</P>
    <P>The plan also seeks to compile statistics relating to road accidents in single areas or along certain routes to identify areas where remedial work is required. It seeks to address these problems by the implementation of relatively low cost engineering measures.  Very often there are certain bends along rural roads which are noted for their danger. Locals know them but strangers coming into an area will not be aware of the danger.  A small amount of work, such as removing a fence or obstacles like trees and branches, can improve the sight distance.  We should earmark areas for such work.  Small improvements could make a big difference.</P>
    <P>It can cost a large amount of money to remove or improve a bridge or a dangerous section of rock.  However, if <Col N="990" /> sight distance was improved to enable people to see what is coming, it could make a great difference and alleviate the problems.  This would go a long way towards stopping accidents on the small and narrow roads throughout our countryside.  On occasion improvement works are carried out and one then has long stretches of very good road.  As a result, people settle into driving at a reasonable speed, when all of a sudden they are faced with a bottleneck such as a bend, a bridge or a humpback, and could have a crash as a result.  We need to have those improved or highlighted in a better way.</P>
    <P>Speed limits are put on straight stretches of road in the approach to towns.  It is my firm conviction that these only encourage people to break the law.  One can have a stretch of road with a hard shoulder and a straight footpath. Because there are a few houses on that stretch of road a 40 miles per hour speed limit is imposed, but cars often travel along there at a higher speed &mdash; although people are obliged to comply with road signs they often do not.  We should consider carefully before imposing 30 miles per hour and 40 miles per hour speed limits which will be disregarded.</P>
    <P>Signposting is not properly standardised throughout the country &mdash; for example, different areas have different signs to indicate that there is work ahead.  Also, signs are sometimes left on roads after the work has been done, which makes people think that even though the sign is up, there may be nothing ahead.  We must consider these factors if we want to avoid accidents.</P>
    <P>The Minister's package is a comprehensive package to deal with the dangers posed to road users in this State. As his press release states, it addresses the four main areas for the promotion of road safety, or the &ldquo;four Es&rdquo;&mdash; engineering, enforcement, education and encouragement.  As a result of this package, I have no doubt that people who might otherwise have been killed will survive.  Rather than viewing this as a piecemeal measure, the House should <Col N="991" /> welcome and endorse this important step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I am delighted the Minister is here for the debate and I congratulate him on his initiative in implementing the scheme.  I am pleased to contribute to this debate and am glad that the Minister has taken this topic on board for serious consideration. I congratulate him for putting it on our agenda.</P>
      <P>We are inclined to be offhand about road safety.  When a person is killed in a road accident we lament the loss and go about our business until it happens again.  Regrettably, many accidents are still drink related.  There is a greater awareness of the risks and consequences associated with drink driving, but some people are still irresponsible and put the lives of others at risk by driving when they are not in a fit condition to do so.</P>
      <P>The Minister is putting an emphasis on the contribution which local authorities can make in this area and I am very much in favour of that.  As members of local authorities we complain from time to time that we do not have a role.  However, this is an area where a local authority can take an initiative to do what it can to reduce the risks to life and limb resulting from road accidents.  In this regard I also support the Minister's suggestion that a properly co-ordinated effort at local level between the local authority, gardaí, teachers and others could make a significant contribution to road safety.</P>
      <P>A special effort should be made to target young road users in order to drive home the message of road safety.  The National Safety Council would support local initiatives of the kind referred to above in teaching the young about civic responsibility, consideration for and courtesy to others in the use of the public roads, and the simplest but most vital of all the safety messages &mdash; if you drink, do not drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Kildare is covered with motorways and dual carriageways and there is an urgent need for speed controls <Col N="992" /> on these roads.  In recent weeks two people were killed and a number seriously injured within 100 yards of each other in Kill.  As someone who uses those roads several times a week, I think it imperative that we introduce automatic camera speed controls as seen in other countries.  It is not unusual for cars to travel at 90 to 100 miles per hour along those roads and it is frightening to see those speeds on dual carriageways. This should be reviewed as soon as possible. Automatic cameras are a necessity if we are to avoid fatalities &mdash; at present we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg, because the N7 and N9 are becoming the race tracks of Europe.</P>
    <P>While the topic of road safety may not ignite debate in this House, it is as important as any that the Minister will bring here during his period in the Department of the Environment.  He is doing us proud as a Minister and his approach to this issue is in keeping with his outstanding record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those Senators who have spoken so far and sincerely welcome this opportunity to speak to the House about the continuing efforts of my Department and the Government to improve road safety and to reduce the daily toll of death and injury that is an unfortunate feature of traffic on our roads.  While the trend in numbers of fatalities has been downwards in the 1990s when compared to the 1980s, this is small comfort to the families and friends of the 437 people who died and the 9,000 injured in road accidents in 1995.  The sad reality is that most of those accidents could have been avoided by the road user &mdash; the driver, pedestrian, cyclist or motorcyclist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The summer of 1995 had a particularly bad record for road accident deaths and injuries.  While I cannot offer scientific reasons for that seasonal increase, I can point out that speed and drink driving were highlighted as significant contributory factors to accidents in that period.  Because of my unease about that alarming increase, I had a <Col N="993" /> review of road safety policy carried out under the auspices of my Department's high level group on road safety.  Inputs to the review were made by the Department of Justice, the Garda, the National Roads Authority, the National Safety Council and the Irish Insurance Federation. The agencies and bodies involved all agreed that it is necessary to focus on working together to increase the effectiveness of their engineering, enforcement, education and encouragement measures, to highlight the responsibility of the road user and to continue to seek new ways to tackle and, we hope, to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>In presenting the results of the assessment on 16 May, I focused on the theme &ldquo;Road Safety Together&rdquo;.  I outlined a set of road safety measures which are to be implemented over the coming months, all aimed at improving the standard of safety on our roads through the prevention and reduction of accidents.  I also announced the publication by my Department of a guide to road safety engineering in Ireland which is already becoming known as the &ldquo;blackspots manual&rdquo;.  I have arranged to have copies of this placed in the Oireachtas Library. The guide is a code of good practice for the treatment of high accident stretches of roads by means of low-cost engineering measures.  It is for use mainly by local authority engineers, technicians and draughtsmen and will assist them with advice and guidance in identifying, analysing and treating high risk sections of road and dealing with accident blackspots on the road network.</P>
    <P>The guide explains how accidents happen.  It describes the importance of good quality statistical data on accidents and how such data can be stored and used for identifying and diagnosing road accident problems.  Valuable advice is also provided for local authorities on road safety planning and on the development of a road safety strategy for their areas of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Engineering solutions to both accident reduction and prevention are explored.  The suggested approaches to <Col N="994" /> accident reduction are based on ways of intervening where there is a known high accident record.  Accident prevention is more likely to be related to new roads or improvement schemes where there are potential risks associated with their design or construction.  For each category, detailed advice is given as to how to identify, analyse, prioritise and treat the problem.  Case studies, diagrams and photographs are used to illustrate the various types of situation covered. Guidance is also given on monitoring the effectiveness of remedial measures implemented.  This is most important in these days when there is a high demand for value for money from all public expenditure.</P>
    <P>While the guide concentrates to a large extent on methods of reducing the number and severity of accidents, it also places a strong emphasis on accident prevention.  For this, a systematic means of safety checking is recommended in the course of the design process of new roads; for the situation where road improvements are being carried out; and to deal with cases where there are no accident records.</P>
    <P>Some of these measures will have already been noted by Members of the House as they travel around the country. The National Roads Authority invested £750,000 last year and has budgeted for expenditure of £1 million this year on these remedial measures. They have the short term impact of accident reduction and the long-term impact of accident prevention.  But this is only one of the angles from which we are endeavouring to combat the scourge of road accidents causing injury and death.</P>
    <P>Education is in many ways the most important element of our road safety activities.  It is the means by which we hope to influence behaviour in the longer term.  That is why my Department, the National Safety Council and the Health Promotion Unit in the Department of Health are making a new input to the school curriculum on road safety.  It is never too early to start.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> It is a known and worrying fact that young people feature disproportionately in Ireland's road accident statistics. Having regard to both the long term and short term impacts of our road safety activities, we must look to parents as well as schools to help to change attitude and behaviour, and to help us, with our young people, to build a more road safe future for us all.</P>
    <P>I have announced two other road safety education measures.  First, with the National Safety Council I am supporting financially the establishment of a voluntary register of driving instructors. Instructors are currently being examined for the purpose of qualifying for this register.  The aim is to have the first group of qualified instructors giving instruction next month.  I hope the scheme will raise the standard of instruction generally, provide for some reduction in the cost of car insurance for novice drivers, and in particular for young drivers, and that the resultant improvement in driver standards will contribute to safer use of our roads.  In essence, the idea is that the Irish Insurance Federation will provide cheaper insurance to those young people who have undertaken an agreed number of lessons from instructors who have qualified under the approved scheme.</P>
    <P>Second, because the scope of the theory element of the driving test currently operated in this country is not sufficiently broad to meet the latest European Union standards, I will make regulations this year to introduce a theory test for new drivers in accordance with EU requirements.  It is my belief that both the new theory test I propose to introduce and the register of driving instructors which is well on the way to being put in place will contribute significantly to raising the standard of new driver education, especially among young drivers, and that these measures will impact positively in the medium and long-term on road safety in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As Senator Calnan said, speeding continues to be highlighted as a major <Col N="996" /> contributory factor in road accidents. We are not just talking about exceeding speed limits, but also about inappropriate speed for the prevailing conditions. By law a driver must not drive a vehicle at a speed exceeding that which will enable him or her to stop within the distance he or she can see to be clear.  Can any or all of us put our hands on our hearts and declare honestly that we always comply with this requirement?</P>
    <P>I will take this opportunity to quote to you from the latest National Safety Council radio advertisement on speeding. It says very bluntly and clearly: &ldquo;Wise up.  Slow down.  Expect the unexpected&rdquo;. We all think we can handle speed, but when the unexpected happens we cannot.  Too many people discover this to their cost, in serious injury or even death.</P>
    <P>The analysis of road accident reports for last summer, carried out at my request by the National Roads Authority, pointed once again to speed and drink driving as being significant contributory factors to road accidents. While all road users are vulnerable, the analysis highlighted the fact that young road users, pedestrians and motorcyclists are particularly at risk.</P>
    <P>The media campaigns of the National Safety Council are designed to raise public awareness of road safety, to remind road users of the dangers, and to encourage safer driving and safer use of our roads.  The council, which is financially supported by my Department and by the Irish Insurance Federation, has taken the results of the 1995 analysis into account in planning its media campaign for this year.  A new TV advertisement on the drink driving theme will be screened in June.  The new radio advertisements dealing with the risks of speeding, which I have already quoted from, are already running.</P>
    <P>The council will also target elderly pedestrians, motorcyclists and schoolchildren in various campaigns throughout the year.  While the National Safety Council will be highlighting drink driving and speeding on TV and radio over the summer months, the Garda will be <Col N="997" /> out there to enforce these messages on the ground.  I have spoken directly to the Deputy Garda Commissioner on this matter and he has given me an absolute assurance that there will be strict enforcement to do what the Garda can to ensure that last summer's increase in fatalities and accidents are not repeated this year.  Enforcement of traffic law is critical to increasing road safety levels and there is a continuing need for unrelenting attention to this by the Garda, who have promised vigorous and sustained enforcement in 1996.</P>
    <P>It has been said that a careful driver is one who has just spotted the traffic police.  I am pleased, therefore, that the Garda Síochána have planned a range of activities for the months ahead, including a continued focus on speeding, drink driving, dangerous driving and not wearing seat belts.  For my part, I instructed my Department some time ago to work with the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána on the introduction of a system of on-the-spot fines for speeding offences.  We hope to have this in place before too long.  I envisage that the system will be applied to more minor transgressions of speed limits rather than to serious offences where prosecutions should not be avoided.  The amount of the fine will be pitched in such a way as to encourage voluntary payment and, at the same time, to ensure that the penalty fits the severity of the crime.  It is our ambition to get gardaí out of the courts, so that they are not spending their time trying to prosecute cases, and onto the streets to carry out the critical job of enforcing the law.</P>
    <P>Significant changes in drink driving laws introduced in 1994 and 1995, combined with intensive media campaigns by the National Safety Council and enforcement campaigns by the Garda Síochána, have brought about a welcome change in attitude and behaviour in relation to drink driving, especially over the Christmas period.  This was not reflected, however, in the summer of 1995, as was indicated in the accident analysis I have already mentioned.  As a <Col N="998" /> result, the National Safety Council and the Garda will intensify their anti-drink driving campaigns this summer to remind road users of the risks and to crack down on those who break the law.</P>
    <P>Most of the initiatives which I have described are coming from the centre. Although they will have widespread application and effect, there is scope for a unified road safety effort by both public and private interests at local level, including sponsorship of campaigns.  It makes sense for road safety campaigns to be related, wherever possible, to local circumstances and to the local environment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the support of local authorities for my request for an enhanced involvement by them in road safety efforts.  Their strength lies particularly in their closeness to local communities. There is great scope for them to maximise their influence locally in support of road safety promotion.</P>
    <P>While much has been and is being done at local level, activity is often carried out by one agency in isolation from the activities of others.  I have already spoken about co-ordinating efforts at national level, and have put measures in train; but it is also important that this should permeate outwards and downwards. The model I now propose is the local authority, through specially designated officers, leading a local working group involving engineers, the Garda Síochána, teachers and others to promote road safety locally.</P>
    <P>I will be providing further assistance to local authorities later this year with the publication of a new traffic signs manual and the making of traffic and parking regulations.  The manual will provide traffic engineers with full information on all aspects of road signage in Ireland, including the standards required to ensure that road users receive a message clearly and in good time.  It should impact positively on road safety by setting the high standards for signposting which are necessary for a safe and efficient road network.</P>
    <P>I propose to make new general traffic regulations which will replace all existing <Col N="999" /> general and local traffic, parking bye-laws and temporary rules.  These regulations will have the effect of consolidating road traffic controls into a single understandable code and will streamline and simplify their administration.</P>
    <P>In summary, we will have more of the four &ldquo;E's&rdquo; that Senator Calnan spoke about &mdash; enforcement of the law by the Garda Síochána; engineering by the local authorities to deal with accident blackspots, and education and encouragement by schools and the National Safety Council, to bring about an attitudinal and behavioural change.  The enhanced co-ordination role of local authorities will help to focus this activity at local and regional level.</P>
    <P>It is now up to road users to play their critical role.  The organisations I have outlined cannot do the job alone.  An effective road safety programme means all of us working together to reduce accident numbers and the resulting deaths and injuries, which are totally unacceptable and continue to occur on our roads system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not intend to oppose the motion.  Any constructive suggestions from the Minister to help deal with the carnage of accidents on our roads will be supported by this side of the House.  We are not going to play party politics with this matter as it is too serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of years successive Ministers for the Environment have campaigned vigorously to reduce the number of deaths on Irish roads.  Road safety campaigns, public advertising programmes, new legislation and many other methods have been used in an effort to minimise the number of road deaths and injuries.  Each new campaign has been publicly promoted, but the toll of death and injury continues to rise, bringing tragedy and misery to many families and pain to thousands of people each year.  As Senator Calnan said when proposing the motion, every year over 400 people die in road accidents and <Col N="1000" /> over 10,000 people are injured, many of them for life.  Those in wheelchairs are testimony to the tragedy we have seen on our roads over the years.</P>
    <P>The continuing high level of death and injury is a cause of deep concern and no effort must be spared in attempting to reduce the carnage.  The 1994 legislation, which was introduced by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, reduced alcoholic levels for driving and was the subject of much criticism at the time.  Nevertheless, it focused public attention on the dangers of driving with excess alcohol more than any other legislation which was introduced in the past ten or 20 years.  The early signs of the impact and effect of that legislation were very positive.</P>
    <P>The international trend has been towards eliminating drinking and driving completely.  We have to work towards that situation.  Driving-related accidents seem to be a major factor in road deaths.  No effort must be spared in eliminating drinking and driving.  No words of ours here could adequately express our deepest sympathy and understanding to all those who have lost relatives and friends in tragic accidents. Laws, penalties and campaigns alone will not end these tragedies.  The public will have to accept drinking and driving is a recipe for catastrophe, and it must end.</P>
    <P>Roads are the dominant internal transport system in Ireland.  Successive reports have indicated substantial investment is needed to put them in a reasonably sound state of repair.  In Ireland we have 92,300 kilometres of roads, which is twice that of Belgium, Denmark and France and three times that of Italy and Spain.  Ninety per cent of all goods and 96 per cent of all passengers are transported by road.  A number of major deficiencies have been identified in our roads network, and the volumes of heavy, tourist and other traffic are likely to increase substantially in the next few years.</P>
    <P>The deficiencies already identified in a number of reports &mdash; the most comprehensive <Col N="1001" /> of which was, I think, in 1980 &mdash; demonstrates the necessity for large scale public investment in our roads network. Unless this is done in a more accelerated way, we will continue to have more accidents arising from the poor design, surfaces and quality of the whole network; 6 per cent of our national primary and secondary roads carry 37 per cent of all road traffic, and the volumes of traffic are increasing.</P>
    <P>One of the major contributions the present Minister could make would be to put substantial national and community funding into the development of our roads network.  We can then eliminate some of the hazards and trouble spots which have been the cause of so many tragic accidents over successive years.  I acknowledge the Minister has played his part in this regard.  I do not disagree with what he is doing.  We had a number of resolutions here last year requesting the Minister to provide increased funding, especially for county and side roads.  To some extent the Minister did deal with our concerns and made a substantial increase in capital available to local authorities to enable them to carry out the work.  In spite of that, the poor state of roads has been a contributing factor to the huge increase in accidents.  It will be constantly necessary for the Minister to campaign with his colleagues in Government to direct more State finances into the development of our road network and the signposting and removal of trouble spots identified by many speakers here.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his initiative in co-ordinating the activities of the various agencies and Government Departments involved in road safety. The National Safety Council has been fighting what some may feel is a losing battle over the past number of years. Nevertheless, we cannot allow defeatism to creep in.  We have to find ways to improve the overall approach of dealing with this problem.  I am glad the Minister is introducing new initiatives, but I query the wisdom of introducing on-the-spot fines for speeding offences.  These will not contribute to the reduction of <Col N="1002" /> speed levels.  I think they will have the opposite effect.  Invariably, people who travel at high speed in high powered cars can afford to pay £50, £60, £100 or £500.  They do not want the embarrassment of a court appearance, which would be a deterrent.  As a person who has been regularly driving the main Dublin-Limerick road for 25 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I can assure the Minister he will find people who drive above the speed limit on the dual carriageway, travel in high powered cars and can afford to pay an on the spot fine.  The deterrent of the court would be more effective.</P>
      <P>There are other issues that need to be dealt with.  One which causes quite an amount of concern is joggers.  A pattern has developed in the last few years for jogging on some of our main roads.  I am not sure what the statistics are in that regard in relation to accidents, but I would ban joggers from jogging along main thoroughfares, which are busy and where there is a risk to themselves and others.</P>
      <P>There is also a pattern of tourists being involved in serious accidents.  I have seen many of them around the Shannon bypass.  We have substantially invested in the roads there.  Nevertheless, people come to Shannon, hire out a car and, if they come from the United States, drive out on the right hand side of the road.  From my recollection, there is only one sign between the airport and the main dual carriageway to indicate that you drive on the left side of the road in Ireland.  This is particularly important because many of the very tragic accidents involved people driving hired cars on the wrong side of the dual carriageway.  I do not want to identify particular cases; that is not the best way to approach this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dangers for young and old walking at night have got to be underlined. Despite all the tragedies and the bad accidents we have seen, we still find people walking unidentified late at night <Col N="1003" /> on our roads.  I do not know how the Minister can deal with this.  In reality the main difficulty we have is from drivers, many of whom are young, speeding at night and having consumed alcohol.  If the Minister can tackle and solve that, he will have made a major contribution towards reducing the carnage which has been devastating to many families over the past number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>My party support this motion.  Private Members' time provides us with an opportunity to highlight a national problem which is a concern for many public representatives.</P>
      <P>In that context I was delighted to hear the Minister announce, reannounce and refocus a number of initiatives in his speech.  The blackspot manual is innovative and will provide a useful reference point for many local authorities.  I was delighted to hear the Minister announce the voluntary register of driving instructors. I understand precisely where he is coming from.  This is an integrated plan to ensure young drivers are given a better deal.  As public representatives we all know from working in constituencies the huge volume of complaints in that regard coming, and rightly so, from young people.</P>
      <P>The Minister's announcement of a theory test for new drivers is to be welcomed. Our standards of instruction must be at the very top of the European league because that would lead to a higher standard of driving.  I also welcome the Minister's announcement in relation to the campaigns of the National Safety Council and his emphasis on local authorities.</P>
      <P>I would support Senator Daly's comments regarding on-the-spot fines.  The issue is one of enforcement.  If someone readily abusing the law by continually speeding is stopped on three or four occasions in a matter of three weeks or a month, they will stop doing so.  It is also an excellent idea for freeing up the courts and ensuring there is the least possible amount of bureaucracy in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> I would like to widen the debate to include a number of other points.  The biggest single contributor to road deaths in Ireland is speed.  When this is added to the unfortunate but ambivalent attitude among many people in Ireland to the question of drinking and driving, policymakers, the Minister and all the agencies are faced with a lethal cocktail when trying to address the problem. The facts regarding road safety in Ireland speak bluntly for themselves. Last year, 437 people lost their lives as a result of road accidents.  This figure represents the worst death rate since 1991 and averages out at 36 people per month.  When one considers that over 9,000 people were injured during the same period it becomes obvious that road related deaths constitute the largest component of non medical deaths in Ireland.  The figures outstrip accidental falls, suicide and other external causes of death.  Every death and injury we have heard about this evening is completely preventable.  Notwithstanding the huge economic implications and the considerable strains put on our health services, the whole area of road safety and the need to reduce speed on our highways is now a matter of national importance and concern.</P>
    <P>One of the most startling features of road related deaths in Ireland is the huge numbers of young people between the ages of 15 and 25 who lose their lives.  From the figures available we do not know whether they are the victims or the perpetrators of speeding.  One thing is clear.  Young males make up the largest group in road death statistics in our country.  This needs to be addressed. Young people who get behind the wheel of a car or who sit for the first time on a motorbike need to be brought face to face with the power of that vehicle and, more importantly, with their responsibilities to other road users.  This point must be brought home and must be at the centre of any national publicity campaign or any education campaign in our schools.</P>
    <P>There are three separate issues which the Government could advance and <Col N="1005" /> which could help to reduce this problem. I fully concede that some of these issues are not within the brief of the Minister of the Environment, but I would ask him to advance them with his Government colleagues.  First, it is high time the Government considered the employment of a special unit within the Garda or a new highway police force to tackle the problem of speeding on our roads.  Everyone would agree that the expansion of the national road network over the last ten years has resulted in a dramatically improved road network. National primary routes of ten years ago are substantially different to today.  Not alone have the speed restrictions changed but the number of lanes and the improved quality of road surfaces have helped to create during that time a road network of which we can all be proud.  I wonder whether the present composition of the Garda Síochána, given the transformation of our roads over the same period, can address this problem of speeding.  When one considers that in many small rural villages and towns the gardaí over the last five years have been replaced by a green box in a former Garda station, can we say that the response mechanisms to deal with the problem of speeding are in place?  Constituting a special unit of the Garda or establishing an independent highway police force would help to modernise our response to the problem.</P>
    <P>Second, I hope the Government might consider extending the scheme which was innovatively introduced a number of years ago to take out of service cars which were over ten years old. This scheme would decommission thousands of cars which are at best defective and at worst highly dangerous.  We have seen an explosion in the small car market over the past two years and particularly cars ranging in the price of £7,000 to £8,000.  We can rightly point out the benefits of this scheme in putting new modern cars on our roads.  I understand that this scheme will end in December 1996.  While the Government described this as a once off measure, the Minister for Finance should consider an extension <Col N="1006" /> of the scheme on the basis of road safety and improving the quality of vehicles on our road network.</P>
    <P>A lunatic proposal has come from the National Roads Authority to toll the new link road around Dublin.  This proposal would put back into the suburbs the traffic the new road was designed to take.  From an environmental and safety perspective I ask the Minister to oppose this proposal.  Those who represent the Dublin suburbs know only too well the problems of traffic congestion.  If the NRA proposal is advanced the existing problems will double overnight.  The NRA proposal is dangerous and will increase the number of traffic accidents in built up areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion. Every Minister for the Environment in recent years has brought in many rules and regulations.  Rules were brought in to cover depth of tread and speed limits; garage reports were required for cars over ten years old for insurance purposes; driving tests, road safety and drink driving measures were also introduced. However, these measures have not brought the desired results.</P>
      <P>The two most important words the Minister used were &ldquo;education&rdquo; and &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo;.  Motorists feel they are the new criminals in society; they feel they are a soft target.  We are told gardaí have to have so many prosecutions each year and the soft option to gain results is to use a speed gun &mdash; a &ldquo;hair drier&rdquo; as it is popularly known &mdash; or to concentrate on parking offences.  These road traffic laws are not considered for their higher motives but are seen as an easy means of gathering revenue for the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a robbery takes place how often does one hear the view that the Garda would be better off concentrating on such crime rather than stopping cars? I go to competitions for one armed golfers each year and while driving to one in England last year I stopped at an agricultural show.  The police had a stand at the show with a video presentation. The officer at the stand told me <Col N="1007" /> they had stopped tackling accidents at a particular point on a road with radar and summonses.  Instead, they decided to stop the drivers and give them advice.</P>
    <P>In England when one approaches a speed check one will see a sign notifying drivers of the check and speed cameras are also indicated by signs.  However, under our system the Garda is like the bad poacher who shoots at the stationary rabbit.  The gardaí stand out of sight with a speed gun and spring out to catch passing motorists.  This antagonises motorists.  We should put an end to that attitude and treat drivers more sensibly. Education and encouragement are the means to achieve this.</P>
    <P>There are two particularly useful experimental measures in operation at present.  There are new traffic islands in villages which force cars to slow down to single line traffic to enter and leave the village.  That system should be extended.  Another useful measure is the use of rumble strips on the approaches to villages or schools.  The rumble strips automatically alert a driver to slow down.  Such measures lead to improved road safety.</P>
    <P>We should not always blame drunk and speeding drivers for road accidents. Prescribed medicines or drugs are responsible for many road accidents. People who are prescribed drugs should be warned to be careful when driving. The effects of drugs can be as severe as drink, yet prescription drugs are not regarded as dangerous.</P>
    <P>Many accidents are caused by pedestrians and cyclists.  In towns on the continent people will not cross the road until the pedestrian light is green.  In Ireland, however, people will cross in front of cars without having regard to traffic.  It reminds me of the story of the two old fellows on a tractor coming out of a field in front of a motorist who had to swerve into the field to avoid them; one of the old fellows said to the other &ldquo;It was lucky we were out of the field&rdquo;. Joggers on the road at night are a great hazard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> Our speed limits are too low.  The limit on dual carriageways should be 80 miles per hour.  Modern cars have ABS, servo assisted brakes and independent suspension which make them much safer.  I drove to Dublin recently in a 1965 Austin Cambridge and I thought its brakes were gone.  When I arrived in Dublin I had a mechanic check it out but the brakes were fine.  I had become so used to driving a modern car with ABS that I thought the older car had no brakes.</P>
    <P>Aggressive driving is another road safety problem.  I was driving the Austin Cambridge at about 50 or 55 miles per hour and I became the object of aggressive driving from motorists who thought I was driving too slowly.  At some places I pulled in because I was causing a problem. Slow drivers can be as much of a hazard as fast drivers.</P>
    <P>I have been driving for 50 years.  I have driven vans and trucks; I have driven the living and the dead &mdash; I worked as a hearse driver at one time &mdash; and I have never had an accident.  I drive up to 40,000 miles a year.  The speed limit should be 80 miles per hour on the motorways and 70 miles per hour on national primary routes.  In a modern car 70 miles per hour is not particularly fast.  Legally people can drive at up to 60 miles an hour on country roads on which I would not drive at 25 or 30 miles an hour.  Speed limits are not related to the quality of roads.  I welcome what the Minister is trying to do and I hope it will reduce the number of road accidents.</P>
    <P>We must stop harassing motorists. When people who drive at ten to 15 miles over the speed limit are stopped by the Garda Síochána, they should be advised to drive more slowly.  We should remove the compulsion on members of the force to have a certain number of prosecutions because that attitude is antagonising motorists.  Before nearing a checkpoint motorists receive signals by motorists coming from the other direction flashing their headlights; this means that the Garda only catches a small number of people speeding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" /> We have too many theorists and too much theory.  When we started teaching the theory of metalwork and woodwork in our schools we put an end to tradesmen. We should forget about theory and deal with reality and facts.  We should introduce a system of education and encouragement for motorists and get rid of the mallet and the hammer attitude.  We have abolished the abuse of corporal punishment in schools.  We should now stop punishing motorists and give them encouragement.  If we do, we will reduce accidents and have a better and safer society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the measures the Minister has taken with regard to road safety.  Over 435 deaths occurred on our roads last year and there is probably not one Member of the Oireachtas who did not have a relative or friend killed on the roads at some stage due to stupid mistakes, drinking or lack of thinking.  It is sad that families have been destroyed because of a lack of thought or consideration before these accidents happened. Prevention is better than cure and, to some degree, the Minister has gone down the road of trying to make people aware of the need for road safety.  Coming from a rural area I know that much of what Senator Farrell said is true.</P>
      <P>The previous Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, came under pressure not to reduce drink driving levels.  Thankfully, he did not cave in to the pressure groups.  However, the reductions do not seem to have made any great difference.  We still have the crazy situation that year after year between 400 and 500 people are killed on our roads.  Speed and drink are probably the two main causes of these deaths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speeding through housing estates is an issue which keeps coming up at county council and urban council meetings. It is hard to believe that young people speed through these estates.  At a recent meeting of Letterkenny Urban District Council, delegations from two estates asked us to introduce ramps or <Col N="1010" /> rumble strips to stop speeding.  Much of this speeding is caused by young people who are creating mayhem and getting the message through to them is a problem. We often hear people complaining about how high insurance costs are for young people.  Probably 90 per cent of these young people obey the rules of the road and have consideration for other road users.  However, many deaths are caused by young people who speed.  It seems to be difficult to get information through to road users, particularly those in the 18 to 30 age bracket.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke recently about regular tests on old cars.  I welcome the efforts he has made to comply with the EU directive by 1998; this is a step in the right direction.  Figures provided by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry show that a record 12,926 new cars were sold in April.  This was a major increase on the figure of 9,536 for the same period last year.  Under the scrappage scheme for cars over ten years old, which was introduced recently by the Minister for Finance, 7,400 cars were sold in a year.  These bangers, which were a danger to the public, were taken off the road.  I ask the Minister to impress upon the Minister for Finance the need to continue this scheme.</P>
    <P>The lack of consideration many tractor drivers have for other road users is unbelievable.  It scares the daylights out of me to see young people of 14 or 15 years of age driving tractors on country roads.  Most of them probably do not have licences or much experience. Nevertheless, their parents allow them drive along fields and roads.  I do not know how we can get through to these people.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell spoke about joggers. The other day I was driving on a dual carriageway outside Letterkenny on which six people were jogging.  Thinking about what could happen to them would scare the daylights out of me.  I do not think the rules of the road allow people to jog on dual carriageways but, unfortunately, we do nothing about this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures the Minister has introduced.  It is important that we <Col N="1011" /> raise this matter as often as we can.  Prevention is better than cure and the Garda Síochána has a major role to play.  A Garda car parked outside a town has a sobering effect on many road users.  Drivers slow down if a Garda car is parked in the same place regularly and they are more careful.  The Garda need to be on the ball and to keep the public aware that it is there to do a job.  I welcome the Minister's initiatives in this area; long may they continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this motion.  Everybody's efforts to reduce the carnage on our roads must be taken seriously. There is no point suggesting there is only one reason for the high incidence of road accidents.  However, the causes can be boiled down to a small number of factors &mdash; speed, driving under the influence of alcohol and the conditions of roads.</P>
      <P>The condition of motor vehicles is also a factor.  A welcome scheme has been introduced whereby cars over ten years old can be taken off the road for a premium of £1,000.  This has had a major impact on alleviating the problems associated with vehicles which were not fit to be on the roads.  MOT type testing should be carried out on light commercial vehicles.  That would help to reduce the number of accidents and fatalities caused by heavy and light goods vehicles.  Before they take their test they must check everything to ensure the vehicle is roadworthy. Human error or a vehicle which has not had a MOT test may cause accidents. There is not a car in the country which has had a MOT test.  It will cost the Government money to get MOT tests done on vehicles over three years old, but the number of lives saved would negate any such costs.  We have been promised legislation for many years, but it has still not been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of cars one meets at night with one light &mdash; we call them one-eyed jacks &mdash; is increasing.  These cause accidents because it is difficult to know <Col N="1012" /> which side of the car the light is on. Many motor companies focus and check lights free of charge before winter.  It should be compulsory for everyone to test the lights on their cars because there is nothing worse than meeting a car with badly focused lights.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that every vehicle is tested for its roadworthiness. How many vehicles have bad shock absorbers, which means that when the brakes are applied the vehicle veers to the right or to the left?  How many vehicles do not have brakes which work?  A number of other safety measures are not tested on cars.  Cars are capable of going from zero miles to 60 miles an hour in ten seconds.  Few cars will not do 120 miles an hour.  The problem is how to stop them.  I agree with the Minister's plan to introduce on the spot fines for speeding.  I have probably been caught more times than other people, particularly since the roads have been improved between Kilcullen and Dublin.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the National Roads Authority to examine how to improve the road between Kilcullen and Kilkenny and particularly between Kilkenny and Waterford.  The road between Thomastown and Waterford is a national disgrace.  The only way to get into Waterford from the north is on the M9 or the M10 from Kilkenny.  There are a huge number of accidents between Kilkenny and Waterford and between Thomastown and Waterford because the roads are not fit for traffic and people take chances.  The biggest port in Ireland is Waterford port, which is in County Kilkenny.  All the Bell Ferry traffic goes north, south and east, but it cannot go west except through Kilkenny.  There is no place between Waterford and Kilkenny where two Bell Ferry trucks can pass safely.  Louisiana Pacific and a number of other companies are setting up in that area, which means the road between the M9 and M10 is of vital importance.  People from Wexford, Kilkenny, south Tipperary, Roscommon, Galway and Sligo have <Col N="1013" /> only one bridge to cross to get to Waterford.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to introduce a MOT test for motor cars as soon as possible.  People will speed, so I am glad the Minister is introducing on the spot fines.  People should be able to pay these at Garda stations rather than paying somebody on the side of the road.</P>
    <P>Vehicles from outside the State cause many accidents because they are not taken off the road if they are stopped for tacograph offences.  If an Irish truck is stopped on the Continent or in Britain and the tacograph shows they were speeding, they are taken off the road immediately.  If a truck from the North of Ireland, Britain or France is doing 75 miles an hour on our dual carriageways, they are not taken off the road.  The same rules should apply here.</P>
    <P>I welcome any legislation or regulation which prevents accidents, but we also need MOT type testing for motor cars.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>On the spot fines here and in the North are not that effective. If a quiet stretch of road is a favourite spot for a garda to hide, and to use an instrument which looks like a hair dryer, and his accomplice stops the driver a little further up the road, the only thing it teaches the driver is to look out for such spots on the road.  That is what it taught me to do and now I know all the spots in the North where I am liable to be caught for speeding.  It has not made any difference to the way I drive my car in traffic or on motorways. I also understand that when good looking girls are caught, they burst out crying and they are then not fined.  That is sexism.</P>

      <P>I tried almost everything else, including pulling rank, which did not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I live in a part of the country where the MOT test has been in existence for many years.  Many people shop at supermarkets <Col N="1014" /> in the area.  The cars they drive are of a high standard and are quite new.  I believe the MOT is directly responsible for this.  The MOT is also a good idea from an environmental point of view.  The authorities in Northern Ireland recently introduced &mdash; and I hope it will be introduced in the Republic &mdash; an examination of the emissions from car exhausts in order to discover whether they reached the required EU standard.</P>
    <P>I use taxis quite a lot.  One of the reasons I cannot find my way around Dublin, despite working here for 15 years, is because I use taxis to travel throughout the city.  I have spoken to many taxi drivers and noticed the care with which they drive as a rule.  Not all Members will agree with me in this regard.  Taxi drivers are careful because their cars are their livelihoods.  If their cars are damaged and put off the road, they will lose income as a result.  A useful way to educate young people who recently qualified for a full driving licence would be to have taxi drivers speak to them.  Taxi drivers are very philosophical and will discuss what they have seen happening on the roads.  They have witnessed almost every error it is possible to commit on the roads.</P>
    <P>Taxi drivers can drive quickly when required to transport a passenger to an airport, for example.  They are not like drivers of heavy goods vehicles, who are an entirely different tribe.  Taxi drivers see it all and it might not be a bad idea to approach them in this regard.  I am aware that they have approached the Minister for a totally different reason and I support them in that.  Perhaps their association might be approached to invite taxi drivers to speak to young people before they remove their &ldquo;L&rdquo; plates and are let loose on the roads. These newly qualified drivers could undergo a course of two or three lectures given by taxi drivers and also by people who have lost a loved one as a result of a road accident.</P>

      <P>No one can be unmoved by the fact that last year 405 people died <Col N="1015" /> and 9,784 were injured as a result of road accidents.  These figures are mere statistics, however.  One must attend a funeral or visit the home of a person killed in a road accident to grasp the reality.  Last month I attended the funeral of a man killed in an accident. He was buried nine months to the day after his marriage took place.  That is the sort of event which puts statistics into place.  I welcome this debate which provides an opportunity to focus on the issue at hand.</P>
      <P>Ireland's road safety statistics are not the worst, but they are not the best either.  I would be glad if we determined to be the best in this regard.  As Senator McAughtry stated, it is only when we consider the death of individual people that we realise something can be done about the problem.  Had it become apparent in 1896, before they began to appear on our roads, that the arrival of motorcars would cause 405 deaths annually on Irish roads, could anything have been done about the situation?  Regardless of whether it could then, nothing can now be done about motorcars or traffic.  Perhaps there are solutions to the problem, however.</P>
      <P>I do not like to contribute to debates unless it is possible to offer suggestions or solutions.  It seems that the first thing we must do is change our attitude.  We do not have an attitude which determines that deaths on our roads will be avoided in the future.  We each have a responsibility in this regard.  I visited America in the past and I was impressed by the way in which people adhere to the speed limit of 55 miles per hour. While driving there, I found myself driving above the speed limit and overtaking other cars.  We seem to have an attitude of mind that tends toward speeding, which is one of the prime causes of road accidents in Ireland.  We must change this attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time the State, through the Minister for the Environment, begins a campaign against speeding and everyone becomes aware of the problem for a period.  This does not seem to <Col N="1016" /> last, however.  If we are to accept that speeding is the main cause of road accidents, a national determination of some form is needed to overcome the problem. I suggest a three-tiered approach. First, we must concentrate on road safety campaigns.  As in the past, we must attempt to institute a lasting campaign which identifies alcohol abuse and speeding as the two prime causes of road deaths.  Ireland does not have the technology that exists elsewhere.  My son-in-law lives in France and was recently scared out of his wits when he realised that he had been photographed by a traffic camera while speeding in his car.  The authorities informed him of his wrongdoing seven days later.  He was aware that he had been photographed while speeding and was worried because he requires the use of his car for his job. Potential exists to do something about this problem by concentrating on the area of road safety campaigns.</P>
    <P>The second tier of my approach relates to policing and road engineering, about which something can be done.  I am not sure whose is the responsibility in this regard, I assume it is the Minister's. I am not certain, however, because it involves many other areas. The third tier involves avoiding a topdown approach and utilising a bottom-up one.  The solution to the problem will be determined by a policy instituted by the Minister which will encourage action to be taken much further down the line.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to friends who are serving members of the Garda Síochána and was informed that in every Garda division there is at least one problem area of which they are aware.  A problem exists wherever a road for which the National Roads Authority has responsibility crosses one that falls within the ambit of a local authority.  I refer to Kilshane Cross on the Dublin-Derry road, which, I believe, is in the Fingal County Council area in north County Dublin. Kilshane Cross is a death-trap situated on a long, straight, reasonably narrow road which is very attractive to someone who wishes to drive fast.  An interim solution <Col N="1017" /> to the dangers which exist on this road would be the introduction of more white lines or amber lights.  I am aware that any long-term remedy would have to be put in place on a much larger scale, but these are the areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>Last week I launched a manual containing engineering solutions for all accident blackspots.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and am aware that he has taken these actions.  However, I am concerned as to who accepts responsibility for road safety.  Local authorities in some areas give assurances that they will take action, but that they lack sufficient resources at present and will put amber lights in place in one or two years.  In the interim, a white line is painted on the road for a distance of 50 metres.  I suggest that a double white line measuring 100 to 200 metres is needed, because at the speed at which they travel on the Dublin-Derry road people arrive at the accident blackspot before realising the danger involved.</P>
      <P>The most horrific deaths occur when children stepping from a school bus are knocked down.  In the United States there is a rule which states that amber lights on each corner of a schoolbus must flash when it stops and passengers are alighting.  It is illegal for other traffic to pass the bus when those lights are flashing.  These suggestions are mere tokens, but we must have a predetermined plan to solve this problem.  I am delighted the Minister has taken this action and I am very impressed with this debate.  It is a further step along the road which I hope will remove some of the horror and pain and will prevent some of the terrible funerals we have all had to attend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Magner and the other Senators for tabling this motion, which I am happy to support.  It is very commendable and essential to debate this matter in this House.  The number of road accidents and deaths in 1995 must shock us all &mdash;<Col N="1018" /> 437 people died and 9,000 were injured on our roads.  Those figures relate more to a war zone than to social driving of motor cars.  It is total carnage.</P>
      <P>How can we help reduce the level of accidents?  The main factor is speed.  I hate to say this, but lack of courtesy and good manners is another important element.  Some people hate to be over-taken and become different people after it happens.  They cannot take the fact they have been passed out and try to overtake the person again.</P>
      <P>The National Safety Council is running an advertisement at the moment which is funded by the Department of the Environment and the insurance industry.  I congratulate the Minister, his Department, the National Safety Council and the insurance industry on the campaigns they are running.  One television advertisement shows a young man driving along with his girlfriend and speeding and showing off in the car. He suddenly turns a corner and knocks down children walking along the road. There are bodies all over the place and his girlfriend is then shown looking at him with shock and horror.  Every time I see that advertisement it makes me stop and think.  I am certain many people in the country are also horrified by this television campaign.  It is important to have such realistic advertisements which shock people.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to also consider running an advertisement demonstrating simple matters, such as moving to the left hand side to allow people to overtake, indicating properly before overtaking and using rear and side view mirrors.  I know such an advertising campaign would take a long time to plan and prepare.  However, it is essential to try to make people aware of the fact that others want to overtake them and that one has a duty to move in to allow safe overtaking.  However, the existing campaign is quite good and must be continued and expanded because it will save the lives of many children and elderly people.</P>
      <P>The drink driving campaign is particularly successful among young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> Young men and women have decided not to take even one drink or glass of wine and drive.  The older generation are more likely to drink and drive. Young people should be congratulated. When this matter was discussed in the House, I felt the existing limits were realistic.  I still feel it should be permissible to drive after one or two drinks, as long as it is kept in check &mdash; as long as a person is sensible about it, one or two drinks do no harm.</P>
    <P>Huge Garda resources are invested in the implementation of road traffic laws. I welcome the Minister's proposal of on the spot fines for speeding.  Of course, a person must be allowed if they feel aggrieved to have their case heard in court.  The Minister who is present, Deputy Taylor, has been a practising solicitor for many years and is aware of this matter.  Under the Road Traffic Act, a doctor's certificate is permitted in court as proof of drunken driving, as is a certificate from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, without the doctor having to appear in court.  That has worked well.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to strongly consider allowing a certificate to be produced in court to state tax is due from a certain date in cases where a person is charged with not having tax.  The person charged should be permitted to challenge the certificate if they wanted to, but they would have to give notification within a specified time of their intention to do so.  Similarly, in cases where a person is charged with having no insurance, a certificate from the garda stating no insurance was furnished to him should be allowed, unless the person wanted to challenge it in court.</P>
    <P>I was in Mountrath Court last Tuesday which was packed with people charged with speeding, tax and insurance offences.  A huge number of gardaí were delayed in court all morning because they could not furnish certificates. That is a waste of Garda resources and manpower.  Members spoke today about gardaí being moved to the Border because of the BSE scare. <Col N="1020" /> However, a great deal of Garda time could be saved if such certificates were allowed in court.</P>
    <P>I have spoken here before about the seizure of cars for non-payment of tax. Three cases were highlighted recently, two of which were in my constituency. It is wrong because it is a sledgehammer of a deterrent.  I ask for that to be investigated. A woman was stranded in Mount Street, and if she had been attacked, assaulted, injured or raped that night, there would have been a major demand for either the Minister for the Environment or the Minister for Justice to resign.  It is unfair to seize a person's car for non-payment of tax &mdash; there are other ways to deal with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and concur with an amount of what was said by other Senators.  Senator Quinn said that drivers in America generally stick to the speed limits.  I travel about 600 miles a week and I regularly drive from Dingle to Dublin.  The journey takes me approximately five to six hours, which means that my average speed would be 35 miles per hour. However, if I travelled at the speed that is allowed my journey would take just over four hours.</P>
      <P>What is wrong?  Some drivers do not know how to use the road and some gardaí are not implementing the law. There are some nasty, foggy days when one encounters 20 articulated trucks ahead travelling in convoys.  It is impossible to pass them because there is not enough room to pull in.  They sometimes travel at unbelievable speeds.  Travelling out of Dublin last Saturday evening, an articulated truck passed me as I was driving at 73 mile per hour on the motorway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am unable to stick to the speed limits because of road hogs.  We are building roads which cost a couple of million pounds per mile &mdash; motorways, dual carriageways and so on.  Yet the driver travelling at a slow speed of 30 miles per hour will be found on the fast lane.  He cannot be passed, people become frustrated, <Col N="1021" /> they lose their tempers and accidents occur.</P>
    <P>I am driving cars for 45 years and have not had an accident.  However, anybody driving 600 miles a week will inevitably be involved in one.  I am horrified at the way in which some people drive.  How did they get a driving licence?  Some travel at 80 miles per hour with &ldquo;L&rdquo; signs displayed.  Similarly, some who have a sign on their rear window advising of a baby on board do not have much respect for the baby, given the speeds they travel.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the road traffic legislation two years ago was to reduce the impact of drink on driving.  It was hoped the number of accidents would be reduced, but road deaths continue to increase.  It is not the fault of road construction, because all dangerous parts are well sign posted.  It is because people are not looking; they do not seem to care.  For example, at a certain distance behind a car, a van or a bus it can become apparent, by failing to see the driver's face from looking at his wing or inside mirror, that the driver in front cannot see the vehicle behind.  Similarly, the number of people who turn off the road without indicating is unbelievable.</P>
    <P>I do not know why Garda cars are not cruising up and down the roads, telling people the mistakes they are making and charging them with offences.  Yet they can be found hidden behind bridges trying to catch people like me, perhaps doing five or six miles per hour over the speed limit and being as careful as possible.  I do not agree with this.</P>
    <P>Like other countries, we should have signs indicating that radar is in operation. They will ensure that those who are speeding will slow down.  Some radar traps are illegal.  For example, I was told on the Continent that such traps do not exist because a police car must be visible on the road.  If a police car is hidden the police are acting illegally; they must notify that radar is in operation because it is only in such circumstances that they can prosecute.  I agree with the Minister's remarks regarding on the spot fines for reasonably <Col N="1022" /> small traffic offences, especially speeding offences.  I do not refer to major offences such as speeding at 120 miles per hour in a 60 miles per hour zone or at 70 miles per hour in a 40 miles per hour zone.</P>
    <P>I do not know why we must have gardaí on the road checking on tax.  My car was stolen two years ago.  The computer in the Garda offices at Harcourt Terrace provided me with every detail when I reported it stolen, including its colour, the year I bought it and when my tax and insurance were due for renewal.  Records such as these should mean that the Garda can contact people who have not renewed their tax or insurance rather than wasting their time stopping people on the roads.  For example, if a person does not renew a television licence the authorities will issue a reminder.</P>
    <P>Bad tyres also cause accidents; yet, although I am stopped approximately twice a week travelling to and from Dublin, no garda in the past ten years has checked my tyres.  In any event, they are always in good condition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tell the Minister the interesting saga of the M7, the road one takes from Dublin to get to Senator Fizgerald's home.  As it runs through the middle of my property I have plentiful opportunity to observe what goes on, because when one is ploughing on a winter's day there is not much else to do.</P>
      <P>The M7 is a fascinating place.  People stop to picnic on it, cycle on it, drive tractors and trailers on it, may even drive invalid cars on it and do U-turns across the bollards that are meant to protect us and allow the emergency service to get across.  The River Liffey flows under the M7.  It is a nice place to stop and look, get out and stretch the legs.  I wonder why more people are not killed on our motorways.  It is only by being beside the M7 for the entire day that one sees these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The squad car to which Senator Fitzgerald refers is on the M7 but it is unmarked, so among all these other sights <Col N="1023" /> is the squad car stopping cars for speeding. While I accept that after alcohol, speed is probably the biggest killer on the roads, I have never seen the squad car intervene in any of the other lunacies which take place on the M7.  Perhaps the gardaí are too busy or have other things to do but, assuredly, what happens on the M7 is lethal and I am sure the same happens on other motorways, dual carriageways and country roads.</P>
    <P>Signage is another fascinating issue. There are signs at the start of the motorway to indicate that various vehicles are excluded but there is no uniformity of signage between local authorities &mdash; different areas have different signs for the same hazard.  I accept it is not the same on the motorway because that is a national route and the National Roads Authority comes into play, but even there some of the signage is extraordinary. Some people who come to Kildare cannot find Athy, a relatively big town. One would have expected a sign where one branches off for Athy but, just past the point where the motorways separate, when one has gone 100 yards past the exit one sees the sign for Athy. Some people continue to Kildare and then try to find their way to Athy but there are skid marks on the road to show that others stopped and reversed to take the slip road.  There may be something in our Celtic blood derived from our Arab ancestors which gives us a healthy disregard for traffic laws and any level of organisation within our society but I do not understand what makes us do these things.</P>
    <P>There is an interchange at Kilcullen where one would turn for Athy if one had seen the sign.  This is another interesting place because some people go up the down ramp, others come down the up ramp, and yet more come down the wrong side and apply their brakes, so there are skid marks in the opposite direction.  There are signs but clearly something is wrong with them and someone must be in a position to find out what it is.  Why do these things happen, given the number of signs?  Perhaps <Col N="1024" /> the problem is that there are too many.  I appeal for uniformity and sense to be applied to the way we sign our principal roads and motorways.</P>
    <P>Another issue is road markings. When we cross the Border into Northern Ireland, we see one white line, sometimes two, in the middle of the road and two lines on either side of the road.  Northern Ireland is subvented to a far greater degree than we are, which may be one reason they are so committed to the Union.  However, we could do more to make our roads safe for driving.</P>
    <P>Another lunacy is that going to Dublin, drivers come off a motorway on to a dual carriageway and are faced with traffic lights.  Those of us who drive to Dublin regularly will be aware of the concertinas which take place at the traffic lights on the dual carriageway &mdash; up to five cars jammed into one another head to tail.  Fortunately, the accidents are not serious but they do take place. It does not make sense to be faced with this when coming off a motorway.</P>
    <P>It cannot be necessary to repair the inner lane of each dual carriageway to and from Dublin because everyone uses the fast lane, whether they are travelling at 40 miles per hour or 80 miles per hour &mdash; I realise they should not be travelling at the higher speed.  It fascinates me that everyone stays in the fast land and no one pulls over.  I know from driving on the M1 in England that if one does not pull over fairly sharply, something will plough into the back of one's car at a rate of knots &mdash; we have seen the results on television.</P>
    <P>I endorse what was said about traffic cameras &mdash; if one drove from Aberdeen to London one would see them at regular intervals and they slow cars down.  I also agree with what was said about passing on the inside and I support the idea of on the spot fines for traffic misdemeanours such as speeding, although more serious offences will have to be dealt with otherwise. We sometimes assume that people in other countries are more law abiding but that is not the case &mdash; they abide by the law because the penalties are stiffer and surveillance is better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to speak on a motion about which there is a consensus. I thank the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, for coming here and especially the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, for the steps he is taking to alleviate the carnage on our roads.</P>
      <P>The figure of 437 deaths on the road last year was mentioned a number of times.  If there was an aircrash in which that number of people were killed it would be a major talking point for months, especially if it happened in a country like ours.  However, there are catastrophes every year on the roads &mdash; 437 died last year; how many the year before and the year before that?  In addition 9,000 people were injured last year.  Let us look at the figure another way.  How many villages have populations lower than 437?  Imagine such a village being wiped out.  When we look at road accident figures we often see them as just statistics.</P>
      <P>One issue not mentioned is the clothing worn by those who go walking at night.  I was once driving on a narrow road, with traffic coming towards me and suddenly I saw a man, wearing a dark coat and cap, walking on the road; I could only see his face.  All I could do was hope that I could avoid him; thank goodness I did.  Wearing dark clothes is a recipe for disaster.  Reflective armbands are available free from the National Safety Council through schools; they shine like a light.</P>
      <P>Many Senators mentioned road rage. If one is in a hurry and someone in front is crawling it can make one cross but that does not mean one should shoot or stab the other person, as happened in England recently.  Two signs stick in my memory: &ldquo;Be alive to danger on the road&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Drive like hell and you're sure to get there&rdquo;.  If we had consideration for others there would be fewer serious accidents and less carnage on our roads.  In other words, we should keep within the speed limits, and we should not take alcohol and drive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cashin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing this motion.  A speech and language therapist works with both children and adults to diagnose, treat and manage a wide range of disorders. Speech and language disorders are now recognised as a serious health care problem. As the Minister is well aware, good communications skills are vital to social activities, both in forming and maintaining relationships.  If speech and language is deficient or damaged, it has a massive affect on the person's life and this is why the job is so important.  One of my boys has attended such a therapist and I know well of these people's great work.</P>
      <P>Speech and language therapists are seeking pay comparable with other graduate health care professionals. To become a qualified speech and language therapist a student must first achieve 500 points in the leaving certificate, which is higher than the amount required for most university degree courses, and complete a four-year honours degree course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pay gap with other health professionals has widened since this grade was introduced in 1982.  At the maximum point of the scale a speech and language therapist now earns £9,213 less than a clinical psychologist, £7,390 less than a physicist, £4,792 less than a hospital pharmacist and £3,067 less than a professionally qualified social worker. According to speech and language therapists, one of the reasons for the poor relative pay is that the profession is predominantly female.  Only four of <Col N="1027" /> the 250 speech and language therapists in Ireland are male.  A similar situation in the UK has given rise to the European Court of Justice ruling that speech and language therapists should get pay comparable to the graduate health professionals.</P>
    <P>Pay negotiations with the Department of Health under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> have broken down because the Department has failed to address the genuine problems and concerns.  It is in this context that I am intervening to ask the Minister to get the pay talks back on track.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a whole-time equivalent of approximately 240 speech and language therapists employed in the public health service.  In February 1994, IMPACT submitted a statement of case for arbitration in support of a pay claim.  In the light of the pay provisions of the <i>Programme <Col N="1028" /> for Competitiveness and Work</i>, speech and language therapists withdrew the statement of case and then opted, through their union, to lodge a claim under clause 2(iii) &mdash; annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  On entering these negotiations, management and union, under the auspices of the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board, agreed a broad framework agenda which would form the basis for discussions.  In the course of the negotiations, management tabled an offer which was rejected by the staff side as it failed to meet their aspirations in terms of pay, aspirations which far exceeded the provisions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> IMPACT, on behalf of speech and language therapists, then withdrew from the discussions and put negotiations &ldquo;on hold&rdquo; in late 1995.  Management, under the auspices of the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board, remain available for further discussions at all times within the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
