      <P>I have notice from Senator Daly that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to act to resolve the dispute between the Department of Health and the environmental health officers which is causing a number of problems, particularly in relation to the granting of hygiene licences for commercial premises.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Reynolds of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to grant disadvantage status to St. Mary's primary school, Drumlea, County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to increase funding to the National Safety Council in order that a more intensive water safety publicity campaign can be launched this year and to ensure that all safety equipment is examined and well maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> I have also received notice from Senator Roche of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to outline the basis for the decision of the Department of Social Welfare to withhold funding from St. Fergal's Family Resource Centre, Bray.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding for the provision of a new sewerage system in Carndonagh, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Daly and Reynolds and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Cosgrave, Roche and Maloney may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, this is the last official day of the session.  We will be coming back for one day but this is the natural end to this session.  I take this opportunity to thank you, a Cathaoirleach, for the exemplary way in which you have guided our affairs during the past session. You have been fairness personified. I thank the staff of the House for their great help to Members, often under difficult circumstances, late at night with late amendments and so on, all of whom have shown great impartiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also thank the ushers and the other staff of the House.  Today by coincidence marks the last time in this House of Dermot McCarthy who has been an usher for 27 years.  He has been a friend to all of us during that time and has upheld the very high standards which the ushers have led us all to expect over that time.  On behalf of the House I thank Dermot McCarthy, and the other <Col N="1215" /> ushers, and wish him well in his retirement.</P>
    <P>In thanking you, a Cathaoirleach, I thank also the Leas-Cathaoirleach. There is something about the Roscommon air which seems to mean that ownership of those august offices belong to that part of the country.  Both you and the Leas-Chathaoirleach have set an example which will be hard to follow.</P>
    <P>I also thank the media, especially our regular reporters.  If we feel we are not getting sufficient or fair coverage it is not their fault.  We have got a fair crack of the whip from them and we appreciate their help.  I wish to record the thanks of all Members of the House.</P>
    <P>It is intended to take items Nos. 1 and 2.  It is proposed that item No. 1 will conclude not later than 4 p.m. and the Minister will be called not later than 3.55 p.m.  Contributions will be ten minutes per person.  Members may share time.  Item No. 2 will commence at 4 p.m.  With the agreement of the House we will take all Stages today.  I suggest 15 minutes per speaker for item No. 2.</P>

      <P>Before calling Senator Wright I join in extending my thanks to all Members for their co-operation and courtesy during the term and to the staff of the Seanad who sometimes have a very difficult job to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to the words of congratulations and thanks which the Leader has spoken on our behalf in relation to you, your able assistants and all those associated with the House, the ushers, including Dermot, and the press office.</P>
      <P>In relation to item No. 2 we want the Courts Bill passed today and that will be arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following his appointment yesterday I wish Pat Byrne well in a most difficult time.  I am confident he has the energy and commitment to carry out the role given to him by the Government for the next seven years.  I hope in that time he <Col N="1216" /> will be able to put his imprimatur on society by his commitment to the force and to all the issues he announced he wants to achieve.  I also wish the retiring commissioner, Paddy Culligan, well in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We on the Independent benches would like to be associated with the words of thanks to the staff of the House, including the ushers.  I thank the Roscommon team of you and the Leas-Chathaoirleach, for your help and courtesy in various ways during the term.</P>
      <P>I say a special word to Dermot &mdash; I always have one bit of advice to retiring public servants &mdash; you think you have beaten the system when you receive the pension.  In fact you have beaten the system when you have been collecting the pension longer than you have been working.  That is the real objective.</P>
      <P>I reiterate a point I made yesterday that it is not appropriate at this stage when a word or act can be misinterpreted and taken out of context regarding the position in the North but I ask the Leader to give serious consideration to a recall of the Seanad, if that is appropriate, over the next number of months when the situation has calmed, if it does, so that there can be an informed discussion in which people could give their views.  Members of the House have much to say on this issue.  We all agree that this is not the appropriate time to do it and I am not suggesting it is. However, the issue needs to be raised at some stage.</P>
      <P>I have not said anything until now on the Bord na Móna issue and I realise we will not have an opportunity to do so in the next few weeks.  I ask the Leader to convey to the Government the seriousness of the position where an important semi-State body is being torn apart.  The person who made a success of it should continue the work.  If wrong was done, it should be corrected and if reprimands or actions need to be taken, they should be taken.</P>

      <P>I join Members in thanking you, Sir, the staff, ushers and members of the press gallery for their support during the year.  I wish the Members a nice summer break, although, with the exception of Members on the University benches, it will not be a break.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish Dermot McCarthy a long and fruitful retirement. I join the Leader of Fianna Fáil in congratulating Mr. Patrick Byrne on his appointment as Commissioner of the Garda and I wish Mr. Culligan well in his retirement.  As Mr. Byrne faces a difficult and challenging task, I hope the financial and other resources he requires to fulfil that task are provided. It would be a good start if he were allowed to exercise discretion on spending moneys allocated to the Garda rather than the Department of Justice deciding on such matters.  While I welcome <Col N="1218" /> the review of the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the Garda Síochána, why should the incoming Commissioner be a member of the group who carried out the review?  When a group of management consultants carry out a review of a firm, I am sure the chief executive of the firm is not be part of the team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important issue.  I appeal to the Garda Representative Association and the Garda Federation to iron out their difficulties, particularly when everybody else has been asked to try to solve the crime problem.</P>
      <P>I expressed the view yesterday that, given the present difficult circumstances in Northern Ireland, it might not be helpful to discuss the matter now. Serious consideration should be given to banning marches.  If this were to happen in England, Wales or Scotland, I have no doubt the police would stop marches. It is not a traditional right as represented&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that, but this is the last opportunity we will have for some time to refer to the matter.  The right to march is not a traditional right when used as provocation and intimidation. I repeat my call to the Unionist leadership to show restraint, to be moderate in what they say and to show true leadership in these grave circumstances. It is incomprehensible that Christian places of worship, irrespective of their denomination, should be used for demonstrations of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Members in thanking you, Sir, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the staff, ushers and members of the media for their help throughout the year.  I wish Dermot McCarthy a happy retirement after many years' service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> I do not believe it would be helpful to hold a debate on Northern Ireland at this sensitive time as our comments would not be helpful.  It would be better to leave it to those who know more about the true position there.  Efforts are being made to bring the communities together so that a reasonable resolution to the difficulties facing the people in Northern Ireland can be reached.  I hope those in leadership positions, particularly on the Unionist side, show responsible leadership and help to bring about agreement, rather than disagreement. We cannot predict when it will be appropriate to discuss the matter but, if necessary, the House should be recalled to debate it.  It might also be suitable to debate the question of law and order at some stage, but the House will sit on 26 July to deal with certain legislative matters.</P>
    <P>I also wish the new Commissioner of the Garda every success in his difficult task.  This is a challenging time for the Garda Síochána and he appears to have the qualities necessary for the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Members in paying tribute to you, Sir, for your good work.  You are very suited to the job. I also pay tribute to the staff and wish Dermot McCarthy well in his retirement. He is a courteous person and should have been a diplomat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>We have debated worthwhile legislation in recent times and the standard of debate has been excellent.  Mr. Byrne, the new Commissioner made his way from Cork to Dublin and made a name for himself.  I hope he continues to do that and I wish him well in his new appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into the details of thanking you, Sir, for everything you have done for us.  I wish Dermot McCarthy every success in his retirement.  I hope this will not be the <Col N="1220" /> last we see of him and that we may have a cup of coffee with him in the Visitor's Bar at some future date.  I am pleased the Government saw fit to appoint Pat Byrne as the new Garda Commissioner. It is not often it does things right, but in this case it surpassed itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is doing him no favours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I convey my good wishes to the new commissioner.  He is the ablest police officer the country has seen for many years.  I also pay tribute to the outgoing Commissioner, Paddy Culligan, who has had a rough five and a half years.  He is a gentleman in every respect and did a good job.  I congratulate the Government on making a good choice of Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, congratulate Mr. Byrne on his appointment.  We should congratulate the Minister for Justice on her excellent choice.  He was an excellent policeman in difficult times and the best person to handle a difficult task.  I also wish Paddy Culligan a long and happy retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is a reflection on southern society that the thoughts of a considerable number of people turn to matters of sporting endeavour in July.  It shows where our priorities lie.  In that context I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister with responsibility for sport, Deputy Allen, the appreciation of many people in the sporting world who have welcomed the establishment of a new National Sports Council, which is chaired by a distinguished former Olympian, John Treacy. Membership of the council is widely reflective of Irish sporting life.  It was particularly pleasing to see the appointment of the general secretary of the GAA to this body, which will formulate proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> Will the Leader establish when the task force will report its deliberations?  I understand it will undertake a root and branch investigation of sport, sporting facilities &mdash; or the lack of them &mdash; and priorities for sport as we approach the millennium.  That report is long overdue. It is ironic that in the month in which we are sending perhaps the largest ever team to the Atlanta Olympics, there is a wrangle about a 50 metre swimming pool&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing that issue now.  The Senator should put a question to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and a national football stadium.  While the Minister is doing excellent work in helping to fund more and more sporting facilities, there is a perception that sport is under-funded. I hope, in the context of my request for an opportunity to debate the findings of the task force, we will also have an opportunity to discuss the percentages distributed under the national lottery for sporting endeavour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>These are important matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have an early opportunity to discuss these matters, particularly in light of the Olympic Games.  I send the good wishes of all the people to the athletes and the administrative staff who will travel to Atlanta. They will carry the hopes and wishes of a nation.  Let us hope they have much sporting success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the congratulations offered by Members to the new Garda Commissioner, Patrick Byrne.  I had the pleasure of meeting him on several occasions &mdash; I think the first time was when I sat beside him on a plane on the <Col N="1222" /> way back from Budapest.  He is a very interesting, intelligent, charming man with a very good sense of public relations.  Without in any sense being critical of his predecessors, he will do a remarkable job on the public image of the Garda, which is very important in these troubled times.</P>
      <P>I also wish to join the congratulations to Mr. McCarthy on his retirement. Having retired from the university, I assure him it is wonderful and he will enjoy himself immensely.  He could, of course, run for the Seanad so that he could rejoin us here.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the remarks about the efficiency and courtesy of the staff of the House, which is evident in circumstances that are not nearly as good as those in most other world parliaments because we have a great lack of resources.  I referred yesterday to the fact that the reports of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and several other committees have not been published because of lack of resources.  That is an absolute scandal and an outrage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Just as a Member of this House, Senator Magner, has transformed the Joint Services Committee and produced facilities of which we are all very proud, let us have more of that energy in getting resources for where we work as well as where we dine.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that item No. 5 &mdash; Statements on the White Paper on Foreign Policy &mdash; is still on the Order Paper.  I presume that matter will be taken early in the new session so that those of us who did not have an opportunity to contribute will be able to do so.  Sometimes this matter is taken coincidentally with meetings of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, but perhaps it could be taken at a time when that committee is not meeting because a number of Members who serve it would like to make a contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to pay tribute to you, a Chathaoirleach, and the members of staff.  I assume you will not question that.  I pay tribute to the incoming Garda Commissioner, Patrick Byrne, who faces a great challenge.  I wish him every success in his appointment. He is a young man who came up through the ranks of the Garda.  There was newspaper speculation that the Government might make the appointment from outside the Garda Síochána, but I am delighted people who start out as gardaí rise through the ranks to the top job.  Long may that continue because those people have the experience. I knew Commissioner Culligan when he was stationed in my constituency and I wish him every happiness. He received some criticism, but he is a fine, honest, straight, hard working man.</P>
      <P>Thought should be given during the coming weeks to making available a day or two for a debate on Northern Ireland.  The present position is serious and the risk is that the problem will get out of hand in that if the leaders of political parties and Churches and those who have an input to the matter are not very careful they will lose out and gang mobs will take over.  I hope the present communications will come to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for Justice on appointing solicitors to the Circuit Court Bench.</P>

      <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the Leader the comments made by the President of the Vintners' Association, Mr. Paul O'Grady, in threatening to evict politicians from their clinics if they do not do what he tells them.  A very successful meeting, led by Senator Howard, was held with the Vintners' Association, with deputations led by Senator Bohan, and at all times relations were courteous and constructive. However, the bullying attitude adopted by Mr. O'Grady is of no avail in resolving the problem.  During the Fianna Fáil/Labour Coalition the fulfilling of this EU directive was as much on the Government agenda as it is now and I suggest that Mr. O'Grady temper his remarks.</P>

This is the most rapidly growing sector of education and those working in the area are concerned. Those in the area wonder whether the sector will come under the remit of the vocational education committees, the HEA, the future educational council or the proposed regional education boards.  It is important that the Minister should clearly outline who will be responsible for adult education before those involved in the adult education programmes return to work in September and the courses begin in October.</P>

    <P>I ask the Leader to bring the very low morale of ambulance personnel to the attention of the Minister for Health.  I am sure other Members have been circulated with a document regarding the <Col N="1228" /> serious breakdown of consultations and negotiations between this group and the Department of Health.  I do not want to say too much about this.

      <P>We are right to wish the new Garda Commissioner well, because he has an extremely difficult job on his hands, particularly in relation to the drugs scene in Dublin.  We have discussed legislation over the last few weeks which will help convict drug traffickers and so forth.  Could the Leader ask the Minister for Justice why on the eve of the opening of the detoxification unit in Mountjoy which has been planned for six months &mdash; the doctor in charge has been appointed &mdash; a dispute has arisen regarding staffing?  The prison officers' association is querying the fact that their medical orderlies will not be staffing the unit and this is very <Col N="1229" /> serious.  The unit was to open this week but we may not see this happen.  We are all agreed that there is little point in sending people to Mountjoy Prison with a drug addiction problem which has led them to crime unless some efforts are made to deal at least with those who want to kick the habit while they are there.</P>

Local authorities are forced to make a development charge of £500 or more on private houses.  Community developments are now charged between £5,000 to £10,000 and these communities do not receive funding for their community centres.  Local authorities are forced to make these charges and a full and open debate with the Minister is long overdue.

      <P>I share Senator Dardis's disappointment that there will not be a debate on the North.  If we do have a debate I hope it will not take the same direction as comments in this Chamber, which is unilateral condemnation of the Orange Order.  There are two points of view in this argument and I hope Members will try to understand that when a community is under strain, the strain will release itself in ways mystifying to outsiders. The residents of Drumcree are being asked for 15 minutes' forbearance every 12 months.  I had hoped they would stand in dignified disgust and let this march take place.</P>

    <P>The Leader might raise with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment recent reports of a £1.7 billion investment <Col N="1233" /> in Newport, Wales.  Was the IDA involved in trying to lure that South Korean company to Ireland and was there any ministerial involvement?  If there was, why did it fail?  The Scots and the Welsh, although part of the same country, were bidding against each other.  If there was no ministerial involvement on Ireland's behalf it should have been brought to bear.  If there was ministerial involvement why did it fail to bring that huge investment to Ireland?</P>

      <P>I omitted to thank the chairpersons who assist the Cathaoirleach and the House and without whom the work could not proceed as smoothly and efficiently as it does.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright referred to the new Garda Commissioner.  It is salutary that all sides of the House accept that the best person for the job has been selected. There is full support for him and the people, as never before, want him to succeed in his job.  That is no reflection on Patrick Culligan who was an excellent Garda Commissioner.  However, it is a new time and there is a new mood and the new Commissioner is the man for the job.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Dardis it is about time the ongoing scandal of the row between the GRA and Garda Federation was brought to an end.  The public is sick and tired of this unedifying spectacle. At a time when everybody's priority is the elimination of crime, the public is tired of the spectacle of gardaí squabbling in public.  It is up to these bodies to not just mouth nice things about what has happened in recent times and condemn politicians but also to show by example and leadership that they too are serious about this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked for a debate on Northern Ireland.  A debate on Northern Ireland at this point would not be helpful.  If it is considered helpful during the recess I will consult Members and the House will be recalled. However, it would have to be a helpful debate.  The Senator also referred to Bord na Móna.  Like other Members, I <Col N="1234" /> would like to see that problem resolved. The best advice was offered by Senator Quinn.  I hope what he proposed at yesterday's meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, which contained a great deal of common sense, will be the line followed.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to the National Sports Council.  It deserves to be welcomed.  I will be happy to organise a debate on the National Sports Council and on lottery funding, which was raised by Senator Finneran, early in the new session.  The same applies to the new task force.  On a lighter note, I am glad Senator Enright realises that the times of the Munster and Leinster hurling finals next Sunday have been changed.  Those of us who have not received tickets from Senator Kiely can now watch both matches.  It was common sense because the GAA is competing in a television age and needs to take advantage of the great sporting spectacles it can offer.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised a number of questions.  I will not dwell on his retirement from the university.  Sometimes, although not in the case of Senator Norris, it is hard to tell the difference between people who have retired and those who have not.  He also called for a debate on foreign policy.  The trouble with that is getting all the members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in the country at the same time, but I will look at that in the new session.</P>
    <P>We all know that Senator Enright will be fighting for a seat in Laoighis-Offaly and my money is on him.  Senator Daly raised the question of transport and I will convey his views to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Magner about the tone of the remarks by the leader of the vintners' association.  It is one thing to come here and speak in a very civil way to Members from all parties but quite another to issue a public threat. Regardless of which parties are in Government or Opposition, those bullying tactics will not get them anywhere.  I <Col N="1235" /> deprecate what was done and I ask them to reconsider.  There is no place for that sort of language.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Dan Kiely about those glossy EU publications, which I also received today.  I cannot see the point of them.  They are enormously expensive to produce and not particularly effective.  It is a waste of public money to engage in such publicity.</P>
    <P>I will convey the question raised by Senator Honan to the Minister.  I will also convey the point made by Senator Henry but, as the Minister will be here shortly, the Senator might raise it again with her.</P>
    <P>I promised Senator McGowan five times that we will have the debate which he requested early in the new session.  I said five times that there will be a debate on the funding of local authorities. For the sixth time, there will be a debate.</P>

      <P>Senator McAughtry's point was very well made.  I will pass on Senator Quinn's comments to the Minister for Health &mdash; I think it is a good initiative. In reply to Senator Kelleher's question on why we did not get that project, I suppose, like Cork hurlers, we cannot win them all.  I am sure every effort was made to ensure that project came to Ireland.  The IDA's track record this year, and that of ministerial help to the IDA, is second to none.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to present the 12th Annual Report of the Ombudsman for the year 1995 to the House.  Since its inception in 1984, the Office of the Ombudsman has come to play a very important role in the Irish system of public administration. Many State bodies are, of necessity, complex organisations which citizens tended to see as forbidding bureaucracies, not as their servants. That perception is changing.  In this process of change the Ombudsman is clearly the champion of the citizen. Over the years he has changed the way we think about the role of the State in ordinary people's lives.  His work has transformed for the better the relationship between public bodies and the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expectations of the public for better services are higher than ever.  The improvement of customer service is a key aim of policy in the private and public sectors.  Organisations throughout the public service have learned from the initiatives undertaken by the banks, building societies and retailers in the private sector.  I am not sure if there is a precedent for Ministers of State to give a &ldquo;plug&rdquo; to individual Senators, but Senator Quinn deserves credit for his part in raising awareness of the importance of the customer in recent years. Semi-State bodies, too, have made immense improvements in customer care.  The Civil Service has been alive to these developments and many Departments implemented customer service initiatives in recent years.  This undoubtedly helps to explain the significant reduction in the number of complaints received within the jurisdiction in 1995 <Col N="1237" /> compared with the 1994 figure: down from 2,489 cases to 2,250 cases.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the promotion of excellence in the provision of public services. As a Minister of State, one of my key roles is to ensure there is continuous progress towards the highest standards of customer service.  As the Ombudsman, Kevin Murphy, put it succinctly: &ldquo;The citizens of this country are entitled to expect that they will be dealt with properly, fairly and impartially by our public service.&rdquo;  I agree and I mean to deliver promptly on that wish list of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of May, the Taoiseach launched the next phase of the Strategic Management Initiative set out in <i>Delivering Better Government.</i>  The key messages to the citizen in <i>Delivering Better Government</i> are that the programme of renewal in the administration of public services will deliver excellent services to the various customers of the Civil Service; will put in place the appropriate legislative systems, human resource management and financial management systems to support the delivery of these excellent services; and will ensure that authority, responsibility and accountability rest in the appropriate places.</P>
    <P>Work on the implementation of the ambitious programme of change set out in <i>Delivering Better Government</i> is progressing rapidly.  A substantial body of new legislation is being drafted.  The new co-ordinating group has been established to monitor developments and progress.  The first of its monthly meetings was held on 24 June.  The key working groups being set up to develop programmes of action will be in place shortly.  <i>Delivering Better Government</i> means what it says.</P>
    <P>When I speak of improving the quality of customer service, I mean developing within the public service a set of procedures for best practice in the administration and delivery across the whole range of public services.  In terms of public administration, who do we mean when we speak about the &ldquo;customer&rdquo;? We mean, of course, every citizen <Col N="1238" /> who demands, or has a need for, the services provided by public sector organisations funded by his or her taxes, social insurance, fees and other contributions. We mean that every person availing of a service delivered by a public sector organisation has the right to the same level of courtesy, efficiency and effectiveness as he or she will demand in any market.</P>
    <P>When one pays cash for a commodity or service in the market place one wants quality of service and value for money. Second best is not good enough.  Just because one pays for most of one's public services indirectly through taxation is no reason one should have to tolerate anything but the highest standards.  All of us involved in preparing the action statements in <i>Delivering Better Government,</i> Ministers and officials, have set ourselves the highest standards.  We mean to deliver.</P>
    <P>The concept of &ldquo;the customer&rdquo; is multidimensional.  In the case of licence applications, the customer may be the applicant, but &ldquo;the customer&rdquo; may also be an individual or group objecting to the granting of a licence for particular reasons.  Given this complexity, balance and impartiality are core values inherent in good public administration. The importance of the Ombudsman in supervising Departments is underlined by this complexity and by the sheer mass of detail in modern systems of public administration.</P>
    <P>Of course, the presence of the Ombudsman does not obviate the need for Departments to put in place their own internal systems of checks and reviews.  These must be supplemented, where appropriate, by suitable appeal mechanisms.  Already, accounting officers must comply with the provisions of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, as regards value for money, and appropriate systems for this are in place.  It is essential that internal systems are developed to review the principles of good administration. The Ombudsman, in a diagnostic capacity, will supervise these systems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1239" /> In his first report as Ombudsman in 1994, Kevin Murphy highlighted the principles of good administration which public bodies should apply in exercising their powers.  I am glad that he expands on these principles in chapter 2 of the 1995 report.  This chapter should be compulsory reading for everyone involved in the administration of public services.  A criticism often levelled at management initiatives, justifiably in many instances, is that they are jargon led and theory bound with little scope for practical application.  In this chapter, however, the relevance of the principles of good administration is demonstrated simply and effectively.</P>
    <P>Proportionality is one of the central principles of good public administration. This principle places an obligation on public bodies, in the exercise of discretionary power, to maintain a proper balance between the adverse effect of their decisions on citizens and the purpose being pursued by those bodies.  It is of particular interest in cases where a body must decide between the rights of an individual and the common good.  It is an established feature of administrative law in other member states of the European Union and of the Union itself.  It is becoming a feature of Irish law and has been employed by the courts as a means of judging whether the restrictions imposed by legislation on the exercise of any given legal right are excessive.  However, the Ombudsman notes that some public bodies tend to administer their schemes and programmes in a rigid manner.  Minor breaches of conditions tend to attract the same penalties as major breaches. The principle of proportionality is not given sufficient recognition.</P>
    <P>Examples involving the principle of proportionality in the report concern the Departments of Social Welfare and Agriculture, Food and Forestry. The social welfare cases relate to loss of entitlement arising from late claims. Substantial arrears &mdash; up to £40,000 and eight years in one case &mdash; are at issue. The report of the Ombudsman suggests <Col N="1240" /> that the penalty &mdash; the loss of arrears &mdash; is not in proportion to the 'fault' &mdash; the late application.  The Department of Social Welfare is now reviewing its position. Similarly, the agriculture case relates to the loss of a milk subsidy of £5,000 due to late submission of claims. Once again, the Ombudsman suggested that the penalty was not proportionate to the infringement of the scheme.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry accepted this view and agreed to pay the subsidy.</P>
    <P>Improving customer service is a complex process.  It involves, not least, a change in the way business is done and in the very culture of the public service. A reformation is now under way in Irish public administration.  The term &ldquo;reformation&rdquo; is probably apposite given that 1996 is the 450th anniversary of the death of Martin Luther, the architect of the Reformation in the Church in the 16th century.  Members will note that there are some good researchers in my Department.  We have not nailed our theses to the door of Leinster House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister of State's researchers were flogging the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but our commitment to change and renewal is real.  It is important that this process of renewal takes place within a framework that facilitates positive change.  In this regard, the Government has not been found wanting.  Successful reform must be rooted in legislation.  Our proposals for legislative reform are set out in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental legislation dealing with the classification of the functions of central Government in the State through the various Departments of state is the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, which is the basic legal framework for the organisation and allocation of responsibilities of the Civil Service.  The preparation of a Government memorandum and general scheme of a Bill to amend the Ministers and <Col N="1241" /> Secretaries Act is at an advanced stage. It is hoped that this will be published in early autumn.  The draft Bill provides for a new management structure reflecting the key elements agreed by the Co-ordinating Group of Secretaries. It includes provision for the devolution of authority, responsibility and accountability within Government Departments to ensure that public service administration is carried out in the most effective and efficient manner.  The Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses Bill is designed to improve the effectiveness of Dáil Committees and is awaiting Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Office of the Ombudsman, there are two key legislative proposals &mdash; the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill and the proposed Administrative Procedures Bill.  The Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill will extend the remit of that office to cover non-commercial State bodies and voluntary hospitals.  In general, a body that receives 50 per cent or more of its funding from the State will come within the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman.  I have arranged for my Department to put proposals before Government shortly.</P>
    <P>The proposed Administrative Procedures Bill is at an earlier stage of development and will be designed to ground in legislation the stated aim of improving customer service by setting down core entitlements of citizens.  It will make legislative provision guaranteeing a specified level of service to citizens in their dealings with State bodies by providing specifically for minimum response times to a citizen's case, the level of guidance to be given to the public and the form in which decisions are to be communicated to the customer. The latter provision will dovetail with the relevant provisions of the forthcoming freedom of information legislation as regards the right of access of citizens to all relevant information on a case.  The Ombudsman will have a key role to play in the implementation of this proposed Act which will vest in that office monitoring and regulatory functions <Col N="1242" /> aimed at securing compliance with the principles of good administration.</P>
    <P>I note with interest that the Ombudsman now has a presence in the south east, albeit not in County Wexford. Nevertheless, I was pleased to see the opening of a service in Waterford in 1995 with the co-operation of the National Social Service Board.  This is part of the office's drive to improve public access and awareness which saw visits from its staff to Roscommon, Longford, Athlone and Tullamore, in tandem with its presence in Cork and Limerick, and a joint venture with the Tallaght Partnership which saw the opening of a new service in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for inviting me to present the Annual Report of the Ombudsman for 1995.  May I, on your behalf and that of the Government and the wider public, thank the Ombudsman, Mr. Kevin Murphy, and his staff for their valuable contribution to Irish public administration and congratulate them on the well produced report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best to remain within the time constraints.  I welcome the Ombudsman to the House. There are few Members of the Oireachtas who are greater advocates of the concept of the Office of the Ombudsman than myself.  I became a members of the International Ombudsman Institute as long ago as 1978.  Having participated in the early debates on the creation of an Ombudsman's office in Ireland, I am personally disappointed at the impact that office has had during the ten years it has been in operation. Profound political timidity and administrative hostility, from the day the concept was first mooted in the 1960s, has stymied the growth and development of <Col N="1243" /> that institution within our administrative system.</P>
      <P>In the decade since it was created, the Office of the Ombudsman has become well established and has been accepted by the people.  The horrific pronunciations about its incapacity to dovetail with the Irish administrative system have proven to be utter nonsense.  There have, however, been a number of profound disappointments during the past ten years.  I note the Minister of State's contribution and the contents of the current and previous reports of the Ombudsman, but I remain disappointed at the impact the office has had in Ireland.</P>
      <P>My first disappointment relates to the fact that the office continues to record a relatively low annual intake of cases within jurisdiction.  I do not accept the Minister of State's observation that the decline in cases held by or taken to the Ombudsman's office is a welcome development.  The case is quite the opposite.  Every Senator, Deputy and public representative is aware that there has not been a massive decline in complaints about public administration.  As increases in staff in ministerial offices has proven, there has been an alarming increase in the level of complaints about public administration.  I am dismayed that there has been a further decline, as there has been in each of the past five years, in the number of cases within jurisdiction by the Ombudsman's office. I will return to this point later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second major disappointment is that the positive impact on Ireland's political life, which I and other enthusiastic supporters of the concept of the Ombudsman's office hoped for, has not materialised.  When the Ombudsman's office was created it was fondly hoped that it would have a profound impact on political life, but this is not the case.  At that time it was felt that Deputies and public representatives were spending too much time acting as highly paid messenger boys and fixing minor administrative problems for constituents. Exponents of the Office of the Ombudsman <Col N="1244" /> argued with great vehemence that the creation of a strong independent complaints mechanism would provide citizens with their own advocate and release public representatives to focus more on policy and less on administration.</P>
    <P>In the past 25 years there has been an exponential increase in the level of constituency case load handled by public representatives in both Houses and at all levels of public life.  If that is so, why are we recording a decline in the cases handled by the Ombudsman? Every public representative knows there has not been a downturn in case load handling.  Councillors, Senators, TDs and even Ministers must invest more of time in minor administrative issues than in the early 1980s when the Ombudsman debate got under way.  I undertook a survey of 115 TDs in 1980 and 1981 which proved that they handled four or five times more cases than public representatives in any other Parliament. That figure has increased dramatically in the past ten years.</P>
    <P>Shortly before the Ombudsman's office was created I pointed out that the system of complaint behaviour and the tradition of approaching every public representative in an area with administrative complaints was having a profound impact on administrative and political life.  The situation is now worse than ever.  The office of Ministers are packed with staff handling constituency work and there has been a profound increase in the number involved in such work.  TDs and Senators still devote the bulk of their time and energy to administrative minutiae.  The public is, if anything, more frustrated with our Administration and more cynical about political life.</P>
    <P>If reform is to be effected, the Ombudsman's office should handle an increased proportion of administrative complaints but the opposite is the case. The number of complaints in the Ombudsman's jurisdiction is showing an alarming rate of decline.  This is not because the number of complaints about public administration are declining <Col N="1245" /> or the administration is coping with more complaints.  The reasons are more complex.</P>
    <P>It is clear the office is suffering from a lack of publicity, an extraordinarily restricted jurisdiction and from being the subject of budgetary and staffing constraints which have been exercised by the Administration which the Ombudsman is meant to control.  Before I went mad and became involved in politics and when the Ombudsman proposals were first circulated, I pointed out there was something bizarre about the Ombudsman Act proposed by a Fianna Fáil Administration in 1984 and something profoundly wrong with the Ombudsman not being created as an independent office with full exercise over its budget and with a budget which was an extension of that of an independent Parliament.  I do not blame this Administration; I accept full responsibility for my party.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the Ombudsman's office is properly funded and staffed and has the resources to create the type of publicity which keeps its operations continuously and alertly in the public eye.  The Ombudsman's office must have the staff to go continuously on circuit and to bring its services to the people.  It does not have enough of these resources at present.  Advertising is less a feature of the Irish Ombudsman's operation than in most other cases.  On circuit visits by the Ombudsman's staff are limited to six or seven per year, which is not good enough.  That is not a criticism of the Ombudsman or the staff but of our failure to provide successive Ombudsmen with funds needed to properly execute the office.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's office was almost strangled at birth by administrative hostility and political timidity.  It was given the most restricted jurisdiction of any Ombudsman in developed countries.  In 1984 80 Statutes were examined for comparisons with the Irish Ombudsman Act.  Our Act was found to be the most restrictive of all except the one which set up the British parliamentary commissioner. <Col N="1246" /> Remarkably, areas of administration have been withdrawn from the Ombudsman's jurisdiction in recent years.  I cannot find another case where an Ombudsman has had his jurisdiction restricted.  Again, it happened during various Administrations of different political hue.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman cannot examine the activities of the bulk of the commercial State sponsored bodies.  He is excluded from examining complaints about non commercial State sponsored bodies, although I acknowledge that will change.  He is confined to examining complaints about administrative matters in the health boards and cannot, for example, examine clinical mistakes and incompetence.  The Ombudsman cannot handle a variety of issues which were excluded by the fact that the concept of maladministration, as outlined in the Ombudsman Act, is a restrictive one.</P>
    <P>Ours is truly a fettered Ombudsman and it is time the office was unfettered. In the policy document <i>A Government of Renewal</i> an extension of the powers and the remit of the office of the Ombudsman were promised.  The Minister said the legislation is well under way for redrafting, but we have not seen it to date.  I am disappointed that is the case, although I do not blame the Minister. While noting what she said, more must be done.  I suggest the Ombudsman Act should be reviewed and that its all too many defects should be rectified.</P>
    <P>When the New Zealand Ombudsman was set up in the early 1960s there were reasons within our administrative system to be deeply concerned about the capacity of the office to fit into the administrative culture, but there are no such reasons or fears now.  I suggest that if the Houses of the Oireachtas truly care for an independent Ombudsman's Office to serve the people as they should be served, we should re-establish the Joint Committee on Administrative Justice and sit down with this Ombudsman and his predecessors to write an Act to take us into the next century.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very taken with the Minister's speech.  I welcome the proposals to extend the remit of the office by including non-commercial State sponsored bodies and voluntary hospitals.  I listened with interest to Senator Roche's contribution.  As he said, he speaks with passion on this subject and he possesses a great depth of information.  I take seriously all of what he said, although I do not agree with some of it.  My view is somewhat different. Senator Roche was probably right when he said the Ombudsman's office needs greater publicity to ensure its activities are more widely known and I accept that is a budgetary restraint.</P>
      <P>I agree the Act needs to be reviewed and that now is a good time given that it is ten or 12 years since it was enacted. If Senator Roche is interested, I will make time available for a longer and less constrained debate in the autumn. Many of the complaints he made about the office of the Ombudsman are probably deeply rooted in our electoral system and the insane competition which it promotes and which it makes <i>de rigueur.</i> Many of the symptoms which he outlined owe more to that than any failing on the part of the Ombudsman's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ombudsman's office has been one of the great successes of public life over the past ten or 12 years.  Part of its success has been that it has moved at <Col N="1248" /> the right pace; it has not moved ahead of the possibilities for change.  It has been incremental in the way it has added to the scope of its activities and I hope it will continue to absorb change at a pace which it is able to accommodate. It is an experiment which has worked and there is no cost to those involved.  The office is accessible and its fairness is beyond dispute.  People can avoid the awesome and costly prospect of going to court.  The office eliminates the need for administrative tribunals and it is simple, private and informal.</P>
    <P>Since the establishment of the Ombudsman's office I have not heard a complaint about the way people have been treated or about a lack of fairness or openness.  That is the greatest tribute we can pay to that office.  Its independence is beyond doubt.  It was established at a time when the culture in which it operated was deeply hostile. Many civil servants saw the office as something to get at them.  However, it has successfully won the confidence of civil servants &mdash; perhaps they are more open now than when it was established. Civil servants do not see themselves at the receiving end of Star Chamber treatment. They expect to get as fair a hearing as the complainant.  That balance is essential, it was there from the beginning and owes a great deal to the two Ombudsmen to date.</P>
    <P>The debt owed to Michael Mills is enormous.  He put a human face on the office and gave it a sense of credibility. He was a crusader as far as the office was concerned and it will always stand as a monument to him.</P>
    <P>I was critical about the appointment of Mr. Kevin Murphy, not because of his personality which I made clear when I spoke on the debate on his appointment a little more than a year ago, but because he came from the Civil Service and the question was whether a civil servant would be a credible person.  I have no intention of praising Mr. Murphy behind his back when I can do it to his face.  I was not wrong in that I did not cast any aspersion on him personally, but I was wrong to the extent that I criticised <Col N="1249" /> the appropriateness of his appointment. He has been impeccable and innovative and he is the right person to steer the office and guide it in the coming years.  It is important that I say that having voiced my earlier criticisms.</P>
    <P>The manner in which we treat aliens, people who apply for naturalisation, is an area that might be considered for inclusion within the remit of the Ombudsman.  It is a murky area, clouded in secrecy, and reasons need not be given for refusing a person naturalisation. An appeal is not possible and there is not any transparency.  I am sure I echo the experiences of everybody in this House who has dealt with such cases.  A cheap, fast, efficient and fair appeals procedure, such as that which the Ombudsman can offer, should be put in place in that area.  Cases of aliens should be brought within the remit of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's office is one of the success stories of the past ten or 12 years.  It may not have progressed at the pace or to the extent Senator Roche would like, but it has progressed at a pace which could sustain the changes it was bringing about.  I look forward to its further development in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I thank her for her kind personal remarks.  She referred to the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman's office and the remarks of Senators Roche and Manning are worthy of support and future consideration.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Ombudman's report. As Senator Manning said, criticisms were voiced when the Ombudsman, Mr. Kevin Murphy, was appointed to the post from within the public service.  I was delighted to hear Senator Manning and I agree with him.  I also questioned his appointment, but he has proved us wrong and I am delighted that point has been proved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that for the second year in succession the Ombudsman's report is on the worldwide web and, therefore, <Col N="1250" /> easily accessible.  I spoke about this matter the other day in regard to another item when we discussed the possibility of the wider use of the worldwide web in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>This report is only the tip of the iceberg. Only a very small number of complaints, approximately one in ten, are reported which means that another nine go unreported.  We must do more to settle individual cases and we must go two further miles in that regard, a task that we must undertake now that the Ombudsman has drawn our attention to it.  Whenever its attention is drawn to a complaint, the public service should identify as a matter of routine other similar complaints &mdash; that is the first mile.  The second is that we should put in place measures to ensure that similar cases will not recur.  Those steps must be taken if we wish to achieve our objective in this area.</P>
    <P>Another measure we should put in place would take the preventative approach one step further.  It is clear from the recent report and during the 11 years since the office was set up that the underlying culture in the public service is somewhat hostile to the people it serves.  The Ombudsman is always riding against the tide, but if we are to achieve our objective, one of the best ways we can support his work is to realise that the tide must be turned.  In the previous report on which the Ombudsman built in the recent report, he set out a series of principles of good administration which are simple and clear and I imagine acceptable to all concerned.  I suggest those principles of good administration should become the agenda for a campaign of positive action within the public service, including the Civil Service.  Those in charge of Government Departments and agencies should put in place training programmes based on those principles with the object of ensuring that everybody working in the public service knows what they are, what they imply and how to apply them, particularly in their work. They should also know that those are <Col N="1251" /> the principles by which their performance will be judged.</P>
    <P>Regarding customer service, the Ombudsman's remit and work goes far beyond the complaints with which he deals to include dealing with complaints and work that must be done in the area of customer service in the public service. The Ombudsman is of necessity a court of last resort.  Only the serious complaints are reported to him.  There is an attitude to time in the public service. Time can be a powerful weapon in the hands of bureaucrats.  An example of that attitude was expressed by a European bureaucrat whom I met some years ago.  He told me that he put papers related to a problem in a pigeon hole and when he checked it some months later the problem did not seem to be so important.</P>
    <P>We have an excellent Ombudsman, Ombudsman's office and staff, but we cannot abdicate to the Ombudsman and his staff the task of improving the public service.  That is why I welcome the Minister's words, but I welcome the Strategic Management Initiative even more.  It is a step in the right direction.  It was prompted by the work of the Ombudsman's office in the past 11 years and I congratulate the Government for responding to the Ombudsman's initiatives in such a positive way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Sherlock.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Ombudsman to hear our comments about him and his report.</P>
      <P>This is the first time a report of this nature has been produced bilingually and I thank the Ombudsman for doing that.  Even though the number of people who speak Irish as their main language is small, nevertheless it is a sizeable minority and I thank the Ombudsman for recognising it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the announcement in the report of the establishment of the office of the European Ombudsman under the Treaty of the European Union in Maastricht.  The office holder <Col N="1252" /> is Mr. Jacob Soderman with whom our Ombudsman, Mr. Murphy, is in close contact.  That is important as increasingly more of our legislation, rules and regulations are governed by rules and regulations that originate in the EU and, therefore, it is important that there is close liaison between the two offices.</P>
    <P>On a personal basis I have always found the Ombudsman's office of extreme importance and value.  In many ways it is a last resort for Members. Many of us receive complaints at county council level or complaints about the public service at Seanad level and where we fail often the Ombudsman succeeds. That is important.  I agree with Senator Roche that in many ways a good deal of the work we do could be handled by an expanded and better equipped and resourced Ombudsman's office.  Some of the work we do is perhaps irrelevant to our main work as legislators.  Complaints from the public allow us to ascertain how legislation is working, how it is impacting on the people we serve and forces us to call for a review of legislation. In that respect I welcome Senator Roche's call for that legislation to provide for the extension of the role of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>If the Ombudsman has sufficient resources available I suggest he initiates a continuous information campaign so that all citizens are fully aware of his office and can avail of its services because the 3,000 people who resorted to him last year must represent a mere drop in the ocean.  The Ombudsman has our support in his continuing good work.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Tuarascáil Bhliantiúil don Ombudsman.  Over the past few years in particular the mere mention of the Ombudsman to those who feel aggrieved at decisions taken by local bodies very often means they become aware that their grievances can be addressed by his office without going any further.  His is a vital office for all citizens.  I noted that within Cork <Col N="1253" /> County Council there were no fewer than 52 cases on hand in the office of the Ombudsman in 1995, of which 39 were dealt with, which surprises me.</P>
      <P>Decisions of the Ombudsman are important because they can often be interpreted as precedents by local authorities when citizens approach them with grievances.  The role of the Ombudsman and the services provided by his office are undoubtedly recognised. Indeed, the recent restructuring of applications for social welfare allowances by the Department of Social Welfare should be of enormous help to citizens generally, as there was enormous need for such co-ordination.</P>
      <P>We wish the Ombudsman and his staff well in their continuing task.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed that the Ombudsman felt it necessary to refer to the fact that many local authorities found it difficult to impart information, that attitude and practice are inappropriate.  The message should go from here that Members condemn local authorities who fail to respond positively to inquiries from the Ombudsman. After all, the other arm of Government &mdash; local government &mdash; has a responsibility to be forthcoming and just as transparent as any other Government Department.  Some local authorities abuse their powers, deliberately withholding information from the public and the Ombudsman.  In recent years local authorities have shrouded themselves in secrecy, that is not helpful to our local government system or democracy, resulting from legislation which gave its members additional powers, to the detriment of local government overall.</P>
      <P>Local authorities should co-operate with the Ombudsman.  Some of the cases cited in his 1995 report, a mere sample, constitute an indictment of the manner in which local authorities dealt with members of the public within the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister of State may not agree with my comments, from my discussions with people generally, my information is that local authorities <Col N="1254" /> have not been forthcoming but deliberately withhold information from the public and, to some extent, the Ombudsman.</P>

      <P>I thank all Senators for their contributions to what has been a very worthwhile if not a very long debate.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Finneran's last point and predict that local authorities will experience great difficulty in complying with the provisions of the freedom of information legislation, as they will be obliged to do.  Generally, there is urgent need for a mind-set change in the manner in which local authorities are administered.  While some are ahead of the possé, there is a general culture problem warranting attention.</P>
      <P>Over recent weeks and months the strategic management initiative has been rolled out to local authorities by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin.  I am not quite sure what emphasis has been placed on pursuing them on that matter because that is being undertaken by the Department of the Environment.  Nonetheless, it is an issue on which I intend to keep an eye and, if necessary, prompt a push on what needs to be done there.</P>
      <P>To revert to Senator Roche's excellent contribution in relation to this area &mdash; obviously he is in full command of his subject &mdash; I do not agree with all his assumptions because the statistics presented in this report in relation to the number of complaints received within the Ombudsman's remit had dropped year on year.  If I understood Senator Roche correctly, he interpreted that as meaning there was not sufficient media hype about the Office of the Ombudsman or insufficient publicity, that, for whatever reason, the public was not resorting to his office to have their complaints addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly question Senator Roche's interpretation.  If his was correct or if his interpretation was the only reason, why then would complaints in certain areas have increased and decreased in others? <Col N="1255" /> Is the Senator contending that selective groups of the public hear about the Office of the Ombudsman and others do not?  When particular problems arise either because of European Union schemes, such as those in the agricultural sector or in relation to new policy direction by the Government, when difficulties of interpretation or implementation have arisen, certain sectors, if sufficiently annoyed, have made their way to the office of the Ombudsman to have their complaints resolved.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there have been greater problems in certain areas with corresponding or greater decreases in others, resulting in an overall reduction in the number of complaints.  Therefore, for Senator Roche's theory to be correct, either there is very selective media propaganda in relation to who we tell about the Ombudsman or there are different factors at work in contributing to the decrease.  I prefer to consider the latter the real reason.</P>

      <P>I also accept Senator Manning's thesis in relation to how politicians in multi-seat proportional representation constituencies generate an awful lot of the extra administration engaged in, particularly in ministerial offices, but in all our offices as legislators. The competitive element of our electoral system means we have created a clienteleism whereby complainants go from one party to another, from one TD to another TD, back to a Senator and perhaps even to a councillor on the way, at least to those councillors who hold clinics.</P>

      <P>We are encouraging the public to generate paperwork.  Our very electoral system generates this type <Col N="1256" /> of work; hence those who work in our offices respond to complaints received. If there was in place some cross-checking system, whereby the only response emanating from public administration was the first one received from the first public representative which was cross-referenced, this would reduce the volume enormously.  In other words, if in response to every representation I made, I received a reply to the effect that that had already been dealt with by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Byrne or someone else, my interest in the case would rapidly wane, knowing that I was merely the third or fourth choice of a complainant to resolve his or her problem.  There is a direct line in terms of the amount of effort one invests in resolving problems, depending on whether one is the first or fourth choice within one's constituency to resolve them.  If there was even a way of letting us know where we came on the list of preferences, we would very quickly stop this crazy duplication at that level.</P>
      <P>I am not saying I consider our availability in our constituencies is not a very attractive part of our political system which distinguishes us from other electoral systems in that, certainly in rural areas, our constituents know us by our first names and can gain access to us.</P>
      <P>We are reviewing the Act which established the Office of the Ombudsman, to which several Senators referred. Replies have been received from Departments to the draft memorandum for Government and the heads of a Bill to extend the remit of the Ombudsman have been received.  My Department is now analysing those responses and I hope to have a final memorandum for circulation to Departments before the end of July.  Senator Manning's point is valid.  The draft memorandum envisages extending the remit of the Ombudsman to cover the administrative aspects of the law relating to aliens or naturalisation generally.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to move this legislation in the Seanad.  It is important that the role of the Seanad should be recognised and that, where possible, Bills should be initiated here to give Members the first go at expressing their views on legislation. Since coming into office this Government has moved a number of Bills here, thus enhancing the role of the Seanad, which is a good thing.</P>
      <P>The Court and Court Officers Act, 1995, enacted at the end of last year contained wide ranging reforms of the courts and judicial system.  Through the provision of extra judges in the courts and other measures, it was aimed in particular at tackling the main problem facing the court system, the arrears of cases and appeals awaiting hearing.  That Act also contained many other much needed administrative and procedural reforms of the courts and judicial system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past week, for the first time, serious criminal court cases were held in Cork.  Until I made the changes in the 1995 Act that required the judge to agree to the transfer of cases, alleged criminals were using a mechanism to move their cases to the Dublin courts, thereby necessitating delays of up to three years and, in the meantime, they were out on bail and free to continue to commit crime.  This week I had a call from a person in Cork who told me there was a sense of achievement among barristers, solicitors and the people involved in the judicial process in Cork at being in a position to present their cases in the city in which the crimes were committed and get sentences passed speedily against serious drug criminals.  During the week two people <Col N="1258" /> were imprisoned for eight and ten years, respectively, for drug offences; they were sentenced by a court in Cork as opposed to having to wait another two years to have the cases taken.  That was as a direct result of a section I put into the Court and Court Officers Act, 1995, having taken over the Bill which had been drafted before I came into office which fell with the fall of the Government in 1994.</P>
    <P>The court system has been under immense pressure over a number of years and, frankly, has struggled at times to provide an unacceptable level of service.  That is in no way to imply criticism of those charged with the responsibility of making that system work.  The fact is that up to the enactment of the Court and Court Officers Act, 1995, it was clear that the level of resources made available to the courts and the reform of the system that was needed had not kept pace with the increasing demands on it.</P>
    <P>The courts are a key element of our criminal justice system, with the Garda Síochána and the prisons.  The measures I have put in place to reform the courts are central to my overall proposals to improve the criminal justice system which I announced last week.  I established a working group on a courts commission last year, and I will refer to this in a few moments.  I want to take the opportunity to refer briefly to some other legislative proposals for reform of the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>I am proceeding with my proposals for a combination of constitutional and legislative changes to the existing bail laws, details of which were given last week, including plans for a constitutional referendum next November.  I also brought forward an amendment to the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill to restrict the right to silence in drug trafficking cases.  That Bill was debated yesterday in this House.  A Private Members' Bill on freezing criminal assets, which is currently before the Dáil and which I will substantially amend and redraft, should be passed into law later this month.  I intend to <Col N="1259" /> publish a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in the next week or two which will contain measures to improve the efficiency of court procedures and reduce the amount of time spent by gardaí in courts.  It will also provide for issuing search warrants in connection with the investigation of serious crimes.  At another time in this House I pointed out the inadequacies in some of our laws where, for example, a garda has the right to go in and search for a gun, if a gun was used in a crime, but does not have the power, has not had and will not have those powers, until my legislation is brought in, to search for an axe or a knife or some other weapon that might have been used to kill or injure people. Such anomalies have existed in our laws for many years.  The criticism against me as Minister, and against this Government, begs the question why previous Ministers for Justice of another party did not make these changes before.  It was not today or yesterday that the Garda Síochána looked for these changes.  I am glad that I and this Government agree to make those changes in our Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  The Criminal Law Bill which passed Second Stage in the Dáil last month creates a new category of arrestable offences in respect of which the Garda will be able to arrest without a warrant.  An arrestable offence will be any offence carrying a potential penalty of five years' imprisonment or more.  That Bill also provides a clear statutory basis for powers of the Garda to enter premises to effect an arrest without warrant.  This has been needed for many years and is now being done by this Government.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a significant increase in both criminal and civil business in the Circuit Court.  I do not intend to explore the background to the increased volume of legal business coming before the courts.  What I will say is that not only has the workload been expanding but the trend is towards <Col N="1260" /> more complex and, therefore, more time-consuming cases.</P>
    <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, will make a very substantial contribution to alleviating the pressure on the court system, in particular, by the provision therein for the appointment of an additional three judges of the Supreme Court, three judges of the High Court, seven judges of the Circuit Court and five judges of the District Court.  Yesterday the extra seven judges of the Circuit Court were appointed. Senators will be aware that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which was set up under the Act went to work early this year on the considerable task of assessing the candidature of applicants for some of these judicial posts.  To date, the three additional Supreme Court judges have been appointed; two additional High Court judges have also been appointed and a third person was nominated for appointment by the President yesterday.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Government also announced the nomination of nine Circuit Court judges, including the seven additional Circuit Court judges, one of whom is to replace a judge who was sent to the High Court and another of whom is to replace a judge who will be retiring in about a month's time.  The District Court appointments will be made shortly.  There were extensive lists of candidates for the positions which are being handled by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  There seems to be a great deal of interest among solicitors and barristers in becoming a judge of the District Court, which is very good.  There was a time when barristers did not want to be District Court judges but the number of applicants clearly indicates that many experienced lawyers would like to be judges.</P>
    <P>In the relatively short period since the enactment of the Courts and Court Officers Act, I have had calls to look again at the arrears of cases, in particular in criminal cases and appeals before the Circuit Court.  In light of this, the Government approved my proposal, contained in this Bill, to amend the <Col N="1261" /> courts Acts to increase the maximum statutory limit on the number of Circuit Court judges by three to 28 judges, including the President of the Circuit Court.  This is an important part of my proposals to deal with crime.  It is intended that these three additional appointments will be made as soon as possible.  Obviously these positions will have to be advertised when the legislation is enacted so that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board can consider applications and this should be done as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in its report last year on the law of bail pointed out that one way the number of offences committed on bail could be reduced is by reducing the length of time persons are at liberty before trial. In this context the Law Reform Commission recommended that a real attempt should be made to address the root cause of delay.  The commission concluded that the appointment of more judges with the appropriate courts staff and back up services would address the current situation where cases which are ready to proceed have to wait their turn because there is not a judge to deal with the case.  I am satisfied that the appointment of more judges in the Circuit Court will help to address the problems associated with the length of time at the disposal of those persons remanded on bail who commit offences while on bail and waiting for their cases to be heard. To that extent this Bill forms part of the Government's constitutional and legislative response to the problem of offending on bail.</P>
    <P>It has to be recognised that there are more ways than one of dealing with the issue of persons reoffending while on bail.  We have a composite package comprising the referendum, legislation and the speeding up of the time between arrest and trial and in turn the delay between conviction in one court and appeal to a superior court.  If we speed up the time between the different stages, there will not be much time for the accused to be out on the street committing more crime.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1262" /> Developments in the family law area and changes to the limits of the jurisdictions of the courts have had a major impact on the amount and complexity of business coming before the courts system as a whole.  The growth in the number of cases and appeals arising from these factors has been particularly acute at Circuit Court level.  There are unacceptably long family law lists, as has been pointed out by the Law Reform Commission in its recent report on family courts, to which I will refer later.  Those awaiting the hearing of personal injuries actions in the Circuit Court face long delays.  Inevitably, there is pressure too on the disposal of criminal business in the Circuit Court.  The personal injury action tends to be put to one side if there is a serious criminal case to be taken.</P>
    <P>Two other factors have heightened the demands on the Circuit Court.  First, the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1991, increased the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £15,000 to £30,000.  This brought about a very substantial increase in the volume of civil business for hearing in the court.  The indications are that this increase in civil business will be sustained in the immediate future, at least. Civil cases before the Circuit Court are now more numerous, more complex and more time consuming that before.</P>
    <P>Second, there has been a huge increase in family law business at Circuit Court level.  The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, transferred the majority of family law business in the courts to the Circuit Court. The Family Law Act, 1995, which comes into effect next month also confers a substantial additional jurisdiction on the Circuit Court.  The breakdown of family relationships gives rise to great trauma for those involved.  Delays in the hearing of family law business in Circuit Court venues can contribute to the trauma and serve to exacerbate an already very difficult situation.  The heavy volume of family law business in the Circuit Court seems set to continue and may grow still further with the introduction of divorce.  Prior to the <Col N="1263" /> Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, these legal reforms and social developments had not been met by corresponding commitments to extra judges. Those lists have been growing steadily over the past five to six years.  No action was taken to increase the number of judges to handle the extra cases.  That has led to the logjam in our courts.  If we had been steadily increasing the number of judges during the early 1990s we would have kept pace with the increase in the number of cases.  We now have a backlog and the extra judges will have to work doubly hard to clear it and get back to a reasonable length of time for a case to be heard.</P>
    <P>This Bill, following the appointment of additional judges to the courts under the 1995 Act, is in my view an essential further step to turn around the business of the Circuit Court and to improve matters in that court with immediate effect.  It would be wrong, however, to adopt this approach as the only response available to deal with the problem of delays.  Other measures can play an important part in alleviating delays.  The 1995 Act, for example, conferred additional powers on county registrars.  A county registrar is assigned to each Circuit Court office and his or her function is the control and management of the business of that Circuit Court office.  County registrars now have new and much wider powers which will have the effect of saving a considerable amount of Circuit Court time as they are empowered to deal with many motions that formerly only judges could handle.  The 1995 Act also gave the Superior Courts and Circuit Court Rules Committee the power to make rules requiring parties in High and Circuit Court personal injuries actions to disclose, without having to apply to court, the reports of experts such as doctors whom it is intended to call to give evidence.  I understand this matter is under consideration by the Superior Courts Rules Committee.  This measure is aimed at speeding up the hearing of <Col N="1264" /> actions in the High Court and in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>On the criminal law side, the 1995 Act addressed the problem of additional delays in the Dublin Circuit Court caused by the switching of criminal trials for hearing from Circuit Court sittings outside Dublin to the Dublin Circuit Court.  The Act provides that an application to transfer the trial to Dublin will only be granted by the court if the judge is satisfied that it would be manifestly unjust not to do so.  That is working. There is not much public recognition of the effects of these measures such as expanding the role of the county registrar and the Circuit Court Rules Committee so that it can amend its rules to change how business is done.  People slip into bad habits.  Barristers, solicitors and their clients have slipped into bad habits.  We all know the syndrome of settling on the steps of the court.  I do not know whether people realise &mdash; Senator Mulcahy is a solicitor so he will know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Waiting to settle the case on the steps of the court has a certain adrenaline flow but it means that as these cases were listed and will not now be heard, the court will adjourn early.  I understand they have tried to create a sense of the court steps in the Round Room of the Four Courts to try to get barristers, solicitors and clients to reach agreement on cases.  It has not worked very well because we all know cases are settled on the court steps.  If 20 cases are listed, if the courts hear them and if ten are settled it means the list is reduced by ten cases that might otherwise have been taken.  It is time all the people involved in these cases take a hold of how they do their business and speed up <Col N="1265" /> their own processes.  When I delve into most of the complaints I receive as Minister I find the delays are not because a court is not available but because clients or the insurance company will not reach agreement or that barristers or solicitors advise their clients not to reach agreement.  It is important there is a recognition that it is not just a case of new judges or new laws being required, all of us involved in the judicial system have to play a part.</P>
      <P>I have already announced I have obtained the agreement of the President of the High Court in relation to the Central Criminal Court, and the President of the Circuit Court for sittings of both courts in September this year for an extra three weeks.  This is the first time that that kind of innovative step has been taken by the courts to bring judges back three weeks early in an effort to clear serious criminal cases.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this combination of allocating resources in key areas and practical legislative and administrative reform will quickly equip the courts system with the means to make inroads in delays in hearing cases and appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the point in this House last December that, apart from appointing more judges and introducing various administrative and procedural reforms, the courts system needed a strategy for its longer term development.  I had in mind a comprehensive examination and review of the courts structure and its management, courts accommodation and facilities, use of technology in the courts &mdash; in other words, a root and branch look at the existing courts system. For that reason I set up a working group on a courts commission at the end of last year, chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham.  I asked the working group to review the operation and financing of the courts system with particular regard to the quality of service provided to the public.  I also asked the group to consider the matter of the establishment of a commission on the management of the courts as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy in <Col N="1266" /> line with the commitment to that effect in the Government's programme of renewal.</P>
    <P>Last spring the working group submitted its first report to me on management and financing the courts.  Serious defects in the administration of the courts are identified in the report which also urges a radical reappraisal of the administrative structures of the courts system.  The Government has approved in principle the primary recommendation of the report that an independent and permanent body to be known as the Courts Service be established on a statutory basis to manage a unified courts system.  I have asked the working group to submit a further report on how the establishment of a new courts service can be progressed.  The working group will also continue its work on the review of the day to day operation of the courts system and will submit further reports to me as appropriate.  I hope while we await the setting up of the courts service we can begin to make fundamental changes in the day-to-day operation of the system which will result in a better delivery of service.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the court's working group clearly demonstrates how this initiative is already beginning to have a significant input to the longer term, more strategic development of the courts system.  I avail of this opportunity to thank Mrs. Justice Denham and all the other members of the working group for the very important work they have undertaken in this area.  That working group is made up of people from a cross section of experiences of the courts &mdash; barristers, solicitors, trade unions &mdash; but also the consumers of the court service, people such as Róisin McDermott who chairs Women's Aid, who have been on the receiving end with clients who are seeking service from the courts and are able at a personal level to share that experience in devising how the courts should be changed.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in its recent report on family courts examined the type of judicial and courts structure <Col N="1267" /> that would be most suitable for dealing with family law cases.  The commission recommended a combination of structural and legal reforms, with a major injection of resources.  The report is being actively considered.  These recommendations straddle the responsibilities of my Department and the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  The report is also being examined by the working group on a courts commission as part of its examination of the courts system in general.</P>
    <P>I have put much emphasis on reform of the courts system since taking office &mdash; tackling immediate problems and implementing a longer-term development strategy.  The benefits of these reforms, with other initiatives I am taking in relation to our system of criminal justice, will ensure that the courts and other key elements of that system will have the capacity to respond effectively to changing circumstances generally and developments with regard to crime in particular.  The concentration of resources and longer term planning is crucial to the operation of an efficient system of justice, criminal and civil, which after all is the hallmark of a truly democratic society.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

If there are more criminals behind bars quicker as a result of this Bill then it will have played a significant part.</P>
      <P>The delays in the courts are unacceptable and I want to address some of the reasons for them.  The Minister accepted that the increase in judges by itself will not eradicate the delays but we need increased court facilities, improved procedures and so on to reduce these delays.</P>

I do not know of any bad habits that I or my colleagues have fallen into. I hope the Minister will consider withdrawing that remark at the conclusion of this debate.  From my perspective as one who has been practising in that area I flatly contradict what the Minister said as both professions, by and large, have helped to expedite our criminal justice system and are professions of which we should be very proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to a list system before the courts but she did not show a clear understanding of how it works. In any of the Circuit Courts in Dublin in any one day five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten cases may be listed before any one judge.  If several of those cases were not settled on the steps of the court only half the list could be dealt with on that day and, accordingly, would become more log-jammed.  It is not correct to suggest, as the Minister has done, that settling cases before they are heard results in a logjam in the system, it is actually of assistance to it.  The position is much worse in the country where up to 20 cases or more can be before <Col N="1269" /> any one circuit judge on any one day.  If they were not settled&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was talking about the way people discuss cases and so on.  By saying that solicitors and barristers have fallen into bad habits, I did not mean to criticise the way they do their legal business.

      <P>One of the main reasons for the delays in our courts system is the lack of proper organisation in the courts, but we hope the working group studying the system will come up with proposals in that regard.  Will the Minister address herself to one of the most pressing problems in the administration of the courts system in Dublin city, the lack of space and organisation of existing space?  The courts are divided between the building in the Four Courts, Dolphin House, Green Street <Col N="1271" /> and other locations.  The Minister missed a golden opportunity to obtain a perfect site adjacent to the Four Courts for the development of a courts complex. If she wishes to present herself as someone who wants to take action, she should avail of other sites available in the vicinity of the Four Courts. The Bill does not refer to the need for temporary judges.  As the present logjam will not exist forever, the Minister should consider the appointment of temporary judges.  This may require the introduction of new legislation, but I am sure the House would facilitate a debate on it.</P>
      <P>We are delighted to welcome the Bill. Anything that will serve to expedite the administration of justice will be welcomed by the House.  I take issue at the Minister presenting herself as a person who has taken fast and radical action. Until the recent crisis the Government had an appalling record on a series of issues, some of which she referred to in her speech.  Why did the Minister not make a decision on the bail laws until this month?  The Law Reform Commission report was published in August 1995?  Why has she only now made a decision on prison places when they were cancelled in June 1995?  The Minister referred to her record in legislation, but the only significant legislation to be brought before the Oireachtas in her tenure of office was the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996.</P>

Why have the Labour Party and Democratic Left been so pathetically feeble on the question of law and order since February 1995?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the Bill as another small measure, but it may be too little too late <Col N="1273" /> to deal with the crime crisis, which the Minister has not yet admitted is a crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refrain from reacting to Senator Mulcahy's contribution. As a lawyer practising in Dublin, I am surprised he does not know that five new District Courts will be opened shortly in the Richmond Hospital complex. That is progress.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill in the Seanad.  It is part of the package the Minister has been preparing for some time.  It tackles the main problem in the courts system, the arrears of cases and appeals awaiting hearing.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on her decision to appoint Pat Byrne as Commissioner designate of the Garda Síochána. He is an excellent policeman and will do an excellent job.  I also welcome her decision to appoint ten additional judges which is significant in the context of this debate.  Criminal cases will no longer be transferred from Cork to Dublin.  This abuse has stopped and judges must be satisfied that it is manifestly unjust not to transfer them.  In recent months the Minister has made the most dramatic increase in the number of judges and, therefore, in the level of court activity since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>The strongest feature of the Irish system of Government is the respect for and independence of the Judiciary, which is important.  There is, however, no agency capable of bringing about urgently needed changes.  The Minister for Justice stated previously that the courts system is creaking under the weight of cases and that county courts open when the trains arrive and close for the September harvest.  It is against that background that the proposal was made to overhaul the system for the first time in more than 70 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Mrs. Justice Denham and her committee for the work they have done in this area.  The report of that committee, which is welcome, is in urgent need of implementation.  In terms of efficiency and proper co-ordination, it is important that the proposed <Col N="1274" /> courts service be established as soon as possible.  The present position where the Department of Justice, the Office of Public Works and county councils share the day to day running of the courts is unsatisfactory.  There will be more coordination under the proposed courts service.</P>
    <P>The involvement of county councils in maintaining courthouses must be questioned. Councils were never given the resources to properly maintain them. The outdated accommodation in court buildings throughout the country reflects the antiquity of the work of the courts.  As a member of the appeals tribunal &mdash; the previous speaker is a former member of that tribunal &mdash; I visit courts throughout Munster from time to time and I am often appalled at the conditions in which justices, their staff and the legal profession work.  In the cold days of winter it is an absolute penance to sit in a court for several hours.</P>
    <P>It is important that courthouses are updated and provide proper accommodation. It will take many years and much money to bring the facilities up to standard.  A programme of work has commenced and considerable investment is being made in the courthouse in Newcastlewest in my area, which is in a very bad state of repair.  The courts service should be accountable to the Oireachtas through the Minister for Justice for finance and administration but not for judicial decisions.  That would ensure the separation of powers and would keep the Judiciary outside the sphere of political influence.</P>
    <P>The Denham report on the courts identifies fundamental problems with the courts system which have caused delays.  It acknowledges the difficult working conditions of court staff, who are to be complimented on their work. The report states that the fact that the courts have managed to function as well as they have is due to the dedication of people over the last 70 years in operating the judicial arm of Government. As the Minister said, delays are the crucial flaw in the courts system. <Col N="1275" /> They are expensive and create particular problems in criminal trials.</P>
    <P>Of the first 20 cases listed in the Supreme Court in February, the length of time between the High Court and Supreme Court hearing dates varied from two and a half to eight years, which is totally unacceptable in a modern democracy.  In personal injury cases in the High Court there is an average delay of almost three years between setting down of the case and its hearing.  In the Central Criminal Court and the High Court delays in date of return for trial vary from two months to almost six years.  For example, last December of 16 murder trials listed, eight were adjourned, three were adjourned with priority, two were listed for trial and provisional dates were fixed for three. Of 40 rape trials listed, dates were fixed for trial in only seven cases, provisional dates were fixed in two cases, two were arraigned and 29 adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Minister's announcement yesterday to appoint ten further judges, together with the decision in April to increase the size of the Judiciary, will contribute greatly to alleviating the problem, and the Minister is to be congratulated for that.  The courts have tried to provide a reasonable level of service in recent times in the face of modern demands and pressures.  There has been a significant increase in the amount of business coming before the courts in recent years in practically all areas of law, civil actions, personal injuries, litigation, family law business and criminal cases.</P>
    <P>The position of the Law Reform Commission on family courts is extremely revealing.  The level of pressure in that area of the judicial system must be addressed, and I welcome the Minister's commitment to do so.  Not only is there more business in that area but cases and appeals are more complex and time consuming than in the past. Changes to the limits of the jurisdiction of courts and developments in the family law area have had a tremendous impact on the amount and complexity <Col N="1276" /> of business before the courts.  The courts system has not been able to keep up with the increase in the number of cases and appeals.  Long delays in having cases resolved mean that many litigants, victims of crime and, to some extent, the community as a whole, are let down by the justice system.</P>
    <P>Delays in courts may adversely affect the smooth running of the business and commercial sector.  That could undermine public confidence in the system of justice.  It is recognised that justice delayed is justice denied.  That informs the overall approach to tackling the problems in the courts.  A key reforming issue of the courts is the appointment of judges, and this Bill further facilitates that.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the issues announced by the Minister in recent times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, this Bill is very specifically limited to enabling the Minister to appoint three extra judges to the Circuit Court.  Will the Cathaoirleach say whether that allows debate on matters such as bail laws, crime and punishment and problems in our courts?  I accept that the Minister has referred to those issues, but the Bill is very specific in its intent. Will the Cathaoirleach indicate whether on a Bill specifically dealing with an increase in the number of Circuit Court judges Members are allowed discuss the criminal law, the High Court, the Supreme Court, the District Court, prisons and so on?  If that is the case, it is a new departure in procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Mulcahy is quite right.  I was addressing the issue of prison places, just as the Minister and Senator Mulcahy addressed such issues. It is significant that between 1989 and 1993 not one extra prison place was provided. Since then nothing further was done until the present Minister initiated a programme to increase prison space. Under this programme, which the Minister accelerated last Tuesday, 126 extra places will be provided in 1996.  Construction of Castlerea main prison, which will provide 125 places, will begin and Mountjoy Women's Prison, which will provide 60 extra places, will start this year or in January 1997 at the latest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 55 extra places will come on <Col N="1278" /> stream for a new wing at Limerick Prison within a year.  Over a number of years I queried the former Minister for Justice and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice about the provision of this wing.  A wing of Limerick Prison has been closed for over two years and the prison services there inform me that at the time it was closed, it would not have cost a lot of money to ensure that those cells remained in use. However, I welcome the fact that the Minister has now taken action on this and that 55 extra places will be provided in Limerick within a year.  The building of the new remand prison at Wheatfield is welcome and this facility will provide 400 places.</P>
    <P>I especially welcome the provision of extra gardaí, which I have called for here for a number of years. The Garda representative associations have for some time been pointing out the necessity for an increase in Garda numbers.  We have had Adjournment debates about falling numbers in the Garda over the past number of years.  I welcome the Minister's announcement of an increase of 400 gardaí between now and 1997 in addition to the recruitment of 350 gardaí in 1996 and another 350 in 1997. The aim of this is to bring the strength of the force up to around 11,000.  It is well over ten years since the Garda numbers were at 11,000.  Some 200 further gardaí will be provided by the introduction of civilians who will be recruited to the service to carry out some duties for which gardaí are not necessary.  The association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors is very anxious that the Minister would consider increasing the retirement age from 55 to 60 years.  I ask the Minister to see if anything can be done about this.  I kept my contribution low-key after the last contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the Bill.  The Supreme Court and the High Court have a very high profile within the press and because of this the enormous amount of <Col N="1279" /> work which is done in the Circuit and District Courts often goes unnoticed.  A great deal of the coal-face work is carried out there.  The increase in the number of Circuit Court judges is to be warmly welcomed.  It is not sufficient to simply extend the number of judges. The need for extra facilities and staff has been spoken of and like other Members I congratulate Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, not just on the speed with which she reported, but on the content of her report which was very wide ranging.  I congratulate the Minister on having set up that group.  I hope it will be in a position to continue its work.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the justice system has managed to function in the extraordinary facilities described as courthouses at present.  On one occasion I was a witness in a District Court case and the hearing had to be transferred from the courthouse in Howth to Sutton Rugby Football Club clubhouse because Howth District Court had been burned down.  I was in the Circuit Court in Naas on another occasion and the scene could only be described as reminiscent of <i>Remembrances of an Irish RM</i>, because there was standing room only.  I am glad the Minister is now addressing this long neglect of our justice system.  Court sittings in September is to be warmly welcomed because, like the rest of us, judges like to plan their year.  We should express our gratitude to them and to those barristers and solicitors who will be trying to deal with the incredible backlog which has become the norm within the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to join the debate regarding the common practice of settling cases on the steps of the court.  The only cases of which I have had much experience are personal injury cases.  It would be worthwhile if the Minister could encourage such measures as the reciprocal disclosure of reports from the medical profession which in general is supported by most of those who have to give evidence within the courts.  The delays in these cases are appalling and people often have to travel to give evidence <Col N="1280" /> only to find when they reach their destination that the case has been settled and that they might as well get the next train back.  This also means that other cases which could have been dealt with are not.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of judges will mean that judges will want facilities which they consider suitable for those they have to pass sentence on and the progress to be made on the prison building programme is certainly welcome.  I am very glad the Minister is bringing forward the development of Wheatfield Prison.  I am one of the few people who have not called for an increase in the number of prison places because that is dangerous.  It might be worthwhile to try to put a ceiling on the number of prison places.  A remand prison, however, is absolutely essential.  Regrettably I know Mountjoy Prison only too well from visits there and it is unsuitable to have remand prisoners and sentenced prisoners there at the same time.  This has been spoken about for years so I hope that when Wheatfield is built one section of it will be used as a remand prison.</P>
    <P>The building of the new women's prison which the Minister mentioned is also urgent.  I spoke yesterday in the House about a study carried out on women prisoners within this country. Very little work has been done on women prisoners and this study looked at the incidence of psychiatric disease among them.  On reading the report I saw to my dismay that a high number of women remand prisoners had psychiatric illness and a history of in-patient or outpatient attendance at psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>I spoke yesterday about Penrose's law which suggested that the closure of mental institutions led to a higher number of people in penal institutions.  I know this is disputed but we must be very careful that those who are out of our mental institutions and become involved in crime are properly catered for.  Many of the women on remand were first offenders and as the Minister knows this is quite unusual because a <Col N="1281" /> high proportion of our women prisoners are recidivists who are in for multiple offences of shoplifting and so on.  We need to look very carefully at the type of people coming into prison.  I hope the new courts will have facilities to carry out immediate psychiatric assessments so that psychiatric assessment is no longer made while the prisoner is on remand.  This is a dangerous practice which we should try to prevent.  We do not have the facilities that exist in England.  There could be a diversion from court immediately so that a person before the court can be psychiatrically examined.  I would like to see that matter addressed.</P>
    <P>After all the work put into solving the drugs problem in the past few months and in view of the legislation introduced in the past few days, I was dismayed to discover there is a dispute about the opening of the detoxification unit in Mountjoy which has been so carefully planned.  Apparently, the Prison Officers' Association is not enthusiastic about how it is to be staffed.  I understood the unit was to be opened this week so I would be grateful if the Minister could explain how this problem has arisen at this late stage.  The matter should have been addressed earlier.</P>
    <P>The new judges will need more probation officers so I hope this is being addressed.  I also hope the use of community service will be encouraged wherever possible so that those who do not need to be sentenced to detention are not so sentenced.  We have an incredible situation where people who have been convicted for non-payment of fines are often sent to prison rather than being forced to take up community service. These people can be sent to prison whereas those detained on more serious charges may have to be released to make space.  This matter must be addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>I regret the Bill does not address a matter I brought up during discussion on the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995.  That matter is the retirement of District Court judges.  Their retirement <Col N="1282" /> conditions are different from those of other judges.  District Court judges retire at 65 and, while they can continue to work until they are aged 70, it is based on an annual assessment.  Senator Mulcahy supported the amendment I proposed to the Bill last December in this regard.  Speaking on the amendment, I asked why Supreme Court, High Court and other judges did not have to retire until they were 70 while District Court judges had to retire at 65.  The Minister of State did not give a plausible explanation.</P>
    <P>It would be far more serious for a judge of the Supreme Court not to be in the whole of his or her health than for a member of the District Court.  I cannot understand why the retirement ages for judges are not in line.  Last December I said I would be grateful if the matter was examined in the future and the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, said he would do so.  I suggested that it be dealt with in the next courts Bill.  That Bill is now before the House and I would not like the same thing to happen to this issue as happened to the ratification of the Protocols to the Geneva Convention.  One of the first things I sought when I became a Senator about three and a half years ago was that we should ratify the 1977 Protocols to the Geneva Convention.  I was told it would be done almost immediately.  It has not been ratified yet.  It is eight months since the question of aligning retirement ages in the Judiciary arose and I did not think it would be difficult to introduce it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The current system seems to debase judges in one sector of the courts.  Mrs. Justice Susan Denham recommended a unified court system in her report. Surely one of the most important elements in that is to ensure that judges have the same status and that people have the same expectations of the judges before whom they appear. People appearing before the District Court should not believe they come before judges whose positions are being renewed on a year to year basis.  The renewal is not often refused; I understand <Col N="1283" /> it only happened once.  However, there was a problem a couple of years ago when a district judge's renewal forms did not arrive on time.  Retrospective legislation had to be introduced in the Oireachtas to ensure that cases which had come before that judge were valid.  Can the Minister say why, as this is the next courts Bill before the House, the Department did not consider addressing this area, particularly as the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, said it would be looked at last December?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister on her accident; I would not like to see how the other fellow looks.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  Its provisions are an important and integral contribution to the fight against crime which the Government recently announced.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the government nominated Dermot O'Donovan for appointment to the High Court and nine other people for appointment to the Circuit Court.  In addition, two new High Court judges received their warrants of office from President Robinson.  These appointments are no substitute for the need for change in the courts system.  The existence of a backlog in our courts is a serious problem which must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The Government and the Minister are committed to ensuring it is addressed.</P>
      <P>With the recently published anticrime package, this Bill is an illustration of the Government's commitment to fighting crime.  Unfortunately, the problem of crime is a fact of life.  It is a serious problem that warrants urgent attention.  This attention is now being given and the Minister is to be commended on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The backlog of cases in the courts system has been criticised.  Some people are of the opinion that the courts have been inefficient in dealing with the anti-social elements of society.  This criticism is unjust and does not put the problem in the correct context.  The current crime problem is an unprecedented <Col N="1284" /> phenomenon.  The courts system has served the country well in the past but the situation it now has to deal with is unprecedented.  There is, therefore, an urgent need for change and this Bill illustrates the Government's acknowledgement of this need.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill increase the statutory maximum number of ordinary judges of the Circuit Court from 24 to 27.  This is a welcome development and an important measure in the fight against crime.  That fight is multifaceted. An important aspect of the fight is an efficient and effective court system.  The Government has also decided to seek amendments to District Court Rules and request separate sittings to speed up procedures on evictions for anti-social behaviour, provide barring orders on evictions for anti-social behaviour in local authority dwellings, allow an authority to refuse to house an applicant on grounds of anti-social behaviour and provide discretion for health boards to refuse or withdraw housing assistance.  These are important measures and indicate this Government's commitment to fighting the crime problem.</P>
    <P>This Government is not, and never has been, soft on crime.  The Labour Party is not, and never has been, soft on crime and it will not be in the future. The State has a duty to protect its citizens from anti-social elements and the Government is committed to ensuring this role is fulfilled.  The Bill illustrates this commitment and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a step in the right direction, in that it attempts to address the crime crisis through the courts.  It remains to be seen whether it is too little too late or whether it is sufficient.  Since last summer particularly we have lost our grip with regard to crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time, a Cabinet decision sent the wrong message to the people.  The crime package was dismantled in the interests of the Wicklow by-election and more than £20 million was taken from the budget of the Department of Justice. <Col N="1285" /> The knock-on effect was that a 150 cell prison was put on hold.  That sent a message to the public and to criminals that the Government was not serious about tackling crime, and had decided not to proceed with measures to deal with the extraordinary number of criminals who had been convicted but were walking the streets of our towns and cities.</P>
    <P>Whether that is the truth or a myth, I heard Fine Gael spokespersons at public meetings in my constituency openly blame the Labour Party Minister for Finance for removing part of the budget of the Department of Justice.  They supported their Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.  That criticism was obviously made also at higher levels if we are to accept recent reports.  The chairman of Fine Gael and other members of that party openly criticised the lack of support for the Minister for Justice in her attempt to deal with the crime wave.</P>
    <P>It was openly said by a Fine Gael elected representative at a public meeting at that time that the Minister for Justice was not at the Cabinet meeting which took that decision.  I do not know whether that is true because I am not privy to that information, but that was the defence put forward on behalf of the Minister for Justice.  I do not blame the Minister for Justice in all circumstances, but she should have dug in her heels on the matter &mdash; although that might not have been easy for her to do if she was not at the Cabinet meeting &mdash; and should not have allowed what happened at that time.</P>
    <P>That was the start of the rot in regard to how we deal with crime.  As my colleague, Senator Mulcahy, said, it was not until the deaths of Veronica Guerin and Detective Garda McCabe and the wounding of Detective Garda O'Sullivan that the reality hit the Cabinet that it had to take measures to claw back some credibility with the public in terms of addressing crime.</P>
    <P>Everybody knew in June 1995 there was a revolving door policy on prisons. Any garda in any town could confirm <Col N="1286" /> that when he delivered a prisoner to Mountjoy Prison by taxi, if he went into a shop on his way home the prisoner would be home before him.  The decision to dismantle the crime package was taken in the knowledge that that was the case.  That was a very bad decision and we have been reeling from its effects ever since.</P>
    <P>Another area which needs to be addressed is that of conviction for drug offences, which is tied up with the area of court reform.  It is extraordinary to hear a statement by a Government source that a drug free zone is being provided in a prison.  What hope can we have of drug free zones in our cities, towns and villages if our main prison is not a drug free zone?  What hope have we of addressing the real issue of drugs on the streets if that is our approach?  In the past few days it was revealed that someone who was convicted of the importation of drugs and given a sentence of eight years, is now in an open prison having served ten weeks.  What kind of message does that send to the public and to criminals?  While we welcome the Bill, the proper decisions are not being taken to deal effectively with crime.</P>
    <P>Another area in which we will have disastrous results shortly is in the treatment of the insane, the plea of insanity and what happens at a later stage. Senator Henry referred to it to some extent.  She confined her contribution to the fact that psychiatric hospitals have effectively closed and the prison and court systems are now picking up the fall out of social cases who up to now were dealt with by the Department of Health's psychiatric services.  The court and prison systems are now clogged up as a result.  I believe what Senator Henry said is true.</P>
    <P>The Garda cannot deal with social cases in the way in which they did in the past, when they approached the psychiatric unit in the area and spoke to the medical officer in charge to see if there was a medical component to a problem. In many of those cases, people were dealt with by the Department of Health. <Col N="1287" /> That is no longer the case.  A Garda sergeant recently told me he spent four hours travelling in a squad car from one psychiatric unit to another to try to get someone admitted without success.  In his opinion, the person concerned needed medical assistance rather than to spend the night in a Garda station cell before appearing in court the next morning.</P>
    <P>I understand from reports that up to 100 sex offenders will be released in the next two years, which concerns every parent.  There is no register of sex offenders here.  The Minister should take steps to compile such a register which could be linked with other European police forces.  A convicted sex offender from another country provided care for young people here.  This worries parents.  There has been a massive increase in the number of sex abuse cases.  It is time to establish a register to ensure that such people do not inveigle their way into care programmes established by different Departments and voluntary agencies.  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on this issue.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Justice and the Government decided to accept the proposed Private Members' legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil in the Dáil. In recent years, Fianna Fáil has consistently put forward constructive suggestions and legislation and has voted money towards dealing with the problem of crime.  I am pleased, to some extent, that the Government is responding in a positive way to that problem.  It is encouraging that, for the first time in the life of this Administration, there seems to be a clear commitment to the notion that the parties involved in a rainbow coalition must work together to deal with crime.  Today is the first time I have witnessed, in this House, a cohesive approach to crime by the three Government parties.  In the past, people were inclined to protect their own patch but there is now evidence of cohesion.  While people may not agree with Senator Mulcahy's comments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Bill is straightforward and deals with the appointment of additional judges.  I welcome this development, particularly as it relates to the Circuit Court because additional judges are needed for various reasons, including dealing with the problem of crime and the serious backlog of cases before our courts.  If a person puts down a case today, it will not come before the courts until early 1998.  When discussing the provision of additional judges, we are dealing with one aspect of a large area of the administration of justice. There are many other aspects which contribute towards achieving a fair system of justice and ensuring that people can live in peace and go about their business without fear of being shot, intimidated or attacked.</P>
      <P>Recent events have brought about a realisation that, over a period, there was complacency towards crime which led to a deterioration in the situation.  Crime did not appear in Dublin or throughout the country since the appointment of the present Minister for Justice; it is no harm to refute that lie.  Successive administrations had to deal with grave problems, including the provision of courts, delays, etc., relating to the running of our courts, people being released on bail, prisoners gaining early release and a lack of accommodation for sentenced criminals.  These issues must be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of additional judges.  Members are aware that there are backlogs and delays and that the system is on the brink of collapse. There are difficulties with regard to criminal and civil law and delays in the hearing of cases.  I welcome the appointment of additional judges who, I hope, will serve the system well and <Col N="1289" /> respond to changes within it.  I have dealt with some of them in a professional capacity in the past.</P>
    <P>By and large, the system of law which has evolved in Ireland has worked. Judges, no more than anyone, are not perfect.  However, it is important that guidelines be laid down with regard to uniformity of sentencing.  Judges cannot be blamed for the general breakdown in law and order.  Some judges must be frustrated that their powers have been restricted.  I welcome the fact that a referendum on the issue of bail will be held later in the year.  The previous decision relating to this area was handed down over 30 years ago.  Times have changed and we are no longer dealing with infringements on the liberty of petty criminals.  We must now deal with well funded mobs of gangsters who will do anything to further their cause and evade justice.  I am glad many people have taken note of the Minister's comments in this regard.  Public representatives and opinion makers throughout Ireland, including the media, have a role to play.  It is important that people support the referendum on bail.  There is no doubt that people are playing ducks and drakes with the system.</P>
    <P>It is also important to consider the question of sentencing policy and whether prisoners serve their full sentences. They will only do so if adequate accommodation is provided.  Consideration must be given to the categorisation of prisoners.  People serving sentences for minor crimes or once-off incidents should be treated differently to those who should be imprisoned for an extended period, if not forever.</P>
    <P>The question of the expanded prison programme must also be considered because there is an immediate need for additional prison spaces.  I would advocate the short-term conversion of certain institutions to cater for low risk prisoners until these additional spaces become available.  Gardaí and judges would, therefore, not feel frustrated when they meet people who were given six month sentences but were released after two days.  I urge the Minister to <Col N="1290" /> consider this as a short-term programme. While major prison schemes may proceed, we will be waiting a number of years for their completion.  Some of those who are sentenced by our courts deserve to be imprisoned for long periods; they do not deserve to be at liberty. We must ensure that sentences handed down to those who commit serious crimes are served.  Otherwise, it will be frustrating for gardaí and detectives if people are released from prison as quickly as they enter.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be cross-party support for the measures being introduced. If amendments are to be taken on board, so be it.  This problem is too serious to politicise the issue or for any cheap gimmicks by individuals or parties. If we fail to deal with the situation, the public will give a firm answer to individuals or parties.</P>
    <P>We must look at the way courts operate and at courthouses.  I am sure Senator O'Kennedy will confirm that in some areas business is done on the street which is pleasant on a sunny day but not when dealing with matrimonial cases.  Couples often have to sit outside the courthouse or stand on the footpath during negotiations.  Consultation rooms must be provided in our courthouses.  I hope extra court space will be provided. If fire officers were particularly vigilant, some courthouses, particularly in the city, would be closed because they are overcrowded and badly ventilated.  A judge in the courthouse in Kilmainham had an ongoing problem with rats and broken windows.  It is not good enough that judges, practitioners and witnesses in civil and criminal cases have to put up with this.  We must look at this.</P>
    <P>As we debate this Bill and other measures relating to the administration of justice and fighting crime, it is important that both Houses adopt a unified approach.  Politicians should be seen to respond to the problem.  The opinion poll taken last week suggested that politicians did not respond as quickly as they might.  It behoves us all to support the Minister for Justice.  The poll also indicated that the public does <Col N="1291" /> not blame the Minister, who has worked hard but has been politically kicked around at times.  She has responded by dealing efficiently with this problem. Knee jerk reactions or piecemeal proposals will not do when dealing with the crime problem.  We must keep our heads.</P>
    <P>These problems have evolved over a number of years and we should nail the lie that everything has got worse in the past 18 months since the Minister took office.  It is important that we make suggestions, which I hope will be taken on board.  We must ensure that those who commit serious crimes are given lengthy prison sentences and that there is no question of early release.</P>
    <P>I compliment members of Judiciary who have made it known that they will not take any more nonsense in relation to drugs cases.  It is important that people in public life are constructive and give a solid lead on this issue.  We must deal with the problems before us, although we will not solve them overnight. I hope what I have said will be taken on board.  I have no doubt the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, will relay our comments to the Minister. This is a reasoned debate on the problems which have arisen and I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>My party wholeheartedly supports the Bill and welcomes the fact that it is being introduced in the Seanad. I understand the Minister of State has been given a specific responsibility in the fight against crime, that is, to come up with immediate prison spaces.  I wish him well in his task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill increases the number of Circuit Court judges from 24 to 27.  There will be 28 judges sitting in the Circuit Court, including the President of the Circuit Court.  This move is welcome. For many years the court system has been the Cinderella of State services in the justice area.  It has been under-funded and devoid of any long-term strategic planning.  Delay in gaining access to justice is one of the most <Col N="1292" /> remarkable features of the system and it is a major cost factor for litigants.  We hope the appointment of these extra judges will lead to speedier trials and accused persons spending less time on bail.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Law Reform Commission's report on bail pointed out that one way bail offending could be reduced is by reducing the length of time persons are at liberty before trial and that the appointment of extra judges would deal with that.  It is appropriate to welcome these appointments which, we hope, will lead to a reduction of the length of time people are on bail. A referendum on bail laws has been promised for November.  Those on remand should not have to wait lengthy periods before being brought to trial, which is essential in a fair justice system.</P>
    <P>The delays in the court system have been acknowledged for a number of years.  In 1993 the Bar Council and the Law Society presented a joint submission with proposals for change.  The Minister appointed a commission under Mrs. Justice Susan Denham which recommended that the court service should be established as an executive agency independent from the Department of Justice, but answerable to the Minister.  This was in line with recommendations in the Devlin report in 1969. The court service in Northern Ireland is under the control of a full-time Executive, which the Minister mentioned.  She said the Government had approved in principle the primary recommendation of the report, that is, that an independent and permanent body to be known as the court service would be established on a statutory basis.  She has asked the working group to submit a further report on how the establishment of the service could be progressed. When will this happen?</P>
    <P>I noted a comment by the Chairman of the Bar Council, James Nugent, on the appointment of the extra judges.  He called for an independent body which would oversee the provision of the court service as recommended by the <Col N="1293" /> Denham commission.  How soon does the Government expect that to be in operation?  We must prioritise this matter. As we are all aware, delays are experienced daily in the courts.  This undermines the justice system, our belief in it and causes us to question if it is fair.  It also denies compensation to those who are entitled to it and causes litigants great personal stress and anxiety.  The current backlog adds substantially to the high cost of litigation about which we all complain.</P>
    <P>In the recent round of judicial appointments, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness was appointed to the High Court and there are now two female High Court judges.  Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness was the first woman to be appointed to the Circuit Court and it is welcome that of the nine judges appointed yesterday three are women, but I am disappointed that of the 28 judges in the Circuit Court, including the President, only three are women.  I ask the Government to consider appointing more female judges.  That is a recommendation of the Report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women of which Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness and I were members.  It recommended that the aim in all State appointments should be to have a 40 per cent female representation.  Given that the majority of family law cases are dealt with in the Circuit Court, it is particularly important that a reasonable number of women as well as those who have expertise in family law be appointed judges.  Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness was recognised as having particular expertise in that area and there was some regret that she was moved from the Circuit Court to the High Court.  I urge that more people such as she be appointed.</P>
    <P>In addition to the appointment of extra judges, funding must allocated for the provision of necessary facilities and back up services.  I pay tribute to the Government for extending the free legal <Col N="1294" /> aid service, increasing the number of centres providing that service and establishing the Free Legal Aid Board on a statutory basis.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, has spoken on that issue on a number of occasions here.  This is an area that tends to overlap between his Department and the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Government's crime package for extra prison spaces.  A total of 400 remand spaces are to be provided at Wheatfield Prison, but when will they be available? People would like an immediate response to that need though I accept that such additional resources cannot be provided overnight.  I wish the Minister of State well in his task of finding immediate spaces for remand prisoners.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the package announced by the Government last week in the fight against crime amounts to £54 million, a substantial but necessary expenditure in view of recent events and the escalation in crime.  I am interested in hearing whether additional gardaí are to be dedicated to anti-drugs services.  Of our force of 10,000 gardaí, less than 10 per cent are dedicated anti-drugs officers.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that there is a dedicated drugs squad in all Garda divisions.  We discussed the drugs problem yesterday when debating the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996.  We all acknowledge that drugs are the greatest threat to society and are the cause of most crime committed by addicts who need to feed their habit and by many who committed some of the frightening crimes in the recent past.  I ask the Minister of State to convey the message to the Government that it is important that a greater number of gardaí be allocated to fighting the drugs scourge in our society.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of the new Garda Commissioner, Mr. Pat Byrne, and wish him well in the task <Col N="1295" /> ahead of him.  This is a difficult time in the area of justice.  A review of the efficiency of the Garda force is being carried out under the strategic management initiative and that review group will report back to Government before the end of the year.  A speedy response in all those areas is necessary, but I question the inclusion of the Garda Commissioner as part of the review group.  Is that wise?  As my colleague, Senator Dardis, said on the Order of Business, would the chief executive of a company be involved in carrying out a review of his or her company?</P>
    <P>I wish to raise another matter which was brought to my attention yesterday. In the fight against crime the Minister made provision for the appointment of additional forensic staff.  There is a lack of resources in the office of the State Pathologist, which has been in the news recently.  The demands on that office have increased.  To date this year there have been 100 deaths in suspicious circumstances. The State Pathologist, Professor Harbison, is responsible for Dublin and the rest of the country and he has an assistant in Cork.</P>

She has said she will publish the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in the next week or two and that the legislation will improve the efficiency of court procedures and reduce the amount of time spent by gardaí in courts.  That is welcome.  All of us see gardaí spend many days in court when they could be doing much more worthwhile work.  I welcome the promised increase in the number of gardaí under the crime package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> The Minister said that she is considering the introduction of changes in the system operating in the Family Law Court to make it more family friendly and to improve facilities there. Responsibility for that court straddles her Department and the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  This area is being examined by the working group on the courts commission as part of its examination of the courts system.  Given that divorce legislation has been introduced and will be passed early in the next session, the number of family law cases is rapidly increasing and it is an area of the courts system that deserves special attention.</P>

      <P>I welcome the decision to increase the number of Circuit Court judges to which this Bill gives statutory effect.  Between 1987 and the end of the 1980s when a policy of fiscal rectitude was pursued untold damage was done to every system, but that is being rectified by the Government which has taken the crime problem seriously.  As a previous speaker said, justice delayed is justice denied for the accused, the victim and society.  The increase in the volume of cases coming before the courts which, until recently, was not met with a similar increase in the number of judges, has led to a judicial bottleneck whereby an individual may have to wait for months or years before a case comes to trial. That is unacceptable and has caused hardship for all those involved in a case. There will be widespread public welcome for the measures designed to reduce delays and I hope that in the <Col N="1297" /> coming months further measures will be introduced to speed up the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to decisions made on the steps of courthouses.  Such decisions were totally unsatisfactory because, when people returned home and reflected on what had been decided and the manner in which that decision was taken, they failed to understand the procedure. It is an entirely different matter when a case goes to litigation because the litigant knows exactly where he or she stands.  Increasingly, it has been the experience of people leaving courthouses that the system is totally unsatisfactory unless there is total agreement, unless litigants understand fully what has been decided which very often they do not.</P>
      <P>The first step in maintaining and increasing public confidence in our judicial system has already been taken by the Court and Court Officers Act whose provisions attempted to bring our judicial system into the 20th century.  It is time responsibility for the upkeep of courthouses was taken from local authorities. They are unable to fulfil their other statutory tasks, whether in the provision of housing, local services or whatever.  Financial provision for courthouses is very far down on their agenda. Some other system must be seriously examined.</P>
      <P>I especially welcome the fact that solicitors and barristers will be eligible for appointment to the Circuit Court.  The first such appointment has already been made.  The appointment of solicitors will broaden our judicial base and ensure that those with experience of the nitty gritty of the day to day operations of the law are eligible for appointment to the Bench.  The speeding up of the administration of justice is just one of the challenges confronting us as we endeavour to get to grips with our increasing crime levels.  The drugs crisis is at the very root of the problem we face.  A law and order response alone will do little to tackle the demand for drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> I welcome the measures the Government announced yesterday, in particular its recognition that the explosion in demand for drugs must be tackled in tandem with their supply.  Yesterday's announcement of the establishment of a ministerial task force, headed by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, to identify ways in which the response to the drugs problem can be better co-ordinated is long overdue.  I especially welcome the short period within which it is to report.</P>
    <P>Drug dealers are holding many communities hostage, leaving many ordinary citizens feeling powerless to counteract the activities of dealers in their midst.  I welcome the decision to speed up procedures for evicting people on the grounds of anti-social behaviour.  I look forward to the early publication of the Bill to give effect to these measures which I hope will be passed by both Houses without delay.</P>
    <P>Estate management is a major factor in the fight against drug dealing and anti-social behaviour.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus, has made this a priority, the results of which will soon become evident.  Following the brutal murders of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and Veronica Guerin, we have been forced to take a cold, hard look at our society, its present state and where it is heading.  The Government's response to mounting concerns has been both swift and measured.  However, the response from certain other quarters, while swift, certainly was not measured. It is inevitable that at times of great public emotion there will be ill-considered calls for quick panaceas.  In recent weeks we have heard calls for the declaration of a state of emergency and the reinstatement of draconian Garda powers, but society's response to crime must be based on the rule of law.  In some cases those laws may need to be changed or, the implementation of existing laws improved.  The Government is addressing the position in a calm, measured manner.  I am confident that <Col N="1299" /> the final result will be a significantly improved criminal justice system which will ensure that criminals are prosecuted with the full rigour of the law while simultaneously ensuring that individual freedoms are fully vindicated.</P>
    <P>I fully support the updating of the State Forensic Laboratory.  I understand the Government has already agreed the appointment of a full-time assistant to the State Pathologist.  I plead that that office be based in Cork where a particularly large volume of work has been undertaken in recent years by the Assistant State Pathologist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some months ago the Minister increased the maximum number of Circuit Court judges to 24. What information has become available to the Minister in the intervening months to make her aware that her decision at that time was a mistake? What has emerged in the meantime to persuade her to introduce this Bill &mdash; which has one purpose only, to increase the number of Circuit Court judges from 24 to 27?  What has transpired to justify this decision?  Was information withheld from the Minister at that point?  I should like be reassured on that point.  She said some months ago that she had given very full consideration to all the demands and pressures at all levels in the courts and then proposed to the Oireachtas that the maximum number of Circuit Court judges required would be 24.  Was her examination and consideration of the seriousness of the position, particularly in the Circuit Court but in others as well, so casual and incomplete as to represent a very serious indictment of the manner in which proposals are considered by her and within her Department and then enacted into law by the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my years as a Member of this House I have never experienced a Minister literally going back on something she proposed to us a mere three months ago, or witnessed such circumstances within a few months of the passage of a Bill such as the Courts (Supplemental <Col N="1300" /> Provisions) Act, 1995, despite the comprehensive statement of the Minister today on a whole range of issues not relevant to this Bill.  That does not fill me with confidence.  I had thought that the Minister would advance proposals on the basis of the most exhaustive examination of an issue which was very serious a few months ago and remains so.  When replying I should like the Minister to explain that anomaly, which is a very kind word for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, &ldquo;I have had cause to look again at the position with regard to the arrears of cases.&rdquo;  That cause arose within a few months of her saying that the maximum number of Circuit Court judges required was 24.  There is something very wrong and deficient in that type of examination.</P>
    <P>This is one of the shortest, if not the shortest, Bills ever introduced here which did not require consultation with the parliamentary draftsman or with anyone else.  Its provision is simply to increase the number of judges to not more than 27.  In case we are not capable of understanding it, we have an explanatory memorandum to tell us that that is precisely what this Bill is doing. That indicates something very serious in the Department of Justice or in the Minister's consideration of the crime level.</P>
    <P>What will be the effect of this Bill on the Circuit Court?  I am very concerned, as we all are, that our courts be seen to operate effectively, that when they take decisions, at whatever level, those decisions and sanctions will be implemented in the administration of justice.  If there are more judges dealing with criminal cases, presumably they will have occasion to impose sentences. That will mean more people being made amenable to sanction and courts being able to operate effectively and seen to be respected by the Administration, because it is a matter for the Administration to provide prison places for the people who will be sentenced by the extra judges appointed yesterday and by those who will be appointed under this provision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> I would like to know &mdash; I presume the information on this will be available within the Department of Justice &mdash; how many of the people who received sentences of not less than two years in the superior courts in the past three years are now serving sentences in accordance with law and the Constitution? How many of them are now wandering free on temporary release? This is a matter of significant relevance because a heinous murder was committed in Clonmel in the past few days and it is of concern to the people in the surrounding area that, while someone is being investigated and will, perhaps, be prosecuted in time, a known number of convicted offenders are out on temporary release on the streets of Clonmel and in every town and city.  For that reason I want to know if the Minister is now of the view that we need 27 judges, not 24.  Is she conscious that giving responsibility to judges and then frustrating that by not providing prison places is calculated to bring the whole system into further disrepute?</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I was not here last week, but I regret statements made by members of the Judiciary in respect of people they had sentenced wandering free.  That is a significant indication of frustration and anger on the part of so many judges or justices at the fact that when they do what they are required to do under their oath and under this Constitution, their actions are set at naught. Will the appointment of three extra judges improve the system, or will it give rise to a further undermining of confidence in the system of administering justice?  Given that so many convicted criminals are wandering free in our towns and cities and in the countryside, is the Minister's proposal to appoint three extra judges to deal with criminal cases in the Circuit Court merely window-dressing?  I was told today of someone sentenced to seven years for a very serious offence in the Minister's city who, within three weeks of being sentenced, was transferred to the open prison at Shelton Abbey.  How can that inspire confidence in our system <Col N="1302" /> of justice?  What consideration did the Minister and her officials give to that scandal before coming before us today with a proposal, which seems to contain an element of window-dressing, to appoint three extra judges?</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement covered the whole range of the law and contained only one short paragraph about arrears of cases on the criminal side.  That is a terrible indictment.  Either someone withheld information from the Minister or she did not sufficiently consider the information provided.  Which is it?  I would particularly like to know how many of those serving sentences are on temporary release, because the public is entitled to know just how our system is operating and how it is being utterly frustrated.</P>
    <P>My views on the establishment of an interview board to examine the suitability of appointees to the Judiciary have been known for a long time.  It is a nonsense, an accommodation reached, perhaps in our time in Government, with the Labour Party, which has, unfortunately, been maintained by this Government.  Which of yesterday's appointees could not or would not have been appointed by the Government if that nonsense of an interview board had not been introduced?  Which of them would not have been considered under the old system where the Government of the day acted on its responsibility? Why was it necessary to go through the nonsense of interviewing people if not for the purpose of giving the public the impression that things were being done properly and fairly?  Those who are close to the people appointed would just smile wryly.  I have respect for the people who were appointed; I know most of them personally, but not one of them is a card carrying member of Fianna Fáil.  That should not disqualify them from being appointed to the Judiciary, but I have to ask what kind of window-dressing is this on the part of elements of the Labour Party in particular and of Democratic Left, to convey the impression that things are being done properly?  That is the issue we <Col N="1303" /> have to be honest about in terms of the administration of justice.  The public want to know if we are just engaged in window-dressing to give the impression that we are doing things as they should be done according to the highest standards and the most efficient system.</P>
    <P>I have one final question which is not immediately related to this short Bill. Many people are concerned about the balance that applies between the treatment of persons charged with crime and that of victims, the people in whose name prosecutions are brought.  Our adversarial system means that a case must be proved beyond all doubt.  Many times, particularly in my earlier years in addressing a jury, I relied on that fact to leave a doubt in the mind of a jury.  It is a very heavy onus.  In other systems in other countries, the inquisitorial system particularly, an examining magistrate conducts an examination.  If we are moving towards the pattern of our European partners, why should an examining magistrate not be allowed to note it as being significant if someone stays silent and will not account for this, that or the other?</P>
    <P>We should at least consider the option of the inquisitorial system which has proved to be much more effective in bringing criminals to justice throughout the European Community than our system. Even if those criminals were brought to justice, resulting in more convictions, would that mean people would be more frustrated and angry because those who were convicted would not be serving their sentences in accordance with the Constitution?  How much thought has the Minister given to that fact in introducing legislation providing for these extra appointments?</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I agree with Senator O'Kennedy that we should look at the possibilities of the inquisitorial system.  I am not a practitioner in this area but his suggestion is a worthy one.  I welcome the additional appointments.

      <P>I do not see why there should be a problem with it.  I congratulate Senator O'Kennedy because he has addressed some of the positive aspects of the Bill whereas the previous two Fianna Fáil speakers seemed to waste practically all of their precious time attacking the Government, saying absolutely nothing constructive on the debate.  I do not know why they did that.</P>
      <P>May I correct Senator Mulcahy's comment on the Labour Party drugs policy document?  I was a member of that sub-committee and am aware the report was not put together hastily.  At our last party conference, a policy development commission was set up under which subcommittees were established.  The drugs policy sub-committee was the first to start working and we have been working for at least six months, seeking opinions not only from people within the Labour Party but from people working in the drugs area.  We spent a long time deliberating before presenting our report.  I refute the falsehood that it was hastily put together.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran seems to have access to what goes on in Cabinet.  I thought there was Cabinet confidentiality but he seems to know what goes on in Cabinet.  I wonder how.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Neville gave details of the time delays in various courts.  It is stated in the <i>Bar Review</i> that the Supreme Court list of April this year contained 259 cases awaiting hearing, of which up to 150 are still awaiting a date for hearing. The first case in the Supreme Court list which does not yet have a date for hearing shows a delay from the date of hearing in the High Court of almost three years.  I presume that when that case was in the High Court there was a Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice.  That gives the lie to the Fianna Fáil assertion <Col N="1305" /> that the problem started in the past year or so.  The problem obviously has been ongoing for years.  The court system needs a thorough root and branch examination.  It is obvious to anyone &mdash; I am a lay person who has to sit in court occasionally for one reason or another &mdash; that the courts system needs a thorough overhaul.  I do not know why Senator Mulcahy is so sensitive about solicitors and barristers being part of that process.</P>
    <P>I support the recommendations of the first interim report of the working group on a court commission, the Denham Committee.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has told us she is working out ways to have it implemented.  The committee's main recommendation is that an independent court services board should be set up comprising mainly members of the Judiciary as well as representation from trade unions, management, the legal professions, court staff and court users.  It is intended that it should be widely representative and that it should look into all aspects of court procedure.</P>
    <P>Clearly there are delays and we should look at the ways to speed up the process.  Obviously that will mean appointing extra judges.  It includes other things and I welcome the fact that in future the county registrar will be able to do some of the business that judges spent their time on and that the Circuit Court Rules Committee will have the power to save time for judges. The working group recommends that modern information technology could be used more efficiently to speed up the process.  The Minister indicated today and previously that measures are being taken so that a garda will not have to sit around all day in court, waiting to say that he was the garda who submitted certain documentation.  Similarly, a doctor should not have to sit around all day waiting to say that he is the doctor who conducted such an examination.  If barristers had to wait in hospital as long as doctors have to wait in court they would be asking questions about hospital administrative systems.  It is up <Col N="1306" /> to barristers and solicitors to play their role in examining what can be done to improve the court systems.</P>

      <P>That is very welcome. I was called to a court because I had written a letter to the housing maintenance department about a repair I wanted carried out.  Somebody subsequently put in a claim and used my letter as evidence.  I had to sit around in court.  The only reason I was there was to say I was the person who had written the letter.  There should have been a simple procedure where I could have spoken to the judge for half a minute saying I signed the letter.  The case was settled and I did not have to give evidence. That is just an example of time wasting.  I hope those areas will be addressed.</P>
      <P>On the question of offences committed while on bail, it is clear that if cases are heard sooner obviously the people will not be out on bail for so long and will commit fewer offences during the period of bail.  We should have consecutive rather than concurrent sentencing when somebody on bail commits other offences.  I do not have a problem with the fact that we are proposing to change the bail laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Article 38.1 of the Constitution, &ldquo;No person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law&rdquo;.  People have a right to reasonable expedition in legal business.  Clearly the will of the people is that hearings should <Col N="1307" /> be speeded up.  I welcome the fact that there will be extra sittings of the High, Circuit and Central Criminal Courts and the additional appointments in the forensics area.  I support the call for additional resources for forensic pathology.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will be able to convey to the Minister my question on the promised juvenile justice Bill.  It was announced earlier that there would be such a Bill.  I asked the Minister about it a month ago and she indicated that progress was being made but it would be difficult to draft.  If we do not deal with young offenders in an effective way, and in my view that involves their parents &mdash; that is the intention of the proposed juvenile justice Bill &mdash; we will have people offending at an early age who will become chronic offenders unless we have effective methods of dealing with them at their first offence.</P>
    <P>There is a need for preventive measures in the criminal justice area as well as in areas related to drugs and crime.  We cannot merely react to what is happening without taking preventive action.  That legislation is just as important as the other legislation we dealt with.  Sentencing policy, the Garda, prison places, efficiency within prisons and the courts are interrelated. We do not need to dwell on the question of prisons today but if many people come out of prison as worse offenders than when they entered there must be something wrong.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should look at the possibility of separate courts to deal with drugs related cases.  In the United States there is a system of separate courts which has proved to be effective in reducing the number of crimes committed by drug addicts.  It is estimated that in Dublin up to 80 per cent of crime may be committed by drug addicts to feed their habit.  So far as I understood the US system, people are not necessarily put into prison but are put on a rehabilitative medical programme and have to report to the court consistently and <Col N="1308" /> to be seen to be working with the rehabilitative programme.  That would seem more effective than to put people into a prison such as Mountjoy where Senator Henry referred to the setting up of separate detoxification units and where the majority of prisoners still have little access to a rehabilitative programme.</P>
    <P>There may be other ways of dealing with that issue and, if so, we should look at them.  Given that the health boards have little to do with drug addicts in prison that matter should be looked at. There should be continuing treatment for drug offenders during their stay in and following their release from prison.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of extra judges.  Clearly that in itself will not solve all our problems but it is an important factor.  The recommendations of the working group must be implemented as soon as possible.  I hope the various measures being put forward to deal with the prisons, the Garda and the demand reduction in drugs will be effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The Minister has adopted the correct approach by increasing the number of judges.  The appointment of three additional circuit court judges is welcome. Those who have been appointed are people of the highest calibre and will play an important role in administering the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is considerable agreement on all sides of the House regarding a number of important changes being proposed by the Minister, one of which is the referendum to change the bail laws. This issue has been discussed for quite some time and up to now nobody had grasped the nettle.  On other occasions, public opinion polls gave the impression a referendum would pass easily but as the debate progressed the margins became very narrow and it was defeated.  However, it is important to change the bail laws.  In the wake of current events I am confident a referendum on bail with the correct wording will be passed by a huge majority if and when <Col N="1309" /> it is put to the people.  If a referendum on bail, which involved a huge public debate, were defeated it would be a serious matter and would send out all the wrong signals.  However, I am pleased the Minister is now grasping this nettle and bringing forward the referendum.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on numerous occasions about the necessity to curtail the right to silence.  I want the right to silence to be restricted but there will have to be sufficient safeguards for an accused person or suspect.  I am pleased the Minister has met my demand in large measure by amending the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill which restricts the right to silence in drug trafficking cases.  It is a difficult matter to restrict the right to silence and I congratulate her on moving in this direction. At a later stage it may prove necessary to further restrict that right.</P>
    <P>Everyone is aware of how people involved in drug trafficking were arrested by the Garda, taken in for questioning and refused to answer questions. Drug traffickers are fully aware of how the system operates to safeguard them.  This legislation is essential and has been necessary for a long time.</P>
    <P>The Organised Crime (Restraint and Disposal of Illicit Assets) Bill which is before the Dáil is necessary as well as the earlier legislation under which banks are obliged to report on money they consider is being laundered.  Finance companies and banks reported more than 300 cases to the Revenue with the result that over £20 million has been frozen.  The people who own it will have to vouch for this money.  Given that large sums of money were being laundered this Bill was necessary.  The Minister has adopted the correct approach to having this money frozen.  I would go one step further and say where money is about to be moved because there is a suspicion that the Revenue are about to take action, the Minister should have the power to obtain a conditional order.</P>
    <P>The Garda has demanded a change in regard to arrestable offences to deal <Col N="1310" /> with persons who have stabbed or assaulted somebody and run into a house or their own home with an iron bar and where the Garda have been prevented from entering that house. They could enter the house if the person in question had a gun, but not if he or she had a knife.  I am pleased the criminal law legislation currently going through the Dáil will create a new series of new arrestable offences which will allow gardaí enter houses without warrants to arrest such offenders.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan is correct in saying that gardaí should not have to go to court to deal with minor traffic offences. In such circumstances a Garda certificate stating that the person concerned did not have tax or insurance on a car should be sufficient.  A Garda sergeant could then deal with the matter in the court.  The prosecuting garda could notify offenders of the information he or she intends to supply to the court and inform them that if they wish they can go to court to contest it.  If they decline the offer to go to court the judge in question should be notified.  When speeding offences come before our courts, courtrooms are usually full of gardaí, detectives, defendants and so on. Many of those cases could be dealt with by a District Court clerk without the offenders going to court.  The amount of Garda manpower and resources being wasted on minor traffic offences is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the changes she initiated in regard to county registrars.  Up to now listed cases and notices of motion cluttered up the courts, but the Minister has simplified the system.  This will speed up the court process and reduce the number of people attending court.</P>
    <P>As a solicitor I am pleased the Minister has appointed a number of solicitors to the Circuit Court Bench.  I am sure Senator O'Kennedy agrees this will give the Minister a much greater choice of people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <P>Senator O'Kennedy referred to early releases and prison spaces.  In 1985-86 a plan was drawn up for the building of prison spaces, but nothing was done for ten years.  We then had talk about a prison in Castlerea.  The Minister is making a major effort to provide prison spaces which cost a great deal of money.  She has made decisions about the Curragh, Castlerea and improving the prison system generally.  Those convicted of drug trafficking offences should be sent to Spike Island.  If that prison were turned into an Alcatraz it might prevent such criminals from continuing a life of crime.</P>

      <P>We are fortunate that the Judiciary, the Legislature and the Executive are independent.  Judges speaking from the Bench should confine their comments to the laws before them.

      <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised the question of people's political backgrounds.  I think he will agree that should not be a bar to appointment.  I have great admiration for people who have a sense of public service and become involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator might be surprised.  There is certainly one gentleman who may have worn more than one colour, but I will not go into that.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to ways in which the system may be improved.  Legal vacations are far too long and there is no excuse for that.  Part of the reason for clogging the system is that courts are closed for an unconscionably long time each year &mdash; that is a greater factor than the small number of judges &mdash; and that is due to the persistence of a Victorian legal calendar.  That may be the most difficult area to reform.</P>
      <P>There is a question of discipline among the Judiciary.  Before Senator Mulcahy accuses me of besmirching the Judiciary let me explain what I mean. Some judges sit extraordinarily short hours, as any barrister or solicitor who works in the courts on a daily basis will confirm.  Some &mdash; the number is small &mdash; deem it virtually an infringement of their constitutional rights to be asked to sit in the afternoon.  I think Senator Mulcahy will not disagree with me in that regard.  To give one example, a solicitor recently told me of a very difficult settlement in a family law case where the parties had come together for consultation and on three occasions within ten minutes on a Friday afternoon the judge's tipstaff came into the room to ask if they could hurry up.  That was a sensitive case in which money was involved and the parties were interrupted on three occasions, perhaps because the judge wanted to leave for lunch, to play golf or whatever.  To the outsider that may appear scandalous.  There is need for greater discipline within the Judiciary as to the way business is conducted. Far too often it appears that business is organised around the personal convenience of the judge rather than the needs of those using the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking in general. Wild horses would not reveal the name of the person about whom I am speaking.</P>
      <P>There is an increasing problem in terms of judges' knowledge of the law. The law changes constantly, with changes in European law and so on &mdash; this is the 40th Bill steered through the Seanad this year &mdash; and frequently judges may not have full knowledge of the most recent aspects of the law.  I welcome some of the recent appointments of people such as Judge Tom Smith, Judge Catherine McGuinness and many other judges who have very deep knowledge in specialist areas, which is of great value in certain areas of the court, but is there provision to ensure judges are obliged to keep abreast of the law in their area?  I would be interested in the answer.</P>
      <P>A further problem relates to a matter referred to by Senator Enright, the separation of powers.  The review of the performance of judges is very cumbersome. In virtually every other aspect of life people's performance is reviewed, whether by the electorate, by customers in the case of commerce or through a fixed term contract, but there is no way of reviewing the performance of judges who sulk, as happens occasionally, are lazy or not performing well.  Unless there is major malpractice there is no means of reviewing their performance.  I accept that the separation of powers of the Judiciary is of paramount importance, but perhaps in holding a referendum on bail we could consider establishing an independent constitutional authority which would, from time to time, review the behaviour and performance of judges.  Their role is so important and has such far-reaching consequences that they should not be almost free agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to another matter raised by Senator Enright &mdash; I will be careful as I always am &mdash; the intrusion of judges in to public debate.  As a general principle, I welcome the involvement of judges in public debate, in seminars, the Law Reform Commission, as <Col N="1315" /> judges in residence at universities and in various ways where they help to form and shape public debate and interact and hear views from the public.  I am thinking about people such as Judge Ronan Keane, Judge Hugh O'Flaherty and Judge Catherine McGuinness, all of whom have played an important part in shaping public opinion on areas which may be included in legislation.  One of the very good developments in the Judiciary in the last 20 or 30 years is the greater openness of judges to listen and give their views in areas where law may be about to be shaped or changed.</P>
    <P>However, I deprecate, as Senator Enright did, the type of blunderbuss intrusion of certain district justices into public print.  It was a well known feature of life in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s that liverish district justices would hold forth on virtually any topic, with headlines such as &ldquo;District Justice attacks the GAA&rdquo;, &ldquo;District Justice blames the cinema for low moral standards&rdquo; and &ldquo;Drink &mdash; the curse of Rathvilly, says District Justice&rdquo;.  Those headings, which appeared in local papers at the time, made great copy but they did not do much for the Judiciary.  I thought that practice had ended, but I deprecate recent blunderbuss attacks on politicians to the effect that somebody somewhere must do something.  Judges must be conscious that if they have a point to make&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be very careful here.  It has been a long-standing tradition that the Judiciary is independent of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I am not attacking individual judges; I am simply exchanging views on them.  There are ways in which judges can channel complaints in terms of their desire for change.  Just as we should be careful in commenting on what happens in the courts and second-guessing judicial decisions, so too should judges be careful of the position they hold and the impact their words can have, particularly <Col N="1316" /> at the hands of an unscrupulous sub-editor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that is indicative of the intense interest in the subject. I will try to respond to most of the points made, certainly since I came in. I thank those who contributed for their unequivocal welcome for the Bill.  It is a short Bill containing a single provision which will be most effective in alleviating delays in hearing cases in the Circuit Court.  With the nomination by the Government yesterday of nine judges for appointment to the Circuit Court, this Bill will help ensure that in time the public will no longer have to put up with such long delays in having criminal cases, family law cases and civil actions dealt with by the court.  The Bill, with recent judicial appointments and other ongoing initiatives and reforms relating to the courts, provides the basis for a more responsive and effective courts service, which is a matter of vital importance to the public.</P>
      <P>There is unanimity among the various parties in Government about the measures being brought forward.  There was a reference to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in regard to Castlerea.  There was never an argument in Government about the need for additional places; the argument was about the optimum site for them.  Given that the majority of offenders are in this city and its environs, a question could be raised about the logic of building a prison so far away.  I wish to nail the notion that there was a huge disagreement in Government about the need to provide prison places; there was not.</P>

      <P>Senators know how long it takes to prepare some of the larger criminal legislation.  Anything to do with the criminal law requires a huge amount of consultation with other bodies. The whole process is slow and we all regret that but it is a fact and important safeguards are built into that process.  I will answer the Senators who are present rather than trying to deal with every matter raised.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry raised the retirement age of District Court judges.  The present retirement age for judges of the Supreme Court, High Court and Circuit Court is 70 years.  This was reduced from 72 years for appointments made after December 1995 as a result of provisions in the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.  The present retirement age for judges of the District Court is 65 years.  However, there is a provision whereby judges of the District Court can apply annually for an extension of their service up to the age of 70 years. Their application is considered by a committee comprising the Chief Justice, the Attorney General and the President of the High Court and my understanding is that applications are generally granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry will appreciate that the thrust of the 1995 Act was to reduce the retirement ages for judges.  This Bill <Col N="1318" /> is solely aimed at increasing the number of Circuit Court judges but I understand that the Minister will also be in correspondence with her about this issue and will develop her explanation in more detail than I can do here.</P>

      <P>Senator Finneran spoke at length about prisons.  The Taoiseach has asked me to take personal responsibility in this area.  My main responsibility is to ensure that the prisons are constructed quickly in a cost effective way and, if necessary, to use innovative methods.  I have been involved in that process for less than one week but we are determined to increase by 50 per cent &mdash; from roughly 2,000 to 3,000 places &mdash; in prison space over as short a time as possible.  Some of it can be done very quickly.  The Curragh is practically ready and the new wing of Limerick Prison will be ready soon.  I am going to Castlerea on Friday and the first phase &mdash; 25 spaces &mdash; is almost ready there.  We are building about another 120 spaces there.</P>

      <P>The number of spaces created by all previous Governments over the past decade is a disgrace.  The Government is trying to run as fast as it can with this ball and I am not fooling about with it.  If we have to ruffle feathers to get this job done we will do so. There is to be a major new prison at Wheatfield as well as a women's prison and all those projects are being actively considered at the moment.  I will be providing the Minister for Justice or the Taoiseach, or both, with a summary of proposals and the likely programme for the debate in the Dáil on 25 July.  I will, unfortunately, miss that debate as I will be in Brussels.</P>
      <P>Senators might be interested to know that people have been in contact with my office about the reference to immediate prison places.  I do not know whether some of the ideas put forward are worth following up, but people have been suggesting how one might acquire immediate places.  That will be difficult because converting even a relatively suitable building into a prison cannot be done immediately but we will look at that as well.  Senator Enright mentioned Spike Island.  I have not looked at Spike Island because other prisons have been listed for my consideration, including those in the Curragh, Portlaoise, Castlerea and Wheatfield, as well as the women's prison.  As I said, I have not looked beyond those yet but I will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Finneran spoke about a register of abusers and sex offenders.  To a very limited extent, because of data protection legislation, that information is available from the Garda authorities.  It is available in qualified circumstances to potential employers, particularly those <Col N="1320" /> in children's residential centres.  A certain amount of information is available in that area but it is restricted by law.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Honan for her comments on the prison proposals.  She mentioned the independent courts service and the Denham commission.  My understanding is that the Government has approved these proposals in principle and has asked the Denham commission to come back with recommendations on the most effective means of implementing the new courts service procedures.  That will happen quite quickly.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan also referred to the desirability of having more women judges.  This Government has been more assiduous than any of its predecessors in trying to reach the 40 per cent figure in relation to public appointments generally. In my time in Cabinet it was a regular subject for discussion.  When people were coming forward with names somebody always mentioned that 40 per cent of public appointments had to be women.  There is a willingness in this Government not just to pay lip service to this provision but to do it, but it takes time.  It must be borne in mind that the 40 per cent figure has not yet been achieved in a whole range of areas.  It will not happen overnight but there is a determination to do it.</P>
    <P>The Senator also made a point about dedicated drug squads.  I cannot give her an answer to that because I do not know it yet.  However, Mr. Barry Galvin is a member of the efficiency review commission which has just been established to look at the efficiency of the Garda. Mr. Galvin is a solicitor from Cork who has been in the vanguard of the attack on drug barons in the southern part of the country, with some success.  He has very strong views on that issue and I am sure he will bring those to bear on that group.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock referred a number of times to the financing of courthouses and the fact that they have a relatively low priority in local authority financing. While local authorities are responsible for courthouses in some cases, the capital <Col N="1321" /> is provided entirely by central Government.  The priorities of local authorities in that area are not a deterrent to construction or renovation of courthouses.  The Senator also mentioned support for the forensic science laboratory and offered the view that it should be located in Cork.  I will not comment on that.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy made some extremely constructive comments.  He asked why the Bill was introduced so quickly after the previous Bill was enacted.  The Minister dealt with this at length in her speech.  She admitted that in the relatively short period since the enactment of the Courts and Court Officers Act she had cause to look again at the arrears of criminal cases and in appeals before the Circuit Court.  She explained that at length.  The Senator's question is reasonable and, with the benefit of hindsight, he can legitimately say that somebody with sufficient foresight should have anticipated that.  The Minister did not seek to blame any of her advisers and neither will I. However, the Senator's question is fair. Why, six months later, do we have to increase the number of judges again? The Senator might well ask if the same thing will happen again in a year's time. I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to early temporary releases, the implications of appointing more judges are that there will be more convictions.  The Senator will accept that the Government's approach is an integrated approach of providing prison spaces, extra judges and more court space for the judges. The fact that this will not happen overnight means that the present unsatisfactory situation will not be alleviated overnight.  However, one must start somewhere and this Government is seriously addressing these issues on an integrated basis.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Kennedy referred to the transfer to an open prison of a convicted drugs dealer.  The way that matter was reported sent out an unfortunate message. I am told the prisoner is not seen as a high security risk in the sense that he is not a physical danger to anybody nor is he likely to escape, and the prison in question is not a hotel.  The prisoner is locked up in a cell and so forth.  My initial reaction to the story was the same as the Senator's.  However, looking at it in more detail it makes sense that if there is a shortage of secure places and they are being used by people who are deemed not to be serious security risks or a threat to anybody or likely to break out, there is validity in moving them from one place to another.  That appears to have been the case in this instance.</P>

Like Senator Manning and the late John Kelly, I believe Governments have tended to move away from making decisions for which they should carry full responsibility.  That has happened in the case of An Bord Pleanála, in this instance and in many others.  I have always taken the view that politicians are ultimately accountable to the public and if we do the wrong thing we should pay the price.

      <P>Last year this House passed a Bill last year which provided for increasing the number of Circuit Judges from 17 to 24.  This new Bill increases that number by three.  Yesterday the Cabinet nominated nine people for appointment as judges.  Can the Minister explain why three more are necessary at this time?  Why not provide for four or five?  Why not wait to see how the increase from 17 judges to 24 works as those extra seven have not arrived on the Bench yet?  This section increases the number of judges from 24 to 27.  A cynic could think of a reason for that.  It is extraordinary that we are appointing three more judges before we have seen how the extra seven are working. Are the extra three appointments a cosmetic exercise?  Could I be so devious as to suggest that it is an appeasement for the three parties in Government? That is what is being said outside the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, did not refer to the point I made to the Minister on the appointment of temporary judges. Section 1 could have stated &ldquo;The number of ordinary judges of the Circuit Court shall not be more than 27 and the Minister shall be empowered to appoint temporary judges&rdquo;.  While the existing backlog might not last forever, there might be a good reason to appoint temporary judges for as long as the backlog exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested by what Senator Mulcahy said but the appointment of temporary judges strikes me as a stopgap measure.  What sort of people will make the career choice to become temporary judges?  For <Col N="1326" /> how long would they be temporary? Would they have to give up their practice? Could they take up where they left off before they were appointed to the Bench?  That does not strike me as satisfactory from the point of view of the person appointed as a temporary judge. Once they are appointed in a temporary capacity they will want to be made permanent. It does not strike me as being the answer to the problem the Senator mentioned.</P>

      <P>It is the judgment and view of the Government, the Department of Justice and the Minister for Justice that this increase is the optimum figure which they can justify at the moment.  The appointment of temporary judges is under review but decisive action was required here.  It is certainly not a form of palliative.  I would not be here, nor would Members, at 7.20 p.m. to debate it if it was simply a device to get the Government off some hook. It is a serious proposal.  It is the view of the Department and the Minister that this is the appropriate number.  That is the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>If three more judges are needed in a year's time, another Bill will have to be passed.  That seems a very cumbersome way of doing business.  I would be tempted to change the word &ldquo;more&rdquo; to &ldquo;less&rdquo;.  Further legislation will have to be introduced if more judges are needed.  I question the desirability of such ongoing legislation.  A provision should be brought in which would enable extra judges to be appointed by ministerial order rather having to introduce legislation each time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago a regulation was brought in whereby judges have to retire at a certain age.  In many companies, retired workers are brought back on temporary contracts if the company is under pressure.  I would prefer to see <Col N="1327" /> that mechanism used rather than the appointment of temporary judges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reiterate the excellent point made by Senator Daly. The Court and Court Officers Bill, 1995, was brought in in December and we are now taking this Bill.  It is not appropriate to have to introduce legislation every time we require more judges.  It would be more appropriate if section 1 read &ldquo;The number of ordinary judges of the Circuit Court shall be a number as specified by the Minister by regulation brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;, although that would require changes to the Court (Supplemental Provisions) Act.  If the Minister had put a little more work into this Bill she might have seen that that change was well worth making.  As Senator Daly said, it will be very embarrassing for the Government if it has to say in three or four months' time that three extra judges were not enough and we need new legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">

      <P>The Constitution requires us to regulate the number of judges.  We are not permitted, nor would it be right, to state &ldquo;not less than 27&rdquo; on the basis that it could be 100.  The appointment of judges is such a serious matter and so bound up in our Constitution that it is appropriate to require that the number of judges should be stated.  In the judgment of the Government and the Department, the proposed number is 27 and I obviously could not agree to change that number.</P>

My party has consistently indicated that it will support any measure which assists the fight against crime.  Nothing on the record of the House will show that, between February 1995 and the dissolution of this Dáil, Fianna Fáil in any way impeded or argued against positive measures to aid the fight against crime.  Any new laws, concepts, ideas or provisions introduced to deal with crime will find a warm welcome on this side of the House.</P>

The Minister of State has the technical ability, enthusiasm and dedication to put in place a proper prison building programme.  There will be <Col N="1331" /> no smiles or smirks from this side of the House in supporting that.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a number of observations about the comments made by the Leader of the House.  I join with him is stating that no one is above debate or discussion.  Members of the Judiciary frequently comment on how the Legislature should work.  Such comments are usually made in good spirit.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my appreciation to the Cathaoirleach for affording me the opportunity to raise this matter. Senator Townsend was also keen to raise this issue because he has experienced some of the problems arising <Col N="1333" /> from this dispute in his locality.  I propose to share time with Senator Finneran. I thank the Minister for Health for coming to reply to this debate.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that there are ongoing problems regarding environmental health officers.  Their dispute was sent to arbitration and the matter was heard by the Labour Relations Commission.  I understand that agreement was almost reached some time ago.  To the best of my knowledge, last Friday's talks did not result in a settlement of the dispute.  The environmental health officers believe that their pay and conditions are out of line with the position that existed heretofore.  They also claim that the new and demanding work resulting from the introduction of new legislation has forced them to demand improved conditions and a wage increase.</P>
      <P>I do not want to enter into a discussion regarding the details of the ongoing negotiations.  However, I urge the Minister to use his good offices to encourage the parties involved to find a way to resolve this matter.  I am aware that a facilitator from the Labour Relations Commission has already had discussions with both sides.  The Minister intervened to endeavour to bring the parties together.  However, the dispute has not been resolved and the work to rule which has been in operation since 1 January has held up the registration of many new premises and developments.  It is detrimental to the owners of new premises who are waiting to receive registration certification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A home for elderly people in Kilrush could not be occupied for several weeks because of the dispute, but thankfully that situation has been resolved.  A number of hoteliers and guest house owners who depend on the tourism season await certification by the environmental health officers.  Because certification is not available, they cannot open their businesses.  The Minister will be aware that the tourism season is in full <Col N="1334" /> swing.  People who have expended substantial sums in tourism developments will be seriously disadvantaged as they cannot open because of the lack of certification.</P>
    <P>Is there a mechanism which the Minister can use to bring the parties together?  Will he again intervene as I understand there has been some progress in the discussions?  Is there any way in which he could use his good offices to bring about a resumption of talks to resolve the dispute which would enable the premises about which I am concerned and which depend on the tourism season to be opened as soon as possible?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Daly for sharing his time.  On the Order of Business I spoke about ambulance personnel who are in the same situation.  I am sure the Leader of the House will relay my concerns to the Minister.  Earlier this year nurses raised their concerns. This is a serious issue because it is having an adverse effect on those who invested a lot of money in tourism opportunities.</P>
      <P>Environmental health officers have a genuine case because the Houses of the Oireachtas have enacted legislation which has added to their workload.  If this work to rule continues, it will have an adverse affect on guest houses, hotels and so on.  An understanding should be reached so that the work to rule can end and meaningful negotiations can take place.  We have a responsibility in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot intervene in every dispute and there are structures in place which have been laid down by the Oireachtas and agreed with the trade unions.  In circumstances where the public and the economy is being affected, we should try to progress the situation. The appointment of an arbitrator acceptable to both sides and the suspension of the work to rule would be welcome. I thank Senator Daly for raising <Col N="1335" /> this matter on the Adjournment.  I hope moves will be made to suspend the work to rule, which would allow premises to be certified and which would bring an end to the dispute between the Department and the environmental health officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank Senator Daly and Senator Finneran for raising this matter.  The environmental health officers work to rule involves non cooperation with and non implementation of legislation pertaining to a broad range of environmental health issues, including the granting of hygiene licences for commercial premises.  A pay claim submitted by IMPACT on behalf of the environmental health officers for a salary revision was processed through the standard industrial relations procedures and was the subject of two hearings by a board under the scheme for a national joint council and arbitration board for local government and health services.  The arbitration board rejected the basis on which the claim was made. Management and staff interests had opted to refer the matter to arbitration. By convention, the decisions of the arbitration board are accepted by both sides.  However, IMPACT on behalf of the environmental health officers rejected the arbitration report and commenced industrial action in spring 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial action was eventually suspended following agreement to process the claim under Clause 2 (iii), Annex 1, of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  In these negotiations, management tabled an offer which was rejected by the staff as it failed to be meet their aspiration as set out their original pay claim which far exceeded the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> IMPACT, on behalf of the environmental health officers, withdrew from negotiations and opted to recommence the <Col N="1336" /> work to rule with effect from 15 January 1996.</P>
    <P>A meeting was held on Tuesday, 25 June 1996 between management and union under the auspices of the local government staff negotiations board. On Wednesday, 26 June 1996 I met IMPACT and a delegation of environmental health officers to explore whether the provisions of the joint Government ICTU statement of 15 May 1996 could usefully be applied to resolving the current impasse in the negotiations. I am pleased to advise the House that the meeting was of considerable assistance to both sides who are currently considering the many issues raised.  As Minister for Health, I hope direct negotiations will be resumed in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the matter of disadvantage status for St. Mary's primary school, Drumlea, County Leitrim. The board of management of the school contacted me to highlight the fact that due to the drop in the number of pupils attending the school, they will lose one teacher.  The school will go from a three teacher to a two teacher one.  At present there are 48 students and I understand 11 students will start in September, which will leave the school four pupils short to qualify for three teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Department of Education that if the school was granted disadvantaged status, it would be in a position to hold on to its third teacher.  Drumlea is a rural area and over the past number of years parents, teachers and the community have dug deep to improve the facilities at St. Mary's Primary School.  When Gemma Hussey was Minister for Education a new school was build.  The board of management has worked extremely hard to maintain standards.  The <Col N="1337" /> teachers are anxious to retain their colleague, so too are the parents.</P>
    <P>While this scheme was set up to help children in disadvantaged urban areas, there is disadvantage in rural areas.  The area to which I refer has suffered from population and rural decline for many years.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to grant disadvantage status to St. Mary's primary school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am responding to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach.  I thank Senator Reynolds for raising the issue of St. Mary's primary school at Drumlea, County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the school in question applied for disadvantaged area status. The disadvantaged area scheme was last expanded in 1994 when the additional 54 primary schools were newly included in it.  While the case put forward by the school in question was considered at that time, it was not successful.</P>
      <P>In 1995 the Minister for Education commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency to conduct a detailed review of our current approaches to addressing the problem of educational disadvantage. The Minister's decision to commission that study arose from a concern to ensure that our supports were properly targeted and that children with real need were in a position to benefit from the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criteria used in selecting schools for special support and the nature of the supports provided were among the issues addressed in the study.  The report presented by the Combat Poverty Agency was one of the most comprehensive studies of educational disadvantage ever undertaken in the State.  It examined the concept of educational disadvantage as it impacted on pupils in the education system and reviewed the procedures in place to identify and address educational disadvantage.  The <Col N="1338" /> report also evaluated the effectiveness of current approaches using a wide range of national and international research data.</P>
    <P>While the report recognised the very considerable advances which have been made in alleviating the effects of educational disadvantage, it also made a series of comments and recommendations aimed at improving the current arrangements.  Among the key issues raised in the report was a concern that under the current criteria the scheme did not have due regard to rural and dispersed disadvantage.  It was recommended that the criteria be amended to better reflect educational disadvantage as manifested in rural as well as urban settings.  It also recommended that a more targeted approach be adopted with resources being directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas.  The report also considered that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school going population.  In that connection it was noted that the present scheme also extends to more than 17 per cent of the population.</P>
    <P>In response to the Combat Poverty Agency report the Minister for Education recently launched a new initiative which aims to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  Schools are being selected for support under that initiative by reference to new selection criteria which have been developed by the Education Research Centre.  The new criteria take on board the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency and address educational disadvantage in urban and rural settings.</P>
    <P>The initiative has urban and rural dimensions.  For rural schools the initiative will also focus on schools throughout the country with fewer than five teachers, particularly schools in rural areas which serve dispersed populations and have concentrations of disadvantaged children In this case supports will <Col N="1339" /> be made available to 25 clusters of schools.  Each cluster will be served by a newly appointed co-ordinator who will work with the families and teachers involved.  Children attending schools in the selected clusters will attract a special capitation grant of £75 per pupil.  The schools will also attract special grant assistance for the purchase of books and other materials.  The Education Research Centre has been in touch recently with all the target schools and <Col N="1340" /> invited applications for consideration in support of the new initiative.  The centre is currently prioritising all applicants, including an application from the school in question, in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted by the schools and will advise the Department of Education of the outcome shortly.</P>
