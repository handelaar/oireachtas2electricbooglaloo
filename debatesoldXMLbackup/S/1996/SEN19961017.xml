      <P>Members will wish to join with me in welcoming a parliamentary delegation from the Republic of Hungary.  The delegation is led by Mr. Zoltán Gán, the Speaker of the National Assembly.  I hope your visit to Ireland will be enjoyable and very successful. On my behalf and on behalf of all Members of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to you.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to outline the present position in relation to Kilrush Community School, where staff and pupils have been operating from three separate sites since September 1992; and the steps she proposes to take to stop the situation from further deteriorating when the convent secondary school is vacated for possession by the purchaser on 1 June 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1822" /> I have also received notice from Senator O'Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to review his decision to accept the Russian exclusion of Counties Tipperary, Cork and Monaghan from the export of cattle to Russia.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Hayes of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to include in the intergovernmental conference discussions a complete and meaningful section concerning the rights of young people in the European Union, and that such a commitment be included in the next Treaty of the European Union, which is presently under discussion.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter.</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Health to provide the necessary funds to alleviate the serious overcrowding at the County Hospital, Roscommon.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Education if she is aware of the unsatisfactory state of accommodation and facilities for second level pupils at Kilrush Community School.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senators Taylor-Quinn's and O'Kennedy's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Hayes, Finneran and Daly may give notice on another day of the matters which they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Cathaoirleach in welcoming the delegation from the Hungarian Parliament. We have all watched with great interest as that parliament has taken shape over <Col N="1823" /> recent years and we hope their visit here will be a successful and enjoyable one.</P>
      <P>Today's Business is items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Items 1, 2 and 3 will be taken without debate.  Item 4 is the National Cultural Institutions Bill, 1996, which will be taken from the end of the Order of Business until 2 p.m.  There is a limit of 30 minutes per speaker and Second Stage will not conclude today although I expect the debate to continue until 2 p.m.  There will be a sos from 2 p.m to 3 p.m. and item 5 will commence at 3 p.m. and last until 6 p.m.  I suggest a time limit of 20 minutes per speaker and Members may share time.  I also give notice to Members that it is intended to sit at 10.30 a.m. next Wednesday, 23 October, rather than the usual time of 2.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I also extend a welcome to the Hungarian delegation and I wish them a very successful Irish visit.  The Order of Business is agreed.  I presume the time is subject to the happenings in the Dáil.  Does the Leader still expect it will be 3 p.m.?</P>

      <P>Following yesterday's request to him, is the Leader in a position to tell Members they will have an opportunity next week to speak on the beef industry?  The Minister's responses to inquiries yesterday are all the more reason for us to have a debate next week on the beef industry and beef contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree the Order of Business and in particular the fact that the National Cultural Institutions Bill, 1996, will not conclude Second Stage today.  That is crucial as there will be many speakers from these benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are more queries on the beef industry than there have ever been before.  In the most neutral terms, there are many of us who want to know the facts and to have the matter discussed. Many of us want to hear the justifications <Col N="1824" /> from both sides and the arguments being put forward.  We need to be informed and I support a debate on it.</P>
    <P>We on the Independent benches see the hepatitis C issue as one of major human concern and it does not help if it becomes a party political football.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Leader to give a specific undertaking that we will debate the BSE crisis in full next week.  I will not go through the reasons, which I outlined yesterday, for having such a debate.  The Leader is well aware why we should have one.  We must concentrate on what political, rather than official, actions are being taken to restore valuable markets.  This is the appropriate place for the Minister to answer questions on that issue.</P>
      <P>The Leader has indicated that the debate on the tribunal of inquiry into hepatitis C will last from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Yesterday, quite a few Senators were still offering at the end of the debate on Northern Ireland.  I note the Leader has allocated 20 minutes per speaker on this matter but I wonder if it is enough.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader tell us whether the Minister will be prepared to take questions on this matter?  We have done so on previous occasions so we are not asking for a precedent to be established. Will there be a period of 15 or 20 minutes at the end of the debate for a question and answer session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Cathaoirleach has kindly agreed to my request for a motion on the Adjournment concerning the beef industry, I join with all my colleagues in seeking Government time to be made available as soon as possible for a comprehensive debate on this matter.  It is essential in view not just of its importance to the beef industry and farmers in Tipperary, Cork and Monaghan, but for the economy.  The precedent set by this decision is a dangerous, if not disastrous, one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister for the Environment to set up a comprehensive inquiry into the sources of contamination of Nenagh's water supply?  It is <Col N="1825" /> becoming a matter of serious concern for people in the town and surrounding region.  The Minister's Department is equipped to carry out a hydro-geological survey.  Recently, there has been further pollution from a contaminated well that had been expected to provide adequate water supplies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Senator can find some other way of raising this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know if the Minister will do so because it is not just an issue for the town of Nenagh.  It sets a standard for every community throughout the country.  Will the Leader convey that request to the Minister in view of the latest information?  I want to find out if there is any likelihood that pollution may have seeped into the aquifer which would mean that we have a very serious problem in Nenagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Justice and other relevant Ministers what efforts the Government is making to ensure that sittings of the tribunal on war crimes in the former Yugoslavia go ahead in The Hague?  Initially, we made strong representations on that matter but now that we hold the EU Presidency we should do more.  Judge Goldstone has left, some say in despair over the lack of progress, and has been replaced by Judge Louise Arbour from Canada.  Very few arrests have been made in Bosnia.  Rape has been recognised as a war crime and I gather that women there have stopped giving evidence.  They say that no arrests have been made and those who raped them are freely walking around the areas where the crimes were committed.</P>
      <P>The White Paper produced on the subject stated that we would treat the war crimes tribunal as a priority yet we do not seem to be following this up with any action.  I would be grateful if the Leader can find out what the Government proposes to do to bring this matter forward.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the national lottery, particularly on how prize money is distributed? The last number of draws resulted in a roll over of prize money to £1.5 million or £2 million before it was won. If no one wins the top prize by getting six numbers, the prize money should be distributed every week between those with five numbers.  In that way, people would receive a fair share each week rather than having the jackpot rolling over.  The debate should also cover how national lottery money is distributed among organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a member of an Oireachtas delegation to Hungary led by the Cathaoirleach's predecessor.  I want to express good wishes to our Hungarian visitors.  If their visit here is as rewarding, illuminating and instructive as our visit to Hungary &mdash; we returned with a heightened appreciation of Hungary's role in modern Europe &mdash; they will have a successful visit.  It will contribute towards fostering even closer and friendlier relations between our two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to indicate what action he is taking on the sacking of over 200 people at the Verbatim plant in Limerick?  Many of those employees come from my constituency in County Clare.  There is a marked absence of any Government interest in the closure of that plant.  I was concerned when I heard an IDA executive on radio saying that as the electronics industry is a new one it is difficult to keep abreast of changes.  There is nothing new about the electronics industry, it has been in existence for the past 50 years.  It is time that the national agency dealing with industry was aware of the problems that exist.  Can we have some indication that the Minister and the Government are serious about this? We have heard nothing from Deputy Kemmy of the Labour Party, nor from the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, about the fact that 250 people <Col N="1827" /> are losing their jobs in the city of Limerick.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline to this House what efforts he is making to protect the jobs of workers at Verbatim and to open up prospects for them in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Leader had any response to a question he raised about the apparent undue delay in granting naturalisation to people who have spent five years in this country and who have completed all the necessary documentation? They are advised they have to wait for the Minister to act.  Nearly 12 months have passed in some instances, which amounts to undue delay.  Is any progress being made in that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in welcoming the distinguished delegation from Hungary. I had a brief opportunity to listen to the discussions at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday before having to return to the Seanad for another debate.  I had the privilege of visiting their beautiful country on a number of occasions.  The first time was in 1989 with the Interparliamentary Union.  I was glad of the response then when I raised the question of Raoul Wallenberg and I hope the Hungarian Government will continue to pursue that matter.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader provide time for a debate on Luas?  I received a decision, in principle, from him which was favourable. Many of us are concerned about it.  There have been developments today with the further intervention of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies.  The Minister appears to be undermining the public inquiry by anticipating its result in advance and that the plans for an overground light rail will be continued with. That was not the feeling that this House was given by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1828" /> Does the Leader share my concern about the destruction of a listed building in Parnell Square in apparent conflict with all our feelings about heritage?  The roof was removed from the building after some damage to the rear.  It looks like the old case of a north side planning permission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the ongoing debacle regarding the Minister for Health, will the Leader of the House indicate if the Minister will resign?  This is the greatest scandal of recent times concerning a Minister for Health.  While we appreciate his apology it goes no way near what is needed.  The general opinion is that he was not as forthcoming in the last 12 months as he was 12 or 13 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter will be discussed this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House might discuss it with the Labour Party because it probably calls the shots.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>He was very forthcoming with information 12 or 13 years ago but he has since become one of the boys.  As regards the public's perception of the Minister at this stage, perhaps he will do the honourable thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator like to see Deputy Noonan get the sack as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I will respond to Senator Daly rather than Senator Finneran. I share the concern of Senator Daly on the loss of jobs in the Verbatim <Col N="1829" /> factory in Limerick but I assure him that every effort is being made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing is being done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Daly knows well, there are a large number of people in the Limerick area employed in the computer industry.  We hope that there will be some development in the Dell factory in particular but he also knows that there is a fine infrastructure in the Limerick area, particularly the Plassey Technological Park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Senator that we are not discussing that issue now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Explain that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing the issue but it is unfair to suggest that efforts are not being made.  One of the concerns I have is the way in which the workers were informed of the decision. That could have been handled much better and there could have been much more consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>What is going on there is disgraceful and the Senator knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfair to suggest that efforts are not being made to secure jobs in the Limerick area.  There is a need to get more jobs and I hope we will have better news in other announcements that will be made in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>When will we have a discussion on the White Paper on mental health?  The Green Paper was published in 1992, four years ago.  There are serious concerns within the psychiatric service.  It is the Cinderella of the health service.  There is undue delay.  The Nurse's Bill is being spoken about at <Col N="1830" /> present.  There are concerns within the service as to why the White Paper is not coming forward.  I ask that every effort be made to bring it into this House as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House find time in the near future for a discussion on currency, having regard to the way this most important element of European Monetary Union is proceeding following a successful meeting in Dublin a month ago?  This is happening without discussion in this House or in the other House.  It is important that we find time for this before decisions are made.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Norris' call for an urgent discussion on Luas for the same reasons that he has so articulately put forward.  There is a danger that decisions are being taken without this House discussing them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Leader to convey to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry the gratitude felt by many in the agriculture industry in the North for his expression of concern for the difference that a distinction be made between Northern Irish and English cattle.  The Minister was kind enough to say that he would do all in his power to emphasise the health difference between Northern Irish and British cattle.  It is much appreciated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Belton. He is always a hard act to follow.  I have to figure out that comment.</P>
      <P>A number of colleagues, especially the Leader of the Opposition, raised the question of a debate on beef.  I will make every effort today to ensure that debate takes place, hopefully, next week.  It may mean sitting on Tuesday of next week.  Senator O'Toole also raised that point and I share his sentiments on the upcoming debate.  It would be useful if we could keep it at that level.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis asked about the possibility of questions at the end of today's session.  It is normal practice that the Minister replies to questions raised during the debate, but if there is a strong view that perhaps ten, 15 or 20 minutes be set aside for such questions and answers, I will talk to the Minister about it.  I do not see any particular difficulty with that, but the Whips can discuss it after the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised the question of the Nenagh water supply.  It is a matter appropriate to the Adjournment where he can get all the information available on it.  I will try to get information for Senator Henry on the Government's attitude to the war hearings tribunal in The Hague.  Senator Farrell mentioned the Lotto.  The issue of numbers on a lottery ticket is not appropriate to this House so we could not have a useful debate on that.  His point about the distribution of lottery money could be raised later.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly and Senator O'Sullivan raised the question of the job losses at Verbatim and I share Senator O'Sullivan's certainty that everything is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I also share her view that the matter was badly handled by the company.  It is appalling that many <Col N="1832" /> of the employees learned from the media that their jobs were gone.  Such behaviour by any company is simply not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I will attempt to find an answer for Senator Sherlock.  I was not expecting that question today.  Senator Norris raised the issue of Luas and a debate would be useful.  I hope we can have one in the near future.  I also share his perplexity about what is happening in Parnell Square.  I thought that sort of thing was in the past.  I do not know any more than that.</P>
      <P>On Senator Finneran's question, there is every confidence in the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan.  He has handled a difficult task well and he will be here today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not know as yet when there will be a debate on mental health but I will talk to Senator Maloney about it. Senator Quinn is right.  We should have a debate on currency.  It is a major issue and I will talk to him afterwards and try to get a time in the next couple of weeks for it, subject to the availability of the Minister for Finance.  It would be useful. Senator McAughtry has drawn attention to an extraordinary and important initiative by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  He sat down with the three Northern Ireland MEPs this week to try to help them with their problem.  I was disappointed that a Senator as young as Senator Kelleher should show a partitionist mentality in this regard.  It was not appropriate.  In terms of the wider context of North-South co-operation and what is happening on this island, what Minister Yates did is most important because he showed, by deed, that this is one island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins) Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the Seanad today represents one of the most significant legislative initiatives, in cultural heritage terms, that the Irish State has undertaken since its foundation.  It takes a major step in fulfilling an objective I set myself when I became the first Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht &mdash; to establish a modern legislative structure within which our major cultural institutions could be enabled to thrive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First there was the enactment of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, which established the right of ownership of the people of Ireland to all archaeological objects of importance found with no known owner.  Another major component was the enactment of the Heritage Act, 1995, which established the Heritage <Col N="1837" /> Council on a statutory basis and whose remit includes heritage objects.  The latest building block is what is before the Seanad today &mdash; the National Cultural Institutions Bill.  I refer to the other Bills because this Bill is part of a set of Bills which will become known as the heritage legislation.</P>
    <P>The National Cultural Institutions Bill, 1996, proposes the establishment of autonomous boards to manage and care for the collections in the National Museum and the National Library; it proposes measures to underpin the development of the National Gallery; it proposes an indemnity scheme to permit exhibitions of international calibre to be seen here in Ireland on a regular basis; it proposes to provide increased protection for all objects of cultural importance wherever they are situated within the State and other ways and means through application of legislative actions are proposed through which the National Museum and the National Library may be enabled to develop their collections, not least through providing extension of deposit copyright arrangements. Through such changes we hope to create structures through which, on a systematic basis, the living memory and achievements of all facets of Irish society may be collected, to facilitate the study of anyone who wishes to understand what has moulded the Ireland of today.</P>
    <P>I ndáiríre, ní ceart go mbeadh aon chúis míniú cén fath a bhfuil gá ann do Mhúsaem Náisiúnta nó Leabharlann Náisiúnta, ach de bharr an bharúil nach bhfuil an áit lárnach chuí ag na hinstitiúdí seo ní foláir an cheist a chur &mdash; agus í a fheagairt.  Níl aon easpa dea-thola poiblí ann, dár ndóigh.  Tá go leor bronntanais thabhachtacha faighte ag an Leabharlann agus ag an Músaem leis na blianta, agus d'oibrigh go leor daoine go cróga i láthair na gconstaic uafásacha le haghaidh na hinstitiúidí a choinneáil agus a fhorbairt mar atá siad inniu.  Ach thar thréimhse fhada níl go leor aird tugtha ag an Stát do na riachtanais reachtúla, struchtúrtha agus acmhainne atá ag teastáil chun na struchtúir bhunúsacha <Col N="1838" /> le haghaidh stair na ndaoine a dhoiciméadú agus a choinneáil.  An leor é mar chosaint a rá go raibh an Stát i gconaí gafa le rudaí níos práinní ar a chlár oibre?  Nó nár fhág an géarghá le hinstitiúidí polaitiúla a chruthú, nó bia, tithíocht agus fostaíocht a sholáthar don phobal mórán ama chun an cheist a fhreagairt conas ar chóir leabhar na ndaoine a chlárú?</P>
    <P>Seans gur féidir teacht ar fhreagraí i measc cúiseanna éagsúla, struchtúir riaracháin uireasacha gan fócas agus easpa treoir ina measc; b'fhéidir freisin go luíonn cuid de na deacrachtaí le rian eile ó am atá thart, sin le rá an claonadh míthuisceanach féachaint ar mhúsaem mar ionad stórais, teach stór i gcomhair lámhdhéantúsáin, áit speisialta ach do dhaoine áirithe, agus áit gan cumas dáiríre na lámhdhéantúsáin a úsáid le haghaidh cuspóirí oiliúna.</P>
    <P>Certainly there was nothing less than insufficient appreciation of the importance records of the past have to play in the task of understanding the present and creating a secure future of tolerance. For how can one measure accomplishment, or the quality, health and well-being of a people, if there is insufficient or inaccessible record of the past with which to make comparison? How can progression of a people be justly measured if the past has not been recorded for retrieval?  Not a past as exemplified by the manipulations of a contrived triumphalism or something deliberately sentimentalised, but a past overflowing with complexity, richness and humanity; not just political landmark occasions, but the self-deluding propaganda, the smoke-screens and evasions, the things which were once regarded as important, and which turned out not to be; the things which seemed trivial at the time but yet hardened into firm evidence: where evidence could be a simple employment reference for a servant girl seeking work in a big house, the preparatory sketches of a great painter, the initial designs for an important public building or a love letter written in haste by a great man <Col N="1839" /> caught up in the throes of a revolutionary struggle.</P>
    <P>What such things show is that what is important is not just the transactions of living but the ways in which we choose to live.  Knowledge of our forebears' ways is of no less value than the evidence accumulated illuminating great events, mass movements or the artistic achievements of our painters, writers and artisans &mdash; all, as James Joyce has articulated, resonant of the &ldquo;collective unconscious of our race&rdquo;.  Without the capacity to recall the data, there is no sense of collective identity or community; there is no nation.  Ultimately there is no coherent society, only an endless suburb inhabited by people existing in a place called anywhere.</P>
    <P>The national cultural institutions of the National Museum and National Library are built on the achievements of the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society.  It was in 1877, through the Dublin Science and Art Museum Act, that the institutions came into being, but the Act did not in itself create institutions; the substance of the Act deals rather with conveyances of land and transfers of collections.  To &ldquo;find&rdquo; the institutions one must look further behind the working of that Act to a formal agreement entered into in 1881 by the then Department of Science and Art with the Royal Dublin Society.  This agreement established a board of visitors for the National Museum and the Botanic Gardens and a council of trustees for the National Library.  Another agreement made in 1890 with the Royal Irish Academy transferring, subject to safeguards, its collections to the care of the State, completed the original structures for the museum and library.</P>
    <P>The institutions of the museum and library, although commonly perceived as independent entities, are in fact fully integrated into the central State apparatus, the staff being civil servants and both institutions part of my Department. Under the basic legal structure the State holds the executive managerial duties relating to the museum.  The <Col N="1840" /> duties of the board of visitors for the National Museum which includes Government, RDS and RIA appointees, are confined to an advisory role.</P>
    <P>The administration of the National Library, too, has been a function of the State.  The council of trustees, appointed by me and by the RDS, has only a supervisory role.  Another constituent part of the National Library is the Genealogical Office, recognised in 1943, but with antecedents in the specialist field of heraldry going back to the 16th century.</P>
    <P>Ba thoradh ar an aois iad na freagraí nó na réitigh a socraíodh orthu, agus na struchtúir institiúideacha a tháinig astu. Bhí an-chosúlacht eatarthu agus na heagraíochtaí daonchairdiúla a chur bailiúcháin le chéile ar mhaithe an phobail san ochtú agus sa naoú haois déag. D'éirigh chomh maith sin leis na heagraíochtaí seo gur éiríodar ró-bheag agus bhí ar an Stát, níos déanaí sa naoú haois déag, struchtúir a chur le chéile a bhfreagródh riachtanais an ré Victeóiriach agus choilíneach.</P>
    <P>Despite the durability of the structures there has been recognised for a long time a need to delegate formally decision making to the museum and library, particularly on issues relating to care and management of the collections. Every commissioned report on the museum &mdash; in 1927, 1947, 1949, 1985 and 1995 &mdash; has concluded that the departmental structure has been a poor basis for managing and developing the museum.  Successive reports of boards of visitors have pointed out in ever more urgent terms the multiplicity of curatorial problems in all areas of work, including storage, conservation and exhibition.  The reports have pointed to the urgent need for the appointment of an autonomous board.</P>
    <P>Administrative reports in relation to the library have also indicated strongly that its underlying formal basis and structures need to be defined and set out in statute.  It is for these reasons that the establishment of autonomous boards for the museum and library is <Col N="1841" /> proposed.  I believe that autonomy provided by means of statutorily established boards will give these institutions greater discretion and accountability over the handling of budgets; some flexibility over personnel resources; stronger powers to develop policies on acquisitions; the holding of exhibitions and integrating these important institutions into the national culture all within a broad compass of guiding principles set by the Oireachtas, not least on the important subjects of loans and disposal of cultural objects.</P>
    <P>A matter of public comment on which I want to spend some time is in relation to the Genealogical Office.  The role of the office within the National Library is a valuable cultural resource for the country.  For this reason I consider it important that the function in relation to genealogy be set out in this legislation. In so doing the office's interests will be best served by confirming and formalising that its existence lies fully within the framework of the operation of the board of the library.  Within the Genealogical Office there has also been a long standing practice of confirming and granting coats of arms by an official known as the Chief Herald.</P>
    <P>The appellation Chief Herald has its origins in what was the Ulster Office of Arms, more commonly referred to as the office of the Chief Herald, in existence since 1552 when the title of chief herald was passed in the form of a personal patent from person to person by the British monarch.  This practice continued up to 1919 when the Chief Herald was appointed in accordance with long established practice and continued until his death in 1940 with the rest of the office staff being paid by the British authorities.  This function has achieved a cultural importance over the centuries and so it is proposed that its title and function be specially recognised in this Bill.  The Genealogical Office is regarded as having been established by virtue of the Allocation of Administration (Genealogical Office) Order, 1943, about which there are some questions, I should say, which gave responsibility <Col N="1842" /> for this office to the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>Since 1943 the Genealogical Office has existed as a distinct entity within the framework of the National Library as well as being linked administratively to it.  Staffing and budgeting have always been treated within the context of the library's function.  A separate Government decision in 1943 provided that the function of granting of arms should continue and be performed by the Chief Genealogical Officer or his deputy.  The staff working in the Genealogical Office were appointed as staff of the library.</P>
    <P>The National Library and Genealogical Office are under the overall responsibility of the relevant Minister of the day, a responsibility that currently falls within the remit of the Minister of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The proposed continuation of the linkage of the cultural resources represented by genealogy and heraldry with the National Library is regarded as both desirable and necessary in the interests of all concerned.  The linkage also recognises that the genealogical function involves important access to National Library sources of material.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure clarity in the administrative framework under the new board it was considered necessary that this issue be clarified in the Bill and the function made a responsibility of the new board.  The legislation clarifies a matter about which there has been ambiguity in relation to staff, the library, the genealogical functions and the office of heraldry.</P>
    <P>For reasons arising from a legal doubt in the 1943 order as to whether a Genealogical Office was actually established, that office must first technically be created and then abolished before pre-existing functions can be formally reconstructed and assigned to the National Library.  This technical abolition should not make any substantial change to the operation of genealogy or heraldry within the library as an institution, the intention being to remove any doubt as to the authority in charge of the operation of those functions.  This <Col N="1843" /> is what is being proposed, no more and no less.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of the legislative change and as an interim measure, the director of the National Library was given the title when the Chief Herald and Genealogical Officer retired in the middle of 1995.  His role was to act in a supervisory capacity overseeing the work of that office.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the role of the RDS and RIA to whom I have paid tribute in relation to their early valuable work.  I have spent some time on the previous point because I believe that, unfortunately, that aspect of this Bill has been misconstrued in some comments in the media.  Last week I met the staff of the cultural institutions in an open question and answer session about the new Bill. There have also been talks between the specific staffs and members and my Department to explain the Bill in detail.</P>
    <P>In seeking to create autonomous boards the Government could not but consider carefully the respective roles of the RIA and the RDS, roles set out in the agreements of 1881 and 1890.  Their work in establishing, during the 19th century, the core of the collections of the museum and library, and their watchful eyes over the last 100 years demands both a recognition and response from the State, a response required to be founded on the principle of some continuation of both that interest and their roles.  To these ends extensive discussions with both bodies have taken place which, I am pleased to say, have resulted in the signing of new agreements building on those of 1881 and 1890.  As a central part of the agreements the Oireachtas is being asked, through this Bill, to approve that the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society be given the right to make a list of nominations to the new boards from which the Minister would choose a number to serve in a personal capacity.</P>
    <P>There are proposals in the Bill dealing with the change of status of the staff of the museum and the library following <Col N="1844" /> the establishment of the autonomous boards.  I will deal with these later when I come to outline the provisions of the Bill.  However, I would like to assure Senators that I and my Department have discussed and will continue to discuss the implementation of the Bill with the staff concerned.</P>
    <P>Measures proposed in the Bill to enhance the development of the cultural institutions will heighten the consciousness of the importance of heritage objects, but other elements are important too.  Exhibitions showing us the achievements of other peoples allow us to compare with and measure our own achievements.  This is particularly important since we live on an island at the edge of Europe and many will only occasionally, if at all, have the opportunity to see at first hand artistic or historic artifacts of international importance.</P>
    <P>This Bill will make it possible for regular exhibitions to be held without the Minister of the day having to go to Government for a separate indemnification. For example, I had to make a separate application to the Government for the current Louis Le Broquy retrospective exhibition in IMMA in Kilmainham and many other exhibitions. The Bill makes that unnecessary and provides an easy way to manage it on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>An essential component in facilitating such exhibitions is the availability of legal indemnity provisions which offer an appropriate, efficient and cost effective aid to mounting such major exhibitions. At present, a certain level of indemnity is provided by Government on a case by case basis.  A clear need exists for a comprehensive statutory based scheme.  While such cover is provided only for exhibition areas meeting the highest standards, it has to be recognised that no matter how well a building is secured there will always be an element of risk.  It is this risk which the proposed indemnity system covers.</P>
    <P>While indemnities are mainly required for visiting exhibitions there have been, and are, rare instances where <Col N="1845" /> it is either necessary or highly desirable that long-term indemnities could be offered to encourage certain heritage objects to be brought into the care of the State.  Providing cover to the full value of the artifact and, by its nature, for an indefinite period, would be an unacceptable and inappropriate burden on the State.  A strictly limited form of indemnity only, therefore, in this area is being proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to heritage collections. Establishing boards for the National Museum and National Library and providing a system of indemnity cover will be of considerable assistance in deepening an awareness of heritage objects as a constituent part of the culture of the people.  However, it is essential that we also provide ways and means whereby heritage items may appropriately be protected from being lost to the country.</P>
    <P>At present, only archaeological objects are afforded full protection under Irish law, including the right of the Minister to refuse a licence for export.  Under the Documents and Pictures Act, 1945, a licence from the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht must be obtained before documents over 100 years old and pictures are exported.  This licence must, in all cases, be given.</P>
    <P>A greater degree of protection is required, quite frankly.  As a first step in the process of putting in place reasonable levels of protection, I am proposing to establish a register of certain heritage cultural items whose export would be a serious loss to the heritage of the country. In drawing up a register it is not being implied that other objects are not of equal heritage importance, but we must make a start.</P>
    <P>We do not want to discourage the inflow of cultural items by private collectors &mdash; the discouragement being the knowledge of the existence of an export prohibition &mdash; since such collectors may later decide to place such items in the care of a public body.  The degree of protection to be afforded must depend on various circumstances, balancing the <Col N="1846" /> interests involved.  The Bill will apply the strongest regulatory controls only to registered heritage objects already in public care.</P>
    <P>A related matter is that of export licences.  I envisage that the export licence provisions concerning paintings will be more targeted than is currently the case.  Documents over 100 years old already need a licence before being exported and a reduction in the limit to at least 70 years is seen as necessary from the archival perspective, and this is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A new export licence category is proposed in relation to the decorative arts. The decorative arts are Irish manufactured objects, such as antique Irish glass, furniture and Belleek pottery, all of which constitute an important and integral part of the National Museum's collection in the sphere of art and industry. It is timely, therefore, that the decorative arts should be recognised in this way.</P>
    <P>The possibility of other categories of cultural objects needing protection from being lost to the country in the future cannot be excluded.  The Bill includes a power to permit the Minister to extend the categories for which there is a licence requirement.  A fine is being introduced for non-compliance with the requirement to obtain the necessary export licence.</P>
    <P>In the interests of consolidation, all the relevant export licensing requirements are to be grouped together.  This consolidation process will permit the repeal of the Documents and Pictures Act, 1945, in its entirety, as well as separate export controls on archaeological objects contained in the National Monuments Acts.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the issue of compulsory purchase.  There are many valuable cultural objects in the long-term care of public authorities but not in the outright ownership of the State.  As a result of instances that have arisen occasionally in the past, there is always the real possibility that a private owner may seek to reclaim from a public authority an important heritage item in its care for <Col N="1847" /> many years with a view to its export and sale on the international market, and where the public authority would be virtually powerless to avoid the loss.</P>
    <P>This is not an abstract point, I am sorry to say.  A person might be motivated by the beauty of an object and the ethical impulse to share it as part of a wider cultural heritage.  However, through succession, others in later generations may seek to change the terms on which the original gift was made. Clearly there is potential for controversy unless provisions are put in place now that attempt to balance &mdash; which I stress &mdash; the rights of the owner and the interests of the common good.  To deal with such potentially fraught situations procedures are set out in the Bill whereby the State may acquire registered cultural objects in public care, compulsorily if necessary.</P>
    <P>While the National Gallery's legislative structure has served it well for a long time, some of the new provisions for the museum and library would be useful and appropriate if they were to be applied to the gallery.  Such provisions would include a power for the gallery to draw up by-laws on the same basis as the museum and library and provisions in relation to annual reports and accounts and borrowing powers.  The opportunity afforded by the Bill is being taken to provide for these.</P>
    <P>At present, the National Library can purchase library material that is not subject to the book deposit requirements of the Copyright Act, 1963.  With the development of new technologies the range and volume of such material has expanded substantially.  However, the scope for extending collections through purchase in the ordinary course is limited to what can be afforded by way of annual grant allocation.  A lack of sufficient resources over a long period of time has led to fragmented private sector activities in various archival fields, for example, in the subjects of theatre, film, music and architecture.  We have often been very grateful to those who <Col N="1848" /> have risen to meet an urgency for which provision was not made.</P>
    <P>Clearly, to bring greater cohesion to the function of collecting items representative of our past the remit of the National Library needs to be strengthened to respond adequately to the broad range of interests and in ways that do not impose too onerous a cost on the collecting institution.  Accordingly, the Bill will allow the National Library on a planned and phased basis, as storage and retrieval resources permit, to gradually expand its collection and take into account the development of new technologies since 1963.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to more material matters.  At present the rating position of our cultural institutions continues to be founded on the Scientific Societies Act, 1843, which provides that scientific and fine arts societies are to be exempted from rating.  This provision is founded on the premise of what constituted the arts in the middle of the 19th century just before the Famine.  It is not established yet that the National Museum, the National Library or Heritage Council would automatically be adjudged &ldquo;scientific societies&rdquo; for rates exemption purposes.</P>
    <P>In addition, while a centrally important cultural institution, the Irish Museum of Modern Art has managed to attain rates exemption in respect of its activities.  The Abbey Theatre, also centrally important, has been refused rates exemption.  The Bill ensures, therefore, that certain listed cultural institutions, including the National Museum and the National Library, engaged exclusively in the fields of the arts or heritage shall be exempt for rates.</P>
    <P>Other provisions enhancing the independence of cultural institutions include a facility permitting the issue of intoxicating liquor licences for certain of the key collecting institutions.  It is extraordinary in a Bill with about 68 sections that this is the one which received prepublicity, almost to the exclusion of every other provision.  Perhaps this is a real need for many which I was glad to address.  Only those bodies with <Col N="1849" /> important collections and under the aegis of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will be included.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes provision for desirable changes which on their own might not justify separate legislative action or which arise from the establishment of the museum and library as autonomous boards.  These provisions include the repealing of redundant legislation relating to theatres; requiring the main collecting institutions to provide assistance to the Heritage Council; widening the basis of membership of Marsh's Library at the request of its Board of Governors and Guardians; making some minor adjustments to specific provisions in the National Monuments Acts and affirming that the maintenance of the premises of the museum and library will remain the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill.  Part I, sections 1 to 7, is of a generalist nature with provisions which are relevant in one or all of the other Parts of the Bill which cover defining terms or necessary technical issues.  Part II, sections 8, 9 and 10, establishes Bord Ard-Mhúsaem na hÉireann and Bord Leabharlann Náisiúnta na Éireann, sets out the names by which these institutions will be known and provides for separate establishment days for each of the boards.  Each board is to be a body corporate with powers to sue and be sued and to acquire, hold and dispose of moveable property, subject to the provisions of the Bill, and land, with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>As on and from their respective establishment days, by virtue of sections 11 and 12, the boards of the National Museum and National Library shall have the general duty of maintaining, managing, controlling and expanding their collections and have all such powers as are necessary for these purposes. Section 13 provides that the business and administration of the Genealogical Office is to be carried out by the Board of the National Library and the functions of researching, granting and confirming <Col N="1850" /> coats of arms shall be performed by a person designated by the board as Chief Herald.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I am specifically providing for the functions of genealogy and the appellation of Chief Herald in legislation in order to strengthen their status as a valuable cultural resource.  It is envisaged that the title of Chief Herald will be held by the person who has the expertise in this sphere of activity while under the supervision and control of the board of the library.</P>
    <P>The boards of the museum and library will be empowered to draw up by-laws under section 14 governing the care and protection of the collections, to charge for services rendered and, subject to ministerial consent, to charge admission fees for their institutions generally and/or in respect of specific exhibitions. Section 15 allows the Minister to confer on the boards additional functions.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that the respective collections of the museum and library are, in general, to be held in repositories authorised and listed in the First Schedule and that items from the collections may only be removed from the repositories for specified reasons as provided for in the Act.  The national repositories will consist in the first instance of the existing museum and library buildings contained within the Leinster House complex.  Provision is also made for the designation of further repositories in the future.  It is envisaged that other buildings will also be designated by order at the time of the establishment of the bodies.  It is envisaged that other buildings, such as Collins Barracks, will be designated in parallel with the establishment day.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 and 18 set out provisions governing the lending of artifacts by the museum and for the lending and disposal of material by the library.  Separate arrangements are proposed for the treatment of the collections by either board having regard to the distinct and particular circumstances involved.  Consultation with the Heritage Council is provided for.  Section 19 sets out the <Col N="1851" /> numbers and composition of the persons to comprise each board, including the chairperson, 14 to 16 in respect of the museum and ten to 12 in respect of the library with provision for a number in each board to be chosen from a list of nominees provided by the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society. A minimum of board members for each gender is provided for.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 and 21 set out the terms of office of members of the boards and chairpersons and the conditions under which they would serve on the boards. Standard provisions such as the period of office, remuneration of board members and conduct of board meetings are provided for.  Sections 22, 23 and 24 set out provisions governing meetings of the boards, establishment by the boards of advisory committees and the acquisition of a seal.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides that a person nominated or elected to become a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament will cease to be or may not become a member of a board.  Where the person concerned is a member of staff of a board that person will be regarded as seconded from his or her employment.  Sections 26 and 27 provide for the making of grants of amounts each year to the boards, and basic criteria are set out under which a board may accept and invest gifts of money, land and other property.</P>
    <P>Section 28 sets out the respective roles and functions of the directors of the National Museum and the National Library.  The directors of the respective institutions are to be the chief executives of the institutions to be appointed by the board with the consent of the Minister.  A director in place on the establishment day is to be deemed to have been appointed by the boards on their current terms and conditions.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 and 30 provide for appointment of staff of a board.  The numbers, levels of remuneration, terms and conditions, would be for the board to determine with the consent of the <Col N="1852" /> Minister and the Minister for Finance. All persons currently employed exclusively for the performance of duties within the National Museum or National Library shall become members of the staff of the relevant board on the establishment day.</P>
    <P>The Minister is empowered to designate those of his general staff to be staff of the National Museum and the National Library.  This will facilitate general civil servants who wish to stay in the museum and library after establishment day.  Transfers to the employment of the new boards are to be on the basis of conditions not less favourable than before the transfer and this is explicitly recognised in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 31 a board, when determining such topics as remuneration and allowances, shall be subject to relevant guidelines and directives issued from time to time.  Sections 32 and 33 set out provisions governing superannuation of staff and empower a board to borrow money.</P>
    <P>Sections 34 and 35 set out basic provisions concerning preparation by the boards of accounts and audits of those accounts, preparation of annual reports and the supplying of information to the Minister.  Section 36 provides for continuance in force of any pending legal proceedings; and sections 37 and 38 provide for transfer of certain types of property, rights and liabilities to each board.  Section 39 empowers a board to employ consultants and advisers subject to any relevant guidelines and directives issued from time to time.  Section 40 provides a board with an exemption from stamp duty in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill establishes the statutorily based State system of indemnity in respect of important cultural exhibitions imported from abroad and for valuable cultural items on long-term loan to the major collecting institutions of the State.  Section 41 defines key terms used in Part III of the Bill and section 42 establishes a procedure for indemnification against the loss of, or damage to, a cultural object while on <Col N="1853" /> loan to certain institutions for public exhibition.  The institutions are listed in the Second Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 43 sets out an upper monetary limit of £150 million on total indemnities outstanding above which indemnities may not be given.  A lower limit of £1 million per indemnity, subject to certain exceptions, is also cited.  A procedure may be invoked permitting temporarily the setting of a new upper limit, subject to approval by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 44 provides a mechanism whereby the list of institutions and authorised areas for indemnity purposes set out in the Second Schedule to the Bill may be amended by the Minister by order, subject to approval by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  The institutions to be cited must have current or planned equipped exhibition areas to high standards, be in full or substantive public ownership, be experienced in presenting exhibitions of major importance or are otherwise already responsible for caring for collections of national or international importance.</P>
    <P>Section 45 provides for giving long-term indemnities for loans of certain cultural objects to cultural institutions for periods of indefinite duration.  The objects must first be registered in accordance with section 47.  The value of any object must be not less than £250,000 and the cumulative amount of liability against any form of loss is set within an overall ceiling of £20 million. Indemnity against loss or damage is capped at 10 per cent of the value or £1 million, whichever is the lower.  The Minister may, by order, vary the monetary amounts to which I have referred subject to approval by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill sets out provisions in relation to heritage collections. Section 46 empowers, <i>inter alia</i>, the main collecting institutions to lend to, borrow from, or exchange with each other any cultural objects in its collection, and there is a provision to deal with the unlikely event of a conflict arising <Col N="1854" /> from any overlap in collection policy.</P>
    <P>Section 47 provides for the establishment by the Minister of a register of certain classes of cultural objects whose export from the State would constitute a serious loss to Ireland's heritage.  The register will be limited in size by virtue of categories and considerations as directed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 48 consolidates and updates existing export licensing provisions. Export licences will continue to be required for archaeological objects.  The scope of licences in relation to paintings and old documents not in print is revised.  New categories of cultural objects to which an export licensing provision will apply are established to include classes of decorative arts objects listed in a Schedule to the Bill and other classes of cultural objects so designated, by order, by the Minister.  Various levels of penalty upon conviction depending on the level of offence are set out in the section.</P>
    <P>Section 49 applies the export licensing provisions.  In general, apart from archaeological objects and registered cultural objects, the applicant will be granted the export licence.  Section 50 provides for delegation of export licensing and enforcement functions to the boards of the National Museum, National Library and National Gallery. Senators can see from these four sections that it is a substantive Bill with regard to the new organisation and possibilities it creates for the new institutions.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill sets out procedures within which acquisition by the State of registered cultural objects in public care may be effected.  I have given the background in my earlier remarks and, as I said, it may be effected compulsorily if necessary.  Section 51 establishes the objects to which it applies.  Under sections 52, 53 and 54, should the return of such an object be sought by an owner, there is a procedure permitting the State to acquire the object by way of vesting order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1855" /> Section 55 provides for payment of compensation.  Section 56 prescribes the form and time limits for claims.  Sections 57 and 58 deal with the situation where, if an offer is made and refused, the claimant may apply to the High Court in a summary manner for compensation and the High Court is empowered to fix the amount to be paid subject to criteria. Upon application by the Minister, the court is empowered to have the order discharged, in which case compensation may be awarded by the court arising as a result of the proceedings. The provision will not apply to objects brought into public care after the passing of the Bill.  Cultural objects, as well as being registered, must have been in the care of a public institution for at least five years prior to commencement of the provision.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill applies certain provisions of the Bill to the National Gallery of Ireland.  Under section 59 additional functions for the gallery shall be to contribute to an increase and diffusion of knowledge of the visual arts to which I attach some importance as it is an educational function, dispose of land it has acquired and engage in fund raising activities.  Section 60 applies to the gallery certain provisions which are to apply to the National Museum and the National Library.</P>
    <P>In Part VII of the Bill section 61 provides certain collecting institutions with granted licences to sell intoxicating liquor under certain conditions.  The on-licence will be subject to the normal opening hours of the museum or library and otherwise be bound by general intoxicating liquor licence provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 62 makes changes to the governance framework of the board of Marsh's Library, established under an Act of 1707, permitting the Minister, with the consent of the Governors and Guardians of Marsh's Library, to appoint two additional persons to the board.  This provision, as I have explained, is included at the request of Marsh's Library.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1856" /> Section 63 provides that certain listed cultural institutions and bodies, whose remit comes within the sphere of arts and heritage, shall be exempt from the rate chargeable by a local authority.  The listed institutions either come directly under the aegis of the Minister or arise from the special arrangements agreed between the Minister and the Arts Council involving the Concert Hall, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Abbey Theatre.</P>
    <P>Section 64 creates a requirement that library material, other than in the form of books and first published in the State, be delivered to the National Library within one month of first publication. The provision includes engravings, play scripts, photographs, and any form of non-print media on which information is placed.  A monetary fine of up to £500 is provided for non-compliance.  An enablement is provided permitting the provision to be applied to other existing deposit libraries cited in the Copyright Act, 1963.  The enablement is intended to be invoked as and when the UK authorities are deciding whether to continue with such arrangements in respect of library material other than in the form of books.  This would allow such material to be deposited in Trinity College under UK law with the Irish providing for reciprocal deposit of Irish material with the relevant UK deposit libraries.  Section 65 applies the new penalty level to books which are already subject to deposit arrangements.</P>
    <P>Section 66 provides that the Minister may request a board, the Director of the National Archives or the Governors and Guardians of the National Gallery to make available such advice to the Heritage Council as required to assist it in performing its functions.</P>
    <P>Section 67 makes minor adjustments to the National Monuments Act, 1930. Section 68 provides that the Commissioners of Public Works shall be responsible for maintenance and improvement of any premises occupied by the museum and library, acting under the supervision of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1857" /> The Bill is necessarily focused on the many structures and mechanisms needed to aid the development of our national cultural institutions and help them reach their full potential.  Nonetheless, legislative action, while essential, cannot be relied on to be the only building block in the process of regeneration. To seek to enact procedural changes without putting into place the resources to develop these institutions would be tantamount to frustrating the intent behind the legislative measures. The optimal development of the museum and library requires the development of their financial and staff resources in a sustained manner.  While developments must take place within the framework of relevant Government policies, I am personally fully committed to making the maximum progress possible in these areas.</P>

    <P>The decisions to which I referred were taken to establish the cultural space in Ireland as a place where significant initiatives will be taken in the areas of audio-visual and film, inland waterways, parks and monuments, land acquisition, the various collections and proper care for the institutions of the State.  If the Bill meets the approval of both Houses, it will join the other legislation I have put through the Oireachtas to become the framework of heritage legislation which will enable the institutions to draw on their rich past, be secure in the present and be flexible in a new era.</P>
    <P>These decisions were taken for the purpose of deepening a sense of a <Col N="1858" /> nation that will be pluralistic and will respect the complexity of things.  It will also be enlightened, tolerant, appreciative of the natural environment and receptive to the world of ideas and the imagination.  It is important to state that respect for the integrity and complexity of the past makes possible a tolerance in the present.  However, it is also the only guarantor regarding the integrity of the imagination in the future.  We must adopt this integrated view of the legislation which guides the institutions, the practices and the making of provision. The decisions we take and the structures we put in place can be no more than conduits through which to protect and nurture what is intangible, yet crucial, in the life of the people.  Any test of our work during the last three years and six months, not least through the actions we take in this Bill, must, of necessity, be judged by reference to those intangible values.  I would welcome such a test.</P>
    <P>Let our work be measured by how the people have lived, by what is achieved by the writers, the poets, the artisans; in due course, let measurement be by those who seek to appreciate and study what is collected, cared for and recorded for posterity in our national cultural institutions.</P>

      <P>It is somewhat facetious to state that I could not help but reflect on a vision of the Minister standing on the back of a lorry in Galway West at election time because the last page of his speech sounded like a mission statement for the future and an acknowledgement of his contribution during the past four years.  I presume that the election campaign has begun.  Of all his colleagues in the Government, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht can be justifiably proud of his record in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the general tenor of this Bill which seeks to establish statutory boards to care for and manage the collections of heritage objects in the National Museum and the material contained in the National Library.  The <Col N="1859" /> scope and content of the proposals in the Bill are substantial and sweep away the cobwebs of over 100 years of benign statutory neglect of two of our major cultural institutions.  The Minister is to be commended for introducing this significant Bill in this House as the first stage of the legislative process. Members will echo my view that a Bill of this substance and content is ideally suited to debate in the Upper House.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated, it is a substantial Bill and runs to 68 sections.  Much that is good in this Bill has been obscured by the raging controversy surrounding section 13 which proposes to dissolve the Genealogical Office and legislate for the new board of the National Library to perform the functions heretofore performed by the Genealogical Office, including the duty of granting and confirming coats of arms under the style of heralding.  The Minister acknowledged that this proposal has raised the hackles of those involved in the genealogical area and many others who believe that an important area of our cultural heritage is under threat.</P>
    <P>Last October, the Minister and I jousted, if I may use that word, on the issue of heralding in this House.  Much of what I argued at that time is relevant to this debate.  The Minister dwelt in some detail on the background of this controversy and the office itself.  For the record, the Genealogical Office dates back to 1552.  The National Library was founded in 1887 and was based on collections acquired by the Government from the Royal Dublin Society.  The beginnings of that institution are also predated by the Chief Herald's office. In 1552, King Edward VI formally introduced heraldry to this country by establishing the office of the Ulster King of Arms, which is generally known as the Office of Arms.  The first King of Arms and Principal Herald of Ireland, Mr. Bartholomew Butler, was required by his terms of appointment to &ldquo;ratify existing coats of arms and assign new ones to meritorious individuals&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1860" /> In 1943, the Office of Arms was transferred from British to Irish administration and located in the Bedford Tower in Dublin Castle.  Established by Edward VI in 1552, it was renamed the Genealogical Office in that year.  The Minister and I are at one on the question of obfuscation and confusion surrounding the history and statutory elements attached to the establishment of the office.  The Genealogical Office was headed by a State official, the late and much respected Dr. Edward MacLysaght, whose contribution to reorganising that office cannot be overstated. It is interesting to note that the original title of Ulster King of Arms was probably used in 1552 because, when the Irish Office of Arms was established by King Edward VI, Ulster had not been subdued by the English.  This is a strange historical irony in the context of the current relationship between Britain and Ireland.  However, as Dr. Paisley might say, &ldquo;That was then and this is now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In 1922, when all branches of the Civil Service came under the control of the new Government, the Office of Arms was, for some reason, an exception.  It continued to function under British control and was funded and staffed by the UK Government.  I appreciate the Minister's wide ranging brief in explaining the terms of the Bill but knowing his penchant for historical research I thought he might have enlightened the House why an exception was made in 1922, if only for the purpose of historical curiosity.  My point is not political, it is purely historical.  Why was an exception made in the case of this particular office?  During the previous debate on this issue, I pointed out that one of the most ancient Irish orders, the Order of St. Patrick, was dispensed with at that time, mainly due to the constitutional imperative that titles of nobility could not be conferred on Irish citizens.  The Minister and I may have exchanged words on that matter in the past, although it is not very serious.  Perhaps there is a bit of the historical romantic in me since I believe we should have <Col N="1861" /> State orders.  France is a republic, yet it has retained many of the trappings of its historical royalty.  Perhaps the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, staunch republican socialist that he is, might be the Minister to reintroduce some form of State orders.</P>
    <P>This is an issue that arises from time to time and, although it digresses somewhat from the matters before us.  In the context of the Genealogical Office we should have some form of public orders which can be awarded to meritorious individuals.  It has nothing to do with monarchy or royalty.  Rather it is colourful and there is an attached pomp and ceremony, elements we seem to have discarded.  I remember a person telling me of his tremendous experience in the 1930s seeing the hussars attached to the civil guard, a mounted battalion that paraded in full regalia.  It would be wonderful to have a similar guard to parade in formation from O'Connell Street to Áras an Uachtaráin and back, perhaps twice a day.  It would have great tourist potential.  I am digressing from the subject matter of the Bill but I am glad to alleviate my angst on the matter.</P>

    <P>On the death of Sir Neville Wilkinson, the last Ulster King of Arms in 1940 no successor to the office was appointed by the Crown.  The registrar, Mr. T.U. Sadlier carried on in his capacity as deputy.  When we last debated this matter I quoted from Mr. MacLysaght's memoirs of the activities of Mr. Sadlier and history has been a little unkind to him.  My remarks were strongly influenced by Mr. MacLysaght's interpretation of his relationship with Mr. Sadlier and the impression may have been given that he was something less than a decent man.  For historical purposes I will put the record straight.  It seems Mr. Sadlier was a very <Col N="1862" /> positive and able individual who served the State during his time in the Bedford Tower.  Sadly, he died in penury.</P>
    <P>The first director of the National Library, Dr. R.J. Hayes, suggested to the Government in 1943 that if and when the Office of Arms was transferred it should be, attached to the National Library under the Department of Education.  I do not have the public records on this matter but it would be interesting to establish whether the Government at the time sent an <i>aide mémoire</i> to Departments seeking a comment on the future of the office and role of the Chief Herald.  There does not seem to have been any public debate on this matter and the Official Reports of the Dáil and Seanad do not indicate any debate on the establishment of the Genealogical Office.</P>
    <P>There is a Statutory Instrument entitled &ldquo;Allocation of Administration (Genealogical Office) Order, 1943.&rdquo;  It states:</P>
    <P>The Government, in exercise of the powers conferred on them by subsection (1) of section 6 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1939 (No. 36 of 1939) and of every and any other power them in this behalf enabling, hereby order as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  This Order may be cited as the Allocation of Administration (Genealogical Office) Order, 1943.</P>
    <P>2.  The administration and business of the Genealogical Office are hereby allocated to the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Given under the Official Seal of the Government, this 13th day of July, 1943.</P>
    <P>It is signed by the then Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera.  This suggests that the Genealogical Office was established in 1943.</P>
    <P>However, there seems to be have been a legal blip in 1943 as a result of which there is some doubt as to whether the Genealogical Office was legally <Col N="1863" /> established.  This office was carried over from the British Administration of 21 years previously for an unclear reason and paid for by the UK Government.  It must have rested uncomfortably with the republican Governments of the time.  The issue seems to have come to a head initially in 1940 on the death of the Ulster Herald.  It prompted some debate in Government but nothing was done about it for three years.</P>
    <P>Mr. Sadlier who was the registrar, was appointed the deputy rather than the herald.  Historical research indicates that Mr. Sadlier was looking to a job in London which would have given him a certain permanence.  He had come from the British Administration originally.  There was some suggestion that he was a Unionist by political inclination and was not all that happy about working for a republican Government, although this cannot necessarily be proven.  I understand following the establishment of the Genealogical Office and the appointment of Mr. MacLysaght in 1943, Mr. Sadlier continued to work in this jurisdiction for at least another two or three years.  There is no reason to suppose his objections were that ideologically strong or he would have ceased to work for the Government.</P>
    <P>I go into detail on this matter because this is a section of the Bill about which there has been a great amount of controversy.  It is important to establish the origins of this office, the reasons for it and the future role of the Chief Herald in the context of the Minister's current proposals.  If I appear to be giving a history lesson I apologise.  However, it is important to clarify precisely what we are talking about.</P>
    <P>The question of legality arises and, in framing the Bill, the Minister and the parliamentary draftsman had to address what they would do with this in legal terms.  It is now proposed in section 13 (1) that &ldquo;the Genealogical Office shall, on the establishment day become and be dissolved&rdquo;.  To avoid any legal uncertainty it is necessary that the office is first technically established and then <Col N="1864" /> technically abolished.  This will ensure that pre-existing functions can formally be reconstructed and assigned to the National Library.</P>
    <P>It is seen by the Minister as a technical provision which should not make any substantial change to the operation of genealogy or heraldry within the library.  My colleague, Deputy de Valera, who is the Fianna Fáil spokes-person on arts, culture and the Gaeltacht, and I have been lobbied on this issue in the last couple of weeks.  Given the approaches made to me it would have been irresponsible for me to come into this House and oppose for the sake of opposition what seemed on the face of it a cavalier approach by the Minister to abolish what was perceived to be a historic cultural institution of great national importance, whose continuity went back to the 16th century and which had resonance, not only for those of us in this part of the island, but for our separated brethren in Northern Ireland.  As a result, while I have certain proposals in this area, I understand and empathise with the Minister's approach in clarifying this historic legal and cultural anachronism.</P>
    <P>The Government must make a choice at this point &mdash; the Minister could argue he has made it &mdash; to either establish an independent and autonomous organisation of the Chief Herald or tie the office legislatively to a national institution. I make a distinction between the position and function of the Chief Herald and the function of the Genealogical Office.  They are two separate entities in that, while they coexist, overlap and interrelate, the argument put forward, if I interpret it correctly, is that the status, title, role and function of the Chief Herald should be retained separately and in its purest virginal state and should not be incorporated into anything else.</P>
    <P>There is a certain merit in the argument and, in my discussions with those who will ultimately implement the provisions in the Bill, there is no great ideological objection to the creation of a separate Chief Herald's Office.  As the Minister will be aware, there are several <Col N="1865" /> examples internationally of the statutory creation of the Office of Chief Herald. Scotland, our nearest neighbour, although it is within the United Kingdom, has a separate legal system and a Chief Herald on a statutory basis. In Canada, it is attached to the President's office.  The Minister might argue these are Commonwealth countries and former colonies.  Surprisingly, the newly created republic of Zimbabwe has a Chief Herald's Office attached to the Prime Minister's office.</P>
    <P>I now find myself on the horns of a dilemma.  On the one hand, I understand where we are coming from on this but, on the other, I have a certain sympathy with those who have strenuously argued for the historic continuity of what they perceive to be a major cultural institution and for its separateness and autonomy to be continued.  While I sympathise with that point of view, I agree with the Minister that the office has not been separate and autonomous since 1943.  Most of the arguments put to me in recent days by concerned citizens and organisations are that the office should be retained largely because of its history and place in the cultural diversity of this island.  I sympathise greatly with that point of view.</P>
    <P>In the previous Seanad debate of the future of the Chief Herald and the Genealogical Office, I sought assurances from the Minister that the unique character and functions of the office would be explicitly provided for in statute to preserve and safeguard the long-term important aspect of Irish life it represents. I cited our near neighbour Scotland as a possible example and I have cited others.  I also pointed that correspondence in the national press, especially from our separated brethren in Northern Ireland, had indicated that any attempt to abolish the title and role of the Chief Herald and the Genealogical Office was, to quote one correspondent, &ldquo;a shocking development&rdquo;.  This is mainly because the office operates on behalf of citizens on both sides of the Border and thus transcends the political divisions created since partition.  I stated <Col N="1866" /> earlier that the Government must make a choice and it should be the creation of an independent and autonomous organisation for the Chief Herald and the Genealogical Office which would be properly funded and staffed.</P>
    <P>There would be implications.  Major cost factors would involve relocating from the existing office in Kildare Street, staffing, security surrounding the building and various other aspects.  We are now in the area of an extra charge on the taxpayer.  I am not sure the Minister, having burned the midnight oil on this legislation over the last 12 months, will drop his provision and promise to this House he will create a new office of State.  However, I must have the courage of my convictions.  We will probably return to this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Having spoken of the separateness and history of the office, there is a notion abroad that the Genealogical Office has a distinct staffing complement. The Minister has clarified this and I reiterate that it is not the case nor has it ever been.  Great play is made by those lobbying for the retention of the <i>status quo</i> that there is a uniqueness about the staff of the Chief Herald's Office.  I understand, and the Minister has confirmed, that all staff who have worked in the Genealogical Office since 1943 have been recruited by the National Library to work across its several divisions.  I also understand that no special training is provided and no qualifications specific to the staff are needed in that each succeeding generation learned what it could from its predecessor. Is it that true?  The point made is that there is a uniqueness to this office and a certain area of expertise which will now be lost.  My understanding is that has not been the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been pointed out to me that, should the Genealogical Office be established as a separate autonomous body, the National Library, with its current staffing difficulties, would not be in a position to release the <Col N="1867" /> staff of five who work in that office.  Five people would have to move into the new organisation, but the Library would not release the current officers.  In other words, five new staff would have to be appointed.  Apart from the five solely dedicated to work in the Genealogical Office, there is also the normal support staff in the National Library, for example, those involved in security, administration, conservation and preservation, none of whom would be available to work in a separate office.  That is the current staffing situation in the Genealogical Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  What I am saying is that, if the Minister were to go down the road of creating a new separate office, new staff would have to be appointed.  The existing National Library staff could not be used.  That is my understanding.  Those who argue for the creation of a separate legal entity for the Genealogical Office and the Chief Herald's Office should keep these factors in mind.  If the Minister is serious in his intent, perhaps he should consider creating a separate entity.  This would go some way to answering much of the criticism and also help to allay the fears of those outside this State who seem to think this is yet another Republican plot to ignore the wishes, aspirations and cultural traditions of our separated brethren in Northern Ireland.  That is what is being said and inferred in letters to the papers.  The Minister is aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should consider creating a new office of Chief Herald.  Transferring the Chief Herald's duties as outlined in section 13 would not be acceptable to Fianna Fáil and we <Col N="1868" /> may table a number of amendments to this section on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of the final resting place of the Genealogical Office and the Chief Herald, our party is concerned at the fate of the genealogical manuscript collection currently accessed under careful environmental and security conditions in the Manuscripts Reading Room of the Library.  The Minister has not gone far enough in ensuring that this collection is ring-fenced.  I would be interested in his comments on that.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that great emphasis has been placed on access to the Genealogical Office by the lobbyists. I am sure the point was made to the Minister that there would now be less direct access for genealogical researchers, etc., and that this would create enormous difficulties for them.  This access might be denied them under the new provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding, this will probably raise a few hairs, is that the last Chief Herald was not an enthusiastic supporter of easy access for those who wished it.  Without being unfair to the gentleman concerned, his management style may have contributed somewhat to the present difficulties with this issue. Interestingly, I received a letter this morning from a genealogist which gives credence to this view.  He stated that the Genealogical Office became notorious in recent years for its growing detachment from the task of assisting persons with genealogical queries, who had to be dealt with, as well as possible in the library, which was also under strain due to paucity of resources for development. He stated that the Genealogical Office instituted a consultancy service for those willing to pay a fee which was operated on an exclusive basis by a group of freelance professional genealogists, many of whom enjoyed preferential use of the office's facilities while the public was excluded.  In so far as there has been some improvement in public access to the Genealogical Office in the past year or so, it relates to the decision of the Director of the National Library to run the place on the same equitable <Col N="1869" /> basis as other library departments and ultimately to her assumption of the post of Chief Herald following a Government decision in September 1995.</P>

      <P>The board of the National Museum and the board of the Library will both remain in the gift of the relevant Minister &mdash; more largesse to be dispensed at the whim of the Minister of the day and do not tell me that this will not be the case.  One has only to look at the policy adopted by successive Governments since the establishment of semi-State boards to see the political reality.  I know the Minister has put in certain checks and balances but it is another example of jobs for the boys.  It will be interesting to see how some of these people end up on the boards, especially as Members of this House will be excluded from consideration.  I would have much preferred the Minister to devote his considerable talents and energy to fighting for more resources for the existing institutions.  He has been under some attack on this subject and rightly so.  I know he has budgetary problems and must fight his case with the Department of Finance but the National Museum and the National Library have been under-resourced.</P>
      <P>Section 19 will remain sacrosanct but I am concerned that a majority of the board will be in the gift of the Minister of the day.  There are certain key bodies who should have the right of nomination, for example, the heads of universities and my own nominating body, the Library Association of Ireland.  The Royal Irish Academy and the Irish Management Institute are others.  We will submit amendments to this section on Committee Stage when we can discuss the matter in more detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will also deal with sections 23, 45, 48 and 51 but as I stated at the outset there is certain validity to this Bill.  It is monumental work and a credit to the Minister but I would have been more <Col N="1870" /> impressed if he were to come into this House and tell us that he had managed to convince his colleague, the Minister for Finance, of the need to improve the staffing and financial resources of the two institutions.</P>
    <P>Does the introduction of this legislation go far enough to achieve the objectives set out in the National Library's strategic plan and the development plan for the National Museum? We will return to this but I am grateful to the Minster for his very detailed explanation of this highly substantive Bill.  With the creation of these two boards our cultural institutions will be placed on a statutory footing.  We will return to the tournament on the next Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this very fine Bill in Seanad Éireann, thus making the Seanad more relevant to Government and the legislative process.</P>
      <P>This Bill is one of the finest pillars in modern legislation and will take our cultural institutions into the 21st century on a very sound statutory basis.  The Minister and his staff have done trojan work in preparing the Bill and researching various aspects of it, taking into account the representations and reports on this wide area in the last few years.  The Bill is comprehensive and extensive.  The Minister and his staff are to be complimented for incorporating so much in one Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his introductory speech, the Minister rightly said that we are nothing unless we can collect all the data that refers to us as a people, particularly data on the past, be it manuscripts, artifacts or genealogical records.  The Bill is particularly commendable because it proposes the establishment of two autonomous boards for the National Library and National Museum.  In doing that the Minister has taken a fine step forward because up to now the level of interaction between both institutions and the Department has been restricted. Their spontaneous reaction to events or <Col N="1871" /> their ability to make decisions on specific issues was somewhat restricted.  It is important that people of such expertise, skill and commitment are given full responsibility and are able to make policy decisions as they see fit.  In certain cases, of course, they can refer to the Minister.  This is very wise in relation to the everyday activities such as deciding to have an exhibition.  It is important they make those operative decisions without consulting directly with the Department concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister's decision to provide an indemnity scheme is particularly commendable. It is extremely important, assuring and guaranteeing people who provide objects for displays that those objects are indemnified.  This is a welcome progression which will generate more activity and allow more objects to be acquired.  This will help the process and it is to be commended.</P>
    <P>Section 48, dealing with export restrictions, is long overdue.  Unfortunately, in recent years many historical cultural objects have been exported. Nobody was in a position to restrict or to prevent such exportation except in the area of archaeological artefacts.  The Minister has now broadened the restrictions on exports which, hopefully, this section will be used to tightly monitor so that none of the items we wish to maintain in the State will be illegally exported.</P>
    <P>As regards section 49, strict conditions and restrictions should be imposed on the issuing of export licences.  I am pleased that the Bill introduces fines as well as restricting export licences, but some of the proposed fines, particularly on summary conviction, are too low.  The Minister may consider this on Committee Stage.  Even though fines for conviction on indictment are substantial they should be reviewed at regular intervals because enormous sums can accrue to those who manage to export such goods illegally.  Fines should be in proportion to the value of the exported items.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1872" /> As well as causing a certain amount of public outcry and concern, section 13, which deals with the Genealogical Office, has been highlighted by Senator Mooney and by the Minister.  Prior to receiving representations, I had formed a view of the Genealogical Office since I come from the west of Ireland where there is a tradition of tracing family histories and a fine appreciation of family names.  The old saying is: &ldquo;If you lack but O or Mac, then no true Irishman are you&rdquo;.  Many individual names interact with other names, and the history of our people is an interesting area of study. While the National Library deals with manuscripts relating to the Irish people and their history, the National Museum deals with artefacts associated with people who lived in certain areas at a particular time.  By studying either, one can appreciate the people of earlier times and how they lived.</P>
    <P>A more important issue concerns how we stand as a race.  Family tradition is an important aspect of our history and we have a far greater one than more modern countries like the United States or Australia.  We have a wonderful history which is widely documented in records and is something upon which we can build.  It is extremely important for people of Irish origin returning from Australia and the United States to be able to trace their roots.  At the Genealogical Office they can find records of their forebears which bring people closer to this country.</P>
    <P>There is a case for expanding the Genealogical Office on a county by county basis.  In County Clare we are fortunate in having the services of Mr. Macie Cleary of Corofin who has done great work in tracing family histories in the county's 46 parishes.  Great work could be achieved through linking local offices in each county to the Genealogical Office.  The Minister and his Department might reflect on this.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not propose to abolish the office as such, but to incorporate it into the National Library.</P>
    <Col N="1873" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am suggesting that it should be recognised separately from the National Library so that it would have a separate identity.  It may not be possible to do that, but it is something the Minister might consider because it relates to people, family names and tracing the history of the Irish race.  From that point of view it has particular significance.</P>
      <P>Some may argue that it was inherited from the British monarchy and, as such, is best forgotten.  We cannot forget our past, however, because it is part of what we are, both as a nation and as a people. It should be recognised, appreciated and developed.</P>
      <P>In purely economic terms, we can expand the area of cultural tourism.  I fully appreciate that the Minister has a higher appreciation of our rich tradition, culture and history than to reduce it to economic terms.  However, he might consider the value of cultural tourism as far as the Genealogical Office is concerned. As the Minister rightly states, the Office of the Chief Herald contributes only one third of the work done by the Genealogical Office, but it is an important office.  I am always amazed by the number of Irish homes that display coats of arms, whether in America, Australia or Britain.</P>
      <P>The Minister should re-examine that issue.  The Government is open to suggestion and does not necessarily enter every debate with a closed mind. It has repeatedly been prepared to accept amendments on particular issues where possible.  The Minister should review the situation concerning the Genealogical Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is welcome in that it transfers current staff from the National Library and the National Museum to the boards that will be appointed.  I am pleased the position of the staff will not be diminished in any way but protected and will, hopefully, be enhanced when the transfer takes place.  We must appreciate the valuable work that everyone concerned <Col N="1874" /> has been doing in their respective areas over the years.</P>
    <P>Until Deputy Higgins took responsibility for this Department the value of that work was not fully appreciated at Government level.  It was the Cinderella of Departments.  The Minister has put this area clearly and definitively on the map.  I hope, in the course of the prebudget discussions and preparation of Estimates the Minister will get the support of his fellow Ministers to provide further funding to develop this important area.</P>
    <P>He proposes to extend the National Museum into Collins Barracks.  That is welcome.  It is extremely important that archives be on constant display and the National Museum does not have the space to display many of its items.  I am delighted with the proposed expansion and I hope that will be a successful development.</P>
    <P>Over the years many important artistic and archaeological works have been stolen.  In recent years some of the old church and monastery ruins particularly on the islands on the River Shannon, in parts of County Clare and along the west of Ireland, have been looted.  That type of behaviour is despicable.  I would love to know who is paying for and seeking these important pieces of our history.</P>
    <P>It is important to provide more protection and to impose restrictions.  The restrictions proposed are commendable and I am delighted the Minister has gone as far as he has to introduce so many.  Criminal gangs have made a play for some of the finest artistic works in the country.  Many of them have been robbed and stored in the most extraordinary places.  Some have been retrieved and some are lost.  Undoubtedly, they will surface at a future date and I hope the National Museum, the art gallery and the Minister's office will be in a financial position to retrieve and secure them.  This Bill provides much of the legal framework necessary to ensure they are retrieved on behalf of the nation.</P>
    <P>It is an extensive Bill and the detail <Col N="1875" /> into which the Minister goes is extraordinary. He gave a fine contribution and outlined the history of the National Museum, the National Library and the Genealogical Office.  He has a clear vision of what he wishes to achieve in his portfolio.  He introduced the National Monuments Act, 1994, a highly commendable Act and he proceeded to bring in the Heritage Act, 1995, which established the Heritage Council.  It is important that the Heritage Council, the National Museum and the National Library work closely because their work is linked.  It is important that good relationships and communications exist between the personnel involved. Equally, it is important that the people charged with the responsibility of taking care of these institutions are sufficiently broad minded and recognise that they belong to the people who should have open access to them.  It is important that the public at large do not feel inhibited about going to the museum, National Library or the National Gallery and do not feel that only certain sections of the public are suitable to go into these institutions. There has been cultural snobbery in this area in the past.  It is extremely important to get rid of that. Everybody has a stake in this.  These institutions belong to the nation and the people should have free access.</P>
    <P>The question as to whether there will be a charge to visit these places is an administrative issue to be decided by the responsible board.  The Minister should ensure there will not be a prohibitive charge for admission to these cultural institutions, particularly in respect of research in the National Library.  As the Minister knows, given his educational background as a political and sociological scholar with extensive university experience it is important to recognise that students do not have money but need to do research work. They should be given free and open access to the various manuscripts and documentation available in the National Library.  I am sure he will ensure that policy will continue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1876" /> This Bill is a pillar in modern legislation. It will bring us into the 21st century. It will guide these cultural institutions in a more positive, responsible and autonomous way to manage their affairs.  I commend the Minister and his staff for drafting and presenting such fine legislation to the House.  I invite him to reflect on the issues I raised during the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1910 Thomas Edison wrote to his nephew that the world had changed dramatically in his lifetime and that the world had never seen such changes as had occurred.  Think back to what he would have seen in 1910.  Six or seven years previously, Marconi had invented the radio.  Only seven years previously the Wright brothers had made their first flight and less than 20 years before, the first motor car had been invented.  He thought the world had never changed as dramatically as in his lifetime.  Those words were almost the exact words used by Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria in 1530 when he wrote to his nephew to the effect that in his lifetime life had changed such as it would never change again.  In his lifetime, the printing press had been invented by Guttenberg, Columbus had sailed the world and discovered it was round, and even more important in effect, Martin Luther had started the Reformation.  The world changes and continues to change so fast.</P>
      <P>While I welcome this legislation, I am disappointed in it.  We do not see reflected in this legislation any awareness of the different world the National Museum and the National Library are moving into.  The role of these institutions will be profoundly affected by what I call &ldquo;the information age&rdquo;.  In effect, they are now beginning to experience competition from other means of disseminating information.  If the National Museum and National Library are to remain relevant to the nation's needs in the 21st century, they must embrace that new situation.  We do not help by structuring them as if the information age did not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1877" /> One way to help them prepare for this new age is to empower them to engage in joint ventures with private sector organisations for commercial gain.  That is not only not provided for in this legislation but it is alien to the ethos of such institutions.  I am delighted to see provision for commercial sponsorship of events and for fund raising. However, my proposal is different.  We are approaching an age in which the value of information and knowledge is becoming recognised as never before. When people value something they are prepared to pay for it.  We are also approaching an age where technology is transforming the way information can be presented.  This is especially true in the heritage area and the Minister competently outlined the efforts to get at the marketplace in that sector.</P>
    <P>Information can now be made to come alive in a way that was never possible. The downside, however, is that these techniques can be extremely expensive.  Nevertheless, they open new commercial opportunities.  In the information age the private sector will increasingly get involved in money making projects in the areas of culture and heritage.  The State institutions should get in on the act, not on their own but in partnership with outsiders who could put up the necessary finance.</P>
    <P>The National Library and the National Museum should always remain resources that are essentially free and open to all citizens who wish to make use of them.  Side by side with that, however, there is room for commercial projects.  We have a choice: we can either leave it entirely to the private sector to cherry pick the profit making opportunities or we can engage the public sector in these opportunities by means of partnership.  The latter course would have two advantages.  The less tangible advantage is that it would engage those institutions in high profile activities that would thrust them to the centre of our national consciousness.  It would put them in the mainstream rather than in a backwater rarely visited except by specialists.  Senator Taylor-Quinn <Col N="1878" /> already spoke of the danger of that happening.</P>
    <P>The more tangible benefit is that joint ventures would create a new income stream for the museum and the library. We should never shirk the responsibility of funding these institutions from public resources.  At the same time we should not shrink from supplementing their income from commercial partnerships to the extent that this is possible.  Scarcity of resources is an issue for these institutions and always has been.  It will become an even bigger issue as technology begins to play a greater role in disseminating knowledge.  We do not need a crystal ball to imagine a scenario in which either or both of these institutions get left behind in the new information age for want of the resources to compete.</P>
    <P>This is particularly so in the case of the National Library.  One need only walk in the doors to see and &mdash; dare I say it &mdash; smell the starvation of resources it has been suffering for decades. It is ironic that we are discussing a grandiose statutory framework for an institution that is dying on its feet for want of money.  The library drew up an ambitious strategic plan several years ago.  Much of that plan has not been implemented because the resources have not come through.  It is clear the National Library is very low on the list of cultural priorities and I do not see anything in the Bill that is likely to change that.  It will remain a low priority.</P>
    <P>Another structural issue deserves to be highlighted.  We seem to deal with our cultural institutions one to one and not as a totality.  That is certainly the case with museums and libraries, although I am delighted with the Minister's reference to Archbishop Marsh's Library and the job Muriel McCarthy does there which is so worthy of praise and congratulations.  I am also delighted with the link the Minister has established with non-State organisations such as the Royal Dublin Society and Royal Irish Academy through appointments to the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1879" /> Both the National Museum and the National Library are overwhelmingly Dublin centred institutions.  We structure them as if nothing else existed. Throughout the country, however, there are dozens of museums of various types and they should be part of a national network of museums; they should be seen as outreach centres of the National Museum.  Perhaps because local libraries are run by local authorities there is a total split between the National Library and ordinary local libraries.  To some extent the two types of libraries carry out different functions.  However, there is an area of potential overlap through which local libraries could become outlets for the national institution.</P>
    <P>In the case of the National Library there is a glaring example of the wasteful split between institutions.  In addition to the National Library, Dublin is the location of Trinity College Library, one of the great libraries of Europe.  The two institutions co-operate as all libraries do.  However, it is ridiculous that institutionally and structurally they should be entirely separate.  Years ago it might have made sense for historical reasons, but it makes no sense now. If the National Library and Trinity College Library came together in some form to create a single national institution &mdash; the thought of anything happening to Trinity College Library will frighten Senator Norris &mdash; they could become one of the greatest libraries not just in Europe but in the world.  They could become a resource not only of great cultural significance but also of practical significance in the information age.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that this Bill misses more opportunities than it addresses. However, this is Second Stage and I congratulate the Minister on the work he has put into it.  Senators must work seriously on it on Committee Stage.  The Minister is open minded and has shown in the past that he is ready and willing to accept amendments, and I believe he will do so in this case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1880" /> The Bill is of great importance in the context of cultural tourism.  We have not even touched the edges of the potential in cultural tourism.  I visited the National Archives recently.  It is a marvellous institution which, under the chairmanship of Hugh O'Flaherty, is achieving a great deal.  It demonstrates the potential in cultural tourism.  That potential is recognised in the Bill but if we are to achieve the legislation's objectives we must examine it in a critical way so that when it passes from this House it will have been amended to give the two institutions the opportunities they seek to enhance and those institutions will have a brighter and more progressive future with its passage.</P>
    <P>I understand that I might be permitted to share time with Senator Norris.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Sherlock) Acting Chairman (Mr. Sherlock)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Sherlock)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand agreement has been reached and that I may call Senator Norris.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for agreeing to share time but we discovered it was technically impossible so I would like to pay tribute to Senator Kelly and Senator Fitzgerald who generously allowed me to jump the queue.  The reason for this is that we are entertaining two distinguished visitors from the Rosenbach Museum Philadelphia, where the largest completed manuscript of Joyce's Ulysses is kept and I think it appropriate that I should be able to see them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill although I have some reservations.  I agree with much of what Senator Quinn said. In particular, concern has been expressed to me by a very distinguished historian Sr. Margaret McCurtain, Chair of the National Library of Ireland Association.  Writing in a personal capacity she says that her concern is about &ldquo;the need for continuing funding by the State of a national library.  It is a service, and unlike other listings in the proposed Bill, is not capable of considerable revenue raising <Col N="1881" /> through fundraising or sales from the shop associated with the institution&rdquo;. That is exactly the point made so effectively by Senator Quinn and I would urge the Minister to consider this and make some provision so that the library can generate additional resources through these means.</P>
    <P>The other matter mentioned by Senator Quinn which interested me was the position of Trinity College Library. I wonder, however, whether a direct merger would be beneficial.  Both of these are copyright libraries so they automatically receive copies of books printed largely within the English speaking world.  It is good that this country has the opportunity to use that resource twice.  Although I am Chair of the Friends of the Library at Trinity, I would welcome any situation where further co-operation between these two great libraries would be ensured.  When I was teaching in Trinity we often had instances where students came from abroad and if materials were not available to them in the library in Trinity, although this was unusual, the National Library could not have been more cooperative in making its resources available and this was reciprocated.</P>
    <P>My hesitation with the Bill relates to the question of the Genealogical Office and the Chief Herald.  There was an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> which indicated that this Bill may be defeated because it appears to abolish the Genealogical Office.  It pointed out that less than a year ago the Minister said &ldquo;the Genealogical Office is not being abolished nor is the work of the office being in any way diminished&rdquo;.  That is not the perspective of a number of people within the genealogical profession and it is clear that section 13 purports, albeit for technical reasons, to abolish the office which is the oldest office of State in the country.</P>
    <P>Desmond Clark, Secretary of the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations, has already expressed deep concern on behalf of his organisation about this.  He said that there has been no call, certainly beyond administrative circles, <Col N="1882" /> for the demise of the oldest national cultural institution on this island.  The Genealogical Office is a symbolic focal point for the Irish diaspora and rather than dissolving it the Bill should be expanding its functions to allow it keep abreast of developments in this area.  He further said that we cannot think that interest in Irish genealogy is on the decline.  In purely monetary terms the Genealogical Office is an important component in the field of heritage tourism.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the significance of cultural tourism and I recall that when the then Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke, visited Ireland there was an exchange of computerised genealogical information.  This was extremely important in developing relations between the countries, exchanges of visits by people looking for their ancestors and the development of cultural tourism in general.  The Genealogical Office is in Kildare Street and there you will find large numbers of people tracing their ancestors.  It is a very important attraction.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of heraldry, it is worth stating information about the origin of heraldry.  I quote from a book called <i>The Poolbeg Book of Irish Heraldry</i> by Micheál Ó Comáin;</P>
    <P>In Ireland we are fond of heraldry. Its graphic appeal is unquestionable but more than that we enjoy it for its association with history.  To an Irishman any historical event is something which only happened the day before yesterday.  It is a country unique in that the conversations overheard in pubs or on the street are as likely to be about national, social or family history as about football or the news of the day.  Even a short walk around Dublin or indeed almost any Irish town will provide examples of familial, corporate, ecclesiastical and territorial coats of arms.  They will be found carved in stone, cast in bronze and iron, worked in stained glass or hand painted wherever fancy may have dictated.  For all that, few people <Col N="1883" /> understand all of heraldry's functions or its full significance, or realise that it is a living, practical discipline that continues to fulfil its ages old purposes. The ability to read a coat of arms may provide access to information about the person who endowed the building on which it is carved, who signed the document to which it is affixed, is commemorated in the arms of an institution which bears his name.  In our own day, to display arms on proper occasions is to create historical records for future enquirers.</P>
    <P>Various Governments have recognised this, for example, in the granting of a coat of arms to President Clinton on his recent visit to Ireland.  This was done in a manner which did not attract much publicity but I understand he accepted it with considerable enthusiasm.  This was an example of the Irish State acknowledging the prominence of this man by granting him an Irish coat of arms.</P>
    <P>Virtually every country in Europe, whether a republic like Switzerland, a former empire like Austria or indeed the United Kingdom which is still a dual monarchy, all have an office parallel to this.  There is even such an office in the new Republic of South Africa.  The office of the Chief Herald of South Africa is down the corridor from the office of President Nelson Mandela.  I would not go as far as to say that whatever is good enough for Nelson Mandela should be good enough for us but it puts it in an interesting and complex background.</P>
    <P>The origin of the word &ldquo;heraldry&rdquo; comes from the German &ldquo;haren&rdquo;, to cry out, and perhaps the Office of the Chief Herald is crying out against extinction at this moment.  Heralds quickly became part of royal establishments.  It was very practical because in battle it was necessary to recognise that you were putting an end to your enemies rather than your friends.  Even in the 14th and 15th centuries there was a phenomenon of friendly fire and for that reason to harm <Col N="1884" /> a herald was regarded as a most serious crime.  So let the Minister beware before he considers harming the Chief Herald of Ireland for one never knows what might befall him even though I wish him no ill as he is a most cultivated man.</P>
    <P>The office itself, although it had been in existence for a century, was officially created in 1552.  I am sure this has already been put on the record but what may not have been mentioned is the actual journal of Edward IV in which this event is recorded.  &ldquo;February 2nd: There was a King of Arms made for Ireland whose name was Ulster and his province was all of Ireland and he was fourth King of Arms and first Herald of Ireland.&rdquo;  That is a significant date because 400 years later on 2 February James Joyce was born.  A revolutionary writer, many would think, but in virtually every book of Joyce's you will find reference to the Office of the Chief Herald or aspects of heraldry.  Stephen Dedalus engages in some controversy with his friend Cranley, the original of whom was George Clancy, the Mayor of Limerick who was murdered by the Black and Tans in 1921.  Cranley says:</P>
    <P>I can't understand you.  One time I hear you talk about English literature, now you talk against Irish informers. What with your name and your ideas, are you Irish at all?</P>
    <P>The response of Stephen Dedalus is &ldquo;Come with me now to the Office of Arms and I will show you the tree of my family&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the brothel episode of Ulysses, the figure of Simon Dedalus, the shaded, wonderful, boozy Corkman, is heard echoing through the brothel:</P>
    <P>Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass.  Head up!  Keep our flag flying !  An eagle gules volant in a filed argent displayed.  Ulster king at arms!</P>
    <P>He was a good Nationalist who when it was neither popular nor profitable, supported the cause of the uncrowned king of Ireland, Charles Stewart Parnell. Interestingly, James Joyce awards to Simon Dedalus the arms of his own <Col N="1885" /> family &mdash; or, at least, the arms which he claimed which may not have been legally his entitlement &mdash; the arms of the Galway Joyces.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that on the third page of Finnegan's Wake the archetypal figure of the Irishman, HCE, Humphrey Chimpton Earwicker, who is Finn MacCool, Adam, Charles Stewart Parnell, Swift and all the rest, is given a coat of arms:</P>
    <P>Of the first was he to bare arms and a name: Wassaily Booslaeugh of Riesengebord. His crest of huroldry, in vert with ancillars, troublant, argent, a hegoak, poursuivant, horrid, horned. His scutschum fessed, with archers strung, helio, of the second.</P>
    <P>That may not be easy to translate, even for a herald, but there are significant elements of heraldry there.</P>
    <P>An article was written in a learned journal, the James Joyce Quarterly, recently about heraldic elements in Finnegan's Wake which led to considerable interest from America.  I was blistered with all kinds of odd items, including something which I thought was a lost page of Finnegan's Wake.  It was an e-mail, which I had not received before, and it looked like a series of typographical errors.  However, I detected some inquires in it of this nature.</P>
    <P>The question of the Genealogical Office is an important one.  I hope the Minister will see his way to not extinguishing this office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that.  The office should be kept separate with appropriate people appointed to it. I would not at all, to continue the Joycean metaphor, cast nasturtiums on anybody who has been involved with the office.  However, a correspondent, who shall remain nameless but who is involved in the area of heraldry, made the following points:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important points to be made are that this is the oldest State <Col N="1886" /> office which has survived both Cromwell and de Valera (Why is it so easy to associate those two names?) [Delicacy prevents me from suggesting any connections which might exist] and is now of greater importance to Irish people everywhere than at any time in the past.  Because of the way the Office has been handled by its most recent incumbent it has grown to become the most important focus for the diaspora.</P>
    <P>That is a tribute to the previous incumbent of this office.  He continues:</P>
    <P>Further, it has until recently been held in the highest regard by other heraldic establishments and should be expanded and enhanced rather than diminished.  How is it possible that an office which excites such interest abroad is barely known at home and is in danger of being reduced to a subcommittee of the Library?  It is a post of such great prestige that it should, at very least, be within the Department of the Taoiseach, and ideally directly answerable to the President.</P>
    <P>Abroad, a visit by the Chief Herald of Ireland is likely to turn out prime ministers to welcome him with flags and drums; here he is largely ignored. If the job is to be handed to an unqualified person, or, worse, a whole board of them, then we are about to lose an important piece of our heritage and put to loss the huge amount of invaluable ambassadorial work which has been done by Donal F. Begley and his deputy.</P>
    <P>It seems important to me that such people should be qualified.  I understand there is a highly qualified deputy.  It would be unfair to mention this person since he has not been in contact with me.  However, I hear from all sources that he is extraordinarily qualified in this rather remote area of learning.  Perhaps, it would be possible to ensure that somebody of that qualification will be involved.  It is extremely important that this office is continued and the difficulties <Col N="1887" /> some of us have with the Bill should be ironed out at an early stage.</P>
    <P>I read the Minister's speech with great interest.  He referred to the measures in the Bill which will enable the National Library and the National Museum to develop, sustain and foster their collections.  He mentioned the National Gallery and the Botanical Gardens. He also paid a very gracious tribute to the Royal Dublin Society, which I suppose is another anachronism. However, it would be a pity to remove it in the same way it would be a pity to remove the Genealogical Office, although the Minister has given an undertaking that apparently this will not happen.  All these bodies, however regrettable some aspects of domination were, are part of our history.  In Helsinki in Finland a couple of years ago I watched with great interest the way in which they preserved relics of Tsarist rule, although they disapproved very strongly of them.</P>
    <P>The RDS was one of the most valuable contributions of the former ascendancy. We are meeting today in a building which was preserved because the RDS took it over as its headquarters.  It was a remarkable cultural complex.  This building comprised its meeting and reading rooms.  It then created four institutions surrounding this central hub &mdash;the National Library, the National Gallery, the Natural History Museum and the National Museum.  These were transferred to the ownership of the State.  It was an act of considerable foresight on the part of the RDS to create those institutions.  It was also instrumental in creating the Botanical Gardens in Glasnevin, so we have reason to be grateful to it.</P>
    <P>Those institutions also have some reason to be grateful to this House.  I raised a matter on the Adjournment when the Botanical Gardens were in difficulty with the wonderful Turner greenhouses at precisely the time that the then Government, of which this Minister was not a member, printed a stamp for European architectural heritage <Col N="1888" /> year portraying the Turner greenhouses, although they were falling to pieces.  As a result of the pressure of that Adjournment debate, among others, considerable sums of money were made available and those unique buildings were beautifully restored by Irish craftspeople.</P>
    <P>I then raised an Adjournment matter on the National Gallery.  I was taken around the gallery by the then subdirector, Mr. Keaveney, who is now the director, and I was able to put my hand into the open atmosphere.  Paintings were literally melting off the walls. Another sum of money was made available and the Minister of the day said on his way out of the Chamber that he was not coming to the Seanad again for an Adjournment debate in which I was involved because it was too damn expensive.  We were pushing an open door.</P>
    <P>It is important to pay tribute to groups such as the RDS.  In common with most people, I have one foot in the bog.  The particular bog in which I have my foot used to be called Queen's County and is now Laois.  I am glad to say that Thomas Pryor, who founded the RDS in the 1740s, was a good Laois man.</P>
    <P>This is not directly relevant to the Bill, but I congratulate the Minister on the development of Teilifís na Gaeilge. Among other matters, our language is part of our national heritage.  If we are not prepared to spend the money involved to allow people whose first language is Irish to receive programmes in this modern medium in the areas in which they live, we might as well not bother at all.</P>
    <P>In his wide ranging speech the Minister spoke about the kinds of material it is important to preserve, including items which might appear to be ephemeral, such as a letter by a servant girl applying for a job.  I wish to pay tribute, as I know the Minister has done in the past, to the wonderful work done in the famine museum in Strokestown.  It is not narrow or sectional in its interest but tells a full story.  That work was done by a <Col N="1889" /> local garage owner, Jim Calleary, and a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, Luke Dodd.  I was there on the opening day and after the bun fight we were taken around the house.</P>
    <P>I wandered up to the top rooms where, in the bedroom of Olive Packenham-Mahon, there was a woman rooting around and trying on Olive Packenham-Mahon's shoes.  She turned to me and said with great relish: &ldquo;Isn't it great, we to be here inside and they to be gone to hell out of it&rdquo;.  That was not the point of a famine museum but I could understand the gusto with which she tried on the shoes in the context of one strand in the history of the Packenham-Mahon's involving the clearance of their estate.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute not only to the RDS and the staff of the National Library and the National Museum with whom I have worked over many years but also to the Government Publications Office which makes accessible to the public the records of these institutions.  We undervalue what it does.  I often buy books there, most recently a &ldquo;History of Gardening&rdquo; by Patrick Bowe and somebody else, an archaeological register of County Laois and a book on wildlife and plant life in the Phoenix Park. These are remarkably well produced, cheap and informative books.  We are lucky to have people working in our public service who commission these works and who co-operate with the experts who may not come from within the service to produce this material.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the transfer of collections by private owners into the keeping of the National Library.  That is important and should be strictly controlled. I recall my dismay when some years ago a deposit of letters left by Paul Leon, in the keeping of the National Library, were made available to the public.  At that point Joyce's grandson, Stephen Joyce, intervened and claimed some letters which he, as he gloatingly suggested, destroyed.  That is not proper conduct.  I felt great sympathy for the library and I hope provisions in this Bill will ensure something similar could not <Col N="1890" /> happen again.  It is an outrageous flaunting of the spirit of James Joyce who wanted everything on the record and who scandalised people by so doing.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the Chief Herald.  He mentioned Sir Neville Wilkinson who I believe was the last Chief Herald.  I tie this in with the question of collections going abroad because, among other things &mdash; the Minister will correct me if I wrong &mdash; Neville Wilkinson made Titiania's Palace, an enormous doll's house of extraordinary delicacy and perfection.  I saw this stunning doll's house as a child when it was in Rathdrum, County Wicklow.  Unfortunately it was sold and went abroad to England.  What a tourist draw that could have been.</P>
    <P>Matt McNulty, that hard headed man who is such a realist and who has done a great deal, had another doll's house called Gráinne's Palace in the Writer's Museum in Parnell Square.  It is a modern house which is beautifully made but it is not of the same scale or delicacy as Titiania's Palace.  I regret that we missed the opportunity to retain that beautiful work of art.</P>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;As a central part of the agreements the Oireachtas is being asked, through this Bill, to approve that the Royal Irish Academy and Royal Dublin Society be given the right to make a list of nominations to the new boards from which the Minister would choose a number to serve in a personal capacity.&rdquo;  I approve of that provision.  Since we are talking about the Royal Irish Academy, I would like to mention a curious fact.</P>
    <P>Recently a committee chaired by Deputy Jim Mitchell recommended the abolition of the University seats in the light of democracy and so on.  Who is he fooling?  At least I am elected by a constituency of 30,000 graduates which is more than can be said for virtually anybody else in the House, except my five University colleagues.  I am not casting aspersions on my other colleagues. If they want to raise the spectre of democracy, I would be glad to take it up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1891" /> The Royal Irish Academy is given the right to make a list of nominations but if it is as effective as the right to nominate Members of the Seanad, it will not get very far.  I recall the occasion when the President of the Royal Irish Academy was nominated by that body for election to the Seanad but he did not get any votes.  That says a lot about the level of democracy which exists in the constituencies from which some of my valued and delightful colleagues managed to get elected.  I assure Members it is not because any of them are head of the Royal Irish Academy.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the importance of exhibitions and I agree with him 100 per cent in this regard.  They explain our history, circumstances, culture and ambience and they are an effective tool in getting things done.  When we were trying to rescue North Great George's Street we got a grant of £2,000 from a heritage group chaired by Louis Clohessy which was entirely spent on an exhibition of what was happening on the street.  It included photographs which were properly lit and mounted and clearly explained the history and importance of the street.  I believe that exhibition helped us to turn the corner in persuading Ministers and members of Dublin City Council to appreciate the need to save that beautiful street.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in this Bill for insurance and legal indemnity which is unfortunately necessary.  The Minister will recall the amusement and horror we felt when the terracotta army was resident in the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham and when a light fell from the ceiling and smashed one of the pieces; artifacts which had survived for 5,000 years came to Ireland to be done in. Although I am being extremely parochial, I am glad that talent existed in North Great George's Street to advise on the restoration.  My friend Desiree Short was able to provide expert advice and guidance.</P>
    <P>I am glad the question of heritage collections is being considered.  People like Matt McNulty have operated efficiently <Col N="1892" /> in preserving not only Malahide Castle and Newbridge House but they have preserved the collections which continue to be kept there.  The collection of furniture in Malahide Castle left the country but the Cobbs at Newbridge House came to an arrangement where the material was kept.  The Minister spoke about licences for works of art leaving the country, which is extremely important and which was not the case previously.  When important works of art and furniture are exported under licence a photographic record should be kept so that we will know what is gone and its importance.  I would like to believe important works will be kept here because they have a particular importance and significance when viewed in their own context.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the film archive.  We were lucky to have people like Ciaran Hickey and the late Liam O'Leary who created the film archive being cherished in the National Library which held a fine exhibition of that material.  It is good that it is not being left entirely to the enthusiastic efforts of individuals.  The Minister spoke about derating certain cultural institutions, something close to my heart.  Why, for example, is Trinity College not derated? Perhaps the Minister might raise that question with his colleagues.  It is important that such cultural institutions are derated.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for meeting myself and representatives of the RIA and Trinity College about the national endowment of the arts which is in concert with this well thought out Bill.  I am happy to commend the Bill to the House with the reservations which I expressed about the Office of the Chief Herald.  I am glad the Minister was here for my little introduction to Joyce.  I am sure he will be sympathetic to that magical coincidence of the date &mdash; 2 February &mdash; when the Ulster King of Arms was created and James Joyce was born. I thank my colleagues for their indulgence in kindly allowing me to skip the queue to speak in this debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  Molaim go mór an obair atá á dhéanamh aige sa Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltacht.  Bille an-spéisiúil is ea an Bille seo.  Neartaíonn sé ArdMhúsaem na hÉireann agus Leabharlann Náisiúnta na hÉireann agus tugann sé cumhacht nua dóibh.</P>
      <P>Cad is músaem nó leabharlann ann? What is a museum or a library?  They are not mere warehouses for the storage of valuable goods or books.  Items from our past cannot be seen in splendid isolation but must be viewed in such a way that this generation, can judge our progression from the past to the present and judge our way into the future.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>For how can one measure accomplishment, or the quality, health and well-being of a people, if there is insufficient or inaccessible record of the past with which to make comparison?  How can progression of a people be justly measured, if the past has not been recorded for retrieval?</P>
      <P>It is in the light of those sentiments that I welcome the Bill today.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to establish autonomous boards to manage and care for collections in the National Museum and National Library, to establish a statutory indemnity scheme to permit exhibitions of international calibre to be held in Ireland on a regular basis, to enable of the National Museum and National Library to develop their collection and to facilitate study within their buildings.  In other words, the Bill gives the National Museum and National Library the legal and administrative structure they have lacked to date and brings us into line with what is happening in countries which have this legal and administrative basis for their cultural institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the lack of this legal and administrative structure, the National Museum and the National Library have been left to stagnate. Funding has been neglected in many cases and they have been trying to make <Col N="1894" /> ends meet with their resources.  We can build our future only if we cherish and care for our past.</P>
    <P>Knowing about the daily lives of our ancestors is as important as knowing the key dates and events in our history because, in many ways, knowing what daily life was like puts flesh on the skeleton of our history.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 are important. Section 11 states:</P>
    <P>(1)  The principal functions of the Board of the Museum shall be to maintain, manage, control, protect, preserve, record, research and enlarge the collection of museum heritage objects of the Board for the benefit of the public and to increase and diffuse in and outside the State knowledge of human life in Ireland, of the natural history of Ireland and of the relations of Ireland in these respects with other countries.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Board shall have all such powers as it considers necessary or expedient for the performance of its functions under this Act including, but without prejudice to the foregoing, the following powers:</P>
    <P>These powers are very extensive.</P>
    <P>Section 11(2) continues:</P>
    <P>(a)  to conserve and restore the museum heritage objects in its collection,</P>
    <P>(b)  to arrange or provide for the display of museum heritage objects in its collection.</P>
    <P>It was a national scandal that so many pieces of our heritage lay almost moulding and rotting in warehouses because the museum did not have space or finance to put them on display.  If this Bill commands the museum to do something about it, a similar situation will not arise again.</P>
    <P>I hope in providing for the display of heritage objects the National Museum will take the trouble to build up a number of regional museums.  One is not needed in every small village or hamlet but we need museums which pertain to <Col N="1895" /> the life of those areas.  Pieces of national heritage importance which would be of relevance to a particular area should, from time to time, be shown to the people of that area.</P>
    <P>We took a group of French visitors to the museum one day with a man and his wife from Ardagh, the home of the Ardagh Chalice which is three miles from my home town of Newcastle West.  It gave us great pleasure to show the French that we were a cultured people. The craftsmanship of the Ardagh Chalice was something of which we could be proud.  However, the man from Ardagh had not seen the chalice &mdash; he had to come to Dublin to see it.  A regional museum which would allow such exhibits to be seen would be very important.</P>
    <P>Section 11(2) continues:</P>
    <P>(c)  to organise or arrange for the organisation of temporary exhibitions (within or outside the State) of museum heritage objects from its collection,</P>
    <P>(d)  to lend, subject to the provisions of this Act, museum heritage objects in its collection,</P>
    <P>(e)  to promote research and scholarship,</P>
    <P>(f)  to disseminate and promote the dissemination of literature and information relating to its collection,</P>
    <P>Many fine semi-public institutions which have museums should be allowed swap pieces with the National Museum. This is very important because each heritage object has as story.  There is research and scholarship to be undertaken and what better place to do it than within the confines of the National Museum?</P>
    <P>However, there is little point having pieces in our collection if we do not catalogue and promote them and allow young people particularly to have an appreciation of what is involved and the work that has gone into making these objects before they visit the museum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1896" /> Section 11(2) continues:</P>
    <P>(g)  to foster and promote contacts with other museums and educational establishments,</P>
    <P>(h)  to participate and promote participation in international collaborative heritage projects and, where appropriate, to enter into agreements, subject to the consent of the Minister, with comparable bodies outside the State,</P>
    <P>Many national events relate to events which took place outside the State. Recently important items which relate to &ldquo;the Wild Geese&rdquo; have been catalogued. Their importance to Irish history is only echoed by their subsequent importance in European events of the time.  To echo what I said earlier, we do not live in splendid isolation.  We need to know what is going on internationally. We have a voice which needs to be heard in international affairs.</P>
    <P>Section 11(2) continues:</P>
    <P>(i)  to engage in international activities concerning museum curatorship and other related matters including, where appropriate, representation of the State at conferences, meetings and seminars,</P>
    <P>(j)  to enter into agreements with other museums and cultural bodies in the State,</P>
    <P>(k)  to foster and promote the Museum as an integral part of the national culture,</P>

    <P>(n)  to compile, publish and distribute (with or without charge) books, magazines, journals, reports or other printed matter, including aural and visual material as may be appropriate in relation to any matter connected with the functions or activities of the Board,</P>
    <P>...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1897" /> Senator Quinn's contribution can best be viewed in the context of this section.</P>
    <P>Consideration could be given to his view that provision should be made to allow collaboration between private individuals or companies and the National Museum.  This would represent a broadening of the museum's role.  I would be the last to suggest that the museum should become the plaything of organisations such as the Heinz Corporation. However, there is scope for an interchange of views between private companies and the museum on how their aims can dovetail and how the dissemination of information can be brought to the fore.</P>
    <P>Subsection 2(o) makes provision &ldquo;to produce or arrange for the production of replicas of museum heritage objects in its collection or of souvenirs&rdquo;.  The museum could reap a great economic benefit in this regard because many people appreciate the objects they admired in the museum and would further appreciate being able to purchase a replica of such objects.  This would promote tourist visits to the museum and would also help to show off our heritage.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in subsection 2(p) to:</P>
    <P>arrange for the sale of material relating to the collection of replicas of museum heritage objects or of souvenirs or other goods,</P>
    <P>and in paragraph (q) to:</P>
    <P>engage in such activities for the purpose of raising funds for the Museum as it thinks appropriate.</P>
    <P>That long list of powers is the most important part of the Bill because it gives the museum a basis on which to work and enables it to move forward into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>It is a shame that we have waited so long for this Bill.  The National Museum was founded in the Victorian era and we have waited until now to make it our own and bring it into the 20th century. That is a scandal.  I thank the Minister for having the courage to gather these <Col N="1898" /> powers together and introduce a Bill that will have teeth.  The museum now has a good basis on which to work and the National Library will also be conferred with many similar powers.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the Chief Herald, we have wasted much time discussing a matter which represents only a small part of the Bill.  I state this in the knowledge that I live in the same county as the last holder of the office of Chief Herald.  I presume he researched the genealogy of his family; if he did, he will have discovered that we are distant cousins.  However, I do not know if that is a recommendation for either of us.  It is unfortunate that the first line of section 13 reads as it does.  The wording probably gives the impression that the Genealogical Office is being scrapped. There is much confusion regarding heraldry and genealogy which are separate, though interrelated, functions of the office.  Anyone who has attempted to trace their family tree is aware that one requires a vast array of resources to obtain the relevant information, unless one's family name is listed in &ldquo;Burke's Peerage&rdquo;.  The common or garden peasants of Ireland must consult parish records, estate papers and, if one is a landowner, one's family may be listed in &ldquo;Griffith's Valuation&rdquo;.  The information is scattered about in various locations.  I am glad this responsibility will become an integral part of the National Library. Much of the material needed to trace one's family tree must be accessed from many different sources.  The library has the best facility for accessing such sources because they are not held in one location.</P>
    <P>Section 13 makes it clear that the Genealogical Office will remain separate to the National Library while being included under its administration. Therefore, the office will have the facilities of the library at its disposal and will be able to access material from other libraries and private sources such as estate papers.  That was, perhaps, not always the case.  This represents a strengthening rather than a dilution of the Office of the Chief Herald.  The Bill <Col N="1899" /> gives a great deal of power to the National Library and the National Museum which they did not have heretofore. The provision of indemnity, for example, will now permit them to hold exhibitions.</P>
    <P>Some interesting powers are conferred in Part VII of the Bill.  These include the reference to Marsh's Library and the exemption from rates in section 63.  It appears that the pieces of the jigsaw are beginning to fall into place because, in section 66, the Heritage Council is being dovetailed into the National Library and the National Museum.  Section 68 provides for the Office of Public Works to maintain the buildings of the library and the museum. These sections represent a knitting together of our cultural institutions.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a positive debate on Committee Stage.  I ask that Members do not become obsessed with the issue of the Chief Herald because there are matters of greater importance and relevance to the people.  I thank the Minister for the work he has done on our behalf in the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht; it is appreciated.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille.  Tá deacraíochtaí agam le cuid de ach bhí argóint againn mar gheall air sin le déanaí.</P>
      <P>I have doubts about certain sections of the Bill.  However, these can be teased out in detail on Committee Stage.  The Bill is a welcome development and not one Member raised a dissenting voice during earlier contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an unbelievable wealth of material in Ireland.  The richness of our cultural heritage includes books from bygone days to the present and many other items which have been preserved. No Government has ever given funding to the institutions mentioned in the Bill, including the Genealogical Office, the <Col N="1900" /> National Museum and the National Library.</P>
    <P>Based on my holiday experiences in other countries I would put some blame on Bord Fáilte and tour operators. When I am abroad I like to browse in the museums.  Usually there is an indication of the tours one can take.  I was in Crete recently and we got a leaflet under the door telling us that we could visit the palace in Knossos or the museum in Heraklion.  One could spend days in that museum even though their culture is different.  I was amazed that at the end of the season there were still queues at the museum.  I do not see similar queues at the National Library or the National Museum nor do I see 20 or 30 tour coaches outside of them.  Such a development might provide much needed money for the museum and the library.</P>
    <P>It may be superfluous to say there should be a special provision in this Bill to ensure that the Irish language will be protected.  I like the Irish language to be put in a prime position because it is the foundation of our culture.</P>
    <P>An cuimhin leis an Aire timpeall cúig nó sé bliain ó shin nuair a bhíos im' Chathaoirleach ar Chomhchoiste Gaeilge an Oireachtais agus ba eisean an Leas-Cathaoirleach?  Chuamar ar turas go dtí an Leabharlann Náisiúnta chun féachaint ar an bhfoclóir a scríobh Seán an Chóta Ó Caoimheán ó Dhún Chaoin. Bhí sé láimhscríobhtha aige.  Is cuimhin liom nuair a chuamar isteach agus d'oscail mé an chéad leathanach.  Bhí seanfhocal ann sa sean-Ghaeilge, &ldquo;Éist le fuaim na habhann agus gheobhair breac&rdquo;.  Níor chuala mé é sin riamh ach bhí sé go hiontach.</P>
    <P>Bhí sé ar intinn agam an scríobhnóireacht san a chur ar ríomhaire.  Chuala mé le déanaí go raibh rud déanta mar gheall ar sin ach, i ndeireadh na dála, ba mhaith liom dá gcuirfeadh an tAire Airgeadais airgead ar fáil chun an leabhar sin a fhoilsiú i gceart mar tá a lán ann.  Chosnódh sé a lán airgid ach tá sé ann le 50 bliain agus tá a lán rudaí caillte scríobtha ann.  Cuirfidh me glaoch ar an Aire inniu a dhícheall a dhéanamh chun <Col N="1901" /> an t-airgead a chur ar fáil chun an foclóir sin a fhoilsiú.</P>
    <P>The proverb I mentioned was &ldquo;Éist le fuaim na habhann agus gheobhair breac&rdquo; which translates as &ldquo;if you listen to the mood of the river, you will get a trout&rdquo;.  That expresses more than just a fisherman's view.  I have been listening to the Minister's mood to find out if he will make moneys available to publish what Seán an Chóta wrote many years ago.  There is always a céad míle fáilte for the Minister in the Gaeltachtaí, but if he did that there would be a special céad míle fáilte for him.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago a taxi man asked me if I knew where in Dublin I would find two monkeys playing billiards. Although I did not realise it at the time he was referring to carvings on the outside of the Genealogical Office, reproduced in a recent newspaper article.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Genealogical Office is almost self-financing.  It could become very profitable.  The Bill refers to copyright.  I have often wondered if the coats of arms produced by the herald are subject to copyright.  One sees them regularly in tourist areas.  Is there a strict copyright on the coats of arms?</P>
    <P>About two years ago many people around the country received a letter from a group in Dublin who would produce a book giving one's family history.  It was something of a joke because nearly the same information was given in every book with small sections on one's family history.  I did not buy it but I saw a book that another Fitzgerald family member bought and it was far from my family history.  The crests are reproduced in the book.  I wondered if copyright applies to the crests and other artefacts in the care of the National Museum which may be copied by jewellers, for example.  I do not mind helping out native industry but I would be worried that the Irish market might be flooded by foreign companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1902" /> It would appear that the Genealogical Office is to be downgraded.  The Bill states:</P>
    <P>(3)  The Board shall, from time to time as occasion requires, designate a member of its staff to perform the duty of researching, granting and confirming coats of arms....</P>
    <P>Why should it be from time to time? Why not leave it as is so that staff now there will be there in the future to maintain continuity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Government decided on 8 October to move a motion in both Houses of the Oireachtas establishing a tribunal of inquiry into the hepatitis C infection of blood and blood products manufactured and distributed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  On 15 October I announced details of the proposed terms of reference of the tribunal determined by the Government and these are set out in the motion I have now introduced.  Whereas the Dáil had an opportunity to discuss at some length all the issues which form the background to the setting up of the tribunal, prior to my introducing the motion there earlier today, I have not had the opportunity of discussing the issues in this House.  I therefore propose before commenting on the terms of the motion to address certain criticisms which have been made of my handling of this whole matter and to outline briefly the steps I have taken to ensure continuing confidence in the adequacy and safety of our blood supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1906" /> Much of the recent criticism to which I have been subjected has centred on the State's handling of the High Court case taken on behalf of the late Mrs. McCole.  It seems to me that, at the heart of the attacks is a refusal by my opponents, especially in the Dáil, to recognise the statutory independence of the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the adversarial nature of our courts. The State has taken great care to provide an alternative to the courts for those seeking compensation and it has also, particularly in the Chief State Solicitor's letter of 21 July 1995, addressed to the solicitors for Positive Action, set out very clearly the State's legal position in relation to the defence and Court cases taken by persons seeking redress through that route.  I cannot change the way in which court cases are conducted: that is a matter outside my influence and I would ask no more than the acceptance of that simple fact by those who object to how cases are dealt within our judicial system.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised in relation to a letter which issued from the Chief State Solicitor on 21 July 1995 which set out the State's legal position on the legal cases in question.  Contrary to what has been alleged, the letter did not issue to the late Mrs. McCole but to the solicitors of Positive Action, who are also Mrs. McCole's solicitors.  It was not a letter to Mrs. McCole.</P>
    <P>The refusal to admit liability on behalf of the State has been a major accusation against me.  My role and responsibilities in relation to the BTSB are governed by the provisions of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, and the assumptions on which it is based; the terms and intent of the relevant establishment order; and the accepted conventions of our public service regarding the responsibilities of Ministers and their Departments in relation to executive agencies under their control.  The Health (Corporate Bodies) Act was intended to provide the Minister with a legally efficient means of establishing a body which would discharge a specialist executive function, <Col N="1907" /> under the governance of a suitably constituted board; would be likely to discharge that function more appropriately and expertly than could be done from within the Department; would be a centre of expertise, and would have a large measure of autonomy in the discharge of its task, subject to the controls set down in the relevant establishment order, mainly in relation to personnel, finance and audit matters.  The model relies heavily upon the professional competence and integrity of the specialist staff employed in agencies such as the BTSB, and the general competence of boards to exercise their role, to identify and address potential problems and to bring those they cannot address to notice in a timely fashion.</P>
    <P>It would not, therefore, be either appropriate or viable for me and my Department to separately engage the expertise to enable me to question the minutiae of the operations of bodies under my aegis.  Neither would it be appropriate for me to issue directives to the body on the conduct of its business, including the defence of cases taken against it in the courts.  The BTSB is a separate legal entity: in this instance, the case against it is different in content and range from the case against the NDAB and the case against me as Minister for Health.  I did not at any stage attempt to direct the BTSB or the NDAB, now the Irish Medicines Board, in the decisions they took in defending any of the court cases taken against them.  It would be totally improper for one defendant to compel another defendant to take any particular course of action in its conduct of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised for not admitting liability on behalf of the State, as if it and the BTSB were one and the same entity, with the same case to answer. The interest being defended by two parties is not identical.  Let me explain in very plain terms what admitting liability on behalf of the State would mean.  I am being criticised and accused of drawing nebulous distinctions because I will not accept liability on behalf of all Ministers <Col N="1908" /> and all officers of the Department who dealt with the BTSB over the years.  If I were to do so, I would act against all available legal advice and, indeed, against my judgment of the state of affairs.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable hurt and resentment expressed about the State contesting the late Mrs. McCole's request for anonymity in pleading her case.  I fully understand and appreciate these feelings but I have to point out that the courts must operate in accordance with the law, even in the most heartbreaking circumstances.</P>
    <P>In relation to the late Mrs. McCole's application to prosecute her claim using a fictitious name, I would like to inform the House that on 22 September 1995 Mrs. McCole's counsel were told that while the confidentiality of her medical condition and other intimate matters would be maintained by the State parties, as a matter of constitutional law their client could not proceed under an assumed identity.  This was confirmed in subsequent correspondence.  Her counsel and solicitors took a different view and ultimately Mrs. McCole brought a motion before the High Court seeking a ruling on the point.  The application in this regard was decided on 14 February 1996 by Ms Justice Laffoy who dismissed it.  The court in its judgment stated it had no jurisdiction to allow the plaintiff prosecute her proceedings using a fictitious name, and to do so would contravene Article 34(1) of the Constitution which requires justice to be administered in public.  The Attorney General is, like anyone else, bound by the provisions of the Constitution.  It is not open to him to ignore the explicit provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism of the State opposing an early hearing in the late Mrs. McCole's case for tactical reasons, or at least that is the allegation. The plaintiff's initial application for an early hearing was withdrawn by her lawyers and when it was ultimately reentered on 26 April 1996 it was pointed out that the case would not be ready for trial in June as the plaintiff's lawyers <Col N="1909" /> requested, and the President of the High Court adjudged it should proceed on 8 October 1996.  The President of the High Court said that in exceptional circumstances the court will give priority to cases and fix an early trial date but that this power must be exercised sparingly as it affects other litigants.  The judge also stated that the defendants had met the plaintiffs claim fairly and stated they would be in a position to go ahead in October.  The Judge added that the rights of both parties have to be weighed and considered it relevant that should her condition deteriorate, the Compensation Tribunal was available to her.  Thus the date of 8 October permitted her case to be listed in advance of thousands of other waiting litigants who did not have recourse to a Compensation Tribunal but also enabled her lawyers to amend her claim substantially.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to one item of discovery in the McCole case and to the allegations that both the Minister of State, Deputy Brian O'Shea, and I misled the Dáil when asked to comment when this item of discovery was made public by the solicitor for the plaintiff.  I will circulate what I said in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I did not argue as to the culpability or otherwise of the BTSB in respect of these events.  It would be totally improper for me to do so.  I am informing the House that I based my view, when I issued the statement in support of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian O'Shea, on the report of the expert group.  I believe a letter subsequently on 27 May 1996 from Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien to Deputy Séamus Pattison, Chairman of the Select Committee on Social Affairs, supports my position.  I have included it for the information of Senators, but will not read it into the record.</P>
    <P>A major priority at all times when items such as the safety of blood or blood products are in question is to ensure that there is confidence in the blood supply.  The House will appreciate the central importance of our blood supply to the daily workings of our acute <Col N="1910" /> hospital services.  At any one time we have only a three day supply of blood to meet the demand for blood in our health services.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the action I took in April 1995 in assigning Professor Shaun McCann and Mr. Liam Dunbar to the medical and administrative posts at the BTSB was correct.  The urgent need to take steps such as management restructuring to restore confidence in the BTSB as a means of ensuring continuity in blood supplies did not allow for any avoidable delay in vacating the post of chief medical consultant.  Given the terms of Dr. Walsh's contract of employment, any alternative to voluntary early retirement would not have produced an outcome for many months, if not years.</P>
    <P>I am also convinced that the approval I gave to a major consultancy project at the BTSB undertaken by Bain and Company, which had worldwide experience in the area, was the correct decision.  The consultants' report was published in May 1995 and the recommendations made complemented those in chapter four of the expert group report concerning the organisation and management of the BTSB.</P>
    <P>The main objective of the board and the central direction of the recommendations in the two reports on the development of the BTSB as the national centre of excellence in transfusion medicine and laboratory science are in line with best international practice. The achievement of this objective and the making available of blood and blood components to the highest standards of safety and efficacy is being pursued with diligence by the board.  While the complete implementation of all the recommendations contained in both reports will take some time, significant progress has already been made by the board and the new management over the last year.  Strategically, the board has redefined its role and function and its contribution to the development of health care services on the lines recommended in the two reports.</P>
    <P>Both reports identified the management of the BTSB as the major priority <Col N="1911" /> requiring urgent and significant attention. The appointment of a chief executive officer as the sole executive head of the organisation addresses the most important management recommendation in the reports.  The chief executive officer leads the entire organisation and, in association with the medical director and senior manager, has addressed many of the other critical management problems identified.  Significant progress has been made in defining authority, improving reporting relationships, facilitating the input of staff into the decision making process, and in improving communications within the entire organisation.</P>
    <P>To support further progress in these areas the medical, scientific and finance sub-committees have been reconstituted. The participation of the chief executive officer in the medical and finance committees has ensured effective decision making at executive level and that the board is fully informed of the emerging policy and procedural changes.</P>
    <P>A clearer focus is in place concerning the business and cost efficiency aspects of the board.  Improvements have also been realised, particularly in contract negotiations and the supplies function.</P>
    <P>As well as co-ordinating the consultant medical resources of the board, the medical director provides expert clinical advice to the board and to the organisation encompassing all clinical matters relevant to the operation of a transfusion centre and such clinical matters as referred to in both reports.  An ongoing review of all aspects of the organisation's procedures and processes including donor and patient care, blood collections, laboratory processing and testing has been established.</P>
    <P>The following developments have taken place: the revision and introduction of guidelines for donor selection; negotiating formal arrangements with a major hospital for microbiological and virology support for the organisation; introduction of revised standard operating procedures for blood collection, <Col N="1912" /> processing and storage; introduction of new technology to improve temperature monitoring of all aspects of blood and blood component storage; introduction of bar coding of blood and blood components to log such products from collection to dispatch; appointment of medical consultants to sessional commitments at major hospitals; clinical roles and sub-speciality interests of the consultants medical staff are being agreed; the interface between medical consultants and the various functions of the BTSB has been redefined and will be further substantially improved when sub-speciality interests are finalised; the appointment of additional specialist consultants with particular interest in transfusion medicine is currently being pursued; and the board is establishing a research and development fund.  Proposals for research projects have been sought from professional interests and an interdisciplinary group has been established to review proposals.</P>
    <P>It is against the background of these and many other factors that I decided to recommend the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry to the Government. This decision has been represented as a <i>volte face</i>, out of line with the positions I had previously taken.  This is not the case.  I could not accept the need for an inquiry as long as there was a prospect that the contested issues would be the subject of a judicial determination in the High Court.  Once it became obvious that this was unlikely in the foreseeable future, I came to the view that an inquiry was the only way of putting the facts beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>There is a particular point I want to clarify before this House.  Deputy Mary Harney contested something I said in the Lower House.  I referred to the fact that High Court proceedings were fixed for 8 October 1996 and that such proceedings would be a judicial examination and determination of this matter. I couched my language in different terms in the Seanad.  The reason I did so was that I received a letter from the solicitors for the plaintiff.  Senators can see for themselves the relevant part <Col N="1913" /> which I quote for their information.  In effect, I received a solicitor's letter saying there was an objection to the way I had said something in the Dáil, so I said it differently in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a tribunal of inquiry is the ultimate mechanism available to the Dáil and Seanad to establish the full truth surrounding any matter of major public concern.  It is not a power that is lightly used.  Indeed, this is only the sixth occasion since 1975 that this procedure has been invoked.  A tribunal of inquiry established under the Act has the same powers, rights and privileges as are vested in the High Court or a judge of the High Court.  These include the compelling of witnesses to attend and the production of documents before it.  It is an offence to disobey a summons to appear as a witness, not to produce documents requested by it, or to obstruct or hinder the tribunal in its functions.  Persons found guilty of an offence under the relevant Acts are liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or up to two years imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>The hearings of the tribunal must be in public unless the tribunal considers that it is in the public interest to refuse to allow the public or any portion of it to be present for reasons connected with the subject matter of the inquiry or the nature of the evidence.</P>
    <P>There has been a general welcome for the Government's decision to establish the tribunal.  Despite the costs involved it would appear that because the infection of blood and blood products is such a major scandal and because there is a need to use all available means to establish the full facts of what happened, there is an acceptance that on this occasion a tribunal is the right mechanism. The establishment of the truth is obviously of most importance to those whose health has been affected by the infection of the blood and blood products. I accept that for them this is probably the single most important expectation that they have of the Government and Members of the House.  It is also of considerable importance to the well <Col N="1914" /> being of the democratic system that we can be seen to address the critical issues of accountability and responsibility through the systems available to us.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the terms of reference, the Government's objectives might be summarised as follows: to enable the tribunal to address fully all the relevant matters of serious public concern; to ensure clarity in relation to the boundaries of the task to be undertaken by the tribunal; and to enable the tribunal to conduct its task as effectively and efficiently as possible consistent with a fair examination of all matters referred to it.</P>
    <P>Senators will have noted that the terms of reference are quite detailed and extensive in contrast with shorter and more general terms which have characterised other inquiries.  This is designed to balance comprehensiveness with clarity and to assist the tribunal in containing the task to those matters which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>However, Members will also note that provision is being made to allow the tribunal in its interim report to draw the Minister's attention to any matter relating to the terms of reference which it considers needs to be addressed.  The inquiry will start with a considerable advantage.  It will have the report of the expert group, so ably chaired by Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien, which was published in April 1995.  It will also have full access to all the documents discovered in preparation for the recent High Court case taken by the late Mrs. McCole.  This represents a significant proportion of the work which might otherwise have to be undertaken by the tribunal.  It can rely on the full co-operation of my Department and all other bodies under my aegis in undertaking the further researches its work will involve and in gathering the testimony necessary to complete its task.  Indeed, the terms of reference as amended by the Government following this morning's debate in the Dáil now incorporate a specific direction on full co-operation.</P>
    <P>The tribunal is being asked to report on an interim basis not later than the <Col N="1915" /> twentieth day of any oral hearings and the matters to be covered in that report are specified.  This coupled with the expressed wish to conduct the inquiry in as economical a manner as possible, consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it, reflects the Government's concern with maintaining confidence in a tribunal of inquiry as an effective and efficient means of getting to the bottom of contested matters of major public concern.  These provisions are innovative but they derive directly from the experience gained in the establishment and conduct of previous inquiries.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the specific reference to the supervisory responsibilities of the Minister and the Department of Health.  Because of the concept of the Minister as corporation sole and the reality that functions are exercised on his behalf by the officers of the Department of Health, it is considered appropriate to include both.  I was particularly anxious to avoid any suggestion that I am not prepared to be fully accountable for any responsibilities I hold in relation to the matters under review.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to inform the House that Mr. Justice Thomas A. Finlay, the former Chief Justice, has agreed to be the chairman and sole member of the tribunal.  I express appreciation to him on my behalf and that of the Government, for agreeing to undertake this difficult task of major national importance.  I wish him every success in his task and I assure him of the unstinting co-operation of my Department and the other statutory agencies.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed to the Attorney General's recommendation to make provision for the appointment of three legal teams &mdash; the tribunal team, the State team; and a public interest team.  This is the first time a team representing the public interest will be appointed.  The tribunal has the power to authorise the legal representation of any person appearing to it to be interested.  It may also refuse such representation. <Col N="1916" /> It is a matter for the tribunal alone to decide who should be represented and the 1979 Act authorises the tribunal to direct that the costs of any person appearing before it should be paid by any other person, including the State.  The work of the tribunal will get under way as soon as the necessary physical and support arrangements can be put in place.  The cost of the tribunal will be a charge on the Health Vote and will be met by way of Supplementary Estimate in 1996 and subsequently, as necessary.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the main features of the tribunal's terms of reference and the arrangements for the conduct of its task. It is being asked to address very difficult and sensitive issues, surrounding one of the worst public scandals for many years.  Many different groups will look at it to provide explanations as to how all this happened and to draw conclusions on the systems or other failures which led to such a sad outcome for so many innocent people.  I did not lightly propose its establishment to the Government and the Government took great care in finalising the scope of the tribunal's work.  If there had been an easier way of addressing the issues which have concerned people within and outside the House, I would have chosen it but there was no easier way to achieve the degree of certainty being demanded.</P>
    <P>It is no consolation that we are not alone in the difficulties which have arisen in the field of blood transfusion. The measures which I have proposed to my colleague Ministers in the EU to enhance blood safety and self-sufficiency within the community have met with a steady and enthusiastic response not because they are particularly innovative or radical.  It is because every Minister for Health recognises he or she cannot take for granted a continuing and adequate supply of safe blood and blood products unless there is zero tolerance of anything other than very best practice in everything relating to the harvesting, factoring, distribution and use of blood and all its derivatives.  The <Col N="1917" /> principles and practices necessary to achieve this are generally known and agreed; the challenge is to implement them rigorously and consistently, no matter how routine the whole operation may appear to the casual observer.</P>
    <P>As we establish this inquiry into past failures we must renew our commitment to support the implementation of the many measures which have been recommended in the Hederman O'Brien and Bain reports in relation to the improvement of the blood transfusion service and of haematology in our hospitals. The provision of resources to do this is essential but so also is the maintenance of public confidence and the reassurance of those charged with providing a high quality service that they have the support of all of us in the House in doing their work.  I hope that all Senators will support this motion which I now recommend to the House.</P>
    <P>I refer to unfortunate remarks I made in the Dáil yesterday.  I apologised to the McCole family and to members of Positive Action.  This morning in the Dáil I indicated that I withdraw all reference to those and that includes any adverse comments made to the legal profession which I withdrew unequivocally.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In paragraph 9, to delete &ldquo;, in so far as these questions relate to the terms of reference above&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, welcome the decision of the Minister of Health to set up a tribunal on a statutory basis to investigate the circumstances of the many people who were infected as a result of the actions of a State body and who have not found a solution to their <Col N="1918" /> problem to date.  I have moved one amendment to the motion and a second one will be moved, because I, and my party, feel the terms of the tribunal as set up by the Minister are inadequate. We want to enhance the terms of reference of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>On 1 November 1995 I, on behalf of my party, submitted a motion to this House asking the Minister to do what he is doing today.  On that occasion he decided in his wisdom to oppose that motion and, indeed, put down an amendment to that motion.  Some of the Independent Senators went along with the Minister's thinking and put down their own motion.  Time has shown that if the Minister had listened to us at that time, we would not have had the trauma which we have had to date.  In particular, we would not have the major public debate on the death of Mrs. McCole. This is one of the great tragedies of modern Ireland.  A State board is responsible for infecting up to 1,600 people with a faulty blood product.  On numerous occasions in this House I explained to the Minister that the only way to resolve this problem and to get to the bottom of the scandal was by having a statutory tribunal look into it.  The Minister gave many reasons that should not have been the case.  He mentioned the beef tribunal and the cost which the State incurred through large legal fees. He did not want to go down that road again.  He proposed an alternative &mdash; an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal to deal with compensation. He wooed and won, to some extent, the groups representing the infected women, but they were not satisfied and some went to court.</P>
    <P>A few days before the unfortunate death of Mrs. McCole, a State body admitted liability and apologised for what had happened.  That took place at a very late stage.  Eighteen months earlier the Minister had accepted the resignations of people employed by the board.  They left their jobs with golden handshakes at a time when people were complaining that they had been infected by a product supplied by the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1919" /> While the Minister personally might not have known all the circumstances at the time, he has had ample opportunity since to investigate what happened.  In fact, the Minister has acted in a somewhat stubborn, if not conceited, manner when the House has debated this matter, and there have been many such debates.  On each occasion the Opposition arguments were talked down and dismissed by the Government with a conceit I found disturbing.  In my discussions with Positive Action they were, to a great extent, of the same opinion. Positive Action have done something that very few others have been able to do.  They have kept their eye on the ball and organised themselves.  They kept a steady pace in their campaign and eventually they cracked something that the Minister and his officials were not prepared to crack.</P>
    <P>There were two disturbing aspects to the case.  In the first place, the Minister and the Department of Health tried to distance themselves from the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  I do not know how the Minister could do such a thing.  The BTSB is an organ of the Department of Health in so far as it is a statutory body and the Minister for Health oversees the board.  The Minister accepted the resignations of the board members when they knew they had done wrong and thought they would jump ship, which they did.  Unfortunately, the investigation that was instigated did not receive &mdash; and the Department did not insist that it receive &mdash; documents and evidence from people relevant to the case.  Documents were withheld and people who should have given evidence did not appear.  That was a cover-up.  The cover-up continued until liability was admitted and an apology offered.  They were only offered by the BTSB.  We still have not reached a stage where the Minister or his Department have admitted liability or apologised on behalf of the State.  I do not doubt that when this House debates the matter again some months hence, the <Col N="1920" /> tribunal will have established the facts and the full truth will be available.</P>
    <P>Questions of guilt, compensation and right and wrong are involved.  The Minister attempted on many occasions to indicate that this case is all about money.  He said he would establish an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal and give people the money to which they were entitled through the tribunal.  Yesterday in the other House he indicated that if the McCole family had gone to the tribunal they would have been better off than going to the courts.  That is most disturbing. It begs the question of whether the Minister has his hand in the tribunal's pot.  Does it mean that the <i>ad hoc</i> compensation tribunal is acting on the Minister's orders?  How could the Minister tell the Dáil that the McCole family would have done better financially in the tribunal than in the courts? On what basis did the Minister make that statement?</P>
    <P>Compensation was an important factor; money had to be given to people who were infected by the State. However, what those people wanted was the truth.  They wanted to know what had happened over a period of 20 years, particularly after the problem had come to the attention of the Minister and the Department of Health.  They believed the only way they could find the truth was through a statutory tribunal. My party and I indicated over 12 months ago that the statutory tribunal was the only way out of this quagmire. However, the Minister chose a different road and now he is proposing to take the road we proposed a year ago.  It is a step in the right direction and, we hope, towards establishing the truth.</P>
    <P>Many questions still must be answered.  The McCole family, in the series of questions contained in their letter, has raised many important issues. Who authorised the legal strategy that was followed in the McCole case? Somebody had to orchestrate it.  It is hard to understand how the Department and the Blood Transfusion Service Board, who knew they had done wrong, would go to the wire and send a threatening <Col N="1921" /> letter to people who were trying to reach the truth just days before the death of the woman concerned.  Why has the board admitted liability now? What was discovered a few weeks ago which led to the admission of liability? Why did it not make the admission six or 12 months ago?  Does it mean that a document simply fell off a shelf two weeks ago?  The public is amazed at the admission of liability at this stage.</P>
    <P>What is so secret about the 1976 file? It might as well be the third secret of Fatima.  Surely the Minister for Health is in a position to look at that file and tell us what is in it.  Why is the information in the file not made available to everybody?  The public and the Oireachtas are entitled to know what is in the file.  Were duplicates made or is there just one file?</P>
    <P>There are many more questions to be asked and, for that reason, my party has put down amendments to the motion. Our amendments demand that the Government direct all persons employed by Government Departments and State agencies to give full co-operation to the tribunal in its inquiries. That is of paramount importance.  We also demand that the Government direct all Government Departments and State agencies concerned to co-operate fully with the tribunal.  To date neither the Department nor the Blood Transfusion Service Board has co-operated. We now know that when the expert group tried to establish the truth not only were people deterred from attending but documents were also withheld.  On this occasion State agencies and the Department must supply all documents and information requested. These demands should be included in the motion.  It is a necessary safeguard. There are still some dark corners and unless power is given to the tribunal to ensure that the Department and other State agencies give every document requested then we will not get to the bottom of this.</P>
    <P>The expert group were shunned when they tried to get that information.  We <Col N="1922" /> do not want that to arise again.  The truth of this scandal must come out once and for all.  All people, Departments and agencies must be compelled to co-operate fully with the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The second element of our first amendment ensures that people's privacy is protected.  We do not want people who come before the tribunal to have their names splashed all over the newspapers. They should be able to protect their privacy if they wish and this must be explicitly stated.</P>
    <P>Our additional amendment involves the deletion of words in paragraph 9. Our intention is to see that all questions relating to the late Mrs. McCole are answered.  There can be no picking and choosing.  Our fear is that through the current wording the Minister and the Government are attempting to limit the scope of the inquiry and to limit answers to the burning questions in the McCole case.</P>
    <P>These are our two main concerns, although we have others.  What is the position of those people who have already gone before the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal? What happens to those people who have taken a final settlement? Where do they stand?  Can the Minister tell us their rights if they wish to seek further compensation?  I believe they are entitled to go back to court or to the tribunal.  If necessary, they should receive whatever additional support, financial or otherwise, is required.</P>
    <P>We are setting up a tribunal which is 12 months overdue.  The Minister for Health and his Department fudged the issue all the way through.  They stubbornly stood against the wishes of the victims, of Positive Action and of the Opposition in both Houses.  The tide eventually turned against the Minister, his Department and the Government.  It was just prior to Mrs. McCole's death that a State agency decided to cave in, admit liability and apologise.  It was very late in the day and we are late setting up a tribunal to investigate something which should have been over and done with at this stage.  We could have prevented the trauma, hardship, stress <Col N="1923" /> and worry of over 1,000 victims in this country who were infected by a State board, not one member of which has been carpeted, reprimanded, sacked, charged or has had anything done to them other than had their resignation accepted by the Minister and given a pocketful of money to go away.  The woman who was infected was taken right to the wire in the courts.</P>
    <P>The public has become very sceptical of State boards and Departments over the handling of this issue.  Apart from establishing the women's entitlements, this tribunal is needed to return some transparency, decency and openness.  As far as the public is concerned there has been a massive cover up for 18 months and no one has taken responsibility, least of all the Minister or the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment by Senator Finneran in relation to broadening the terms of reference to ensure that all persons involved in this scandal will be required to co-operate with the tribunal and that all documentation relating to it will be made available.  The amendment will also ensure that the names of victims will not be disclosed if they do not wish it.  I hope this amendment will be accepted.</P>
      <P>I welcome this motion because it will help to establish the truth.  It is a scandal that so many women have been infected with this disease.  Questions have to be asked as to why this happened.  Why did the truth not emerge before now?  The Minister has already stated that the BTSB is a separate legal entity, nevertheless it must be held accountable. That has not happened.  The Minister is politically responsible.  He has to take action.  It is important to get all the facts and the Minister is answerable on that score alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First we had a compensation tribunal which definitely seemed to be a cover up.  That was the perception.  Rather than let the truth emerge we had this tribunal established rather than using the courts.  This was deeply resented. <Col N="1924" /> We are dealing with people's lives.  We are not dealing with a piece of research or test cases where we have sub A group and sub B group and then we make a final conclusion as to what blood content is working and what is not.  This time we are dealing with people.  Men, women and children were going to the blood bank, either to give or receive blood, knowing that somewhere in the background something was not right.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister choose to establish a compensation tribunal?  Did it take Mrs. McCole's death to bring this issue forward?  My perception is that the public are ill at ease about this very sensitive issue.  Let us get to the truth once and for all.  It has been going on over 20 years.  We had the expert group who investigated this under Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien, yet their terms of reference did not enable them to be furnished with all the documentation.  It seems that some people were not interviewed about this saga.  The issue of why that documentation was not brought forward was not raised in the Dáil until March this year, when it was propelled by Fianna Fáil.  It was denied in the Dáil by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, that that file was necessary to change the expert group's findings. Something went wrong there.  Why? Why did the file suddenly appear after two years?  I am not saying the Minister knew about it but the buck stops with him.  The current Minister has to take the responsibility to ask the BTSB what went wrong, why there was a cover up and why this file was not produced long before it was.  Why did it take until June before we got to the end of that?</P>
    <P>The Minister would not listen to the demands of the victims for the truth, an admission of liability and an apology. All Mrs. McCole wanted was the truth. She wanted those who were responsible &mdash; the Department of Health &mdash; to be accountable to the public.  The Minister for Health refused to listen and facilitated the cover up by the BTSB.  I hate to use that language; it is not my style to make such statements in the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1925" /> We let down the public and the victims who innocently used the blood bank.  I am glad the tribunal has been set up &mdash; although it has taken 20 years &mdash; and that the truth will come out.  Perhaps it is the best thing that ever happened because we need to look at the administration and professionalism of the BTSB.  I hold its professional and administrative staff responsible.  They had a say in how the organisation was run and how its affairs were administered in terms of documenting case studies and deciding which blood content should be allocated to them.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister apologised for what he said yesterday, but I was very upset by it.  I was amazed that such a professional Minister would have such a lack of empathy with the people who are suffering.  We are talking about people, not numbers.</P>
    <P>Propelled by Fianna Fáil Members of the other House, there has been movement on this over the last two years.  My colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, documented the series of events from 1976 to today.  The &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme last Monday week was the first time the public entered into dialogue on this matter.  It did not take root in the public arena until that night.  There was great shock at the revelation that these people had been victimised by the blood bank in relation to how the anti-D product was administered.</P>
    <P>With the setting up of the tribunal, we will come to the end of this awful saga and have a little more openness.  Do not forget that when we were in Government we were told we were not open or transparent but that the new regime would deliver magnificent openness, transparency and accountability.  It has failed absolutely on the first test.</P>
    <P>Why was there a cover-up?  Why did the BTSB suddenly produce the famous file?  Who frustrated the late Mrs. McCole's endeavours to get at the truth?  It is necessary to answer these questions if we are to restore public confidence in the blood bank, which plays an important role.  It is a shame <Col N="1926" /> that confidence in it has been undermined. I welcome the tribunal and its broad terms of reference.  I hope the amendment will be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The motion proposes to establish a tribunal to investigate the terrible tragedy of the 1,600 women infected with hepatitis C.  There has been a great deal of discussion and newsprint in recent times about this terrible problem.  It is extremely important that none of us loses sight of the fact that 1,600 women, through no fault of theirs, were infected with hepatitis C.  If I was one of those women I do not think I would be as responsible, reasonable, cool or constructive as they have been in their approach to this very serious and sensitive issue.</P>
      <P>In 1971 I was a student in UCG.  I gave a pint of blood and I received a card saying I had ORH negative blood. That meant nothing to me but I found out subsequently that I was one of 8 per cent in the country and, as such, I was a universal donor.  I also found out that if I married a man with positive blood there was a real danger of producing blue babies.  Sometime afterwards, a medical student told me about the development of the anti-D injection which would prevent the development of antibodies after a woman had given birth.  That was greatly welcomed by all women in that position.  Since then, any woman in that situation, where positive blood has been crossed with negative, has received an injection of anti-D.  I am sure Senator Henry is in a better professional position than I am to elaborate on that issue.</P>
      <P>In 1983 I gave birth to my first child who was a twin &mdash; I had been pregnant with twins.  Prior to that I had an anti-D injection and after his birth I had another injection.  I was delighted to have produced a baby and went about my business until this scare emerged a short time ago.  It was then decided that all women who had had anti-D injections should be tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1927" /> As someone who received three anti-D injections, twice in 1983 and once in 1989, I was extremely afraid of going for that test.  I was one of the last to go to my GP for a blood test.  I was afraid I might be told I had hepatitis C but I do not.  However, I was quite fearful and it took me a long time to go for the test. We should all put ourselves in the position of the 1,600 women who had the test and received a positive result saying they have hepatitis C.  They fully understand the significance of that result.</P>
    <P>A great deal of unfair criticism has been heaped on the Minister.  The Minister has held this portfolio for less than two years.  He has been criticised for not apologising and for not accepting liability. I have known him for almost 20 years.  He is a caring, committed man who has a great sense of public duty and public office.  He has taken his responsibilities as Minister for Health very seriously.  The Minister in private can say he is extremely sorry about what happened.  However, we must appreciate that constitutional constraints prevent him from saying that in public. It is important that we separate the Minister's constitutional role from his role as a private individual.</P>
    <P>The BTSB is a semi-State body for which the Department of Health is responsible.  Each semi-State body has a statutory responsibly and must act accordingly.  I deplore that we had to go this far before all the relevant information was presented and that more information was not available to the Hederman O'Brien inquiry.  Recent statements by a doctor in the BTSB and by its medical director have shed more light on this.  It is a pity that did not happen sooner.  Those statements have made it clear that some Opposition politicians are more interested in politics than in facts.  They failed to take the opportunity of a Dáil committee hearing with the BTSB to examine more thoroughly the question of the missing file or of donor X.  That is a reflection on their sincerity and motivation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1928" /> The BTSB has shown appalling insensitivity in the manner in which it has handled this case.  It has displayed a lack of understanding of the women concerned. Its handling of the Mrs. McCole case was particularly harsh and it does not deserve commendation.  I am delighted the Minister has stated in the terms of reference that co-operation from Departments and State agencies will be obligatory.  It is important that justice is seen to be done.  It is also important that victims who wish to remain anonymous can remain so under the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The situation as regards the blood supply is serious.  If the Minister has done one good thing it is that he has managed to retain confidence in the donor system and despite this crisis, supplies to the BTSB continue.  We must not lose sight of the fact that thousands of people in hospital urgently need blood.  I wondered what I would do if I had to go into hospital to be injected with a blood product.  People who have low haemoglobin counts are often injected with blood injections.  I am happy to say that I have been fully reassured and would have confidence if such a situation arose.</P>
    <P>What was done by the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, when he set up the Miriam Hederman O'Brien inquiry was highly commendable.  Many of its recommendations are being implemented by the BTSB and the Department of Health.  The Minister has appointed two people to the BTSB, Shaun McCann and Liam Dunbar, both recognised as being at the top of their professions. The Bains group reported on the BTSB and the Minister has assured us of further research in this area, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>During our EU Presidency the Minister will preside over the EU Health ministers.  He has made the supply of blood in Europe a priority and he is anxious to ensure an agreed policy among member states.  Given the variations that exist within member states, uniformity is important.  I commend the Minister for prioritising this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1929" /> The motion is: &ldquo;To inquire urgently into and report and make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit in relation to the following defined matters of public importance.&rdquo;  It is important that we find out how and when the BTSB first became aware that anti-D manufactured by it had become infected with hepatitis C and what action it took. I hope the tribunal will come up with a response.  The consequences of this for blood products and the blood supply will be apparent when the report is produced.</P>
    <P>Condition 4 of the terms of reference of the tribunal refers to: &ldquo;The response of the BTSB to a letter of 16th December 1991 from the Middlesex Hospital, London in relation to Human Immunoglobulin &mdash; Anti-D and the adequacy of such response including the consequences for the blood supply and blood products.&rdquo;  I am delighted that has been included.  I would be extremely annoyed if my blood was being tested without my being advised of it.  We have a right to personal integrity and any intrusion without our agreement is not acceptable.  I welcome the inclusion of this condition in which that issue can be addressed.  The question of retrospective licensing is a matter of public concern which needs to be teased out.  I am delighted the eminent Mr. Justice Thomas Finlay, who has wide experience, has taken on this responsibility.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran proposed an amendment to the terms of reference of the tribunal, which reads: &ldquo;In paragraph 9, to delete &ldquo;in so far as these questions relate to the terms of reference above&rdquo;.&rdquo;  The letter the McCole family wrote to the Minister on 8 October included five questions.  I gather four of these questions can be dealt with under the terms of reference of the tribunal.  I would like to read those questions into the record.  The McCole family asked:</P>
    <P>1.  Why did the Blood Transfusion Service Board used plasma from a patient undergoing therapeutic plasma exchange when it was unsafe to so?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1930" /> 2.  Why did the Blood Transfusion Service Board ignore the ample warnings of jaundice, hepatitis and adverse reactions to Anti-D in 1977 and again take no steps when they were informed of the infection of Anti-D with hepatitis C on December 16th, 1991?</P>
    <P>3.  Why did the Blood Transfusion Service Board not inform the infected women in 1991, and why did they not report the infection to the Department of Health as they were obliged by law to do?</P>
    <P>4.  Why was the Blood Transfusion Service Board permitted to manufacture Anti-D unlawfully and without a licence under the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932, from 1970-1984?</P>
    <P>Question No. 5 is the one where the difficulty arises.  In its letter of 20 September 1996, the BTSB admitted liability and apologised but only in the context of a threat that if it proceeded with a case of aggravated exemplary damages and not succeed, it would pursue her costs.  What was the justification for this threat?</P>
    <P>I understand there is a separation of power in relation to the legal and departmental position, and one is in a different situation and a body apart.  For legal and constitutional reasons, it would not be possible to deal with that particular aspect.  The fact that the pertinent questions raised in the four questions can be dealt with by these terms of reference is welcome and, given from where we have come, we have proceeded a long way.  The terms are tight and I compliment and commend the Minister's openness in accepting various proposals which have deepened the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made that there is a cover-up.  Will somebody tell me what Deputy Noonan has to gain by a cover-up?  He has absolutely no responsibility for the crisis.  It is not of his making as it happened over 20 years ago and at intervals since then.  Not only that, he was not in Government but in <Col N="1931" /> Opposition.  Since coming to office, he has taken a hands-on approach and dealt with the issue directly.  He has been open to a variety of suggestions and acted in an extremely responsible and fair way.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised about compassion and lack of sensitivity. Everybody empathises with people in difficult situations but the reality is that action is needed at the end of the day. The Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, established a tribunal of compensation. Many cases have gone through it and many women have been compensated and are extremely happy with it.  Other women have chosen to go to the courts which is their right but what the Minister did is unprecedented in Europe.  No other European country has set up a compensation tribunal.  In France, they put people in jail but the reality is that nobody has received compensation. Similar situations exist in other member states.</P>
    <P>This Minister has adopted a progressive approach.  He has empathised in a positive way and acted positively in the interests of the victims concerned. When all discussion is concluded and everything calms down people will realise that the Minister has met the sensitivities and worries of the victims and done as much as is humanly and constitutionally possible to do in his position.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's speech.  This dreadful incident has given us a knowledge of haematology which we would not have had before.  I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn for explaining why the McCole family's fifth question was causing such difficulty.  I also thank her for pointing out the most important fact, that this is an international problem. I know we are dealing with one specific case but this problem is in evidence all over Europe.  Indeed, an article in today's <i>Irish Medical Times</i> entitled &ldquo;Canada hit by hep-C scare&rdquo; tells of 5,000 recent donors who may have become infected, so this is an <Col N="1932" /> extremely serious problem on an international scale.</P>
      <P>The editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Wednesday stated: &ldquo;The real scandal is that it has come to this; that a tribunal of inquiry is necessary to establish facts which must already have been known in the Blood Transfusion Service Board (BTSB), in the Department of Health and, perhaps, in other State agencies&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I support this statement.  The real scandal is that there are those who could and should have spoken to the expert group and have not done so because I am sure far more information was available than that which they received.</P>
      <P>When this débâcle started, I had two main concerns, the first of which related to the health care of the infected patients and how they were being treated.  I think the patients have been well cared for from a health point of view.  The natural history of infection by hepatitis C is really not well known yet, nor is there any adequate known treatment. However, whatever screening processes were necessary were put in place and carried out and, where it was felt advisable, liver biopsies were carried out and the results made known to patients.  All those who need the care of a hepatologist are receiving it and all others are assured that their health care will be of no financial cost to them as it will be taken on by the State for the duration of their lives.  I welcome all those provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike some others, I welcomed the setting up of the compensation tribunal because, as I said on several occasions, the adversarial system in this country, where patients must go to court to get damages which are due to them for injuries, can often be more stressful than the original injury.  While we know that hepatitis C causes damage to the immune system as well as the liver, we are certain that a very great deal of damage is done to the immune system by stress.  Therefore, the simpler it is made for those patients who do not want to go to court and want to go to the tribunal, the better.  I quite understand <Col N="1933" /> that people were happy with the results of the tribunal because they feel a weight off their shoulders.  They will now try to put it behind them and get on with their lives.</P>
    <P>My second concern was that we should do all we possibly could to ensure that this sort of episode could not happen again.  I say &ldquo;do all we possibly could&rdquo; because we must remember that blood products are biological and constantly open to infection and change. Therefore, even though one thinks a problem is solved, a few weeks later this may not be the case.</P>
    <P>The initial episode causing infectious hepatitis C clearly came from the anti-D produced and sold by the Blood Transfusion Service Board from 1977. The source of the infection was a lady who was undergoing dialysis to lower her very high anti-D levels.  The woman became jaundiced but her blood tested negative for hepatitis B.  This is what one would normally expect, that one would try for hepatitis B, and I will go on later to the famous request form for information.  Therefore, it was concluded that she had environmental hepatitis, infectious hepatitis, jaundice &mdash; whatever one would like to call it.  At that time, these terms were not being used in a very precise manner.  It is important to remember that jaundice really only means that the skin and the sclera go a green-yellow colour due to a pile up of bilirubin in the tissues and in the interstitial fluid.  It could be due to numerous things.  I think medical terminology is being misunderstood quite often along the way in this case.</P>
    <P>They decided to use this blood because, at that time, it was felt that hepatitis A was not transmitted by blood.  I want to say that it is probably not transmitted but there is such a change of knowledge in these fields that I am constantly terrified of anybody saying anything definite.  Muir's <i>Textbook of Pathology</i> lists the mode of spread for hepatitis A as &ldquo;oro-faecal (parenteral)&rdquo;. Even Muir is careful in case it emerges that a person might contract the disease in a manner other than oro-faecal.  This <Col N="1934" /> is a very difficult area with which to deal.  The blood bank resumed the use of blood from the 1976 donor thereby breaking its own rules that it should not use blood from jaundiced patients.  This was not an international rule; it only applied to Ireland.  Blood transfusion services in countries where hepatitis A is common would be forced to use such blood.  In addition, it was considered that the disease was not spread by means of blood transfusion.</P>
    <P>We must consider the information available regarding hepatitis at that time.  It is always good to thank those who have helped with one's research because one might need them in the future.  I thank the librarians of Trinity College, the Royal College of Physicians and Mercer's Library in the Royal College of Surgeons, Professor Donald Weir and my daughter, Dr. Meriel McEntagart, who carried out a computer search on my behalf.</P>
    <P>The first evidence regarding suspicions about non-A, non-B viral hepatitis was given at a symposium in March 1975 at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington.  Did any officials of the BTSB or the Department of Health attend that meeting or read the reports that were published the following November in the <i>American Journal of Medical Sciences?</i></P>
    <P>Two important papers issued from the Washington symposium.  The first, &ldquo;The emerging pattern of post-transfusion hepatitis&rdquo;, discusses the possibility of a non-A, non-B hepatitis in transfusion hepatitis.  It states, &ldquo;additional human hepatitis virus(es) may exist&rdquo;.  Experts at the time were not sure whether such viruses did exist. The paper refers to the fact that some voluntary donors who tested negative for hepatitis B appeared to have contracted another form of the disease which might have been transmitted by serum.  It also suggests that perhaps this form is a variant of hepatitis A.</P>
    <P>Another useful paper was delivered at that meeting which did not mention non-A, non-B hepatitis.  However, the abstract stated: &ldquo;The existence of <Col N="1935" /> additional viruses of human hepatitis is suggested by data concerning transfusion-associated disease and multiple episodes in the same individual&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The key indexing terms attached to the paper do not refer to non A, non B hepatitis.  It was probably easy to miss the connection.  The paper goes on to discuss viruses in human hepatitis and states that more than two viruses may cause the infection.  It further states that this was not appreciated until 1962 because of a predominance in previously studied situations of transfusion-associated disease caused by pooled derivatives.  The paper in question contains much technical information which is difficult to understand.  However, it stresses that the possibility must be considered that there is more than one additional agent to hepatitis A and B. However, it is somewhat unsure in this regard.</P>
    <P>In July 1975, an article appeared in <i>The Lancet</i> under the leader headline &ldquo;Non-A, Non-B?&rdquo;.  It begins by stating that blood transfusion is dangerous at the best of times and that the transmission of syphilis and malaria is well recognised.  The article also points out: &ldquo;Even when a case of hepatitis is recognised as being &ldquo;transfusion-associated&rdquo;, it is a long, and sometimes hard, road to trace the source with certainty and identify the virus with precision&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It continues:</P>
    <P>All this seems to point strongly to hepatitis-B virus being the major hazard of blood transfusion so far as hepatitis viruses are concerned, although post-transfusion hepatitis is certainly not the exclusive preserve of hepatitis-B virus.</P>
    <P>At that time, medical experts were still concentrating on hepatitis B.  The article further states:</P>
    <P>However, before a hypothetical hepatitis-C virus is produced, a touch of Occam's razor is not inappropriate. These patients might have a hepatitis <Col N="1936" /> A differing antigenically from the MSI of FEINSTONE et al.</P>
    <P>This shows that there was a tremendous lack of knowledge and it does no one credit to state that things were as definite as certain people seem to believe.</P>
    <P>Another paper published in <i>The Lancet,</i> which is widely read in this country appeared under the title &ldquo;Clinical and Serological Analysis of Transfusion-Associated Hepatitis&rdquo;.  It states: &ldquo;The attainment of hepatitis-free blood-transfusions has been a frustratingly slow, but progressively realistic goal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In 1975 medical experts were experiencing difficulties in attempting to identify the viruses in question.  The article goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The aetiology of non-A, non-B hepatitis after transfusion remains obscure.  One could argue that these transaminase elevations do not represent viral hepatitis, but every effort was made to exclude other known causes of hepatic enzyme elevation.</P>
    <P>It appears that questions were being asked as to whether people were contracting hepatitis after a transfusion rather than an infection.  Efforts were made to identify the virus but it proved difficult to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pathologic Basis of Disease</i> by Stanley Robbins states that &ldquo;The subject of viral hepatitis is one of the most exciting and rapidly unfolding areas in medicine&rdquo;. So speaks an academic working well away from the coal face who does not refer to non-A, non-B hepatitis in his book.  Churchill Livingstone, a well known publishing house in the medical field, published a more specific article, &ldquo;Systemic Pathology&rdquo;, in 1978.  In the section dealing with the alimentary canal, a specialist on this condition states:</P>
    <P>When the term viral hepatitis is used without further qualification it conventionally relates only to the conditions now generally distinguished as type A viral hepatitis and type B viral hepatitis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" /> It goes on to discuss type A viral hepatitis &mdash; epidemic hepatitis &mdash; and type B viral hepatitis &mdash; homologous serum jaundice.  The individual in question knew his subject but he refused to include any information regarding non-A, non-B hepatitis.  Davidson's <i>Principles and Practice of Medicine</i> also refuses to mention non-A, non-B hepatitis. Our knowledge of this problem was inadequate at that time and it is fine to begin apportioning blame with the benefit of hindsight.  Indeed, people have gone so far as to suggest that it is not a virus at all.</P>
    <P>I inquired whether officials of the Department of Health or the blood bank attended that conference because I wish to know the level of interest shown by the BTSB in modern research at that time.  Did the Department of Health provide sufficient funding for officials to attend the conference?  For most of its existence, the blood bank has operated in a very isolated manner.</P>
    <P>Definite information about non-A, non-B hepatitis appeared in <i>The Lancet</i> on 10 November 1984 in an article entitled &ldquo;Non-A, non-B Hepatitis&rdquo;. This article refers to the usefulness of serological tests.  By the date of publication, hepatitis A had been better identified but the authors remained unsure regarding non-A, non-B hepatitis.  They state: &ldquo;Two or more agents are believed to be responsible for NANB hepatitis but attempts to isolate these agents have hitherto been unsuccessful.&rdquo;  They go on to state:</P>
    <P>The most convincing studies of NANB hepatitis in man have concerned its parenteral transmission... [that is through blood or injections. They are still not in a totally definite position.]  Although hepatitis A and B are readily identifiable by serological methods, great difficulties have been encountered in devising tests for NANB agents... We cannot exclude the possibility that NANB viruses induce little or no antibody production.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1938" /> There may be a number of immunologically distinct non-A non-B viruses which could explain the discrepancies which have been reported.  Even when they have definitely decided there are non-A non-B viruses, there is still trouble.  It is important to keep this in context with what is being discussed.</P>
    <P>Hepatitis C was identified in 1989 and when the situation became very bad. The expert group has been very charitable in the way it has dealt with people involved.  By that time tests had been developed internationally which were not accurate.  However, I wonder why the blood bank appears to have decided to do nothing at that time.</P>
    <P>The tests were throwing up too many false positive results.  A false positive result is not nearly as serious as a false negative result.  A false positive test means that one thinks that some people have the condition who do not have it. It is unfortunate if they are told and it turns out they have not got the condition. However, a false negative result means that people who have a problem are being let loose without it being recognised.  At that time, did the blood bank do the tests even though they were not reliable?  Did it decide to discard all blood which tested positive?  I cannot work this out from the report.</P>
    <P>There is a large information gap between 1989 and 1991.  Did it decide to get rid of all the blood or was that the time when the second hepatitis C positive donor slipped into the net?  There is a second donor because we know there is another serologically different hepatitis C donor.  I have not been able to get much information on that point.</P>
    <P>I have not been able to get much information about the supposed consultant's report done on the women in Baldoyle who had hepatitis in the late 1970s.  Whatever about throwing out the fresh blood, did anybody think of testing the old blood products for hepatitis C?  We know there had been an appalling problem before this with HIV infected Factor VIII.  Did anyone realise that, although the tests were not accurate, the blood products should be <Col N="1939" /> tested?  Did anyone alert the Department of Health to the presence of hepatitis C?  Who was the representative from the Department of Health on the board of the blood bank?  Did he or she report back along a chain of command to the Department and, if so, how high did that chain of command go?</P>
    <P>Much has been made about the fact that Dr. Terry Walsh, for reasons best known to himself, only showed the letter from the Middlesex Hospital confirming the infection to his chief biochemist. However, people should have become suspicious without that.  Having had the débâcle of HIV something more should have been done.</P>
    <P>The report of the expert group states in section 3.70: &ldquo;We could find no evidence that the BTSB formally reviewed its initial decision to supply an intravenous product at any stage prior to the discovery of the hepatitis C incident in February 1994&rdquo;.  I find that almost unbelievable.  Have the files of the various officials involved at that time been examined?  They would be most important.</P>
    <P>I will not quote Tennessee Williams about mendacity and the smell of it but somebody is being very economical with the truth.  The whole matter needs examination.  I was misled about the status of WinRho when it was brought in as an emergency in February 1994.</P>
    <P>I want to try to sort out the medical details about which Professor Shaun McCann felt obliged to speak on Pat Kenny's radio show.  I do not think that either Professor McCann or Mr. Liam Dunbar hid anything from the expert group.  What turned up was a blood request form that goes with a blood sample.  Thousands go to the laboratory every day and normally one throws them out.  I do not think it significant that they did not see it.  Neither the Minister nor the Minister of State lied to the House about this.</P>
    <P>A biochemist, Dr. Caroline Hussey, who is an expert in industrial microbiology and a professor of haematology from London were on the expert group. <Col N="1940" /> If I go to work and someone hands me a report on a urine sample with indicates certain levels of bacteria, white cells, blood cells and pH, I do not need a request form saying &ldquo;urinary tract infection&rdquo;. I know the form went to the laboratory because I know the answer I received.  The same applies in the case of the blood bank.  It is to denigrate these two experts to say they would not have understood from what came back from the virology laboratory what was being sought.  Of course they would have known, just as any professional would have known.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why some people harp on and on about this point because there are more serious questions to be asked.  There are questions about information not being passed between 1989 and 1991.  There was a great fluttering in the dovecotes in early 1992.  One should look again at sections 3.72, 3.73 and 3.74 of the expert group's report where the production of anti-D is suddenly being questioned.  What started that fluttering in the dovecotes?  We were told there was nothing to report until the admission in February.  Frankly, I do not believe it.  Something happened around that time, although I do not know what.</P>
    <P>However, there is the fact that Terry Walsh did not produce the Middlesex letter.  I do not know what the civil servants are doing keeping letters in their drawers.  This is the second time this has happened in the recent past.  Files need to be examined.  Something happened then, although I do not know what.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for people to harp on about the request form.  I write them out every day and if I expected to get them back I would have to prepare for a mountain of paper because most of them return with a negative result.  This is not an instance in which anything was hidden and people should stop accusing the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea of hiding it.  The professional integrity of Professor McCann and Mr. Dunbarr is at stake as is the implied stupidity of Dr. Hussey and Professor Bellingham.  Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien's  <Col N="1941" /> letter which is quoted makes this perfectly clear.</P>
    <P>The request form is not of significance as it is the same as the one used in the urine analysis example I gave.  If the results came back indicating other diseases I would know what was being looked for and I would not have to see the request form.</P>
    <P>The McColes are most anxious to have these questions answered and if the final questions cannot be answered, perhaps the Minister will ensure it is answered outside the tribunal.</P>
    <P>One other matter we should consider in this House is whether only certain doctors should be allowed prescribe blood and blood products.  Do we need to go that far?  We in the medical profession have perhaps looked on blood too casually.  However, it can be seen from what I quoted how desperately difficult it is to constantly identify what is going wrong with viruses in blood products. Constant reporting is necessary in this situation.  Another measure which could be adopted is to ensure people attend international conferences to keep up to date.  The blood bank was allowed to be far too isolated and, perhaps, was grossly underfunded by the Department of Health who may have a considerable share of the blame for the period 1989 to 1991 because of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>The anti-D and hepatitis C story is a tragedy which needs to be addressed for a number of reasons.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government for facilitating this debate. It was obviously a difficult decision but the Minister has nothing to hide on the subject of the blood transfusion system in Ireland.  However, it is important we get to the bottom of this mystery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragic death of Mrs. McCole, a fellow Donegal person, was a major personal tragedy for her family and has focused public attention further on the hepatitis C issue.  In situations such as this, there is always the temptation to make political gain and it is unfortunate that some Members of the Oireachtas have been unable to resist such temptation. <Col N="1942" /> Some of the political points scoring which occurred in this debate, aimed at people who were not even Members of the Oireachtas when women were being infected, has not helped in the search for truth.</P>
    <P>Many of the allegations against the Minister were dealt with by him in the Dáil yesterday.  He has shown that, contrary to Opposition claims, he did not delay and obstruct Mrs. McCole's case from the beginning to the end.  Remarks were made yesterday which probably should not have been made and the Minister moved quickly to address them.  His apology was most welcome and it is obvious from the remarks of Positive Action that it was accepted by them.</P>
    <P>The provision of an adequate supply of blood and the assurance it exists is extremely important.  Without it, many operations would not be possible.  It is therefore right that the first imperative of policy for the Minister has been to protect the integrity of the blood supply and he addressed the issue at all times. He said it was a sensitive issue and had to be addressed in a proper way.  The great danger of such an imperative is that it could ultimately be used to justify a cover up.  That is why the Minister's decision to ask this House to hold a judicial inquiry is welcome.  It proves there is not and will not be any cover up.  If all questions had been properly answered from day one, we would have no call for an inquiry, but it is welcome.</P>
    <P>We as public representatives are entitled to the truth.  More than us, the women who have been infected, who have been placed at terrible risk, who cope every day with suffering and who may even die are entitled to know the truth.  The children and loved ones, who cope with illness and anxiety, are also entitled to the truth.  I worked for many years as a nurse and saw the effects of hepatitis and what it can do to people. The stress, the depression, the strain on families and the colour of the person's skin are all horrible.  It is an issue which must be dealt with very sensitively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1943" /> There have been no heroes in this saga so far with one exception: a woman who fought to her death bed to know the truth.  Her interest in money was so minimal, she instructed her lawyers to fight for an admission and not for money.  She left behind her a monument of personal integrity and courage.  Every Member of this House and of the wider community owes Brigid McCole a debt of undying gratitude.  She fought on in pain and weariness against the delaying legal tactics of the Blood Transfusion Service Board until she could fight no more.  If the truth comes out and people are found to have been negligent, it is important they are dealt with severely. She fought with the support, not of shysters as one of the newspapers described them last week, but of honourable legal people prepared to fight for her without any guarantee of recompense.  The innuendo I read in newspapers last weekend that Mrs. McCole's lawyers were profiteering from illness and death amazed me.  These newspapers did not seem to know there were four substantial legal teams involved.  Three of them, for whom it appears money was no object, were against Mrs. McCole.  Only one represented her.  It was her legal team, unpaid as far as I know, who secured the admission of liability which the entire political establishment was unable to secure.  The only consolation for these people is that the woman who had been campaigning for truth and justice in this matter knew what they did and how they won against the odds.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that Mrs. McCole had left a monument of personal integrity behind her.  The greatest monument we could build for her and her family would be to publish the truth of what happened to her.  I welcome the Minister's appointment of the former Chief Justice Mr. Thomas Finlay to the chair of the tribunal.  I have no doubt he will obtain the truth which the McCole family seek. We know this is a human tragedy.  We do not know whether there was wilful conspiracy behind it, simple human error or criminal stupidity and negligence. <Col N="1944" /> We do not know if all factors involved have been identified with sufficient clarity to ensure this cannot happen again.  Until we do, none of us, who may after all need blood at some time in the future, can rest easy.  Until we do, none of us can say that justice has been achieved for innocent victims; people whose only crime was to seek an injection to protect their unborn babies.</P>
    <P>There is one fundamental question which must now be answered.  The Hederman O'Brien report into the causes of this infection covered much ground.  It spoke of errors of judgment and made clear there was fault, but did not provoke or stimulate an admission of liability from the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  The board carried on in the legal sense as if the Miriam Hederman O'Brien report had not been made.  Several months later and before it knew of Mrs. McCole's deteriorating health, it changed tack and admitted liability. Why?  What documents were discovered? What witnesses came forward? What information came to light? The only legal conclusion is that some information was withheld from Miriam Hederman O'Brien and her team which was sufficiently damning to change even the most intransigent legal advice.  We need to know and must know what that was.  If the truth is to be served, we must know what was hidden from the Hederman O'Brien examination.  It finally came to light under the pressure of a court case.</P>
    <P>Without that knowledge, it will be impossible to retain the necessary confidence in the blood supply.  The Minister has striven at all times to maintain confidence in the blood supply.  At the Blood Transfusion Service Board, people line up to be tested and if their blood is refused they imagine something is wrong with them.  People go there in the belief they are doing good for others.  It is important the Minister addressed that matter and he did so in a sensitive way.</P>
    <P>There are other lessons to be learned from this controversy and I mention two of them.  This case produced more than <Col N="1945" /> 1,000 victims who are entitled to and need to be served by politics.  Instead, in too many cases, they have been subjected to the interaction between law and politics.  They were sent to a limbo where the State and the establishment too often send people who have awkward questions to ask.  There has been too much stonewalling in this case, too much use of legal tactics and too much obstruction.  It is not fair to blame the Minister for that but the search for the truth must start with him.</P>
    <P>Many of us have experienced the anxiety and stress that accompanies any serious illness.  We sometimes feel that the medical profession does not like to be asked difficult questions.  It is a profession that is sometimes unwilling to admit flaws or mistakes.  Bad mistakes were made in this case but hardly a day goes by without someone suffering at the hands of a medical profession that can be bureaucratic, insensitive and unwilling to face plain truths.  We all know doctors and nurses whose care and devotion are second to none but we also know people who have had painful and distressing experiences when they should have received better care.</P>
    <P>If some of the work of the judicial inquiry to be established results in better appreciation among the medical profession of its own fallibility we would all be very well served.  The Minister has set up the tribunal and we in this House look to him to ensure it gets the fullest co-operation possible.  If the Minister needs any additional statutory powers to instruct any bodies under his control he will get those powers from this House.  All Members feel this way.  We want, and are entitled to, the whole truth.  Brigid McCole must not have died in vain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Honan is our spokesman on this but she had surgery recently and cannot attend, which she regrets very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the tribunal.  I would prefer if its terms of reference were broader but the tragedy is that the genesis of the tribunal was <Col N="1946" /> not the scandal that came to light but the fact that it took a life to precipitate the establishment of the tribunal.  That is very sad.  I wish Mr. Justice Finlay well in his search for truth, it is our hope and wish that the tribunal will lead to the truth because that has been our search for some time and it has not been very successful.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's apology last night in the Dáil.  However, I am still critical of many aspects of this whole saga.  Perhaps he has learnt a salutary lesson about the scripts provided and the need to read them carefully before delivering them.  The Minister accepts that it should not have been said.  Last night I heard him on <i>Vincent Browne Tonight</i> on the radio when Jane O'Brien of Positive Action accepted his apology.</P>
    <P>I met the Positive Action people yesterday as I left the House.  I had not been listening to the debate in the Dáil and I wondered what was wrong.  They were not angry but felt absolutely crushed to the extent that one did not want to interrupt them because they felt so defeated and deflated.</P>
    <P>There is an underlying feature of all this that I find disquieting and I have referred to it in the House previously, the attitude of official Ireland to its citizens. Within the whole culture of secrecy that surrounds our public life, a contradiction in terms, there is a certain arrogance and a &ldquo;we know best for the people&rdquo; attitude; that we should not provide them with information which is not good for them; and that if they found out they would not understand. That is totally contradictory to the idea of a republic and needs to be examined closely as it is recurring.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the statutory independence of the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the adversarial nature of our courts.  I accept the separation that exists between the Legislature and the Judiciary but I tire of the restatement of the legal position.  I mentioned previously that frequently on the advice of the Attorney General or someone else we may not do this or that.  In this instance particularly, if we <Col N="1947" /> have learnt anything it is that we are servants of the people.  I do not dispute the need for lawyers to give their professional advice truthfully and to the best of their ability but I dispute the State taking such ultimate regard for that advice to the exclusion of the human dimension of the problem being addressed.</P>
    <P>Did the refusal to admit liability come down to mere money?  If that is the case how do we contrast that with the amounts of money mentioned for Luas in Dublin?  There are some parallels between the discussions today and yesterday on Northern Ireland.  I do not want to over-dramatise this but there are parallels between the condemnations we make in the case of people being killed and a certain callousness in respect of an individual life within our State.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the State's alternative to what Positive Action sought was not what they sought or required.  If there had been a more open approach at that time some of the more terrible subsequent events might not have happened. This legalistic approach goes right through the Minister's speech.  I accept that from the purely legal point of view the BTSB and the State are not the same, but there has to be responsibility and accountability which must extend into the Department.  It is the same with the delays in the court and the Minister's explanation of those delays but it brings us back into the legal framework and defensiveness which is not right or appropriate.  There is a legal and a moral responsibility but, increasingly, in our society the moral responsibility is subservient to the legal responsibility.  That is the wrong way around.</P>
    <P>The Minister and all Members here represent the public.  We are public representatives <i>pro bono publico</i> and we must frame our decisions and make our laws within that context.  There must never be a situation where official Ireland and all its panoply of influence can exercise such enormous pressure on <Col N="1948" /> citizens trying to vindicate their rights. That balance has shifted in a very unsatisfactory direction.</P>
    <P>Why was it necessary to reveal Mrs. McCole's name and to contest her request for anonymity?  I fail to understand that.  Why do we mobilise the State with all its power and influence against someone who is dying?</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business today requests were made for us not to politicise this matter.  The Minister has made similar requests.  It is not my intention to politicise the issue, but if it is politicised to the extent that one's own party is attacked, then one must respond.</P>
    <P>If Senator Honan were here today I suspect she would say it more forcefully than I, but on her behalf I must say that she first raised this matter in February 1994 when Deputy Howlin was Minister for Health.  Senator Honan continually sought information in this House, her colleagues in the Dáil sought information and the matter was also raised on the Adjournment.  It is wrong for the Minister to suggest the Progressive Democrats do not have the interests of hepatitis C victims at heart.  Senator Honan's record suggests that she always had the interests of those victims at heart.  It is worth recording that she herself received anti-D and so, on a human level, she was interested in their welfare, though fortunately she was not peronally infected by contaminated blood.</P>
    <P>The discovery of documents revealed the BTSB knew in 1976 that donor &ldquo;X&rdquo; had infective hepatitis, and the Minister referred to some of these aspects earlier. Senator Honan, however, would continue to insist that the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, denied there was anything new when it was clear to everyone that there was new and significant evidence.  Senator Honan wishes that to be said on her behalf.</P>
    <P>On the Adjournment debate in the Seanad, Senator Honan was told there <Col N="1949" /> was nothing new in the discovery of the documents.  Those infected, and the wider public, want to know why and how all this happened.  They do not want to be drip fed information in a slow transfusion, if I may use that phrase in this context, because the information frequently appears to have been contaminated.</P>
    <P>How many people within the Minister's Department and the BTSB realised how serious this matter was? Was there a certain level of complacency as well as the defensiveness of official Ireland which I referred to earlier? Was that uppermost in their minds when they came to consider these matters?</P>
    <P>If, at last, the State and its agencies become truly accountable rather than protesting to the House and to the public, the exercise will have been worthwhile despite the human tragedy involved.  We can no longer hide behind selective disclosures of information.  We frequently seem to hear that it is not in the national interest for the truth to be told, but the truth will always come out eventually.  It is in the national interest that the truth should be told.  The background to the establishment of this tribunal is far worse than the Fr. Smyth affair and infinitely worse than the beef tribunal, even though both these matters were very serious.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already made the point that we cannot draw parallels between how this tribunal will operate and the beef tribunal because their procedures are totally different.  The legal aspects of both tribunals are standard, but the new tribunal's terms of reference will be much narrower.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert but references were made to a particular person being vilified.  However, I found it disturbing when I heard on the news that it took two years to interpret the tests.  The scientist in me came out in protest at that.  From a scientific point of view it is not tenable to say that it took two years <Col N="1950" /> to interpret tests.  I am open to being persuaded otherwise but from a purely scientific viewpoint I found that to be an astonishing statement.</P>
    <P>I hope all the documents required will be made available to the tribunal and that it will be able to consider all these matters in full.  I hope it will be able to look at political accountability apart from administrative accountability. Given the dominance of the law in all the arguments, why have no papers been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions? I cannot understand that.  Reference has been made to the contrast between what happened in France and what happened here.  Our expectation is that the tribunal will arrive at the unvarnished truth which is what victims of this sad incident have a right to.  They should know exactly what happened as well as why and how they became infected.  Such an affair must never happen again.</P>

      <P>I remember only too well the morning of 23 February 1994 when the former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, announced in this House that he had been informed by the BTSB there was a possibility that an anti-D product manufactured by them was infected with what is now known as hepatitis C.  My mind immediately flashed back to the previous difficulty we had with our blood supply in relation to HIV factor VIII when Deputy O'Hanlon was Minister for Health. Unfortunately, factor VIII was administered to haemophiliacs, quite a substantial number of whom died as a result.  I hoped we would never have such a tragedy on our hands again but it seemed we had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health immediately <Col N="1951" /> established an inquiry under the chairmanship of Dr. Hederman O'Brien.  Its duty was to undertake an investigation into all the circumstances surrounding the infection of the anti-D product and other related matters.  The group was informal in the sense that it had no power to compel witnesses or produce documents.  In her report, Dr. Hederman O'Brien stated that her group's requests for information were generally met in full.  Initially it required considerable probing to get the information required.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the current Minister, Deputy Noonan, came into office he was presented with the report of the expert group on the BTSB.  He was rightly of the view that the report could have damaged the confidence of blood donors and this would have a devastating effect on our health services.  He took the necessary steps to strengthen the board with the appointment of Professor Shaun McCann and Mr. Dunbar so that the BTSB would continue its work under new management, would enjoy public confidence and we would never see a repeat of the hepatitis C tragedy.  I was glad to hear Professor McCann say on radio this morning that there is no lack of public confidence in providing blood which our hospitals so badly need.  I hope nothing that is said in this House will reduce public confidence in supplying blood.</P>
    <P>In yesterday's debate in the Dáil, numerous Deputies showed genuine interest in the health of men and women who have been affected by this tragedy. On receiving the expert group's report, the Minister for Health also showed a compassionate interest in those who have been affected by this tragedy.  The Minister's first concern was to appoint a compensation tribunal to provide fair compensation for those affected by hepatitis C.  The compensation scheme approved by the Government offered numerous advantages over court proceedings. <Col N="1952" /> I am pleased to note that, to date, no award has been rejected by any claimant who went before the tribunal. It should be said that no one is compelled to go before the tribunal and they can if they wish also attend the courts. It is a matter for each person to decide whether to pursue their claim before the courts or the compensation tribunal. The Minister also showed his consideration for those who had been affected by setting up the compensation tribunal to avoid the adversarial system of the courts.  The tribunal as distinct from the courts has only to establish that the claimant has been affected by the anti-D product and then it is up to the tribunal to assess damages to that person.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996, which provided a statutory basis for the primary health care service for persons who suffered from hepatitis C.  That has not been mentioned although it was a special provision.  Services under this Act would be provided free of charge including general practitioner service, medicines, nursing services, home help and other services that might be required.</P>
    <P>When I read the Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien report, I felt she had all the facts necessary to make the judgment she made in her report.  It is alleged that a file showed that the BTSB knew from 1976 that a woman whose blood was being used without her knowledge or consent to make anti-D had infectious hepatitis and this information was not given to the expert group.  It was only when the court case was being prepared for the late Bridget McCole that this file turned up.  This might not be the only file that did not turn up.  There could be other documents which were not made available to the expert group. I hope that they will be available to the tribunal.  For that reason, the tribunal now proposed is justified.  The facts about the infection are already in the public domain from the report of the expert group chaired by Dr. Miriam <Col N="1953" /> Hederman O'Brien and it should be relatively easy for the tribunal to confirm them.  The most difficult aspect of this case is why the BTSB continued since 1991 to administer the anti-D product which could have been infected with hepatitis C.  In November 1976, a female donor became jaundiced and the BTSB stopped using her plasma.  It also at that time ordered tests for hepatitis B. Samples of plasma were taken and tested for hepatitis at UCD and also at the Middlesex Hospital.  These tests proved negative.</P>
    <P>In August 1991, the division of virology of Middlesex Hospital wrote to the BTSB offering to carry out newly developed tests for hepatitis C on the archive samples it had kept since 1977. In December 1991, it informed the BTSB that hepatitis C may have been related to cases of clinical jaundice from 1977.  What is most difficult to understand is why the BTSB continued since 1991 to treat women and men with anti-D products when it knew there was a possibility that it could be infected with hepatitis C.  If a local authority was informed there was a possibility of a contamination in its water supply, it would immediately cut it off.  This did not happen unfortunately with the BTSB until 1994 and a substantial number of people between these dates had been infected.  This infection could have been avoided.  Paragraph (6.12) of the expert group's report states:</P>
    <P>We consider that the failure to act upon this information promptly was a serious omission.  Had the letter of 16 December, 1991 been followed up immediately it seems to us that the BTSB could have withdrawn its anti-D product and commenced a screening programme in December, 1991, or early in 1992, rather than in February, 1994.</P>
    <P>This dereliction of duty of the BTSB is unforgivable.  None of the senior employees of the BTSB has spoken in <Col N="1954" /> public about this matter and the tribunal's terms of reference clearly allows the crucial questions to be asked as to why this was allowed to happen.  It is a scandal that a tribunal of inquiry had to be set up to establish facts which must already be known to the BTSB.  The hepatitis C scandal is not just about the matter in which the BTSB administered contaminated products to its clients, it also underlines a fundamental lack of accountability in public administration. It is abundantly clear that the management and more importantly the supervision of the BTSB was grossly inadequate. I welcome the fact that former Chief Justice Mr. Finlay has agreed to chair the tribunal.  The Minister and the Government deserve credit for framing terms of reference which meet the precise needs of those infected by this terrible tragedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Doyle concentrated on the health aspect of this debate.  That is, and must be, the primary concern in the issue, though we are focusing today on the tribunal and getting at the truth.  Throughout discussion, we have the faces of individual people in the backs of our minds, people who we know and whose families we know and whose lives have been overtaken by the tragedy of infection with hepatitis through receiving anti-D.  That is the human element of this story which we have to keep at the front of our minds in discussing the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the procedures have been put in place to look after, in so far as is possible, every aspect of the health needs of the people concerned.  I welcome that the health boards are being asked to put a co-ordinator in place who is directly responsible for co-ordinating the health care aspects.  This is important because those who have been infected should not have to search for the various aspects of care they need, whether it be direct physical health care, counselling or home help.  It is <Col N="1955" /> important that the names and contact numbers of those individuals are available to those who need them.  I support a call made in the Dáil that the home help needs, in particular, of these women should be fully looked after. There was some question that they might not have continuity of home help care and that the home helps might not be paid in the same way on a continuous basis.  This is an important personal issue for the individual women concerned. I would like the Minister to take the concerns on board and ensure there is full continuity of care in that regard. The second issue is compensation and the financial aspect to it.  I welcome the progress that has been made in that regard.</P>
    <P>The issue being focused on is the question of getting at the full facts of what happened.  I welcome the setting up of the tribunal and its terms of reference, its scope in time and other aspects of it and the fact that it goes back to 1970 and does not leave out any of the time in which this saga unfolded.  As other speakers have said, the most critical time is from 1991 to 1994 when it appears the information given to the BTSB should have resulted in immediate action, but did not until 1994.  That is the crucial timeframe but there are other aspects.  I welcome the broad scope of the tribunal.  I welcome the fact that there will be a legal team representing the public interest.  This is an important aspect to what is being decided.</P>
    <P>Speakers in both Houses referred to the legal and moral rights of this issue. That there is a public interest legal team is important.  It will ensure it is not just a legal confrontation between those defending one side and those arguing the case on the other.  Senator Henry gave us an insight into the complexities of the medical aspects in this issue.  We should not gloss over them or expect it to be straightforward or easy to examine <Col N="1956" /> the detailed medical aspects.  Perhaps we take a safe supply of blood for granted.  Obviously ensuring a safe blood supply for those who need it is a complicated matter.  It is important that an assurance comes from this tribunal that mistakes will not be made again so we can be confident of having a safe blood supply in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken on board the concerns that were rightly expressed by the Opposition both here and in the Dáil with regard to full co-operation from Departments and State agencies and in relation to protecting, where possible, the anonymity of the people concerned.  I commend and congratulate the brave members of Positive Action, and particularly Brigid McCole and her family. They fought a brave and difficult fight and they deserve our full support.  I welcome the establishment of the tribunal and I hope it will answer all their questions.</P>

      <P>I will not.  However, perhaps it could be examined.  Having received two treatments while abroad with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on <Col N="1957" /> Foreign Affairs, I wonder if this might be the avenue through which I contracted the virus.  Perhaps it is worth researching whether in certain circumstances it is possible to acquire the disease through inoculation.</P>
      <P>I was saddened by events in the Dáil yesterday but I was impressed by the Minister's demeanour.  He dealt with the matter in an extremely responsible way. He instantly apologised at the first available moment in a timely and gracious manner.  This Minister is good and efficient and I believe the offence was caused inadvertently.  I do not wish to cast aspersions on civil servants but it appeared that elements of the speech had a strong legal flavour and might have been included through draftsmanship other than that of the Minister. He seemed to be concentrating on getting issues of fact right and might not have paid as much attention to the surrounding circumstances.  I also heard the Minister on the &ldquo;The Vincent Browne Show&rdquo; last night and again I was impressed with how he dealt with a difficult situation.  Mr. Browne is an efficient journalist and he tried, using every guile he could, to get the Minister to admit liability.  It would have been utterly wrong for the Minister to admit such liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Positive Action has drawn a matter to my attention which I wish to put on the record and on which I hope the Minister will comment.  There is a clause in the terms of reference whereby the tribunal will examine points in a letter written by the McCole family on 8 October. However, Positive Action understands that it will only be considered in so far as it relates to the terms of reference and limits what may be examined in the letter sent by the McCole family.  The organisation is anxious the allegation that there was some form of threat or intimidation should be included within the terms of reference.  The Minister has dealt with this in some measure. However, it would be appropriate if it <Col N="1958" /> could be included in the terms of reference. Although it might not be germane in a legalistic sense it would help to allay public concern.</P>
    <P>Members of the Irish Haemophilia Society have also expressed concerns. They are concerned about what they describe as the restrictive nature of the tribunal.  They say there is no mention in the terms of reference of the blood products used on a daily basis by people with haemophilia which have infected those people with hepatitis C and other viruses.  There is no mention of specific issues relating to those products.  The tribunal will not look at the incident in 1982 when blood concentrates obtained from paid donors were imported by the BTSB and resulted in the death of haemophiliac patients from HIV infection. The terms do not include a 1986 incident when the BTSB was not heat treating factor IX concentrates in Irish plasma although it was internationally accepted practice to do so.</P>
    <P>The society is seeking an expansion of the terms of reference to include all aspects of donor selection procedures, records maintained by the BTSB on the source of blood plasma and plasma, the BTSB's record in dealing with various viral infection disasters, the BTSB's recall and tracing policy, failure of the BTSB to introduce a plasma quarantine period, the criteria used by the BTSB to select blood products and the exchange of medical knowledge between different committees within the BTSB.  The Minister might examine some of these matters and see if it is possible to include them within the terms of reference of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Professor Shaun McCann, the new director of the BTSB, on the radio this morning.  It is important that this person, who was brought in by the Minister to clear up a difficult and complicated situation, should be allowed to operate in an efficient manner.  It would be most unfair if any opprobrium attached to <Col N="1959" /> him simply because he inherited a situation that must be cleaned up.  He showed clear evidence of being able to deal with it in a comprehensive and useful manner.  Having heard Senator Henry's contribution, it is clear that it is a complex area in which lay people easily get confused, particularly because of the incremental and developing nature of our knowledge.  The efficiency of certain tests has increased and new tests have been introduced at various historical stages so that it was not possible to determine what infections had occurred. Hepatitis A, B, C, and D have been identified.  Hepatitis G has now been reached and the experts do not know where it will end.  As a lay person I am not competent to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he &ldquo;cannot change the way in which court cases are conducted. That is a matter outside my influence and I would ask no more than the acceptance of that simple fact by those who object to how cases are dealt with within our judicial system&rdquo;.  I cannot accept that.  I am a frequent litigant and I always ensure that I direct how cases are run.</P>
    <P>My last point relates to the disclosure of Mrs. McCole's name.  Would it not have been possible for her to have sued under a name such as &ldquo;Witness A&rdquo; as happens in other trials?  When we dealt with the refugee legislation, for example, the Government was extremely anxious to secure anonymity for people in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would like to say more but I must yield to my colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make two points. The first concerns the liability of the State in matters such as this.  The principle of strict liability should apply here just as it increasingly applies in the commercial world.  If blood transfusions were supplied by a private firm and not by the State that firm would be strictly liable when things went wrong.  By this <Col N="1960" /> I mean that the fact that blood was contaminated and infected patients would be enough to establish liability on the part of whoever supplied it; it would not be necessary to establish negligence or wrongdoing.  The damage caused is what creates the liability of the supplier not how it was caused.</P>
      <P>Second, the Minister for Health is not the only party deserving of criticism on this issue.  Mistakes were being made long before this Minister came into office.  I am more concerned with the behaviour, practices and attitudes of people in the organisations behind the Minister.  They cannot escape their due portion of blame.  For instance, one of those affected, a person to whom I spoke yesterday, had a blood transfusion in November 1991.  She felt reassured when the original announcement stated that only transfusions up to October of that year were at risk.  That information turned out to be false and later, to her horror, she found that the November transfusion had infected her.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the attitude which seems to prevail in some quarters to matters as grave as this.  The nation rightly expects a great deal from this tribunal and it will be our duty to scrutinise the report with a focus on the future not the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a difficult week for everybody involved and that includes the people in Positive Action who have done trojan work.  It has also been a difficult week for the Minister. Things have gone wrong, mistakes have been made, but we all make mistakes.  I appealed this morning on the Order of Business for us to deal with this as an issue focused debate rather than a personality focused debate.  I deal every day with people who have difficulty accepting an apology.  I have a very simple view&mdash;if people do not accept an apology they should reject it, but once it is accepted that should be the end of the matter.  The Minister assessed his <Col N="1961" /> position and offered an apology.  It is a difficult thing for a senior politician to do and it is a mark of the man's professional self-confidence that he did it.  I appreciate it and that should be the end of the matter.</P>
      <P>There is a problem here.  Things did go wrong.  I spent three hours in the Dáil yesterday and I have to say that, in my ten years here, I have never been so depressed and frustrated walking out of a debate even though I played no part in it.  I felt that the problems associated with the issue were lost in the political tensions between the parties.  It was not good for politics or public representation that none of us in either House emerges with honour from this level of debate and I share the blame with every other Member of the House.</P>
      <P>The problem arose when the lawyers ran riot.  I could never visualise the Minister standing over a dying person with a cheque in one hand and a form to be signed in the other.  That is not his style, that is not the man and anybody who thinks it is is misinterpreting the situation.  However, it is completely wrong that it should have happened and if there is blame to be cast, then it is on the Minister for his failure to control the lawyers.  We all know how difficult that is.  The Minister who rejects legal advice and then gets it wrong will never be forgiven; the Minister who accepts legal advice and gets it wrong will not be forgiven either.  It is a no win situation.  He should have pulled them back but it is very easy to make that point with the benefit of hindsight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More was achieved in the course of this Ministry than at any other time. Issues were dealt with but that does not help the people who are suffering.  That is where the difficulty arises because even though, as the Minister has said, compensation through the tribunal was as fairly administered as possible, it begged the questions about the truth, about who is responsible and where are we going.  No matter what amount of <Col N="1962" /> money was paid there was still going to be a demand for the truth that is why this tribunal had to be established.</P>
    <P>We had a motion in this House six or seven months ago and there was an amendment down in the names of most of the Independent Senators.  On the same day discussions took place between Positive Action and the Minister and late that afternoon Positive Action indicated that it felt the compensation tribunal should be given a chance and the amendment was not pressed. Both the Minister and Positive Action took the correct decision that day; it is an understatement for us to say now that things did not work out.  However, that does not mean that, with the facts people had at their disposal at that time, matters were dealt with improperly. That decision had to be taken but, now that we find ourselves in a mess, we should do our best to improve matters.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many times I have stood in this House and pleaded for the words &ldquo;in so far as it be possible&rdquo; to be deleted from Bills.  I know they are not the Minister's words; I know it is an anonymous draftsperson in some Department who is responsible.  I have argued for ten years that they should be in a Bill only if they are inserted after every paragraph, every section, and every subsection because if it is not possible then it cannot be done.  This is something that I have never understood.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to be open on these issues.  He will be judged on his record. There will be people who will always say he got it wrong and there will be others who will say he did it as well as any human could have done.  He said that he made mistakes.  The crucial mistakes made years ago were not made by Ministers, they were made by people in other places and we need to know where those mistakes were made.  In addressing these issues we are looking for a balance between recognition of the problems and finding the truth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1963" /> Compensation is an issue which has been dealt with.  Any wording in the motion we are doing tonight which gives a wrong impression should be eliminated. The fact that it might have to go back to the other House is not the issue; so be it.  We do not need to pour over the bones of this any more.  We do not need to know what went wrong in the last week but what went wrong all those years ago.  We want to know why mistakes were not corrected in time to prevent other people being infected and which delayed treatment as we see it.  I say &ldquo;as we see it&rdquo; because I am only informed to the extent of what I have read and been told.  I do not put myself forward as an expert.  I have avoided giving another lecture on the history of the issue or trying to point out where I think things went wrong.  We should get the evidence, get the truth, get the internal reports and move the matter forward so that at least people will know what happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming here.  It would have been so much easier for him not to do so.  That there is a certain amount of anger expressed here is only to be expected because there are many women who were infected through no fault of their own.  As a woman I feel for them. Decisions were made to administer anti-D. Those decisions were made in good faith by the women and the medical staff.  We have to find out why the blood was contaminated.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference are fair.  If they are broad enough to satisfy those who are most involved with the problem, who am I to say otherwise?  If it has satisfied them it should satisfy us.  I also agree with the time limit of 20 days for bringing back the report.  We do not want it to drag on and on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Terms of reference are usually set out before work is begun.  Those working on a project often find half way through <Col N="1964" /> their work that the terms of reference are constricting.  If that occurs in this case I hope the Minister will return to the House to seek an extension of the terms of reference.  Aspects may arise which require further examination of which we or the Minister have not thought.  I would like the terms of reference to be seen as enabling rather than restricting.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has taken many steps to ensure the safety of all blood products, both nationally and internationally. A conference was recently held in Adare, County Limerick, on that topic.  This is a move in the right direction. We need more research on blood products and the possibility of other contaminants.  We cannot sit still and say we have solved the problem.  We must be aware of the possibility of other problems which might require similar action in the months and years to come. I have every confidence in the Minister seeing this through and ensuring the women are recompensed for their suffering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Quinn about the strict liability of the State; I think it goes beyond the strict liability of the private sector.  I also agree that this Minister has probably done the job better than anybody else would have, or has done, in the circumstances. This is essentially an ethical question.  Although I am loathe to mention ethics, because on the scale of ethics we all stand condemned, nevertheless, the balance between the ethical and legal sides is still being got wrong. However belatedly, we should wholeheartedly recognise and accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is on the line now is not simply the credibility of the blood service and the Department of Health.  It is awful that we have to have clauses demanding full co-operation from the public service. Those of us who have regarded the integrity of the public service as a prize of this State find it very difficult to have <Col N="1965" /> to insist formally on it.  What is at stake now in the public mind is the credibility of the Oireachtas itself, that it be seen to get the terms of reference right, to want to get to the bottom of everything and to have no restrictive clauses.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I support what Senator O'Toole said about the unacceptability of the phrase &ldquo;in so far as that may be possible&rdquo;.  That clause intellectually insults the Oireachtas every time it is used.  I will oppose any amendment, or amendment to an amendment, which contains that clause.  The credibility of the Oireachtas itself is now more at stake than anything else.  That credibility should be sustained, which induces me to support the most open possible interpretation of everything and to oppose any attempt to restrict what we are now doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank all Senators who contributed to the debate.  Senators will appreciate that I will not be able to deal with all the matters which were raised but I will try to deal with some of them.</P>
      <P>I take full responsibility for the speech I delivered in the other House yesterday.  It is unfair to blame my officials in any way.  I always read my scripts and I read that script thoroughly. I do not want to continue the suggestion that the fault somehow lay with my officials.  The fault was with me and I accept responsibility.</P>
      <P>Many Senators spoke about a cover up.  A series of allegations have been made throughout this affair.  The allegations are that there is a lack of information in one area or another.  There is also an allegation of a cover up. However, if we were sure there was a major cover up we would not need the tribunal.  The tribunal is there to establish the facts.  We should proceed neutrally on that basis and stop making allegations at this stage.  We should let the tribunal of inquiry, under Justice Finlay, decide what is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1966" /> I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn, who spoke first on the Government side, for her support.  I was very interested in Senator Henry's contribution.  It is very important to get a medical view because matters are not as simplistic as they are frequently presented.  I particularly thank her for her supportive comments on the file which is being waved over me all the time and for clarifying that situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised a number of points.  I particularly agree with what he said about Senator Honan, to whom I wish a speedy recovery.  Remarks I made in the other House were not directed at Senator Honan but at the Progressive Democrats' spokesman in that House in the heat of debate.  No reference was made to Senator Honan who has on several occasions played a leading role in health debates in this House and no remark of mine was directed towards her.</P>
    <P>Somebody said we should contrast the situation with that of France.  The issue of people going to jail in France is always waved.  That issue concerned factor VIII and HIV in the 1980s.  We also had a problem with that here and Senators will recall it was the causal factor in the 1989 election.  Compensation was not being paid to victims, particularly haemophiliacs, who got HIV from the blood product, factor VIII.  The motion in the other House which, in effect, brought down the Government was on that issue.  The 1989 election had to be fought before compensation was paid.</P>
    <P>Members will see how much we have learned by the fact that on this occasion our first action was to ensure that compensation would be paid.  We modelled it in the first instance on the kind of trust fund which was put in place for the haemophiliacs.  We also tried to make very significant improvements on that so that, to pick up a point made by Senator Quinn, although liability is not admitted at the compensation tribunal, <Col N="1967" /> effectively it operates on the basis of strict liability.  There is no proof of liability &mdash; the connection between hepatitis and the infected blood or blood product simply has to be established in the case of the plaintiff, and then compensation is measured.  While it is not strict liability as outlined by the Senator, it is the concept under which compensation is paid.</P>
    <P>The Irish Haemophiliac Association was referred to by Senator Norris.  Many of its areas of concern, which Senator Norris listed, are encompassed in the terms of reference.  The Department will meet the organisation early next week to discuss all aspects of its concerns.  It is very important they are dealt with fairly.  They have been doubly injured because many people who got HIV in the late 1980s have been subsequently infected by hepatitis C.  That is a tragedy of double magnitude.  We always meet that organisation and have very good relationships with it; we are very careful of its concerns at all times.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee and Senator O'Toole referred to the wording of the amendment I have put before the House which states &ldquo;in so far as it may be possible&rdquo;. Amendments were tabled by the Opposition in the other House which had to be recast for technical reasons.  I can see the objections Senators might have to the words &ldquo;in so far as it may be possible&rdquo; but I am told it may be difficult for Justice Finlay to accede to the request we are making in the two Houses.</P>
    <P>I ask Members to recall the miscellaneous section in the terms of reference. When there is a requirement on the tribunal to report back on an interim basis, after 20 oral hearings days, part of that requirement is to report on the adequacy of the terms of reference.  This is not a cop out clause. It is simply that we do not want the Dáil or the Seanad to give a direction to the former Chief Justice which he would not be able to fulfil.  However, this amendment <Col N="1968" /> will be brought to his attention.  If he runs up against a blank wall and believes he needs a different term of reference, he can tell us what he needs in the interim report.  That is the context in which this is being put forward.  I would like Senators to accept it on that basis.  It is being put forward fairly and in combination with the miscellaneous terms of reference.  It meets the need.</P>
    <P>The second amendment directs Departments and State agencies to co-operate fully with the tribunal.  That amendment was brought forward by the Opposition in the Dáil and we had to alter it slightly for technical reasons. Occasionally in the other House the Government loses a Private Members' motion but that does not have force in terms of the Executive.  While Parliament does many things, it does not direct by way of motion.  Consequently, we wanted to word this in a way which was more appropriate.  Any Government decision has the force of compulsion on civil servants to deliver.  Government decisions are circulated to the relevant people in the Departments.  It goes without saying that it will be followed. The decision to set up the tribunal carries a consequence of co-operation.</P>
    <P>There are sanctions in the legislation under which a tribunal is set up.  The High Court has the power to compel witnesses and to order the production of documents.  Those powers are underpinned by legal sanctions, for example, fines of up to £10,000 on indictment and/or two years imprisonment.  The powers of the tribunal are strong.  I suggest the solution might be &mdash; we agreed this in the other House &mdash; that Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann would wish that persons as described would co-operate. By doing that, if the House were aware of non co-operation, it could take action by way of a motion, refer the matter to a special committee or deal with it in plenary session in the Dáil and Seanad.  One would have the <Col N="1969" /> motion, the original Government decision which is an instruction to public servants and particular civil servants, the sanctions of the tribunal under the Act and the express wish of both Houses which would be incorporated in the terms of reference and which would give Members the right to revisit this if they were unhappy.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept one of the amendments. The McCole letter laid out all the issues of concern about the infection which visited Mrs. McCole in 1976.  The initial questions in the letter are directed towards that area.  It will be possible to deal with them under the terms of reference of the tribunal. Senator Norris asked if there was an attempt to limit the investigation in respect of that.  There is no attempt to limit the investigation.  The last question which the family asked concerned the letter sent by the solicitors for the BTSB.  The complaint was that the manner in which the issue of costs was dealt with was very onerous and not in accordance with what would be expected in a case of such delicacy.  I hope I am paraphrasing that correctly.</P>
    <P>I am advised that we will have a problem if we accept that.  On account of the demarcation line between Parliament and the courts, the separation of powers is in danger of being infringed if Parliament seeks to pressurise by inquiry how any party conducts its litigation in the courts.  Parties are free provided they stay within the law and the rules of court.  Whatever other allegation is being made, there is no allegation that the solicitors in question did not stay within the law and the rules of court. They are free to defend their cases as they see fit in accordance with their legal advice.  There is a difficulty that we would be crossing the constitutional line.  The other requests made by Mrs. McCole's relatives are being dealt with fully within the terms of reference of the tribunal, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>That was one of the good recommendations <Col N="1970" /> made to the party leaders by Positive Action in its letter dealing with the terms of reference.  It was the first time I had seen that suggestion which I thought was an excellent one and we incorporated it in the terms of reference.  I would like it if Members did not press that amendment.  I can accept the spirit of the other amendments by recasting them as I have described.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for its co-operation. This is an issue which concerned many people and I am pleased that the debate has been conducted in a non-political way and that real issues were addressed.  I hope the new proposals, which would not have been in traditional judicial inquiries, will be effective. I hope the appointment by the Attorney General of counsel to serve the public interest will be an effective device. There have been criticisms that while all parties to a tribunal and the State are represented, the citizens &mdash; the public interest &mdash; is not.  On this occasion an independent counsel will be appointed which will be served by a solicitor from the private sector.</P>
    <P>In recent months a letter from the Chief State Solicitor's Office caused offence.  We recognise that and, consequently, we believe it would not be proper to staff the public interest team from that Office.  A solicitor from the private sector will serve in that capacity.  I cannot predict the role in which the public service team will engage because we are breaking new ground.  If the right people are in place, they will develop that role and if they are effective, they will be doing something on which future generations will insist in all tribunals.  I hope it is an effective tribunal.</P>
    <P>The second novel aspect of the terms of reference, if I may use that term, is the concept of an interim report.  We want Mr. Justice Finlay to be in a position to report back to us.  On the one hand we want him to report progress or the lack of it while on the other, we want him to tell us if he is having any <Col N="1971" /> difficulties which we may have the capacity to relieve.  If there is an early report back, both Houses can look at the matter again if necessary.  If the terms of reference have to be changed, we could do so quickly and to allow the tribunal to proceed.</P>
    <P>I envisage a situation where, if the terms of reference are not adequate to meet the need, they could be changed in one or either direction, and maybe both. First, if the tribunal is inhibited because of the terms of reference from pursuing a line of inquiry which it feels it should pursue, then the terms of reference will be changed.  On the other hand, if the terms of reference for one reason or another which we have not seen here or in the other House, enforce the tribunal to chase some irrelevancy, that the hare could be chased for the following three years without any particular benefit to anybody but because it had to be done under the terms of reference, then it would be proper that that would be pulled back also.  We are not predicting what may happen; we are putting the mechanism in place so that it can report back to both Houses.</P>
    <P>When the report is made I will communicate it to both Houses.  It will be a report to the Minister for Health but it will in no way be a report other than a report for Members' information.  The hearings of the tribunal will be in public under the Act, taking account of the anonymity issue which I mentioned already, and I hope it will proceed effectively.</P>
    <P>There is one last aspect of the terms of reference to which I would draw the <Col N="1972" /> attention of the House, that is, the introductory sections which, it seems to me, will allow contending counsel to meet in the first instance to establish common ground.  While the conclusions and recommendations of Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien's report have been put under severe pressure, I think contending counsel will find that they can agree much common ground arising from that report.</P>
    <P>Then there are all the documents of discovery.  There are over 5,000 documents which have been discovered at the BTSB in the course of the late Mrs. Brigid McCole's High Court case and all those documents are available.  Therefore, this tribunal will start much farther up the road than a previous tribunal.  I thank Justice Finlay for taking on this onerous task. I wish him well and every success.</P>
    <P>Finally, by way of explanation, the 20 day report is not due in 20 days time but after 20 oral hearing days which puts it a little further down the line than 20 days from now.  I am grateful to the Seanad for an analytical debate which has brought many issues to my attention. I am sorry I am not able to reply to all of them on an individual basis but we may get an opportunity in the future to return to this issue.</P>

      <P>Senator Daly and I have raised this matter in the House on a number of occasions.  It was agreed in 1992 to establish a community school in Kilrush.  Discussions took place between the three schools concerned &mdash; the Covent of Mercy secondary school, the Kilrush Christian Brothers school and the vocational school.  A site was acquired from the Christian Brothers school and it was decided to have the community school on a single site there. Progress has been made since then in proceeding with the plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new architect was employed in the Department at that stage some months ago and they decided to redesign the plans for the proposed school.  This has caused a delay.  While it is appreciated that funding has been provided for this school in the 1996 building programme, there is concern locally that this money be secured and the school maintain its priority position.  It is important we receive assurance on that from the Minister <Col N="1977" /> because the situation in Kilrush is totally unacceptable.  Teachers and children are moving between three locations in the town, one of which is a ten minute walk.  If there is heavy rain the children are in wet clothes all day.</P>
    <P>Some months ago, the Convent of Mercy sold its property and the secondary school must be vacant by 1 June 1997 which means over 200 students who use that facility will have nowhere to go.  The provision of temporary buildings in Kilrush at a future date, or any such proposal, is unacceptable.  The new school must go ahead quickly.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that the building unit give priority to this and that everything be done as quickly and expeditiously as is humanly possible so that a new school will be in place by 1 September 1997.  Anything less would be unacceptable.  I appreciate the difficulties in the workings of the system, but there have been other instances in the town where building work has been completed quickly.  There is no reason one should suggest or accept that because it is a Department matters should move five times slower than in the private sector.  On this occasion, it is vital we proceed rapidly.</P>
    <P>We appreciate and are thankful for the support the Minister has given to us to date, the manner in which the site was acquired and the preparatory work done.  A change of personnel in the design team resulted in a change in the design of the school and local people now have the type of school they wished for which was in the previous plan.  I impress upon the Minister the importance of taking quick action in this matter so that a school will be in place on 1 September 1997.</P>

      <P>It is now four years since a decision was made to build a new school in Kilrush.  There have been numerous delays in completing the project and getting it underway.  Part of the overall design was that some of the existing <Col N="1978" /> buildings would be reconstructed and some of that work has been completed, to the great dissatisfaction of both parents and teachers.  We were taken on a tour of inspection.  Anyone would agree that the work left a lot to be desired. The feeling was that, in the further stage of development, additional work should be carried out to some of the renovated buildings so that we would put in place a school capable of meeting the second level education needs in Kilrush for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>At this stage, parents, teachers and pupils who attend the schools are frustrated and annoyed at the delays and cannot understand why it should take so long to put a building in place, bearing in mind that the pupils attending the school are scattered in three locations in the town.  The inconvenience of that is putting pupils at the college at a serious disadvantage.  It must be remedied as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>It is feared locally that the latest change in the design will delay further the allocation of funds.  When designs are changed, a procedure where the technicalities are examined must be gone through again.  The new design may not meet the budget provisions for the original one.  There is a fear in the community and board of management that the new design, when examined by departmental technical experts, may be more expensive and be objected to by the Department.  There is a genuine fear that the new design may delay funding, although it is welcome and the parents and board of management are agreeable to it.  They want an assurance there will be no change in the funding already committed: £250,000 for this year, £1 million next year and £500,000 the year after.  They are fearful that, if other buildings elsewhere in the country are ready to proceed to tender stage, the money earmarked for this project, which has still to go through a number of stages including planning permission may be allocated to some other project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1979" /> That would further delay the allocation of funding for the completion of this project.</P>
    <P>The children must attend three different locations in all weathers.  The inconvenience to them and to teachers and parents is unjustified and uncalled for at this stage.  I thank the Minister of State for coming here this evening and Senator Taylor-Quinn for affording me some of her time to support the completion of the project at the earliest opportunity.  The time taken between the various stages should be reduced so that this can proceed to planning and tender at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like for the information of the House to outline the background to the situation at Kilrush community school.  The second level schools in Kilrush, the Convent of Mercy, the Christian Brothers school and the vocational school, have amalgamated to form a new community school.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education completed the purchase in 1995 of property from the Christian Brothers in Kilrush for the purpose of providing the new community school.  The property comprised of approximately six acres and buildings used by the Christian Brothers' primary and secondary schools, Kilrush, and approximately nine acres nearby to be used as a playing field.</P>
      <P>Phase I of the project involved the refurbishment of the existing buildings. This work was completed in September 1995.  However, in advance of the completion of phase II, the school is continuing to use the existing accommodation. Phase II involves the provision of approximately 1,600 square metres of additional accommodation to cater for a long term enrolment of up to 450 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The technical staff of the Department's post primary building unit have completed their examination of the <Col N="1980" /> school and as a result it has been decided to demolish the CBS primary school instead of renovating it. Additional new accommodation will be provided to make up the shortfall. These amendments to the format of the project have unfortunately resulted in delays but the changes have been accepted by the school authorities.  The revised outline sketch scheme is currently being prepared by the design team appointed to undertake the architectural planning.</P>
    <P>There are two further stages of architectural design which the project must go through before tenders for the construction work can be obtained.  It is not possible at this point to give any definite date for the commencement of work on site.  However, the Department is fully aware of the pressing need for school accommodation in Kilrush, particularly in view of the non-availability of the convent secondary school from the end of the current academic year.</P>
    <P>The project will be accorded the highest priority in order to ensure that delays in providing the new buildings are minimised to the greatest extent possible and I assure the House that there will be no delay by the Department in processing the remaining architectural planning stages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in his absence for making one emphatic statement during the week at a press conference.  He said there is no scientific basis or justification for the selective ban requested by Russia on our beef exports to which he agreed.  He stands condemned out of his own mouth.  I agree with him that there is no scientific basis.  I will produce figures going back to 1989 to underline how unscientific and outrageous the Minister's decision is and how damaging it is and will be for the economy. <Col N="1981" /> If the Minister decided to introduce a ban in, for instance, Brittany, he should remember that Brittany, in the northwest of France, is in a different position from Tipperary which is in the heartland of Ireland and surrounded by seven counties.  Monaghan and Cork also have contact with other counties; Cork with Limerick, Waterford and Kerry.</P>
      <P>In its disease-free status France is not comparable to Ireland.  I was Minister for Agriculture for five years, perhaps the longest serving Minister with one exception since the foundation of the State.  When BSE broke out in Britain in 1989 I took the most stringent steps of any member state in Europe and any country in the world in relation to the control of BSE to reassure consumers at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>I demanded that the International Veterinary Agency in Paris and the Veterinary Committee of the EU meet.  I called the meetings and they unanimously endorsed Ireland's actions as being the most positive and effective. We introduced the slaughter policy immediately, which has cost over £14 million since.  The then Taoiseach asked me what it would cost.  I told him I did not know but that it would cost us much more if we did not do it.  The slaughter policy and the ban on the use and importation of meat and bone meal gave us a high standing in the eyes of the world.  We set the standard for other countries.  Now this Minister has made a craven decision in response to some veterinary officials, not even in response to his political counterpart in Russia, and with this craven surrender he had conceded the basis of disease-free status in Ireland which has been the envy of the world.  He has done worse by conceding it on a basis that has no scientific justification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one were worried about the number of incidents in Ireland, as external consumers will be, it is worth remembering the outbreak occurred in Britain. We have had 153 cases.  Britain, in the <Col N="1982" /> same period, has had 165,000 cases. There is no comparison.  I pleaded with this Minister to spend time in the last 12 months protecting the image of Irish beef and agriculture.  I did so and brought Pavarotti with me to promote Irish beef in Italy.  I visited Iran.  The Minister is so busy solving the British problem that he forgot he was creating a disaster for us.</P>
    <P>There is no analogy between the Irish and British situation but the Minister has now allowed our competitors to point out that the three banned counties have a total cattle population of 2 million, almost one-third of the total cattle population in Ireland.  If any competitor wants a stick to beat us with he can use the Minister's decision and say: &ldquo;Almost one third of our herd is affected.  Your Minister declared it. That is far too risky for us to consider allowing importation of Irish beef or livestock&rdquo;.  The Minister's words have condemned us.</P>
    <P>Is it not extraordinary that of the total cattle population in Ireland, one-third are in those three counties and that marginally over one-third of the incidence of BSE this year and since the 1989 outbreak in Britain occurred in the three counties concerned?  The level of outbreak in the three counties is marginally above the level of outbreak throughout the nation.  Does the Minister not realise there are people who can attack us with those figures if he is not prepared to vindicate the national position?</P>
    <P>If people really want figures to vindicate a case against us they could notice that there seems to be a much higher level of BSE in Wexford, the Minister's native county than in Tipperary, the county of his predecessor.  Wexford has had five cases in total, four of them this year.  Tipperary has had eight cases in total, four of them this year.  One might say Tipperary has had twice as many cases this year though a little less than three quarters as many over the whole <Col N="1983" /> period but Tipperary's cattle population is almost three times that of Wexford. The incidence of this disease is much higher in Wexford than Tipperary.  I am not making a political appeal to a Wexford Minister, asking him not to be so harsh on us.  He stands condemned by his own decision on this nonsense ban. Our competitors will have ample ammunition, as they did in my time, by virtue of the Minister's outrageous actions.  If he is making these decisions he should include his own county, which has a higher level of incidence than Tipperary. I am not being parochial as the facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>My predecessors and I spent a long time with our veterinary services building up the &ldquo;white country status&rdquo; for Ireland.  We invested much time and effort and Ireland's status was the best in the world.  This Minister has thrown it away with one stupid decision.  The Minister tells us that the gun was put to his head by some veterinary officials.  I have met veterinary officials from Iran, Libya, Egypt and many other places but they would not be allowed to put a gun to my head.  I met my counterpart in Iran and he met me here and we sent our officials and vets to talk to theirs and <i>vice versa.</i>  However, we are being asked to believe that within five minutes of a veterinary official going back he tells our Minister that he must either agree to this now or else.  Even if he had that authority &mdash; and I doubt if he did &mdash; in the interests of maintaining what we have built up over the years the Minister should have refused to do business on those terms.  He should have made it clear that we could not make a concession that is not in accordance with the facts and that would undermine our status elsewhere, be it in Saudi Arabia or Iran.</P>
    <P>I do not want to claim special credit but I was recognised as the Minister who did this not just for Ireland but for Europe.  My approach is made not for <Col N="1984" /> Tipperary or for farmers but for the economy in general.  I have never been as concerned as I am on this occasion that a craven, mistaken and unjustifiable decision has done so much damage to the whole country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan) Jimmy Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Kennedy for raising this matter.  I am glad to have this opportunity to deal with Irish exports of beef to Russia in the relative calm of this House.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I could begin with some background.  There is a history of the import of Irish beef into the former USSR and, more recently, Russia.  The level of trade has varied substantially through the years depending mainly on production patterns in the USSR and Russia which, in turn, determined supply, demand and prices.  For quite a period, sales to the USSR and Russia were sourced mainly from intervention stocks.  Commercial sales took off in 1994 when the level of export refunds to Russia was increased thus making this trade economic.</P>
      <P>It also coincided with the transformation of the Russian food market following the break-up of the USSR.  This fact, together with a decline in Russian production following difficulties associated with privatising the agriculture sector, has resulted in a substantial steady increase in the export of Irish beef to Russia.  In 1995 some 100,000 tonnes of beef was exported to Russia valued at around £325 million, making it the largest market for Irish beef outside the EU.  It continues to be the most important third country market for Irish beef in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The confirmation of the first BSE cases in Ireland in 1989 caused difficulties for Irish beef sales to a number of third countries, including Russia.  In the autumn of 1990 the USSR authorities raised concerns about accepting Irish intervention beef.  The sale from intervention <Col N="1985" /> was only cleared following the visit of their chief veterinary officer to Ireland to inspect our health controls at first hand.</P>
    <P>In July 1993 the Russian authorities suspended imports of Irish beef because of BSE related concerns.  Again the ban was lifted following the visit of a high level veterinary delegation to Ireland and the negotiation of a veterinary certificate which included certain specific animal health assurances required by the Russian authorities.  The point I would like to stress is that BSE related concerns in Russia are not new and it is only since 1994 that a consistent commercial trade developed in that market.</P>
    <P>The most recent and most serious BSE crisis commenced following the House of Commons statement on 20 March, and we are all aware of the subsequent wave of consumer concern and market closures which followed. However, the Russian market remained open during this period because of ongoing contacts with the Russian authorities and their satisfaction with the comprehensive series of controls in place here which ensured the safety and quality of beef exports.  In addition, a permanent Russian veterinary official was assigned to Ireland to monitor the filling of contracts and the loading of ships to Russia.  The presence of this official has facilitated the continuing trade to Russia at a time when difficulties were being experienced in a number of other markets.  Therefore, the Russian authorities have been updated on the BSE situation on an ongoing basis and are relatively familiar with the control system here.</P>
    <P>During recent months, the Russian authorities began to express concerns regarding the increasing level of BSE in Ireland.  There have been 38 cases of BSE in Ireland in 1996 to date, which is more than double the number of cases in 1995 and is higher than the level of cases in any year to date.  During the <Col N="1986" /> visit of a trade delegation which I led to Moscow in mid-September the Russian veterinary authorities raised the increasing level of cases in Ireland and a ban was threatened though not implemented at that time.  Despite reassurances provided, the issue was raised again on the margins of a veterinary conference in Malta two weeks ago.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach contacted the Russian Prime Minister, Mr. Chernomyrdin at that time, and the Tánaiste spoke to the Russian Foreign Minister.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, contacted his Russian counterpart.  Russia's chief veterinary officer was invited here and following a review of the situation in Moscow it was decided that he would come here with a delegation of experts to study the situation at first hand.</P>
    <P>There was no complacency on the part of the Government to a developing situation.  The Minister, Deputy Yates, personally kept in constant contact with the situation.  No useful purpose would have been served in advertising to the world that we had BSE related difficulties with Russia or in talking about trade restrictions where none actually existed.</P>
    <P>I would like to describe in some detail the events of last week.  The chief veterinary officer of the Russian Federation and a delegation of veterinary experts visited Ireland from 7 to 12 October to review the controls in place and to study the epidemiology of the disease in Ireland.  The Russian team completed a comprehensive programme of visits covering beef plants, rendering plants, ports and laboratories.  I met with the delegation during their stay, as did the Minister, Deputy Yates, and the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>At the end of the week the Russian delegation put forward a Protocol which set out the basis for the continuation of the importation of beef from Ireland by Russia.  Apart from age and labelling requirements which do not present major problems, the Protocol included <Col N="1987" /> categorisation by counties and the exclusion of up to seven counties from the Russian market.  They selected the counties.  The basis for the selection, while not altogether clear, was based on their study of the figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly is not clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was linked, however, to the level of the disease in the various counties in 1996.  The Russian side made it very clear that if the Protocol was not agreed an immediate ban would be recommended and implemented on all Irish beef with effect from 1 November.  Notwithstanding the threat of a ban, the proposed categorisation was opposed vigorously and it was argued in strong terms that there was no scientific justification for the measure.  The Friday, 11 October, meeting ended without any resolution of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following consultations at a high level, the negotiations resumed later that evening.  The Russian side continued to insist upon categorisation but they did agree to drop the number of counties to be excluded to three &mdash; Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan &mdash; and that beef for Russia could be sourced from any approved plant in any county. I should add that it was not a case of swapping counties, adding one county would not get another removed.  It was also agreed that the restrictions would be temporary and would be reviewed every three months and that if the incidence of the disease improved in the counties concerned then the restrictions would be relaxed.  These were important considerations.  We continued to oppose the measure and it was only following further consultations at high level that a decision was taken reluctantly to sign the Protocol.  The Protocol was signed in the departure lounge of Dublin Airport on Saturday, 12 October.  A member <Col N="1988" /> of the delegation, an epidemiologist, is staying in Ireland to study the BSE disease further.</P>
    <P>I would like to state very clearly that the decision was taken on practical grounds and with the greatest reluctance. However, the stark choice we were facing was the complete closure of the Russian market to all Irish beef or the exclusion of three counties on a temporary basis with an agreed mechanism to relax this restriction in due course.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances we made the only possible choice.  The closure of a market of the size of Russia would have been disastrous for the Irish beef industry at a difficult time.  Not enough thought has been given to the reality of a ban and what it means.  It would mean that our trade would be excluded from a market with an import requirement of almost 500,000 tonnes of beef.  Contacts would be lost and competitors would be established.  We all know that trade creates more trade and the worst scenario would be for our trade to be cut off from the contacts and buyers with whom they have built a relationship over the past two years.  The loss of the Russian market would put us into safety net intervention and would mean a drop in producer prices of 4p per pound.  The consequence of a build up of intervention stock could undermine Russia as a commercial market.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that categorisation or regionalisation would have an impact on other third country markets.  I do not accept this.  However, a ban in a market the size of Russia would definitely have an impact.  Therefore, I completely reject the argument that it would have been better to accept a ban rather than a limited form of regionalisation.  The Russian market remains open and Irish traders can continue to exploit the real opportunities which exist in this market. While the Minister, Deputy Yates, was prepared to reluctantly accept limited regionalisation in respect of Russia, as it is our most important third country <Col N="1989" /> market, it is not proposed to accept it in any other third countries.  It is also the Minister's intention to travel to Russia at an early date to seek a relaxation of the restrictions on these counties.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concerns of the farmers in the counties concerned and I accept that the measures are not justified on scientific or other grounds.  The meat from these counties is as safe to eat as that from any other county. However, the Minister was faced with the stark choice of protecting the Irish beef industry and, in the circumstances, I am satisfied the right decision was taken.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that the negotiations could have been prolonged.  First, as I indicated earlier, a ban would have been promulgated from last Monday and, second, our beef trade needed to know now where it stood as regards entering into future contracts.  The filling of a contract, particularly of the high volume type supplied to Russia, takes weeks to organise.  It is naive to think that this could be let run up to the end of October and that trade would flow from then.  Stalling the negotiations was not an option.</P>
    <P>My impression is that while the meat trade may not like the conditions or restrictions, it is anxious to continue slaughtering and to do business in Russia. Contrary to earlier expectations commercial sales of beef from Ireland have performed quite well.  This can be demonstrated by the fact that our usage of intervention has been less than expected.  We have put 40,000 tonnes of beef into emergency intervention which is a good deal less than original predictions when figures of 100,000 tonnes were mentioned.  Arising from this we should do everything possible to maintain the momentum of commercial sales and there is no basis for the fatalistic comments with regard to animals and products from Counties Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan.</P>
    <P>We have a market in Europe for over 200,000 tonnes of beef without any restrictions.  The EU has set down the guidelines for trade and we comply with <Col N="1990" /> these.  Other third country markets have the potential to take 100,000 tonnes and we have individual veterinary certificates and Protocols with these countries. The cliché of &ldquo;talking ourselves into a crisis&rdquo; holds particularly true in this case.</P>
    <P>The real culprit in this is BSE.  Much of the comment that has been made seems to be based on the assumption that we do not have BSE and that it only exists in Britain.  We have BSE and the present predicament arises from the upsurge of cases during the summer.  I accept that the number of cases is small and it is not reasonable to draw conclusions from changes in low incidence figures.  However, the discussions with third countries are held in the context that we are a country with BSE, albeit at a low level.  It highlights the need to ensure that we have effective controls. Everything is being done to ensure that the controls are effective and properly enforced and nothing less than full cooperation from farmers and from the industry generally in their enforcement is expected and accepted.</P>
    <P>At this stage, we need less recrimination and inaccurate and intemperate reaction on how we have arrived at the current situation.  The Protocol is a reality; accepting a full ban is not. Therefore, we need to move on and support the trade in seeking new contracts and implementing smoothly the Russian requirements.</P>
    <P>No case is seen for regionalising cattle prices.  The ultimate aim is to ensure our BSE controls are fully effective and that we get rid of the disease.  BSE has given rise to many unpleasant decisions.  It was not easy to depopulate herds of what appear to be healthy and valuable animals with just one case of BSE but experience has shown this to be the right decision.  I compliment the Minister for putting the policy in place at the time.  Banning the feeding of meat and bonemeal caused disruption but it was the right decision.  Further regulations the Minister has put in place recently will help enforce that decision because not everybody complied with that ban.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1991" /> It has not been easy to accept regionalisation for the Russian market if only on a temporary basis.  However, I believe it was the right decision and that experience will show this to be the case.  In all the circumstances, I consider that the Minister, Deputy Yates, acted in the best interest of the agriculture sector, of the beef industry including farmers, beef processors and workers.</P>
