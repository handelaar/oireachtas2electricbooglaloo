      <P>It is proposed to take items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 18, motion 29.  Item 1 will conclude today and will be taken from now until 1 o'clock.  There will be 15 minutes for each speaker and if the need arises speakers may share their time, but I do not think that will happen. Item 2 will be taken from 2 o'clock to 3 o'clock, with Second Stage concluding today.  Item 3 will be taken from 3 o'clock to 4.30 p.m.  Depending on the number offering, speakers will not have more than ten minutes each.  The Tánaiste will open that debate. Members may share their time.  Item 4 will be taken from 4.30 p.m. to 6 o'clock with 15 minutes per speaker.  Item 18, motion 29, will be taken in normal Private Members' time.</P>

      <P>Item 29 deals with tourism, which is an issue that has been raised by many Senators on both sides <Col N="2070" /> of the House.  We tabled this Private Members' Motion to get the debate on tourism going.  If it suits the Leader's agenda, can this item be brought back after Easter when we will be coming into the tourist season?  I am aware that for various reasons some Senators are not here today, but they would like to have an opportunity to promote their own areas at a future date.  Perhaps the Leader could consider that after Easter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader organise an early debate on the failure to implement legislation enacted 12 months ago providing for the seizure of assets related to the illegal drugs trade. Such a debate could examine the extension of powers currently enjoyed by the Revenue Commissioners to the Garda Síochána.  We currently have a bizarre situation whereby the Revenue Commissioners, which is not a law enforcement agency, actually has more powers than the Garda Síochána in the matter of seizing assets.  It is a matter that concerns Members on both sides of the House.  Can the Leader assist by identifying an appropriate time at which we could debate this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I caught the end of what was being said here and I have to say <Col N="2071" /> that we have had a wide ranging debate on drugs.  Drug seizures, particularly seizures of cannabis, are complete and utter nonsense.  They are a waste of time and mean nothing.  Some of them were the result of sting operations and were not what the public was led to believe.</P>
      <P>There are a number of ways to deal with the problem, although removing the financial incentive on a worldwide basis is the only way to eliminate it. Thousands of millions of pounds have been spent in the United States and it has not had the slightest impact.  The Leader of the House could do something which might be positive in a small way.  He could ensure that this House recognises and debates the report of the Inner City Partnership, which is being presented to the Minister for Finance today.</P>
      <P>The partnership, which has worked in the inner city with deprived communities, is seeking a modest sum of money to deal with unemployment.  Levels of unemployment are at 80 per cent and 90 per cent in some deprived areas in the north and south inner city and that is what provides a fertile market for drugs. It would be helpful if we could inject about £30 million into these areas.  Up to £100 million was spent in Temple Bar, in ways which some of us would find questionable, and the Financial Services Centre was built in Sheriff Street. Can some money be directed at the population in the inner city areas, which is not just the source of the problem but is also the victim?  That would do something about the drug problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister for the Environment or the Minister for Social Welfare come to the House to discuss rent systems for local authority housing?  An eviction was featured on a radio programme recently and RTE saved the day for the person involved. However, how many people are evicted about whom we do not hear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be a system whereby rent could be stopped out of social welfare payments.  The most important <Col N="2072" /> thing anybody can have is a roof over their head.  It is also unfair that local authorities are obliged to subsidise the Department of Social Welfare in that they are expected to provide housing at a differential rent which is uneconomic. The local authorities are therefore unable to keep housing in a proper state of repair.</P>
    <P>If people are unable to pay rent they should be subsidised by the Department of Social Welfare.  Local authorities have no funds, because there are no rates, and no way of getting funding. They cannot get sufficient funding to comply with the regulations.  It is time the system was discussed and amended. There should be a system whereby rent could be stopped from social welfare payments so that no person would have to be evicted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be happy to make time available after Easter for a debate on tourism.  I am aware a number of Members who are not present today would like to contribute to such a debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis asked if all Stages of item 2 would be taken today.  I do not envisage that being necessary.  I would prefer to conclude the debate on county enterprise boards today but if there is a demand we can order it again.  I am trying to allocate short amounts of time for the many topics raised during the course of the year so that we can cover topics of interest to Members.  However, if there is a demand for more time I will make it available.  I would welcome another debate on the Independent Radio and Television Commission and on broadcasting generally.  The last debate was helpful but we had not exhausted all the possibilities of that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Roche raised the question of the seizure of drugs.  That matter is envisaged in item 17 on today's Order Paper and it will be the subject of one of the first debates in the new session.  I will allow adequate time for a wide ranging debate.  Time will also be allocated early in the new session for a <Col N="2073" /> debate on the Inner City Partnership which was suggested by Senator Norris. Most of the points raised by Senator Farrell could have been raised yesterday in the course of the debate on the Social Welfare Bill but were not.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Consultation Paper on Representation of" RHead="Emigrants in Seanad Éireann: Statements">
    <Title>Consultation Paper on Representation of Emigrants in Seanad Éireann: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Seanad has agreed to have this debate so soon after the publication of the consultation paper on Representation of Emigrants in Seanad Éireann.  The reason for publishing the consultation paper was to focus public debate not just on the issues of principle involved but on the details of how a scheme of representation might work. In this way we aim to ensure that people know exactly what is involved before they are asked to vote on the issue at a referendum.</P>
      <P>It is just over a year since the Minister addressed this House during a debate on Seanad representation for emigrants. Since then further consideration of the matter led to the view that, in the interest of clarity for the electorate, details of the proposals should be published and debated in advance instead of compressing any public debate into the relatively short period that usually elapses between the passing of a Constitution Amendment Bill and the subsequent referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The paper states in the introduction that the Government will consider carefully any suggestions emerging in the course of the consultation process &mdash; notably in relation to the position of Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland. It is particularly appropriate that the first formal consideration of the paper should be in the Upper House.  As the House is aware, the debate on emigrant representation has been going on for several years and has been subject of <Col N="2074" /> debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The present proposals arise from a commitment in the policy agreement A Government of Renewal, which states that provision will be made to allow for the election of three Members of Seanad Éireann by Irish emigrants. Implementing this commitment requires the approval of the people to amending the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The consultation paper includes the proposed amendment to Article 18 of the Constitution.  It is straightforward and would enable provision to be made by law for the election of three Members of Seanad Éireann by Irish citizens resident outside the State who were formerly resident in the State. Under that arrangement the number of nominated Members of the Seanad would be reduced to eight so that the total number of Senators would not increase.  The expression &ldquo;emigrant&rdquo; has not been included in the text of the proposed amendment because it could imply a degree of permanent absence and could have the unintended effect of excluding from the franchise a citizen working abroad for a number of years who intends to return to live in the State at some future time.</P>
    <P>If the proposed amendment of the Constitution is approved by the people, it will be necessary to enact legislation on the various aspects of an electoral process to enable the three emigrant representatives to be elected.  During the progress of such legislation through both Houses, Members would have an opportunity to debate the details of that legislation.  However, it is important that the people should be aware of the details before they are asked to vote. Suggestions in relation to each of the issues involved are set out in the consultation paper.</P>
    <P>Who should be eligible to vote for the three Senators?  The paper proposes that an emigrant elector should be a citizen of Ireland, have reached the age of 18 years, have been resident in the State for a minimum period of ten years, and be now resident outside the State but not for a period exceeding 20 years. <Col N="2075" /> Such a person could apply for registration in accordance with the proposed legislation.  However, a person would not be entitled to be registered as an emigrant elector if the person is for the time being registered as a Dáil elector pursuant to the Electoral Act, 1992, or an elector in a university constituency pursuant to the Seanad Electoral (University Members) Act, 1937.  The latter point will have particular interest for some Members of this House.  Apart from this, Members may have views on the time periods.  In particular, should the qualifying periods suggested for residence in the State and for residence outside the State be longer or shorter?</P>
    <P>Under the proposed amendment, Irish citizens who have lived in the State for the requisite period and who move to live in Northern Ireland will be eligible to vote at Séanad elections. However, Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland who did not previously live in the State for the requisite period would not be eligible to vote.  Senators will appreciate that this is one of the particularly difficult issues to be addressed in framing the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>Who should be eligible to stand for election?  The proposal is that the qualifications which apply for Dáil membership would apply in the case of Senators representing emigrants.  Thus, every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of 21 years and who is not placed under disability or incapacity by the Constitution or by law would be eligible to stand for election.  Every candidate would have to be nominated, with his or her consent, in writing on a prescribed nomination paper, signed by not fewer than 50 persons each of whom must be registered as an emigrant elector for the constituency concerned.  An emigrant elector would not be allowed join in the nomination of more than one candidate at an election.</P>
    <P>In the event of the electorate being divided into constituencies, a person would not be allowed to be nominated as a candidate, or a replacement candidate, <Col N="2076" /> in respect of more than one constituency. It is proposed that the returning officer would arrange for the provision of nomination papers at Irish diplomatic and consular missions and at other appropriate places, and supply a nomination paper, free of charge, to every person applying.</P>
    <P>Every nomination paper would have to be delivered to the returning officer not later than the latest time for receiving nominations, as fixed by the Minister for the Environment by order.  The returning officer would rule on the validity of a nomination paper within 24 hours of its delivery to him or her.  A candidate could withdraw by a notice in writing, signed by the candidate or by not fewer than half of the persons who signed the nomination paper.  Such notice would have to be delivered to the returning officer not later than the latest time for receiving nominations.</P>
    <P>Elections involving emigrants would be held on the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote and by secret ballot. An aspect on which some organisations representing emigrants have expressed a concern is the question of whether there would be one or more constituencies. In the last analysis, this would depend on the number and location of emigrants who apply for inclusion in the register.  When the composition of the register is known, a decision could be made on whether there should be separate constituencies and, if so, what constituencies. One possibility would be one for North America, one for the UK, and one for other countries, but the feasibility of this would depend entirely on the number involved at different locations.  Initially, it is envisaged that the legislation would provide for a single constituency, with power to effect a division into two or three constituencies at a later stage; this would be done by the Minister for the Environment, by order made with the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Another question which arises is the filling of a vacancy in one of the three emigrant Senators' seats.  Because of the <Col N="2077" /> logistics, it is not proposed that there should be a by-election to fill a vacancy in emigrant member representation. Instead, it is proposed to apply the system which operates for European Parliament elections.  Under this system, casual vacancies among the representatives of emigrant electors in the Seanad would be filled by the replacement candidate of the representative concerned. Where the candidate did not nominate a replacement candidate, or if the replacement candidate, or candidates, so nominated were unable or unwilling to fill the vacancy, a fall-back position would be provided for, similar to that applying at European Parliament elections.</P>
    <P>At an election of emigrants representatives, voting would be by post.  Each elector would be required to produce to an authorised person the envelope addressed to the elector by the returning officer, the unmarked ballot paper and the form of declaration of identity.  The elector would make and sign the declaration of identity which would be witnessed by the authorised person and stamped with the stamp of the authorised person's office.  The elector would then mark the ballot paper, in secret, in the presence of the authorised person and send the ballot paper and declaration of identify to the returning officer by post.</P>
    <P>For voting purposes, &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; would be defined as an officer of an Irish diplomatic or consular mission authorised for this purpose by the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, or a commissioner for oaths, notary public or other person before whom, in accordance with the law of the country in which the voting takes place, a formal declaration may be made.  An emigrant elector who is in the State at the time of an election would be able to vote here; &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; in such a case would include a commissioner for oaths or notary public in the State.</P>
    <P>Whatever arrangements are made for emigrant representation, an important aspect will be the cost involved.  Costs would arise in establishing and maintaining <Col N="2078" /> the register of electors, conducting the elections and in respect of the salaries and travel and subsistence expenses of the new Senators.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to say at this stage what the overall level of expenditure will be as it will depend, to a large extent, on the number of emigrant citizens who register as electors and the country of residence of the representatives they elect.  My Department has made very tentative estimates of the net extra cost of the scheme over the five year life of a Seanad and these range from £3.55 million to £10.3 million.</P>
    <P>The £3.55 million figure assumes an electorate of 50,000 and is made up of annual registration costs of £550,000, election costs of £500,000 and Members' annual travel and subsistence expenses of £60,000.  The £10.3 million figure assumes a very high total electorate of 500,000 and is made up of annual registration costs of £1 million, election costs of £5 million and Members' annual travel and subsistence expenses of £60,000. I would like to stress that these are only indicators of what costs might be on certain assumptions about the likely level of interest in emigrant voting.  We will not know the size of the register, the spread of the electors and, therefore, the cost until the first register is compiled.</P>
    <P>Every person in Ireland is touched, to some extent, by emigration and I hope therefore that the consultation paper will receive extensive consideration and debate.  When the consultation process is complete, the proposals will be reviewed by the Government in the light of the views expressed, before the necessary Constitution Amendment Bill is finalised later this year and formally introduced in the Oireachtas.  Publication of these comprehensive proposals for Seanad representation is a significant step forward.  It should assist all concerned to focus on the specific issues involved, some of them complex and difficult, and to make a constructive input to the preparation of the necessary implementing legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2079" /> I look forward to hearing Senators' views on the subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a cause for disappointment that, after all the discussion that has taken place, we are still at a very early stage of consultation in relation to this issue.  As the Minister mentioned, a discussion took place on this subject on a motion by Senator McDonagh just over a year ago.  At that time the Minister gave an indication of the broad framework which he saw for providing representation for emigrants; it does not appear to have been advanced to any great extent in the last year.  Some discussion has taken place about how the mechanics of this scheme will operate.  The issue has now come back to this House; perhaps the all-party committee which was suggested here last year could look at this issue and maybe come up with recommendations on how emigrant representation could be provided.</P>
      <P>When the initial decision to deal with representation in this manner was made emigrants felt it was inadequate.  As an interim measure, however, it was an acceptable first step to providing Dáil representation.  The emigrant body will be disappointed that, despite the Bill which was, I think, introduced by the late Gerry O'Sullivan in 1991, and the numerous discussions in both Houses over the last ten or 12 years, detailed conclusions, which would give emigrants the prospect of representation in the next election, still have not been reached.  Even with the best will in the world, it is unlikely we will have a constitutional amendment in time for the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State could give us a more definite timetable of how matters will progress because unless the Government is serious about it &mdash; it does not appear to be &mdash; nothing will be done before the general election next year.  Unless we urgently seek a constitutional change and pass new legislation quickly through the Houses of the <Col N="2080" /> Oireachtas, it is unlikely that emigrants will be represented in the Seanad.  Emigrants will be disappointed and will feel let down that their case for representation, which they made so eloquently over the past ten or 12, is not getting the response from these Houses which they had expected.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to discuss the complications which may arise from these proposals &mdash; I am sure many of these will be teased out in further discussion of the legislation &mdash; but it appears we are taking a short cut by using three of the Taoiseach's 11 nominees without being clear about how they will be selected.  It would be better if the Government set out clearly how it will establish a new panel for emigrants, on the same lines as the sub-panel used for university representation with an elected base, rather than accepting what is suggested here.</P>
    <P>In view of the uncertainty about the procedure and how it will work in practice, a constitutional amendment is likely to be rejected.  That would put the issue back for many years.  It would be difficult to pass a constitutional amendment on the information in this document. I am not certain the people would vote for it.  If the constitutional change proposed was rejected, the shape and form of representation would be put back by many years.  The Government must make a decision urgently.  There is uncertainty, for example, about how Northern Ireland will be approached. Senator Roche will address this matter later.  It is difficult to see how the matter will be dealt with in legislation, given the way it is currently framed.</P>
    <P>There is also indecision about constituencies. The Minister mentioned the prospect of three constituencies, North America, the UK and one other.  The document mentions one and three constituencies. People should know whether there will be one or three constituencies. In the absence of a response about the size, composition or location of the electorate, it is difficult to plan for it.  Would it be advisable for the Minister to establish a panel before she drafts the legislation, or is she legally <Col N="2081" /> entitled to do that?  I am not sure it can be done.  It would be useful to know the size and composition of the electorate when planning and shaping the constituencies and deciding on the representation. The Minister also mentioned the prospect that 50 people would be entitled to nominate a candidate.  The panel could consist of 50 people if there are three constituencies.  Can the Minister tell us the size of the electorate?  It may be necessary to have a panel of 50 people to nominate a candidate, but the electorate may only be 100 or less.</P>
    <P>The arrangements will not be adequate to deal with the possibility of having representation here after the next election.  We do not have the type of detailed knowledge necessary to enable the House to pass legislation to establish the constituency panels.  The document is vague in this regard, but perhaps that is the intention.  We now have the opportunity to express our views on how this might be improved. The system being adopted will be cumbersome, impractical to operate and it will lead to confusion and perhaps rejection of the constitutional amendment. The Government must be more clear and decisive about how these matters will be dealt with if we want to push it through.</P>
    <P>Seanad representation was seen by many of the emigrant organisations and bodies as a minimalist step or a sop to emigrants.  I do not share that view.  This proposal is worthwhile provided it is streamlined in a way which will make it effective and efficient.  The Minister said this document is a consultation paper.  I strongly favour a panel system for emigrants, with an electorate similar to that for the university panels, rather than using three of the Taoiseach's 11 nominees.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6 suggests that the Clerk of the Seanad would be involved in the preparation of the electoral list.  I am not sure that is the type of activity in which the Clerk of the Seanad should be involved.  Perhaps the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of <Col N="2082" /> the Environment could organise it.  The Returning Officer for the Seanad elections has onerous responsibilities during the Seanad elections.  Another burden would further complicate the situation. It would be more efficient and effective if the Government decided to have a separate panel for emigrants.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State could outline the views represented to her by the emigrant bodies.  When the Minister spoke in the House last year he indicated that it was his intention to have discussions with the emigrant organisations to seek their views as to how this would work in practice.  I am not sure to what extent that consultation took place.  The Minister might say if there is any documentation indicating the views expressed to the Government by the emigrant bodies on this issue.  Did comprehensive consultations take place and what bodies were in communication with the Department before this document was prepared?  Looking through the consultation document it appears that there was not much consultation with the emigrant bodies.  Perhaps the Minister might refer to notes of any discussions which took place and the points expressed to the Minister by the immigrant organisations.</P>
    <P>Electors must be citizens and certain conditions are laid down.  I presume a person who is born and lives here for ten years and emigrates would be entitled to be on the electoral list when they reach 18 years.  It is not clear if those ten years can be made up of a combination of two years here, two years abroad and so on.  The question of how long someone can live abroad before they are eliminated from the register is not too clear.  Perhaps the Minister might elaborate on requirements to be an elector, the period of residence required here and abroad before a person is entitled to be on or be removed from the electoral list. While the document refers to those living abroad who are eligible to vote on the university panel, it has been glossed over.  These people may be able to vote <Col N="2083" /> twice and perhaps the Minister will clarify how that might work.</P>
    <P>Even after so much discussion and deliberation, it is disappointing that this document has been poorly researched. As far as I can see, it has been put together to keep the debate going.  I am not sure if it is really intended to pass this legislation and to change the Constitution so we can look forward to representation from emigrants after the next election.  I am not sure if the urgency required to meet that deadline exists in the Government document. While the Government is sending this document to a Select Committee for discussion, it has done little in terms of a decision which would indicate its seriousness about dealing with this matter.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact we, as Senators, have had the first opportunity to respond to the consultation paper issued by the Minister for the Environment. It is right that the Seanad should give the first impression on this document as much of contents relate directly to the electoral makeup and structure of this House.  This is a consultative paper and, therefore, the views of Members are vitally important in terms of the Government producing a final position on this matter.  I note this paper will shortly go before the Dáil Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  It might be a good idea if the Minister returned to the House after that meeting.  This issue requires the type of free flowing debate in which that committee will engage but in which we cannot be involved.  The Minister could respond to points raised by Senator Daly and others by way of a discussion rather than statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue at the heart of this debate is simple &mdash; whether it is right or wrong for those who have emigrated to be given a voice in the parliamentary life of our State.  A range of voting mechanisms <Col N="2084" /> can be put in place to give emigrants a vote, but Members must decide whether as a matter of principle those who have emigrated should be entitled to vote in some form of elections. Because of the problem which faces so many people in terms of finding work and the historical reasons which underlie the need for emigration for many young people, I believe emigrants have a right to vote and for their voice to be heard and represented in Parliament.  I say this because the issue of deciding the exact form and type of elections is secondary to the issue of whether one believes it right or wrong that emigrants should be entitled to vote.</P>
    <P>When the issue of votes for emigrants was first raised in the Dáil in March 1992 by the late Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, the then Minister for the Environment, Pádraig Flynn, opposed the extension of the franchise to emigrants for reasons of principle and for practical and administrative reasons.  It is ironic that the then Minister is now one of our most eminent emigrants albeit in Brussels. How would Commissioner Flynn feel if he was unable to vote in elections because he is away from home?</P>
    <P>Emigration does not mean exile. Unfortunately, much of the debate which has surrounded the issue of votes for emigrants has been ill-informed and reactionary.  I admit many people oppose the principle of extending votes to emigrants, but those of us who believe emigrants have a right to be heard should explain in greater detail to those who oppose the principle why we are introducing this measure.</P>
    <P>There is support in the community for votes for emigrants, as was seen in a poll taken last year by <i>The Sunday Independent</i> which found that 65 per cent supported the principle of extending votes to emigrants while 35 per cent opposed the measure.  It was interesting that the largest percentage of people who supported the measure were living in rural areas and aged 50 years and above.  It is obvious why so many in rural communities aged 50 and above support this principle. The emigration phenomenon is a <Col N="2085" /> real issue for townlands which have lost 80 per cent of their young people.  Parents, now in their fifties, see emigration as the only way forward for their sons and daughters under 20 years.  It is a phenomenon which permeates the Irish experience.</P>
    <P>Many groups make up the emigration cohort.  For many, emigration is the only way to get employment because of poor employment opportunities here or because they have failed to gain certain educational opportunities.  Emigration to London or New York presents the only realistic way to obtain a job.  These people are generally referred to as those in the involuntary emigration category. For large sections of my own age group &mdash; and this is becoming increasingly the case over the last ten years or so &mdash; emigration is a way of increasing people's skills.  Emigration introduces people to more advanced training or simply provides many people from my age group with an opportunity to gain capital abroad before coming back to reside in Ireland.  The view of emigration as depicted in the 1940s, when it was not feasible to exist without emigration, is substantially different from the view of emigration today.  This is the case because of the reducing cost of air travel and a greater frequency of travel by emigrants back home to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate which has surrounded emigration has been coloured by a victim mentality which some have seen fit to advance.  Emigration is an option for many people who choose it by their own free will, voluntarily deciding to leave Ireland for whatever reason to advance their situation in life.  This will become even less so in the years ahead as the demographic balance in Ireland will reduce the rigidity of our labour market and therefore increase employment opportunities for school leavers and graduates.</P>
    <P>Many people under the age of 25 leave this country because they can amass substantially more income than they can in Ireland.  Those who oppose the principle of extending the right to vote for emigrants frequently argue that <Col N="2086" /> people who no longer live in this country should not have a say in the national affairs of this country.  This argument is fundamentally flawed in that it fails to recognise that in calculating annual average net migration outflows there is an element of returning emigrants who have simply left the country for a short period of time and are now coming back to reside in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is frequently the case that people leave Ireland for a short period of time and then, because of their own situation or an improving economic climate in Ireland, decide to come back.  Owing to the methods utilised in compiling total population data, specific figures for population inflows or outflows cannot be attributed and thus only net migration trends can be calculated.  Notwithstanding this, it is now generally agreed that in recent years there has been a sizeable inflow of returning emigrants who have been resident outside of Ireland for between one and five years.</P>
    <P>To say that any person who is resident abroad at any given point in time does not have a right to a voice in the parliamentary life of his or her own country despite the fact that he or she may be returning within five years is clearly wrong.  They have as much right to a voice in our Parliament as any other citizen of this State.  They more than anybody else, because of the fact that they will soon become the opinion leaders or the new entrepreneurs in our country, have a right to a voice and a vote.  When one considers the relatively new makeup of these emigration figures and that this is a phenomenon which has only occurred in the past ten to 15 years, it enhances the case for the right of emigrants to vote and for their voice to be heard in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Another much cited reason for refusing to allow emigrants the right to vote is the view that emigrants pay no taxation and accordingly should be given no representation.  Those who use this argument are by their own words excluding whole sections of the present Irish electorate who, because of their <Col N="2087" /> circumstances, do not pay direct taxation. If this argument was taken to its logical conclusion those in receipt of unemployment benefit and low income earners who do not pay taxation would also be excluded from general, local, presidential or European elections or indeed constitutional referenda.  This argument fails to recognise that the vast majority of our emigrants continue to come back to Ireland and spend great amounts of their income in this jurisdiction. Taxation therefore is not an issue and is used as a red herring to oppose the right of emigrants to vote.</P>
    <P>Having established the reasons why it is important to extend some form of franchise to the thousands of young people in particular who have a direct interest in this country, I would now like to turn to how we could devise a structure so their voice can be heard in the parliamentary life of this country.  I have never believed in extending the right of Irish emigrants to vote in Dáil elections. My concern has always been to ensure that the voice of emigrants is heard in some shape or form in the Oireachtas. In my view, the essential reason why the Government has decided not to extend the franchise for emigrants to general elections is that the central function of the Dáil is to elect a Government and emigrants who determine Deputies to elect that Government can neither suffer nor profit from the performance of that Government.</P>
    <P>The Seanad is the most appropriate place for the voice of Irish emigrants to be heard.  The Seanad is a smaller House and, by definition, this means that Members representing a variety of interests can access debates more speedily than in the Dáil.  The <i>raison d'être</i> behind the Seanad was that various sections of opinion in Ireland could be heard by way of a second Chamber which could seek to either amend or delay legislation from the Lower Chamber as it saw fit.  It was also intended that the Seanad would inform the work and legislative initiatives of the Government which resides in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2088" /> I take the opposite view from certain sections of the emigrant lobby who say that Seanad Éireann would not be an appropriate forum for giving the Irish abroad a voice in the Government.  The Seanad is the place where the voice of the Irish emigrant lobby can best be heard because of its structure and its makeup.</P>
    <P>Many questions arise in relation to this consultation paper.  What would happen if a person who was elected as an emigrant Member of the Seanad exceeded the maximum period of absence from the State during the course of his or her term?  Would he or she then have to resign?  The use of the term &ldquo;the maximum period of absence from the State&rdquo; in the consultation paper would seem to determine the eligibility of emigrant voters.  The Minister might be able to clarify this at some point in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the paper deals with the registration of emigrant electors.  Like others, I would be of the opinion that many in our emigrant population will for a variety of reasons simply fail to register.  This has already been experienced in Ireland, where increasingly large sections of our urban population are either failing to register or failing to vote at all.  Is the Minister considering proposing a base line number of registered electors for the emigrant seats in each of the proposed constituencies? Otherwise, a relatively small number of people could vote in prescribed constituencies, depending on the size of the register.</P>
    <P>How will the information required by the register of electors to verify the bona fides of the emigrant in question be verified?  Has the Minister any views about who would be in charge of verifying the information given, or will it simply be a matter for the register of electors or the returning officer?  I agree with Senator Daly.  He mentioned that the consultation paper cites the Clerk of the Seanad as the returning officer.  The workload associated with the large number of panels in the Seanad which would be coming forward for election at that <Col N="2089" /> time is such that the Clerk of the Seanad will not have the time to deal with this larger emigrant constituency.  Do we not have a precedent whereby in other panels, such as the NUI panel and the TCD panel, a different returning officer is in charge of organising the election? This might be considered because of the confines of time surrounding this election.</P>
    <P>I have long held the view that Irish citizens resident in Northern Ireland should be entitled to vote in our Presidential Election.  The office of the President in our Constitution has a wider function than that of just the Dáil or the Seanad.  He or she is a representative of the Irish nation at home or abroad.  It would be offensive to Irish citizens in Northern Ireland to be regarded as emigrants. There is a case to be made for extending the franchise for presidential elections to Irish citizens in Northern Ireland.  It would be a means of reinforcing the Irish dimension, which would be important in Northern Ireland and would include sections of opinion that hitherto have remained outside the Oireachtas, which comprises the President, the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I am not sure how much support there is for this issue.  I imagine there is very little support for it outside the House and, indeed, little enough in the House.  Four members of my family are abroad and because they are graduates they can vote for the university panels.  However, they cannot vote for me and that is a source of a certain amount of rancour.</P>

      <P>I have visited many Irish communities abroad and the issue of voting has never arisen, formally or informally.  Some people have travelled abroad with the specific purpose of meeting groups seeking a right to vote. Incidentally, they generally seek a right <Col N="2090" /> to representation in the Dáil, not the Seanad.</P>
      <P>There would be difficulties with legislation to give representation in the Seanad.  There would be even greater problems associated with representation in the Dáil.  There is a means by which people from Northern Ireland, whether they are Irish citizens or not, can be represented in the Seanad.  There have been Taoiseach's nominees to this House who have been from different communities in the North and they have done a good job.</P>
      <P>The registration of emigrant electors will be difficult.  The difficulties would be few in Great Britain, large cities in the US or other places where there is an Irish embassy or consulate.  However, in other areas the compilation of a register would be a major problem.  The proposal for electors is to include those who lived in this country for ten years before they emigrated and who have been abroad for less than 20 years. Therefore, generally speaking, one would target a group of people over 18 years and under 38 years of age.</P>
      <P>During the first few years abroad emigrants may change address a number of times.  They tend to move to look for jobs.  Our emigrants tend to have a greater mobility now than ever before and people do not tend to stay in the same job for very long.  Young graduates may emigrate and cut their teeth in a job and may then move jobs a number of times.  Thankfully, there is a great demand for the services of our graduates which gives them a greater mobility.</P>
      <P>If you were to try to get the current addresses of our emigrants between the ages of 18 years and 38 years of age you might have only a 20 or 30 per cent success rate.  One might have to set up groups in certain cities looking for people to register.  The problem is that not only would people over 40 years of age be excluded in a sense, but you would confine the electorate to a particular group of activists.  That might not be bad in itself but it would not get at our emigrants in the broad sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2091" /> Emigrants would want to vote to change the society which forced them to emigrate.  If their representatives were elected to the Seanad they could not change much in terms of the influence on the causes of emigration.  People who emigrated for financial or job reasons might not want to get involved early on in the registration process.  The ten year and 20 year limits cut out a large group of people who for their first few years abroad move around a lot and who might not have any great interest in politics here.  One might then be cutting the electorate down further to those aged between 30 years and 40 years.</P>
    <P>Two by-elections to the Dáil took place yesterday and only about 50 per cent of those registered to vote did so. People who would have been within two miles of a polling station did not vote. They do not have the registration problems emigrants might face &mdash; the political parties and the local authorities check the registers here so there is a double check &mdash; yet we still have turnouts of only 50 per cent.  We have had referendums in the past on issues more important than votes for emigrants, yet the voting percentage has been low.  If we foisted a constitutional revision by way of referendum on the people on the issue of votes for emigrants there might only be a laughable 10 or 20 per cent turnout.  It would not be what those who seek votes for emigrants would want.</P>
    <P>People in Ireland seek a means of stopping emigration through tackling poverty, unemployment, crime and drugs.  A Government which put a referendum to the people on the issue of votes for emigrants before dealing with these other matters would get a kick where it hurts.  There is merit in giving people who have had to emigrate a voice, but they can express themselves to elected representatives.  They can meet Ministers who visit abroad or via various Irish associations who may invite guests from the Government, Opposition or local authority representatives and they can express themselves <Col N="2092" /> extremely vociferously at these meetings.</P>
    <P>This measure should be better researched before we put it to the Irish people.  Judging by the report there is no danger that a Bill will be moved by this Government and there is no hope of the next Government moving it.  The public may eventually decide that emigrant voting is necessary but I believe it will never come.  I cannot see the Irish people voting in favour of this measure.</P>
    <P>It was said that people who are out of the country for a short time, between one and five years, lose their right to vote, so this would be a means of enfranchising them again.  However, if a person is registered to vote in Carlow-Kilkenny and his job takes him out of the constituency on election day, he cannot vote.  Like someone who has been out of the country for five years such a person is disenfranchised.  If we want to facilitate these people, we should allow a person who is out of his constituency on election day to get a certificate to vote from a county registrar so that he can vote outside his area.</P>
    <P>I am negative about this issue because I do not believe in it.  It has not been properly researched and I do not think it can work.  Even the financial arrangements are vague &mdash; the cost is estimated at between £3.55 million and £10.3 million, allowing for the cost of annual registration, expenses, etc., which may accrue to emigrant Members.  The latter is estimated at £60,000 per year &mdash; they would have to travel by cattle boat from Australia if £20,000 per year would sustain them to travel back and forth every week.</P>

If we want emigrant representation, the Taoiseach of the day could nominate a person for each of the three continents <Col N="2093" /> from his 11 nominees.  My colleague, Senator Dan Kiely, will probably seek substantial votes for emigrants; I feel this consultation paper is as useful as a lighthouse in a bog.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a problem with the title of the discussion document &mdash;<i>Representation of Emigrants in Seanad Éireann.</i> To listen to Senator Lanigan one would think we were about to enfranchise an alien constituency; we are merely talking about extending the right to vote in this country to passport holding citizens of the Irish State who happen to be domiciled, permanently or semi-permanently, abroad.  They are not only emigrants, they are citizens.</P>
      <P>If I was to devise a banner for them I would use the title of the late Woody Guthrie's ballad, made famous by Ms Joan Baez: &ldquo;This Land is Your Land&rdquo;. It is their country.  Why can we not afford them the same facilities we afford rich Arabs or south Americans?  If they pay us £500,000, we will give them a passport and they can vote for whoever they like.  I did not detect anything in Senator Lanigan's contribution to suggest he had a problem with that, but he seems to be reluctant to allow my two sons in Boston the right to vote.  I find that hard to take.</P>
      <P>We are talking about citizens of the State.  If we want to reduce this to money, 20 per cent of all bank accounts in this country are held by Irish nonresidents. There has been a big in-flow of money earned by Irish people abroad.  Senator Lanigan does not seem to be worried about Arab, Greek or South American money but Irish money seems to bother him.</P>

      <P>Senator Kiely would know all about that &mdash; I am not going to discuss it.  Our tourism industry generates £1.8 billion, of which 60 per cent is from Irish-born people travelling to and from this country.  I have no doubt that their financial contribution would supersede anything from the odd person <Col N="2094" /> who wishes to have a safer passport than he currently possesses.</P>
      <P>My colleague the Minister of State. Deputy O'Shea, would agree that we are not reinventing the wheel here &mdash; we are extending the vote to a different category of Irish citizens.  However, in a typically Irish fashion, we are not giving them what they asked for but something totally different.  They did not ask for representation in the Seanad, they wanted to vote for the Dáil.  In their wisdom, the last two Governments &mdash; all of whom are Members of Dáil Éireann &mdash; decided to respond to this by giving emigrants representation in the Seanad, which they expressly said they did not want.  I understand the Government's standpoint and some of the arguments made against direct representation in the Dáil, with which I will deal shortly. I simply point out that this is not what the emigrant groups asked for; they said they did not want it and asked that it not be offered, but the Government did so anyway.</P>
      <P>Mr. Andrew Doyle, the campaign coordinator of the Irish Emigrant Vote Campaign in New York, wrote to <i>The Irish Times</i> on 9 February 1995:</P>
      <P>The Government's proposal to allow emigrants to vote for three members of the Seanad completely misses the point of the many emigrant vote campaigns around the world. The creation of an emigrant constituency in the Seanad would not give emigrants a real voice in Ireland, it would merely give them a modest forum to discuss emigrant issues.</P>
      <P>That is a fair summation of what is on offer.  The letter continues:</P>
      <P>They would still be cut off from meaningful electoral participation. And this is completely contrary to what emigrants have been campaigning for &mdash; which is simply that the right to vote in Irish elections and referenda be restored to them.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;restored to&rdquo; is an interesting choice of words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2095" /> We in the Irish Emigrant Vote Campaign will continue to work to that end.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, to be welcomed that the Government is willing to address the issue of emigration in some way, and the creation of Seanad seats for emigrants may well be beneficial in that regard.  But this form of representation bears no relation to what emigrants have been working for &mdash; which is an equal voice, an equal vote.</P>
    <P>The principle on which emigrant vote groups have been campaigning is that all Irish-born citizens have the right to vote in Irish elections.  We were able to use that right when we lived at home, but were stripped of it simply because we became resident abroad.  This is wrong.  All the countries of the EU, the US, South Africa, the new democracies of Eastern Europe and more make great efforts to encourage their emigrants to vote in their national elections.</P>
    <P>I will not read the entire letter but in conclusion Mr. Doyle states:</P>
    <P>Emigrants love their country and carry their goodwill for Ireland to every corner of the globe.  This Government has the opportunity to respond to all that goodwill and forge a real connection with them.  It should do so now before still another generation is lost to Ireland.  It should extend them a real vote, rather than merely throwing them a Seanad sop in the hope that they will do as all good Irish emigrants are supposed to do, which is to go quietly, and say nothing.</P>
    <P>We must not forget the revenue received by Ireland from substantial remittances and tourism, 60 per cent of which relates to emigrants.  We use that industry to unashamedly promote all things Irish.  Advertising campaigns throughout the world use images of emigrants to bring material benefits to this country.  Plays and songs are written about them and portraits painted of <Col N="2096" /> them, but there is a great reluctance to include them.  The message seems to be that it is acceptable to exploit emigrants but they must not be given a say.  I object to the title of the information leaflet because it seems to suggest that a new type of citizen is being created or that we are enfranchising people who are alien.  We are, in fact, extending the franchise to another category of citizens. The fundamental point is that they are citizens.</P>
    <P>In 1990-1991, my late and much respected colleague, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan &mdash; who was my good friend for many years &mdash; travelled to London, Boston and elsewhere to speak to Irish emigrants, some of whom had resided there for a long time.  He returned to Ireland convinced it was in the country's economic interest to include this constituency, the benefits from which would become more apparent as stronger links developed.  Quite apart from other considerations, he believed we could forge links with Irish citizens abroad similar to those enjoyed by the Israelis.</P>
    <P>Having listened to contributions from the other side of the House, it seems this issue involves money.  The same rights should be conferred on Arabs and South Americans who invest money here for the purpose of gaining Irish passports.  I do not disagree with this, I am simply pointing out the hypocrisy of selling a passport to one category of people and denying the right to vote to Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>Gerry O'Sullivan moved a Private Members' Bill in the Dáil to deal with this issue which was subsequently defeated by 66 votes to 62 by the then Government.  This places Senator Daly, who accused the present Government of dragging its feet, in a slightly ambiguous position because he was a member of the Government which voted down that Bill.  The Senator can hardly complain about the delay when his party decided to halt the original legislation.</P>
    <P>People seem frightened by the requests of emigrant groups.  They are concerned that the balance of power <Col N="2097" /> will be affected by granting votes to emigrants.  There is no evidence to show this occurs in countries who give emigrants the right to vote.  The campaign for emigrants' votes is supported by very eminent Irish men and women living abroad.  An open letter to the Irish Government by the editors of major Irish newspapers abroad was signed by Donal Mooney of the <i>Irish Post</i>, London; Damien Gaffney of the <i>Irish World</i>, London; Niall O'Dowd of the <i>Irish Voice</i>, New York; Tom Connolly of the <i>Irish Echo</i>, New York and Billy Cantwell of the <i>Irish Echo</i>, Sydney. There is a broad consensus among the leaders abroad that they want representation in Ireland.  They quote examples from other EU countries where votes for emigrants are considered normal.</P>
    <P>I have always liked the Dutch who are very uncomplicated, direct and do not mess around.  They are not like Irish people and do not write ballads or hang Jack B. Yeats paintings of emigrant scenes on their walls.  With regard to votes for emigrants, the Dutch&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator has a long memory because he is a member of the Progressive Democrats and deals in history. In the Netherlands, all non-resident citizens can vote in elections and there is no time limit beyond which they lose this right.  The Netherlands is not an ungovernable country but a very progressive EU nation.  The Dutch do not panic.</P>
      <P>Many of the fears expressed during this debate are unreal.  I speak against myself in this regard because I am a Taoiseach's nominee, the numbers of whom will be reduced to eight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The prospect of that reduction does not fill me with glee.  As I stated earlier, the emigrants groups do not want representation in the Seanad. However, in a typically Irish way, we <Col N="2098" /> considered the issue and informed them they would be given representation in this House, not the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Some of the questions on the problem of granting votes to emigrants were addressed by &ldquo;The Case for Emigrant Voting Rights&rdquo;.  The first issue raised was:</P>
      <P>Because of their large numbers, emigrants could, if given the vote, decide Ireland's political future and would have a disproportionate influence.</P>
      <P>In reply it was pointed out:</P>
      <P>This is not true.  At present the electoral roll in Ireland is imbalanced due to emigration.  A large number of people between the ages of 18 and 35 have lost their right to vote due to emigration; it is not to Ireland's advantage to have such a gap in the electorate.</P>
      <P>The second issue raised related to emigrants abusing the system, the reply to which stated:</P>
      <P>No other country which allows emigrant voting experiences abuses because there are clear preventative procedures and legislation in place. There is no evidence to indicate that Irish emigrants are less honest than citizens of other EU countries.  New European democracies such as Poland, Ukraine and Eritrea ensured that their citizens abroad have the right to vote without any difficulty.</P>
      <P>If other countries and their emigrants can manage their voting systems well, why can't Ireland?</P>
      <P>Politics in Ireland is, after all, a national pastime.  A further issue raised was that emigrants do not pay tax.  In this regard, &ldquo;The Case for Emigrant Voting Rights&rdquo; states that this is the latest argument against emigrant voting:</P>
      <P>It is based on a distortion of the American War of Independence maxim: &ldquo;No taxation without representation&rdquo; which now becomes &ldquo;No representation without taxation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2099" /> This would disenfranchise people claiming unemployment benefit and assistance and those who have retired from work because they do not pay tax.</P>
    <P>This House has been asked to formulate and agree a system which gives Irish citizens abroad the same rights gladly given citizens of Saudia Arabia, Kuwait and some South American countries, who are provided with Irish passports when they invest money in the country. Emigrants are citizens of this country and hold Irish passports.  I suggest that the House gives them the vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps my agreement with him will make him review his position on this issue.</P>
      <P>Emigrants should be able to participate in the parliamentary life of the country.  The question is whether this proposal represents a way in which they can do that effectively; in my view it does not.  While I welcome the consultation paper as a means of debating this issue, I do not support anything in it.  It has all the characteristics of a very gifted academic with a limited grasp of reality on a particularly bad day.  I wondered how Labour could go along with the proposals in the document and Senator Magner has allayed some of my worries in that respect.</P>
      <P>I agree with him that money is not at the heart of the issue; the question of citizenship is.  Are we to have a type of pavilion membership of the Irish nation held by people who by reason of circumstances forced upon them by the management of the nation have been compelled to seek a livelihood abroad? Having relieved the nation of the burden of having to maintain them at home they are disenfranchised.  That is not at all equitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2100" /> In other countries it is possible for people to participate in parliamentary life and have a vote although they live abroad.  People who wish to do so should be able to register and cast a vote in the Dáil constituency in which they lived.  If there were enough emigrant voters who wanted to elect an Irish citizen who lives in Hong Kong, I would permit that as well.  The State is about to embark on a £10 million public relations exercise to assuage its conscience in this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not object to emigrants having seats in the Seanad, but this proposal does not go far enough.  We can give emigrants seats in the Seanad without a referendum and a constitutional amendment. The Taoiseach could pick three emigrants' representatives from his 11 nominees on the basis of consultation. History shows us that the selection of the 11 nominees in every other respect where emigrants were not involved has been successful.  Many of the Taoiseach's nominees have been spectacularly successful.  The late Senator Wilson was one.  I am sure Senator McAughtry, although he was elected, will also have a valuable contribution to make to the House so I do not see why we need this complicated procedure.  If the Taoiseach wants to take all three representatives from Australia or America let be that be done, but let it be done on the basis of consultation.  Why do we have to institute his weird proposal to assuage our consciences?  This is a move in the right direction but it is no more than that.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes was right when he said people should be able to participate in the parliamentary life of the country. That should be full participation.  My attitude has always been that democracy should be as inclusive as possible. Nobody should be excluded from casting a vote and it should be easy to stand for election.  If that brings out the Screaming Lord Sutches, the cranks and the weirdoes, let that be the case.  They will be voted down just as are other people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2101" /> Behind this reluctance to give emigrants the vote is a fear that some people will lose their seats in the other House.  That is why we say these people abroad are some sort of inferior beings who might affect the outcome of an election in the grand democratic system we have.  If it is a grand democratic system and they wish to affect the outcome of an election they should be able to do so.</P>
    <P>Allowing people to vote is not the major logistical problem it has been represented to be.  If the American ambassador thought it important enough to go to Galway to speak to members of an American political party there to ensure their votes would influence an American presidential election, it is possible for somebody in America to visit Irish people to try to influence their votes.</P>
    <P>I would start with the presidency. Whatever about giving emigrants representation in this or the other House, every Irish citizen living abroad should be able to cast his vote in a presidential election.  Let us forget all this talk about the diaspora, about our emigrants and how important they are.  It is all a load of codswallop if we do not give them the vote and it is not as administratively difficult as it is represented to be.  If they want representation in the Seanad I do not object to that.  It could be done by the Taoiseach nominating someone and it does not need a constitutional referendum, which is a waste of time and money.</P>
    <P>When the Minister addressed us earlier this morning she talked about Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland and said they would be treated as two categories. Those who left the Republic and went to Northern Ireland should be treated in one way, and those who have had the great misfortune to have lived in Northern Ireland all their lives and who are Irish citizens should be treated in a different way.  Now we have two classes of pavilion membership.  First we had full citizenship and pavilion membership and now we have a sort of honorary membership which does not <Col N="2102" /> include voting rights at the general election. It is like being a member of the club, being allowed to attend a general meeting but without being allowed to cast a vote.</P>
    <P>Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland and Irish citizens who went from the Republic to live in Northern Ireland should be treated similarly.  One possible way of doing it is to have a Dáil constituency for Northern Ireland and allow Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland to elect several people to seats in the Oireachtas.  We will see how the anti-partitionists would react to that proposal.  I am sure that might set off a few flutters in the hearts of people wondering about the future of their seats.</P>
    <P>Much of this is predicated on the basis that seats might be at risk because these terrible people who live abroad might have an undue influence on the outcome of an election.  Senator Magner is right; there is no reason to believe they would behave much differently from the generality of the population living at home.  Most of them are sensible, reasonable people.  They may have an absolute contempt for Irish politics because they had to go into exile, but if that is the case it is more probable that they will not cast their votes at all than that they will cast them in a particular direction to influence the outcome. They should be given a vote in general elections.</P>
    <P>There are models of electoral systems around the world.  The first South African elections were impressive in this regard.  We saw newspaper pictures of nuns going to vote in a polling station in Dublin for the South African election. If that was possible in an emerging democracy it is possible here.  I was in Palestine monitoring the elections and there was a demand that the very large diaspora, greatly outnumbering the people at home, should have a vote. Palestine will develop its electoral system in the future.  There is also a US model.  Many Irish civil servants in Brussels are very interested in Irish politics and are very up to date with political developments in Ireland.  Are we saying <Col N="2103" /> that Irish civil servants who live in Brussels and who work for the European Commission should not have a vote in Irish general elections?  They have just as much an interest as anybody else in the developments of the country.</P>
    <P>We could get into some of the detail of the recommendations made here. One reasonable recommendation if this went forward relates to the substitute candidate on the European election model, in other words, when somebody stands for election there would be a panel so that if the person elected resigned their seat or died, the first substitute would take their place.  That is a reasonable suggestion, and it is one which could even operate within the present Seanad panels.</P>
    <P>An obligation has been imposed upon the Clerk of the Seanad to be the registration officer and administer this proposal. This is totally unreasonable. Members of the House know that the Clerk's office is already over-stretched and I do not know how it would be able to deal with this proposal.  More resources would have to be provided.  I noticed that the Minister of State's speech made the point that the returning officer would rule on the validity of a nomination paper within 24 hours of its delivery to him or her.  No doubt many faxes would be sent to Australia and America.  That would be quite an achievement.  It will be interesting to see how that proposal flies.</P>
    <P>However, the issue should be that citizens are full citizens and there are not different categories of citizens; it is irrelevant where they live.  They should be allowed vote in elections, and while I have not a particular objection to giving them three seats here, it is only a sop and does not go nearly far enough and there are administrative difficulties in terms of resources within the House to carry out the task which would be imposed by this proposal.</P>
    <P>I come back to the point about participating in the parliamentary life of the country which was described earlier.  In my view, the only way to do that effectively <Col N="2104" /> is to allow them participate to the same extent as any other citizen because they are citizens.  Citizenship is the qualification.  Let us have not pavilion members in this Irish citizenship which is of such value and importance to us.</P>

      <P>Modern technology now makes it possible for us to stay closer to Irish emigrants than ever before.  We should make use of that technology to create a huge global family of the Irish diaspora, so that all our people everywhere can share in being Irish in a way which is meaningful to them in their everyday lives.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that we should give votes in Seanad elections to emigrants is impractical, wrong in principle and, to use Senator Dardis's words, even weird; more importantly, it misses the point.  It is impractical because of the virtual impossibility of defining what is an emigrant, and because of the enormous cost of organising a global vote to which a number of speakers referred here.  Are we to include Irish people living in Liverpool but exclude Irish people living in Newry?  We heard that discussion this morning and what the Minister had to say about it.  Are we to include people who left Ireland five or ten years ago, but exclude those who left over 25 years ago?  Even if we could get over the practical difficulties, we would still be wrong to implement it.</P>
      <P>The best place to draw the line is by equating taxation and representation. The American revolution was founded on the principle &ldquo;no taxation without representation&rdquo;.  The corollary is an equally sound guideline: &ldquo;no representation without taxation&rdquo;.  It is worth noting that Americans living abroad today can vote in their elections but they also pay taxes when living abroad.  That is a clearly defined and enforced provision. Irrespective of the part of the world in which they live, US citizens pay taxes to the United States Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person living in the Republic pays taxes to this State.  Senator Magner asked about the unemployed and pensioners. If they do not pay income tax, <Col N="2105" /> they certainly pay value-added tax whereas emigrants do not pay tax.  Residence therefore provides a clean, unambiguous basis for drawing the line between who votes and who does not. We should, in my opinion, continue to stick by that strong principle.</P>
    <P>However, that does not mean we should turn our backs on the Irish diaspora. On the contrary, we should use the means now at our disposal to forge stronger links than ever before with Irish people around the world.  Already we are beginning to see the effects of disseminating real-time Irish news globally through satellite radio and on the Internet.  As a country, we are lagging far behind on this issue.  Even the tiny country of Cyprus, for instance, has a full television service available on satellite for Cypriots abroad.  Poland has three television services available on the Hotbird satellite. In contrast, we have only an embryo radio service with minimum patchy coverage available around the world.</P>
    <P>Satellite technology now makes it possible for us to beam real-time television programmes to Irish people anywhere in the world.  On the Internet, Carlow people anywhere in the world can, since last week, read key stories from each week's <i>Nationalist and Leinster Times</i> which is the first provincial paper to follow the lead of <i>The Irish Times</i> in establishing a presence on the World Wide Web.  This is the way to draw closer to our diaspora.</P>
    <P>If we took the millions now being talked about for representation for emigrants to this House and spent it instead on kick-starting a much enhanced Irish presence on satellite television and, in particular, on the Internet, we could bring this country and its emigrants much closer together in a way that would be meaningful and highly useful in both economic and political terms.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner referred to the late Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan's efforts to try to establish votes for emigrants and his views on the economic benefits in keeping the link with our emigrants.  This proposal is not the way to try to establish <Col N="2106" /> that link.  This proposal will not work but, more importantly, it will not achieve that which it sets out to achieve, that is, to maintain the link with those Irish people who left because they had to or wanted to and who are so valuable to us not only in economic but in cultural terms.  We must find another way; one way would be to use modern technology.</P>

      <P>All of us have a strong sense of the wider Irish nation and would like to be in a position to enable emigrants, who left the country fairly recently and wish to keep in touch, to have a say and maintain their sense of belonging to the nation.  This is the generous thinking behind this proposal.</P>
      <P>What is being proposed here is not unique to this country.  Other countries allow citizens, who emigrate and are out of the country for many years, to vote in parliamentary elections.  The French, for example, have a system which enables their emigrants to vote in parliamentary elections, not for the Upper House but for the Lower House.  American citizens living abroad are enabled to vote in the most important of all US elections, that is, the presidential election. So there is nothing unusual or untoward in what is being proposed here.  However, I feel the system proposed in this discussion document has a number of enormous practical drawbacks, if not impossibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of whether the representation will be in the Dáil or Seanad must be addressed.  Perhaps the Seanad was chosen to give some substance to the principle of no representation without taxation because this House does not have a constitutional right to levy taxes and our financial powers are virtually non-existent.  Likewise, the House has no right to initiate constitutional <Col N="2107" /> legislation.  There may well have been reasons why this House was chosen.</P>
    <P>I would have no difficulty with having three, four or five representatives of Irish emigrants in this House.  The right of emigrants to have representation in this House is as legitimate as that of university graduates to their six seats, members of local authorities &mdash; they may have higher rights because they are elected &mdash; or any other group.</P>
    <P>However, the system proposed &mdash; and the figures bear it out &mdash; is enormously expensive and cumbersome.  After a huge amount of effort and expense, only a small number of emigrants may vote anyway.  The suggestion in this booklet that the Clerk of the Seanad should have the task of compiling the register and administering the election is not on. Those who know the amount of work which goes into the preparation and running of a Seanad election in that office can see that this proposal is a non-starter and there is no point in saying otherwise.  Likewise, our embassies abroad are not prepared or equipped for having to act as registration centres for votes.  We expect our embassies to be involved in a range of trade, political and cultural activities, but to use them as registration centres would impose an enormous burden on them.</P>
    <P>There are also practical problems in setting up three constituencies of this type.  If we have single seat constituencies, which is not proposed here, high density population areas will swamp the election.  If it was opened up to representatives from Australia, Africa, North America or Britain, the cost of these practical arrangements, which are addressed and costed in this booklet, would not justify the results.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about emigrant representation in this House, there are other ways of doing it.  It is possible to leave three of the Taoiseach's nominee places open for emigrants.  The Taoiseach, the Leader of the Opposition and the President could then nominate them from lists submitted by bona fide emigrant groups.  There is equality between <Col N="2108" /> elected and nominated Members in this House.  Once a person becomes a Member his or her credentials as to how they got here are never questioned in debate, their voting rights or their status outside.</P>
    <P>If we accepted the principle it would be simple, at least in the early stages, to set up a system where the Taoiseach of the day &mdash; it could be part of the spoils of office &mdash; could nominate three emigrants coming from lists provided by bona fide and recognised emigrant groups or else divide the nominations between the Taoiseach, the Leader of the Opposition and the President.  We could allow representatives of bona fide emigrant groups the right of audience in this House.  This is possible under Standing Orders.  Senator Hayes made a number of interesting suggestions as to how we might address this problem without following the proposals made in this booklet.</P>
    <P>This booklet shows that the proposals put forward are not workable, are expensive and do not meet the needs of the case.  If they were put into effect, they would bring the system into disrepute. There are other ways of doing it and we should examine them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is a complete waste of time.  I cannot understand why we have been asked to debate a set of proposals that may contain more ludicrous suggestions than anything else I have seen in my 15 years in this House. We are not talking in this document about giving emigrants votes but seats. They are completely and utterly different issues.  Giving emigrants the vote involves them voting in their home constituencies where they have a small effect on the result.  However, this fairy-tale proposes giving them seats in the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never heard that suggestion being taken seriously until it appeared in the Programme for Government.  I do not know how it got there.  I also do not know how the Minister for the Environment approved this proposal and the printing of this consultation document. <Col N="2109" /> Did somebody slip something in his soup before he did this?  The proposal is so barmy that we know it will never see the light of day.  This debate is in a vacuum. We will never see these three Seanad seats set up in the way proposed here and everybody behind this document knows that.  It has been put out to fool the emigrants and their families.  A gesture of some sort may be made, but the provisions in this document will not come about and everybody knows it.  It may carry the Government over a silly pledge it made when it was formed and get it through a certain time period, but these proposals will never see the light of day.  It is so absurd that it is almost not worth discussing and so ill-thought out that it is almost not worth consideration. One wonders whether the purpose behind it was to invite ridicule so the issue would be left dead and buried for a long time.</P>
    <P>The consultation paper estimates that the cost of one scenario will be £10 million, and for what &mdash; to give people who do not live in this country representation in this House.  I am open to correction by the Minister, but my interpretation is that there is no requirement on them to have ever lived in this country to qualify for election.  Although they must be Irish citizens, they can qualify for this through their grandparents.  This document suggests that the electors must have lived in the country, but not their representatives.  People who have never set foot in Ireland will be representing people who do not live in Ireland and will not hold votes, but seats in this House.</P>
    <P>What would happen if three Taoiseach's nominees, representing emigrants in Australia, America, South America or Britain and who have never been in Ireland before, were sitting happily on these benches?  Due to the current numbers in the Seanad, they could vote down, delay and propose legislation which affects people who live here in the most minute detail and on issues of which they are totally and understandably ignorant.  Giving these <Col N="2110" /> people that sort of power will give them unprecedented leverage in this House.</P>
    <P>The current balance of power in this House is subject to certain negotiations between the Government, the Opposition and the Independents.  We would then have an Irish American, an Anglo-Irish person and an Irish Australian seeking certain legislation to be passed, proposed, amended, defeated or delayed for reasons which would be beyond the rest of us but which would have to be agreed to by the Government because of the numbers in this House.</P>
    <P>They would hold us hostage when they knew nothing about this country. This is utterly and totally barmy, it is crazy.  It is absurd and insulting that we should be debating something as facile and ridiculous as this.  I beg the Minister not to give us the sort of bland explanation which we got from the Minister introducing this, which was simply a paraphrase of this paper.  It was not a suggestion or an opinion.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the possibility of keeping in Dublin a register of 500,000 people, some whom live in the South American jungle.  How on earth will that be done?  How will we know whether people have died in Sydney, San Francisco or New York on a daily basis?  How is it proposed that the Clerk of the Seanad will do that?  It is impossible to keep a register of that sort and the cost of doing so efficiently would involve not only having a register here but also having someone on the ground in Australia, America, the United Kingdom, in the South American jungle and wherever else these people are.  That fact has not been mentioned and we just have a few bare proposals.</P>
    <P>The administration of this particularly idiotic idea is not addressed in this document.  That is because a gesture has been made in terms of votes for emigrants, which, in a moderate way, people do not quarrel with in the same terms as they are exercised in embassies for certain elections.  However, I never heard anybody suggesting that we should give the balance of power in the <Col N="2111" /> Upper House to people who never lived in this country.  It is berserk, and it cannot and will not be done.  I hope a matter as serious as the Constitution will never be treated in such a flippant way by a Minister or Government in this House again.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Senator Manning lived up to the obligation he clearly gave and relaxed the leash on my distinguished constituency colleague, Senator Ross.  It is extremely refreshing to hear Senator Ross exhibit the independence of mind which some of us feared he might have forfeited by joining the august ranks of the Government parties.  It was a splendid performance, although I did not agree with everything he said.  There is merit in this proposal, although the Government parties are obviously embarrassed by it.  It is obvious, by looking at the body language around the House, that there is a degree of unease about this matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross is at fault if he thinks this proposal has not been seriously floated before because it has been, including by virtually all the university Senators, although Senator Ross may have distanced himself from them.  A perusal of the record might reveal some interesting results at a time when we all felt that an element of the university constituency was interested in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Over lunch, perhaps.  In travelling abroad, particularly in Australia, I was made aware of the strong desire of our emigrants to be represented. Some years ago, during a debate on the reorganisation and restructuring of the Seanad, I proposed that emigrants should be catered for by having two seats in the Upper House, <Col N="2112" /> but they were not particularly charmed, flattered or pleased by this.  Emigrants in Australia and New Zealand thought this was simply a sop and that it was not enough.  Three seats are now proposed and I am pleased to see that they do not encroach upon the university constituencies. It is a moderate and balanced proposal, and a sign of serious interest that the Government should propose diluting the Taoiseach's power.  There is an element of generosity in that instead of using it in a mean-minded, narrow-spirited way to take a smack at the university seats, which are, after all, the only really independent and democratic element in this House.  By resisting that opportunity the Government has shown a degree of maturity and wisdom.</P>
      <P>I understand some of the arguments against this proposal, but a number of them could be tidied up.  In her speech the Minister indicated that there could be further discussion on the amount of time emigrant voters will have to have spent in Ireland.  It seems ludicrous that while emigrants will have to be at least 18 to vote or run for election, they will have to have spent only ten years in Ireland.  Such a person could have lived here from birth until they were ten years old, a period during which it is unlikely that their political conscience or views would have been formed, or that they would have had any wide appreciation of the economic or social problems confronting the country.  If they emigrated at ten years of age they will, by the age of 18 &mdash; when living in New York, Sydney or Hong Kong &mdash; not only be eligible to vote but also to put themselves up for election here. That qualification is not sufficient and I would prefer to see some clearer and more consistent link with this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate for us to look at this proposal to include representation for emigrants in the Upper House.  I notice that my distinguished and valued colleague, Senator Quinn, instinctively went for a good example of the problems we have, which I used in an earlier debate.  I am not suggesting plagiarism on his part, but two intelligent minds <Col N="2113" /> will sometimes come up with the same quotation when looking at the same problem.  Going back to the American Revolution, we both examined the well known tag line &ldquo;No taxation without representation&rdquo; and inverted it to read &ldquo;No representation without taxation&rdquo;.  I am not sure if Senator Quinn went a step further to examine the implications for this House.</P>
    <P>I recommended seats in Seanad Éireann precisely because it would not be appropriate to elect people from outside this jurisdiction to a House which has control to any degree over the dispersal of Exchequer funds.  The principal limitation on the powers of this House is that we are precluded from producing Exchequer Bills.  We are not entrusted with dispersing State funds, except in the most roundabout way. That answers the hesitation of those who say that since our emigrants do not pay taxes here they should not be placed in a situation where they can spend taxpayers' money.  This is one of the things the Seanad is not permitted to do, so that argument is quite effectively answered.</P>
    <P>It is good to keep in touch with our diaspora.  I laughed at this phrase because it became a kind of buzz word like androgyny, buxerology and a few other well known tag words, but there is something extremely practical in it.  It is not just a sentimental action by President Robinson to keep a candle in the window, although some of my friends and colleagues have been extremely wicked in their comments about it recently.  It is important that we maintain a link with our people abroad because so many more of our people live there than have managed to live on this island.</P>
    <P>I am a frequent visitor to the Middle East and have what I discreetly describe as &ldquo;family connections&rdquo; with Jerusalem. I admire the Jewish people enormously, the way they milk their diaspora, which is far smaller than ours, in the United States of America and the benefit they extract from a considerably smaller <Col N="2114" /> group of people in key positions in the USA.  I would like to see this small country drawing strength, energy and support from those who have not had an opportunity to live in this country. About 40 million people in the United States claim Irish descent.</P>
    <P>I was in America last month and celebrated St. Patrick's Day in Denver, Colorado.  It was interesting to see the extent of the interest focused on Ireland.  Some of it was highly amateur and inaccurate.  I heard leprechauns talking for the first time and I can inform the House that they spoke with Mexican accents.  I also found a piece of promotional material which stated that the game of hurling was invented in 1275 BC by the Fir Bolg.  This is information with which I was not brought into contact at home and I was extremely glad to receive it.  However, the material demonstrates a naive interest in Ireland and it could be focused to the benefit of the country.</P>
    <P>I accept there could be mechanical difficulties with this proposal.  Senator Ross was at his best in indicating his lack of belief in the possibility of maintaining a register of 500,000 people.  It would be extremely invidious to impose this task on the Clerk of the Seanad. Regardless of her extraordinary capacities and talents, since the machinery to do so does not exist, it would not be fair. However, the University of Dublin maintains an accurate constituency record of over 30,000 graduates while NUI maintains an accurate record of over 100,000.  Those two amateur offices deal with constituency records of over 130,000 graduates in an efficient and businesslike manner.  If part-time officers in a university can do that, I do not see why the entire apparatus of the State should be assumed to be incapable of maintaining a register of 500,000.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to the fact that death occurs in San Francisco and Sydney. Of course it does, as it occurs in Dublin.  The fact that one is an emigrant does not render one immune to mortality. Of course the register will be incomplete and inaccurate in certain <Col N="2115" /> respects.  However, that has not inhibited the development of the constituency which Senator Ross represents. If his argument does not apply to his constituency, how can it possibly be held to apply to a similarly constituted constituency which is not dependent on the universities?  It will require the maintenance of records.  That in itself would be a good thing.  If we had to keep an up to date register of people it would mean we would have to keep some degree of contact.</P>
    <P>I travel abroad a great deal and keep in touch with our diplomatic staff, for whom I have the highest regard.  We do not appreciate how well we are served by a small diplomatic staff scattered throughout the world.  They do their best to keep tabs on the local Irish community and, by and large, they do a reasonably good job.  How much easier would that be if there was a requirement on those who wish to participate in this electoral system to maintain contact with our diplomatic staff and to place themselves annually, biannually or every five years on a live register of electors.  In that sense, it would also be a good thing.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross also asked what would happen if, in an extreme case, three people who had never been to Ireland and who were elected to the Seanad by people who had hardly ever been in the country held the balance of power. Would the country collapse?  The university Senators hold the balance of power in the Upper House at present and the State has not tottered to its knees.  To assume that the situation outlined by Senator Ross could lead to circumstances in which the State would be in danger is to underestimate the responsible attitude of the Opposition. Three people could only hold the balance of power if they could convince the Opposition parties to support their views or if they supported something proposed by the Opposition.  Again I think a chimera has been raised by Senator Ross. <Col N="2116" /> I support the principle of this proposal. It is useful and should be explored further.  There are obviously ways in which it needs to be technically honed down but there is nothing in it that vitiates the principles of democracy. Although we have a small country we have shown ourselves to be capable of organising all types of international events.  I am not an admirer of John Paul II but we organised his visit in a most remarkable and efficient way.  We have organised a series of Eurovision Song Contests and I am one of those who proposes that we should bid for the Olympic Games at some time in the future.  We have the capacity to organise highly technical and sophisticated events.</P>
    <P>I was saddened to hear my colleague, Senator Ross, suggest that we are too stupid to organise efficiently a constituency of 500,000 people.  I do not agree. We have the capacity, talent and political sophistication to ensure that this system, if it were to be utilised, would function efficiently.</P>

      <P>As a former emigrant and member of a county association in London for three years, I have an insight into emigration and the workings of Irish associations abroad.  This matter was often discussed when I was in England and since then.  It is easy to say that this proposal is not workable and the idea behind it is farcical.  It is not and I welcome a discussion on this proposal. It is constructive to hear the opinions of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The electors on University Panels might not be nationals of this State. <Col N="2117" /> They can be from any country so long as they graduated from the relevant universities in this country.  That point of interest was not mentioned by the previous two speakers.  A non-national, so long as he or she is a graduate of an Irish university, can stand for election to the Seanad.  It is interesting to look at the Seanad as it exists at present and how its electoral system works.  It is extraordinary that Members of this House should start screaming about a proposal through which this House can represent nationals abroad, even though non-nationals already have a vote under the current electoral system.</P>
    <P>We must be constructive when discussing this issue.  Quick decisions are often dangerous but I do not understand why a Taoiseach cannot appoint three Senators to represent the emigrants in Britain, America and Australia.  It is no harm to listen to all the options.  I am sure Senator Dan Kiely, who has travelled with the emigrants, will express his views on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue and I thank Senator Belton for sharing his time with me.  This legislation is flawed.  As an emigrant in the United States for 14 years and as someone who helped 30,000 or 40,000 illegal emigrants during the 1980s, I know there is a need for some type of representation in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I dealt with visa problems for emigrants in North America, but there does not seem to be any such difficulties for those travelling from the UK to Australia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When emigrants looked for representation in the Houses of the Oireachtas, they did not mean in Seanad Éireann, where their powers are limited, but in Dáil Éireann where they could be elected in three constituencies.  These people have rights and entitlements and they should be represented but rather than trying to establish an electorate of 500,000 people, which would put an untold burden on the State and on the staff of the Seanad, the Taoiseach of the day should nominate three people from <Col N="2118" /> Australia, the United States and the UK to represent our emigrants in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The system whereby the Taoiseach could nominate 11 Members was introduced to bring people with a wide range of experience to the House and Taoisigh have nominated non-political figures over the years such as Éamon de Buitléir, the late Gordon Wilson, T.K. Whitaker and Professor Dooge, who became a Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach of the day wants to give power to the emigrants, he should nominate three people and appoint them as junior Ministers in the Lower House.  Emigrants must be given representation, although there will be problems trying to establish a register.</P>
      <P>Although I am concerned about personations, if people in the three constituencies organised a proper campaign, they would be able to elect one of their representatives to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, if a person had to campaign in a constituency the size of North America where he had to travel 3,000 miles, he would need President Clinton's aeroplane for at least 12 months in advance and hundreds of people working for him, which would cost millions of pounds.  The Minister should re-examine this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultation paper states that it would cost approximately £10 million to operate this system.  Expenses would also be incurred trying to bring representatives here on a weekly basis.  I am sure people in rural Ireland would welcome part of that £10 million to repair potholes and tourists would be delighted to see an improvement in our roads.  This proposal would place an enormous strain on our national resources.  Senator Magner asked what was wrong with emigrants voting in Dáil elections in Irish constituencies for which they emigrated.  They should also <Col N="2119" /> be allowed to run for election if they wish.</P>
    <P>There are many flaws in this document. If a person is permanently resident in the United States for five years, he or she can apply to become a citizen of that state.  They could then hold an Irish and a United States passport and could vote in elections in either of two countries.  However, they would need to state if they will support the country in which they have taken up residence or the country in which they were born. This could lead to complications.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Taoiseach could not appoint people like T.K. Whitaker and Éamon de Buitléir to represent the emigrants until legislation is in place to allow them to take their seats in the Lower House.  Problems may need to be teased out in countries such as the United States and Australia.  It would have to be decided if these people could register their vote in their local constituencies or if three new constituencies would be set up to give them three seats in the Lower House where they would have power and where they would be able to express the views of the emigrants abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate the Leader of the House for allowing Government time to discuss this Bill. This is an innovation.  I also congratulate and commend Senator Roche for the work he has done in bringing forward this Bill.  It is important that such legislation is opened up and discussed here.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House is broadly based on the Norwegian Act.  I would like to outline a few key features which are important to ensure a successful freedom of information system.  The main feature of successful freedom of information legislation in other countries is a purpose clause which establishes a legal presumption of openness. This would set out in law a norm in favour of release of information and would enunciate a policy of access to official information.  The purpose clause is a powerful reference point of access to official information for the private citizen in any dispute with a Government body as to whether information should be released.  It puts the onus back on the bureaucracy to justify to an independent appeals system, or even to the courts, why official information should not be released.  The Bill does not contain a strong purpose clause which would establish a legal presumption of openness.</P>
      <P>Where definitions of exemptions are loosely cast, experience abroad also has shown that Departments tend to interpret them in their own favour and against the interest of the requester.  As a result the interest of the bureaucracy dominates and little information comes in the public domain.  The nature of exemptions proposed by the Senator are not clearly defined and would lend themselves to misuse by those eager to protect or withhold the information requested by the citizen.</P>
      <P>An independent appeals system is the very heart of effective freedom of information legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it does . . . but Senator Roche's Bill will only allow the Ombudsman make recommendations to the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Department would not be obliged to implement them.  On the other hand, the system adopted by the Government in December &mdash; the general scheme of freedom of information which was prepared by the Minister present &mdash; proposes binding powers for the office of the information commissioner. In addition, experience in the Ombudsman's office to date has shown that Departments should be placed under a statutory obligation to provide reasons in support of decisions and the onus of proof where matters are under appeal should rest with the Department concerned.  This constitutes a key provision in the proposals which the Minister has brought to Government and Which are being drafted at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complementing this, the general scheme provides for a system of internal review.  Experience abroad indicates that an internal review mechanism is a highly effective way of resolving freedom of information disputes &mdash; up to 30 per cent &mdash; between private individuals and Government agencies.  This also carries the benefit of avoiding a buildup and log jam of cases for the independent information commissioner.  A key issue in dealing with people in industrial relations is to allow those in dispute to talk about it first and if they cannot resolve their differences they should go to a higher authority.  The two people in dispute, the citizen looking for information and the Department, should have an internal mechanism to resolve <Col N="2122" /> it before taking it to the independent information commissioner.</P>
    <P>In every country operating freedom of information legislation it is accepted that not all information held by a Government can be readily accessible to the public.  Hence, the need for exemptions to protect key areas of Government. There may be instances, however, where information should be disclosed in the public interest notwithstanding the protection afforded by an exemption. It is important to ensure that exemptions are used in a reasonable way.  The general scheme proposes that the public interest be taken into account when considering issues under a number of exemptions.  There is no similar provision for consideration of the public interest in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche's Bill is vague on administrative arrangements.  The most disappointing practical feature of freedom of information systems in many jurisdictions relates to delays.  Delays arise in a number of areas, including failure by Departments to respond promptly with decisions on requests for information, or failure by the appeals system to deal with appeals within a reasonable timeframe.  Such delays could result in the public losing faith and confidence in the freedom of information system, which would fall into disrepute and disuse.  The Bill's objectives would be lost.</P>
    <P>The general scheme, as outlined by the Minister, specifies explicit time-frames within which administrators must process requests.  The Bill before the House makes no provision for legal protection for individuals releasing information under a freedom of information system against action relating to defamation.  This important provision will be included in the Minister's Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on preparing detailed legislative proposals on freedom of information based on best international practice.  The general scheme was approved by the Government in December and the heads of the Bill were presented to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, which considered <Col N="2123" /> them in detail.  It is hoped that the Bill will be brought forward as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>While we may criticise parts of Senator Roche's Bill, we must commend him for bringing it before the House. When on the other side of the House I often said that if we had the expertise available to us which the Minister had, we would be better able to draft Private Members' Bills.  Such facilities should be made available to Senators who want to introduce legislation.  I spent months researching legislation when on the other side of the House.  Some Bills were found defective and I accepted that in some instances.  Senators should have access to the expertise rightly available to Ministers.  I commend the Senator on his work.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue as the right to information is close to my heart.  It is a fundamental right of every citizen to know what information is kept about him or her on the many files in officialdom. As far as I am concerned, there should be no beating about the bush on this issue.  Everybody should have the basic right to know what the various powers in this State are saying about them.  The much abused words &ldquo;openness&rdquo;, &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; and &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; come into play here in a practical way.  These words have been bandied about too much in this and the other House, yet they mean so much in terms of their effect and import.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For too long this State was run like a secret organisation.  The system of Government put into place by de Valera, principally, and others was one to serve those holding power and seeking to maintain it with an iron grip. There is much talk now about the independence of persons appointed to independent bodies.  We must not forget the persistent policy of de Valera of infiltrating the Civil Service with those who found favour with Fianna Fáil and promoting those of like mind to the higher <Col N="2124" /> echelons of the Civil Service in its many divisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The result was that after many years Fianna Fáil held power whether in Government or not.  Its supporters were in the right places and could continue to serve their role so to speak.  Let us call a spade a spade.  The independence and impartiality of many individuals in positions of power today can be questioned because of the nature in which they originally came to those positions.</P>
      <P>I am not talking about one or two individuals but about civil servants, county managers, town clerks, planning officials, chief executive officers, etc. That abuse of power fed directly from the lack of information given to the public. Once people were starved of information they were helpless to fight for their rights, to question those in authority, to seek redress for incorrect and improper decisions and so on.  We must not forget that information is power.</P>
      <P>Freedom of information is about sharing that power and making the public service more accountable to the people it is supposed to serve.  At present we have an appalling and frightening lack of access to information, something which must be urgently addressed.  Senator Roche's Bill, which is good in certain areas, does not go far enough and for that reason I will oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see the doors to information flung open to everybody, not only those favoured by those holding positions of power and those who can afford to go to court seeking discovery.  Everybody should be able to get information sought by them on matters relating to tax, social welfare, banking, education, health, housing, grants and medical <Col N="2125" /> cards.  We do not have that right at present.</P>
    <P>I would like to put this into context because I speak from cruel experience. I have received numerous queries from individuals who want to know where they are on the housing list in their area. Despite repeated requests, Cavan County Council, Monaghan County Council and many of the UDCs in that constituency failed to give this basic information.  They will not disclose where an individual is on the housing list nor the size of the list.  That is disgraceful in this day and age.  It begs this question: is there a housing list for the area?  If there is a list and if it is based on objective criteria, why not disclose it?</P>
    <P>People in Castleblayney have come to me with a secret copy of the housing list on which their names are seventh or eighth.  Yet when there is an allocation of 12 houses, they do not get one.  If freedom of information legislation was in place, there would be a remedy by which they could gain the necessary information to see whether the decision was proper.  I am completely frustrated by the secrecy which prevails in the local authorities with which I am familiar.</P>
    <P>A county engineer can tell somebody that roads in their area will not be repaired because they dared to criticise the county council on the issue.  It is scandalous that nobody can do anything about this.  The fact that the county manager in Cavan threatened to sue me last Friday morning because I dared to query a decision made by the planning authority and appeal against it in circumstances where those affected were not given adequate access to files is nothing short of scandalous.  The fact that Monaghan County Council sold off or leased a national asset, in the form of Hope Castle and Lough Muckno leisure park, at a pittance to an English private registered company in peculiar circumstances and that the county manager and county councillors involved have refused to disclose information sought by the public about the nature of the <Col N="2126" /> transaction is nothing short of scandalous. The fact that certain individuals in this country are treated like gods who cannot be questioned because people are afraid to lose favour with them is nothing short of scandalous.</P>
    <P>The legislation cannot go far enough. Many of those in positions of power in this country must not sleep easy with the fear of such legislation coming into force.  The fact that they would be forced to actually assist somebody in pinpointing the information sought by them and obtain it for them must make certain individuals sick.  If decisions on applications for housing, medical cards, social welfare, business grants or farming schemes are being fairly and properly assessed, those in the public service have nothing to fear.  The legislation will only enable ordinary people to see that.</P>
    <P>Legislation of this type is not only needed to let people know how decisions affecting them are made and on what information those decisions are based.  It would be much more far reaching in its knock-on effect.  Such legislation would place an onus on all public bodies and public servants to keep careful, accurate, fair and professional records about individual citizens.  It will therefore protect against arbitrary, partial and biased decision making.  It will ensure that public servants will be there to serve the public in the best interest of our State without fear or favour.  It will make central Government, local government and all public bodies more accountable to the people they are supposed to serve.  It will overturn the principle of secrecy by which our bureaucracy and our State have been ruled to date.</P>
    <P>I joined the Labour Party because it serves ordinary people, not vested interests, because its believes in the provision of equal rights and opportunities to all our citizens and because it cannot be bought by anyone or any group.  If our party was to deliver nothing else in Government, which in point of fact is not the case, I want to see the widest possible Freedom of Information Bill brought into force by us.  I am making <Col N="2127" /> that quite clear to the Minister because it is so important.  The heads of the Bill introduced by the Minister indicate a good Bill, but it is a priority that, as a matter of urgency, it should go as far as possible to deal with the circumstances I outlined.</P>
    <P>I want to see everybody having access to information about themselves and about matters of public concern.  I cannot wait to see the day when every citizen will be given full access to files and data held about them, when they will be able to see the rules, regulations, internal memoranda and guidelines by which their dealings with the State are assessed and when they will be entitled to see the full reasons underlining any administrative decision which affects them.  Then and only then will Irish people know true democracy.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a Freedom of Information Bill. Since the Government took office the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, has on at least six separate occasions indicated in media briefings that the long awaited Government Freedom of Information Bill is imminent.  To date we have only got brief headings.</P>
      <P>A Fianna Fáil Freedom of Information Bill, based very closely on the Norwegian legislation introduced in 1967, was circulated in March 1995. Senator Roche was a consultant to the Norwegian Government on that legislation, so he knows what he is talking about.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Bill covers comprehensively the same ground as the draft scheme circulated by the Government.  However, the Fianna Fáil Bill differs from the Government proposals in a number of significant ways.  The Fianna Fáil Bill is much more comprehensive in its coverage than the Government proposals.  The Fianna Fáil <Col N="2128" /> Bill would apply to information on the files of all Government Departments, local authorities, health boards and State-sponsored bodies.  The Government Bill applies only to information in the possession of Government Departments. That is an awful loss because it is important that local authorities and health boards should be subject to freedom of information requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the Government scheme, the Fianna Fáil Bill recognises that certain information could not be made generally accessible.  The Fianna Fáil proposals differ from the Government Bill in that they seek to identify specifically the areas of exemption and codify effectively from day one all exemptions rather than leave any area of ambiguity.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Bill was discussed in Seanad Éireann in June 1995.  The Minister of State indicated that the Government would not be accepting the terms of the Fianna Fáil Bill on the basis that the Government would introduce its own legislation in the autumn of 1995. Indeed, the Minister of State promised specifically that her Bill would be introduced in Seanad Éireann in the autumn. It is obvious that there have been divisions within the Government parties on the significant areas to be covered by the Freedom of Information Bill.  Media reports suggest that opposition was particularly vigorous from the Department of Justice and the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear at this stage that the Government was not in a position to fulfil its often repeated promise that its own Freedom of Information Bill would be introduced in the autumn of 1995. The general scheme which has been circulated for consideration by a Dáil committee is an incomplete document which <Col N="2129" /> contains a number of striking ambiguities.</P>
    <P>If the Government parties are truly interested in getting a Freedom of Information Bill on the Statute Book at an early date they should accept the Fianna Fáil proposals as a basic document and allow an all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee, supported by a secretariat from the appropriate Government Departments, to refine and improve the Fianna Fáil proposals.  This was the approach adopted when the Ombudsman legislation was first mooted in the Dáil and has proved to be very successful. If the Government parties are truly interested in a Freedom of Information Bill they should accept a proposal along these lines from Fianna Fáil.  This approach would have the not inconsiderable benefit that the legislation which ultimately goes on the Statute Book would be the product of political and not bureaucratic minds.  Such legislation would reflect the views of the elected representatives of the people rather than the defensive predisposition of a number of Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The explanatory information circulated by the Minister indicates that the general scheme of the Freedom of Information Bill proposes to give citizens a legal right to information held by public bodies.  This scheme in fact focuses on the Civil Service, not on public bodies in general.  The Fianna Fáil Bill more closely fulfils the objectives outlined in the opening sentence of the Minister's explanatory material than does the Minister's own scheme.  The Minister outlines four key principles on which the Government scheme is based. The Fianna Fáil Bill covers all four of these principles.  However, in the case of the first principle, whereas the Government proposal suggests that access to information should be progressively increased, the Fianna Fáil draft legislation provides that there should be immediate and across the board access.</P>
    <P>In adopting an incremental approach to freedom of information, the Government is not only being unduly conservative but is in effect defeating the whole <Col N="2130" /> point of freedom of information legislation. Information is either free or it is not free; it is either accessible or it is not accessible.  Freedom of information legislation has been around for decades and has not caused consternation in other administrations.  The approach adopted in the Fianna Fáil Bill has been well tested over three decades in Norway and has been copied elsewhere. The Minister of State has put forward no logical explanation in support of the idea of the incremental approach to freedom of information legislation.</P>
    <P>In her opening comments the Minister of State dealt with the nature of the general scheme of a Bill.  The document she circulated explains the general scheme and heads of a Bill.  It obfuscates on whether the Government has agreed the headings.  The Government should accept this Bill rather than produce the heads of a Bill which will achieve nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the discussion of any freedom of information legislation. I am disappointed the Minister of State's Bill has not been brought forward yet.  It is ten months since we talked about it and I had hoped to have had sight of it by now.  There is too much secrecy about information in general in the State.  I would like to focus on that related to health boards and health issues.  It has been practically impossible for people to get any information on health records, for example.  Departments have gone to extraordinary lengths to call upon the doctor patient confidentiality relationship when refusing to give information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I admired Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn when she was Minister for Justice, a particularly sinister example of the use of this excuse took place when she was queried about the use of psychotrophic drugs in prisons.  Discussion tends to be concentrated on the use and abuse of illegal drugs in prisons, but we rarely consider the psychotrophic drugs.  I remember visiting Mountjoy Prison years ago and seeing a large bottle of Librium which must have <Col N="2131" /> been in use.  When the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, was asked in the Oireachtas for information on the number of prisoners in Mountjoy Prison on tranquillisers or sleeping tablets, she replied she could not give the information because of the confidentiality of the doctor patient relationship. I do not know how one could describe a global overview of the extent of the prescription of such drugs to about 670 people as breaking that confidentiality. When such lengths are taken to prevent such important information becoming public we have to examine the extent to which matters are covered up in the State.</P>
    <P>We in the medical profession have to take some of the blame for the fact that patients could not get hold of their records.  However, there has been great change in the level of access now given to patients, which is to everyone's benefit. I remember a time when if a patient dared to look at the chart hanging on the end of their bed they got a dressing down for daring to go beyond their status as patient.  Some years ago, when we were very short of money in the Rotunda Hospital, particularly for filing charts, the patients were given their charts to take home.  I had visions of the charts being left on the Finglas bus, but as it transpired the charts were never better cared for.  It was satisfactory because one could almost ask people to keep an eye on their haemoglobin levels. The only information one did not include on the charts was that which the patient might want kept private &mdash; they did not want every body on the bus home reading the chart.  It is about time that people were allowed access to a lot of information about themselves that we thought appropriate to keep from them in the past.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate the amount of money which will be needed to make information available.  Senator Farrell is right in saying that access should be free, but there will be a cost to the State.  When the problems in the Blood Transfusion Service Board first <Col N="2132" /> came to light one of the main difficulties was the impossibility of tracing those who had received anti-D immunoglobulin or blood transfusions.  About one third of the records were missing because of a lack of co-ordination between the hospitals and doctors. Ensuring information is made available will not be cheap.  Record keeping is expensive, although it should be done properly regardless of the expense.  Cost should not be used as an excuse to refuse access to information.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche's Bill allows for an appeal to the Ombudsman and this is an important provision.  If a person is denied information it is essential they have an appeal mechanism.  The courts should not be involved because they are slow, cumbersome and very expensive. The Ombudsman's office has established a reputation for fairness and the public's confidence in the office has not been misplaced.  It has performed a service for the public which cannot be overestimated.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State's Bill will be brought forward rapidly and that she will incorporate some of the best elements of Senator Roche's Bill.</P>

      <P>Freedom of information legislation &mdash; whether in the form of this Bill or the Government's long promised Bill &mdash; cannot in itself create the intended open society.  The legislation is a necessary condition for openness but it is not a sufficient condition in itself. In addition, we will need a culture change.  I know am speaking to the converted because Senator Roche and the Minister of State served in the Department of Finance and are aware of the culture change needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who hold information need to be convinced that an open information approach is desirable and that one can run a country with that approach. Otherwise, their efforts will be concerntrated on trying to frustrate the legislation, not in helping to make it work. We inherited an exceptionally secretive culture from the British &mdash; a culture in which knowledge is regarded as power <Col N="2133" /> and is jealously guarded for that reason. If we look at the example of America and the northern European countries we will see that there is another way which works very well.  Until I became a Member of this House I was unaware of the Scandinavian tradition and methods.  I have since realised how well they work.</P>
    <P>I accept Senator Henry's point that the cost may be high, but it is likely to come down with modern technology. The ability to have access to information, not necessarily in traditional written form but on computer, makes it much easier to achieve.</P>
    <P>Our secretive culture is by no means confined to Government; it applies just as much in business.  In both sectors the prevailing assumption is that at least 95 per cent of all information is sensitive and therefore must be kept confidential. I have always found, however, that the amount of information that is genuinely sensitive is very small.  It is probably more like the other way around: at least 95 per cent of information need not be kept confidential.  Senator Henry touched on this but I did not accept her point about the Finglas bus.  Similarly, when Senator Norris spoke yesterday about middle and upper income groups, he only referred to the south side of the city.  I am not sure why Senator Henry mentioned the Finglas bus&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, it is more likely that 95 per cent of information need not be kept confidential.  Often the commercial goals of the business are enhanced by releasing it.  We need to convince the present holders of information of this point.  In this case we are talking about the State and the Civil Service, where what is required is a culture change.  We need to convince them that there is life after disclosure, that the work of Government and administration <Col N="2134" /> could become easier, not harder, with a more open approach. There is a job of persuasion &mdash; evangelistically speaking, a job of conversion &mdash; to be done.  If the people who walk the corridors of power can become convinced of the merits of openness, any legislation passed will work in practice. However, if they are not so convinced, an enormous amount of effort will be put into frustrating and circumventing the legislation.  Few people would doubt it is eminently possible to do that, no matter how the legislation is drawn.</P>
      <P>This challenge will face the Civil Service and the State culture.  This Bill should pass &mdash; although the Minister has tried to convince us that her legislation is an alternative, we have not seen it and we have been waiting for it for some time.  However, if the Civil Service remains unconvinced, the cause of greater openness would not have been well served by passing a law.  I urge the Minister, in either accepting this Bill or promoting another, to remember this is not the end of the road &mdash; it is the start of a long journey to convince those who have the information of the benefits of change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this legislation because in this area we must catch up with a number of European countries. In a previous session of the Seanad we had an opportunity to discuss this matter at considerable length, so, historically speaking, my views are already on the record.  Since then, a distinguished former Member, whom we all recall with great affection and regard, Senator Brendan Ryan, published an important book on the necessity to achieve freedom of information in this country in so far as this is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a clear need to move in this direction with apparatus to protect the citizen in an era of greater invasion of privacy by various concerns.  In the last few days I have received a letter from an insurance company which guarantees my pension.  One curiously sinister phrase in the letter was: &ldquo;We are aware that you have travelled abroad&rdquo;.  I <Col N="2135" /> would have thought such an activity was exhilarating and bound to do me good. On one hand, some organisations are acting as &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; and acquiring information about private citizens &mdash; for instance, I have been told that insurance companies mount surveillance operations, employing private detectives to monitor people who make claims.  On the other, Government is frequently protective of information even where the interests of the State are not threatened.</P>
    <P>One Member thought 20 per cent of information is genuinely sensitive &mdash; that seems rather high.  In Britain, one sees the granting of immunity certificates in a highly politicised way with the intention of affecting the rights of a private citizen in a trial, with adverse effects in the Matrix Churchill case.  I hope we ensure the rights of citizens are maintained against Government, bureaucracy and agencies like insurance companies and that the use of a let-out clause covering national security would be so clearly defined that it could not be abused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank every Senator who contributed to this debate.  I intended to be provocative when I circulated this Bill on 16 March last year, because we have a fundamentally unhealthy attitude to information.  As Professor Paddy Lynch of UCD said, the Irish public service, particularly the Civil Service, guards its most commonplace file as if it contained the last copy of the formula for eternal youth.  My intention in introducing this simple Bill was to do precisely what Senator Gallagher suggested should be done &mdash; to throw open the doors and windows of every State bureaucracy and make it a statutory right for every citizen to have access to every piece of information, save where on a statutory basis the Houses of the Oireachtas decided the information should, for good purpose, be withheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without being unduly controversial, I must observe that Government foot-dragging <Col N="2136" /> is denying Irish people their fundamental right to information.  This is not only today or yesterday &mdash; it has been foot-dragging by the permanent Government of this State, which is where the problem lies.  In the Programme for Government, a firm commitment is given to the Irish people to end the secrecy which has been the hallmark of Irish public administration throughout our history.  The undertaking is not a new one &mdash; the Government is not entering forbidden or uncharted territory.  During the life of the previous Government good spadework was done on freedom of information by the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, and other Members.</P>
    <P>I circulated this Bill over 12 months ago.  If it were not for the prevarications and failures of the Government and the difficulties the Minister has had with some who are less willing than she is to commit to the liberalisation of public administration, the Bill &mdash; no doubt improved and strengthened by parliamentary debate &mdash; could now be part of the law of this land.  Government foot-dragging, opposition from specific Departments and the hostility of nameless, faceless mandarins, allied to a level of incompetence on the issue, combined to deny the Irish people the right to information, which is a tragedy.</P>
    <P>This is not a party political or partisan matter; it is supported by every right-minded public representative at every level in this nation.  Senator Gallagher's contribution showed this.  Another example is the chairman of Wicklow County Council, who had to take the county manager to the High Court to have access to files which are statutorily open to him.  That is an extraordinary waste of taxpayers' money.  On 7 June 1995, the Minister of State persuaded this House to still its hand on this matter by informing Members that:</P>
    <P>There was a commitment in the Government programme to have my legislation before the House by Christmas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2137" /> In the same speech she informed the Seanad that:</P>
    <P>Work on my Freedom of Information Bill is at a very advanced stage.  We have completed a draft Bill which is now being studied by Departments. . . .</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with the Minister of State.  However, since that time there has been a truncated and bizarre process where the heads of a Government Bill were given to a Dáil Select Committee. Such action specifically excludes the Members of the Seanad from participating in the debate.  In a characteristic flourish of hyperbole, for which her party has become renowned, the Minister of State informed the House that:</P>
    <P>What my Bill sets out to achieve is nothing short of a transformation in the way our system of Government works. . . .</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well in that regard because this House has not yet formally seen her Bill.  The Minister of State concluded her speech with a final promise to Seanad Éireann which persuaded a number of Senators from all sides of the House to suggest that I should not press my Bill to a vote at that time.  She stated that she would introduce the Government's Freedom of Information Bill in Seanad Éireann in the autumn of 1995.  I have no doubt that she meant to fulfil her promise, but she did not.  Instead she circulated the draft heads of a limited and limiting Bill to a Dáil committee.  With all due respects to the Members of the Lower House, I would be understating the case if I said that I was anything other than disappointed by the debate which took place on the heads of that Bill.  By taking that course of action, the Minister of State deliberately sought to exclude Seanad Éireann from playing any meaningful role in this area.  That is a fundamental mistake.  Most importantly, however, the Bill currently before the Dáil committee is a truncated measure which will have a limited application and will exclude important areas of public <Col N="2138" /> information from freedom of information measures.</P>
    <P>I remind Members that the Bill I circulated was uncomplicated and simple. It was closely based on the Norwegian Freedom of Information Act, of which, as a consultant with the Nordic Council, I had some experience.  I spoke to people involved in public administration in Norway last spring who informed me that it had had very little impact and implementation of its measures cost a relatively small amount.  As other Members stated, the vast majority of information in public files is not really secret and should be accessible.  Senator Gallagher should have the right to enter the offices of her local council and gain access to any files she wishes to see.  The public also have a right to do so.</P>
    <P>The Norwegian Act was followed by the introduction of Freedom of Information Bills in many other countries.  It focused on the premise that all information in the public service should be readily accessible unless excluded on a good basis.  The point of my Bill was that access to information could only be excluded on a statutory basis.  Under this arrangement information could only be withheld if such action were specifically ordered by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This approach meant that there would be no need for an information bureaucracy or a costly infrastructure to implement information measures.  In addition to providing the people of Ireland with the right to information, my Bill would provide a right to a written explanation for the reasons for withholding information.  A third right granted to citizens in my Bill would be a simple and uncomplicated right of appeal, on refusal of information, to a strengthened Ombudsman's Office.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that the Office of the Ombudsman's has become well established in the Irish mind.  As public representatives, we are aware that the Irish people like to deal with complaints on a person to person basis.  The appropriate place for the first complaint relating to this issue is with the Ombudsman.  I accept Senator Neville's point that the <Col N="2139" /> Ombudsman has no statutory right to force an administrative body to go along with his findings.  I previously criticised that position and will introduce a Private Members' Bill in the near future to address a number of the lacunae in the Ombudsman Act.</P>
    <P>During the first ten months of this Government's term of office, media briefings indicated on six occasions that introduction of the Freedom of Information Bill was imminent.  We were promised comprehensive legislation. Seanad Éireann was promised that the Freedom of Information Bill would be introduced last Christmas.  Instead of progressive legislation, the Minister of State has circulated a draft scheme which is limited and incremental in its application.  It will be bureaucratic in its operation and will be unlikely to come before the Houses during the life of the current Dáil.</P>
    <P>The most fundamental difference between the Minister of State's and my proposals is that by enacting the legislation which I proposed the Dáil and Seanad could ensure that the Irish people enjoy the right to information now, rather than waiting for a more truncated right in the distant future.  The Minister of State's Bill and the draft heads are not before this House, but have been referred to by a number of Members.  The incrementalist approach adopted in this Bill is not the handiwork of a politician interested in liberalising Irish public administration.  In my opinion, it is not the handiwork of the Minister of State, whom I have known for some time.  It was stated earlier that we shared time in that most mandarinlike of institutions, the Department of Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Minister of State must, unfortunately, deal with the realities of Government.  The draft heads of the Bill which she circulated have many failings.  It would not be appropriate for me to list them now.  However, the tragedy is that under the rules we could not do what I proposed last June &mdash; merge the two proposals and refer them to an all-party Oireachtas committee. That committee could have been given a free and independent secretariat to produce, as happened in the case of the Ombudsman's Act, a piece of legislation which all politicians could support.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State's Bill well, but I do not believe it will be enacted during the life of the current Dáil.  I hope I am wrong, because a Freedom of Information Bill is needed.  I accept that my Bill has many warts, as does the Minister of State's.  However, if both Bills were referred to an all-party Oireachtas committee we could produce something worthwhile to serve the Irish people.</P>

In principle, I do not like to take the course of striking down a Private Members' Bill on Second Stage before debate has been <Col N="2141" /> fully exhausted.  I am a member of the Government's legislation committee and I can inform Senator Roche that the Minister of State's Bill is at a very advanced stage.  It is a comprehensive piece of legislation, but does not have some of the defects the Senator seems to think it may contain.  Nonetheless, that is not for me to judge.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to this Bill being given a Second Reading.  At that point, we could then discuss if there could be a merging of the strong points of both Bills.  It is good for this House that a Bill be given a Second Reading and therefore I will not be objecting to this Bill being given a Second Reading.</P>

I remember as a civil servant and at certain times as a local authority and Oireachtas Member being very frustrated by the unhealthy attitude we adopt to information.  It is very frustrating.  If we could pool our resources on this issue we could help the Minister, because I know from friends and ex-colleagues in the Civil Service the difficulties she has had.  It would give me no delight to score political points; we could strengthen her hand greatly.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the House will agree a Second Reading of the Bill.  Perhaps the Leader of the House and the leader of the Opposition could discuss some appropriate way in which to involve Members of the Seanad in the discussions on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to <Col N="2142" /> make this contribution to this important debate.  Ten days ago, on 23 March 1996, the people of Taiwan went to the polls to elect their President by direct universal suffrage.  This was the first time they had the opportunity to do so. This direct election represented the final stage in the development of democratic institutions in Taiwan, a development that can only be welcomed.</P>
      <P>It was, therefore a matter of grave concern that The People's Republic of China should have conducted so-called war games in the Taiwan Straits and in the mainland province of Fujian for a period of 18 days last month, including the firing of missiles and military exercises, with the apparent aim of influencing the election in Taiwan and of intimidating the electorate.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was the subject of an Adjournment debate in this House as recently as 27 March 1996.  On that occasion I informed the House that on 8 March 1996, the day of the commencement of the testing of missiles by The People's Republic of China in the Taiwan Straits, a declaration on behalf of the European Union, including Ireland, had been issued on this matter by the current Italian Presidency in Rome and Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This EU Declaration, within the context of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, regretted the firing by The People's Republic of China of missiles into test zones in the Taiwan Straits. Further, the declaration stated that naval and military exercises which had also been announced could lead to further tension in the region and increase the possibility of any miscalculation eventually leading to confrontation. In addition, the European Union recalled the repeated pledge made by The People's Republic of China that it would stick to its fundamental policy on the Taiwan issue, that is, the seeking of a peaceful solution to the problem, called upon The people's Republic of China to refrain from activities which could have negative effects on the security of the entire east Asian region and urged an early resumption of the cross-straits <Col N="2143" /> talks, which had been suspended in June 1995 following the private visit to the United States of America by Taiwanese President Lee Teng Hui.</P>
    <P>I have noted the subsequent resolution of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, which was passed on 13 March 1996, and which called on the Government to condemn in the strongest terms the war games being carried on by The People's Republic of China which were seen as an attempt to threaten and intimidate the people of Taiwan and to express to the Chinese authorities, both bilaterally and through the European Union, the concern felt in this country and worldwide at the latest threat to the stability of world peace.  It will be seen quite readily from the contents of the EU Declaration of 8 March 1996, which I have just outlined, that the sentiments contained in the resolution of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs were brought home to the Chinese authorities without delay and in the clearest of terms.</P>
    <P>No Member of this House can be in any two minds with regard to the depth of feeling on the subject of Taiwan which is held by the current leadership in Beijing.  On Friday last, Vice-Chairman Tian Jiyun of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of The People's Republic of China met with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in Leinster House.  In a fairly robust response, he rejected criticism of the recent Chinese military exercises. He maintained that the recent Chinese military build-up and exercises near Taiwan were a &ldquo;normal phenomenon&rdquo; which were necessary to upgrade the capability of the armed forces.  He underlined the fact that the exercises &ldquo;demonstrated the determination of China to safeguard its territorial integrity&rdquo;. Mr. Tian went on to say:</P>
    <P>As for our policy regarding Taiwan it is always clear that it is peaceful reunification and one country, two systems.  This principle remains <Col N="2144" /> unchanged.  However, should anyone declare Taiwan's independence or separate Taiwan from the motherland so as to create one China and one Taiwan, the entire Chinese people will not tolerate it.  China has never committed itself to the non-use of force.  Should the above mentioned case take place [that is, independence], China will use all means possible, including military means, to safeguard its unity.  This is very clear.  No matter who is in power in China, he will surely pursue this policy.  Anyone who surrenders on this issue will be surely overthrown.  You must understand that China regards the integrity of its sovereignty as a sacred thing. Any other country will do the same.</P>
    <P>I have quoted Vice-Chairman Tian so extensively to try to bring home the stark reality of the depth of feeling regarding Taiwan held by The People's Republic of China, as indicated so recently to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated the serious concern which was expressed at the Chinese war games which were conducted last month.  The Government were no less concerned at the announcement by Taiwan last weekend that three sea-air military drills would be held this month from 7 to 10 April, including the use of live ammunition in the front-line island group of Matsu.  It is the Government's view that such exercises at this moment would not be conducive to the reduction of tensions in the region and should be reconsidered.  The best possible way to defuse tensions between Taiwan and China is the resumption of direct talks at the earliest possible opportunity.  I am glad to learn that Taiwan's Premier Lien Chan yesterday ordered the proposed military exercises to be suspended in order to alleviate worries over escalating tensions with China and to maintain regional peace and stability.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the election on 23 March 1996 was a victory for the incumbent Taiwanese President Lee Teng Hui with 54 per cent of the vote; 10.7 million <Col N="2145" /> votes were cast, representing a turn out of 76 per cent.  His closest rival, Dr. Peng Ming Min of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, polled 21 per cent, while former Taiwan Provincial Governor of the pro-unification with China New Party received 15 per cent and the independent, Mr Chen Li An, achieved 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The initial reaction from Beijing was to restate its customary line: regardless of the procedures which the &ldquo;rebel province&rdquo; used to select its leaders, there was only one China and Taiwan is an inseparable part of that unity.  In the past China had accused President Lee Teng Hui, who was born in Taiwan, of being a secret advocate of independence for Taiwan.  On 25 March 1996, however, the spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry called for a meeting between Mr. Lee Teng Hui and President Jiang Zemin, as well as the opening of direct air, shipping and postal links across the Taiwan Straits. Taiwanese vice-president elect Lien Chan has indicated that Taiwan will follow a policy of détente and his administration has drawn up a tentative timetable seeking the resumption of top level unofficial talks between Taiwan and China.</P>
    <P>Independence would not appear to be a feasible option for Taiwan.  Not alone is there the overriding threat from China if such a development were to be pursued, it would also appear that those supporting independence in Taiwan are very much in the minority.  Taiwan administration spokesman, Mr Jason Hu, is quoted to have stated in Washington D.C. last week, citing recent polls, that support for independence in Taiwan hovers around 12-16 per cent while support for unification with China has fallen as low as 14 per cent.  He said that the lack of support for independence was highly significant at this juncture as it indicated that more and more people in Taiwan considered a declaration of independence to be a most dangerous move and that the overwhelming support for President Lee <Col N="2146" /> Teng Hui in the recent election meant that on a longer-term basis most people in Taiwan still envisage a reunified China one day, which would come at a time when the mainland had caught up economically, politically and socially with the rapid changes which Taiwan has already experienced.</P>
    <P>The question of UN membership for Taiwan has been raised in certain quarters from time to time.  The UN Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in commenting upon this matter last week, reiterated the UN position that Taiwan was an integral part of China and that it would be impossible for the Taipei administration to gain admittance to the United Nations without the blessing of China.  He said that the UN could not admit a member without the recommendation of the Security Council.  As China has the right of veto in the Security Council, unless there was a change of mind in Beijing, there was no possibility of admitting Taiwan into the UN.  Certain member states have tried to put the issue on the UN agenda, but the majority of states have refused to do this.  It should be borne in mind that only 31 states have diplomatic relations with Taiwan while there are at present 185 member states in the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Members of this House will be aware that when Ireland established diplomatic relations with The People's Republic of China in 1979, the then Government recognised the Government of The People's Republic of China as the sole Government of China, including Taiwan.  Arising out of this one China policy Ireland does not recognise Taiwan as a state and consequently does not have diplomatic or official relations with Taiwan.  Economic trade and cultural relations between Ireland and Taiwan are pursued within the private rather than the public sector. In Taipei, the ITI Ireland Office has been established under the auspices of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation while the equivalent in Dublin is the Taipei Representative Office.</P>
    <P>Taiwan is one of the most dynamic economies in east Asia.  It is now the <Col N="2147" /> 14th largest trading entity in the world with the second largest foreign exchange reserves, second only to Japan.  Although Ireland has no formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, it has become an important partner for us in terms of trade.  There is much further potential in the fields of inward investment, educational exchanges and tourism. Ireland offers a highly attractive environment to Taiwanese companies with a highly educated, skilled and flexible workforce.  Efforts are being made in the area of education and English language proficiency to attract Taiwanese students to Ireland.  We also welcome an increasing number of tourists and business visitors.</P>
    <P>Taiwan has now firmly established democratic institutions.  The territory is gaining in economic prosperity.  It is the firm hope of the Government that the existing differences between China and Taiwan can be resolved through peaceful means and dialogue and thus contribute to the peace and security of east Asia.  I am glad to have the opportunity to put the Government's position on the record of the House.</P>

The situation is part of a broader picture and the Minister in the latter part of his address referred to this when he made reference to the fact that Ireland has recognised that Taiwan is an integral part of China.  Indeed, it was a colleague of ours, Senator O'Kennedy, who, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1979, was involved in that recognition. There is a matter of sovereignty here.  Do we or do we not agree that <Col N="2148" /> China has a right of determination over areas within its sovereign area?  Ireland has agreed with the UN that there is one China.  The Chinese have agreed that there is one China but two systems. When they say two systems, they are basically talking about two systems of internal government in the province of Taiwan and, indeed, a different commercial system to date.</P>
      <P>One must look at this whole area as one where great changes are taking place.  One must look equally at the situation where in 1948 a number of people who had fought a civil war on mainland China left China and set up business on Taiwan.  The people who stayed on the mainland have had a chequered history in which there have been major structural changes.  People can judge for themselves whether or not those changes have been for the good.  We must take the situation as taking place at a time of dramatic change in China and the surrounding area.  There is no doubt but that 1997 will probably be a year in which many people will be looking at China after it takes back Hong Kong from the British. Let us be quite straight about it: the British took Hong Kong as a result of trading which we are trying to eradicate here at present, that is, as a result of drugs wars.</P>
      <P>It must be said that in 1948 a huge amount of money was taken out of mainland China to Hong Kong by Chiang Kai-Shek and his supporters.  It is equally certain that possibly the best museum in the world is in Taipei.  The artefacts there are from every province in China.  There is a possibility that had those artefacts not been taken to Taiwan, they may have been destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.  I did not hear anybody suggest that all these artefacts should be brought back to mainland China.  However, they were taken from every Chinese province and the museum there may form one of the best profiles of any country in the world. That is no mean feat when one considers the size of China.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2149" /> China has major population problems. There are 20 million people in Taiwan.  However, the population of China is currently growing at a rate of 16 million people, or four times the Irish population, every year.  Its other major problem is in trying to change from an agricultural to a modern industrial society.  While this change is being carried out, it has created internal problems. There will be conflicts in changing from a Government controlled society to an open commercial one.  There are also major upheavals involved in changing from a rural to an industrial environment. Some 600,000 hectares of Chinese land was taken from food production last year to cater for industry. When one remembers that China makes up approximately one quarter of the world's population, and it is still growing, there will be problems in feeding its people when it is changing its society from a predominantly rural to an open industrial one.  Some 70 million Chinese people live on the poverty line, who are not even up to basic Chinese standards of living.</P>
    <P>The accommodation necessary between Taiwan and China is similar to that between Hong Kong and China &mdash;&ldquo;One country, two systems.&rdquo;  If the Hong Kong system is a success, there is no doubt it can also work for Taiwan. There are even no absolutes in trade between China and Taiwan.  Much of their trade is carried out through intermediaries. Many Chinese exports are contingent on Taiwanese traders working out of Singapore or Hong Kong and <i>vice versa.</i> We hope this trade will continue to grow.</P>
    <P>We do not want to see conflict between a small island and its motherland. It would be similar, in terms of size, if Rathlin Island produced a Government and president and tried to dictate to the rest of the country.  Taiwan received a lot of economic assistance from the American economy in the late 1940s to the 1960s.  America pumped an enormous amount of money into its economy at the time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2150" /> The people living in Taiwan and on the Chinese mainland are kind and hardworking.  Since it is opening up its society, we must take into account what is happening there.  We should get them to agree to a peaceful resolution.  We do not want to see the United States becoming involved as a policeman in the area.  As China opens its society, we must ensure it defends civil rights and overcomes its problems with Taiwan and hope that democracy will prevail.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  While this complex matter will not be resolved by what we say today, some intervention should take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State and the Minister for Foreign Affairs for agreeing to this debate.  It is important that it takes place.  We have asked for such a debate for some months and, while we were not optimistic of its coming about, we are pleased it has.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to wish the new democratically elected President of Taiwan, Mr. Lee Teng Hui, every success in the difficult and onerous job he now faces.  He was elected in a free and open election and that strengthens his position.  He now presides over a full democracy in a free country.</P>
      <P>Ireland and a considerable number of other countries were requested by the Taiwanese Government to send observers there to see that its election was carried out in a free, fair and open way, and in a totally impartial manner, and that people were given the opportunity of exercising their franchise.  If only such opportunity was afforded in many other countries.</P>
      <P>I was given the opportunity to go to Taiwan to observe its elections. However, because of other business in the House, I was not able to go.  Two senior Members of the Houses did attend and they were satisfied that the election was carried out in an open and fair way.  They were further satisfied that the will of the Taiwanese people had been fully expressed through the ballot box.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2151" /> The conduct of The People's Republic of China in carrying out military exercises just off the coast of Taiwan was a serious matter.  An election was taking place there, yet mainland China tried to interfere with and influence that election.  The military exercises, including aircraft sorties and the launching of missiles with live ammunition, were condemned by our Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and by Members of this House.  That conduct was wrong and had to be condemned.</P>
    <P>At the time, a statement issued on behalf of the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros Ghali, referred to the military exercises conducted by China.  The Secretary General hoped that all concerned would exercise restraint so as not to interfere with the rights of other states under international law and to avoid tensions in the area.  Dr. Boutros Ghali said the issue of Taiwan was &ldquo;an internal one&rdquo;, but the UN should have made a strong statement.  By claiming the issue was an internal one when an election was under way and military force was being used off the coast to bully and intimidate the Taiwanese, the UN statement could not have done other than make The People's Republic of China believe it was supportive.  Indeed, many people might feel it was an invitation to continue this type of military aggression.</P>
    <P>We must be clear and unambiguous in condemning this type of conduct which can only be described as military aggression.  Senator Lanigan described the activities as war games, but when live ammunition is used that is hardly the way to describe them.  That type of military activity is highly dangerous and could plunge the whole area into a blood bath, engulfing many people and leading to much loss of life.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's concern about Taiwan's earlier announcement of army, naval and air force drills from 7 to 10 April, including the use of live ammunition on the front line Matsu Islands.  I am glad, however, that Taiwan's Premier, Lien Chan, has ordered the proposed <Col N="2152" /> exercises to be suspended.  That is important because while the Government in Beijing was rightly condemned for military exercises, the Government of Taiwan has now recognised it would have been a mistake to carry out such exercises themselves.  Let us hope this type of military activity is totally halted by Beijing and that Taiwan will not indulge in such exercises either.</P>
    <P>The election in Taiwan resulted in a clear victory for President Lee Teng Hui with 54 per cent of the vote.  Beijing stated that &ldquo;regardless of the procedures which the rebel province used to select its leaders there was only one China, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of that unity&rdquo;.  However, Taiwan cannot be described as a rebel province, especially as its leaders have been democratically elected.</P>
    <P>Taiwan has diplomatic relations with 31 states and as the Minister pointed out there are 185 member states in the United Nations.  After the collapse of the Berlin Wall, Ireland recognised a number of new states and welcomed the new democracies set up after communism was driven out of eastern Europe. We welcomed the new fledgling states in eastern Europe where people had freedom of expression through the ballot box in democratic elections.  The same principles that applied to eastern Europe should apply to Taiwan.</P>
    <P>Members of the United Nations feel they have the backing of democracies across the world.  Taiwan is seeking UN membership but Beijing, which has a seat on the UN Security Council, is opposed to that.  Ireland should endeavour to support Taiwan's admission to the United Nations.  That would be good for democracy and for peace across the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of The Republic of China in Taiwan are a peace loving, industrious, cultivated and civilised people who are interested only in establishing full democracy.  Like ourselves, they are interested only in freedom. It is clear that the people of Taiwan are no threat to The People's <Col N="2153" /> Republic on mainland China.  President Lee himself has emphasised time and again that it is not his wish to divide the Chinese people or Chinese nation in any way.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China in Taiwan is interested in progress, it is not interested in the barbarity of war.  The Taiwanese people are interested only in developing democratic institutions and freedom.  That interest is well illustrated by their generous support for emerging nations in the Third World.  Their generosity in Africa and in South American states must be commended.</P>
      <P>Against this we have the dangerous and reprehensible action by the regime of The People's Republic of China.  The recent exercises in the Taiwan Straits were a crude attempt to undermine or destroy democratic progress.  In many ways that attempt was unworthy of the Chinese, a great civilisation.</P>
      <P>The historic elections on 23 March 1996 were an extraordinary hallmark in the march of a people who, for the first time in thousands of years, selected their own leadership democratically. The so-called war games did not have an impact on democratic procedures on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan and their political leaders realise that democracy is a tenacious flower.  Freedom cannot be suppressed by guns, rockets, threats or the brandishments of a bully.  Freedom and democracy have taken a tenacious hold on Taiwan.  Senator Lanigan referred to the Palace Museum in Taipei, an extraordinary treasure house of the Chinese people and their civilisation which stretches back over thousands of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Republic of China is, in many ways, like Ireland.  During the Dark Ages in Europe civilisation and culture remained in place in Ireland and, in time, spread back to the mainland.  It is my fond hope for the Chinese people that freedom and democracy will bloom not just in the fertile plains, valleys and hills of the island the Portuguese called beautiful &mdash; Formosa &mdash; but that the seeds will spread across the Taiwan <Col N="2154" /> Straits and take hold on the mainland so that the Chinese people can enjoy the democracy and freedom we take for granted.</P>
    <P>There is another side to this issue and it is the importance of Taiwan in the economic life of the Pacific rim.  It is extraordinary to think of what has been achieved on a small island.  It is the fourteenth largest trading nation in the world.  It is also extraordinary that democracy and the economic progress achieved through the ingenuity of the people of the Republic of China could be threatened by a regime that is surely in its last kick.  The reality is that the exercises in the Taiwan Straits had more to do with an imminent leadership struggle on mainland China than with the democratic processes of the people of Taiwan.</P>
    <P>I join other Members in celebrating the ingenuity, civilisation and industrious nature of the people of Taiwan whom I had the great privilege to visit. I hope better counsel will prevail in Beijing than has prevailed in recent times.  I have no doubt they have suffered a loss of face as a result of their activities.  Hopefully they will learn that democracy is not a threat but is inevitable in that part of the world.</P>

      <P>I welcome this important debate on the frightening events that took place during the elections in Taiwan. I also celebrate the emergence of Taiwan as a democratic state and its development as a major economic entity in the Pacific region.  I congratulate President Lee Teng Hui on his election and his initiative in progressing the emergence of democracy in Taiwan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reaction of the Chinese is a demonstration to the citizens of Taiwan that they are not the sole bosses of their destiny as long as mainland China, which is 175 kilometres across the Taiwan Straits, considers Taiwan to be a renegade province.  Beijing saw the election as a conscious move by Taiwan and President Lee towards a political status independent of The People's Republic of China.  Twice in the past nine months <Col N="2155" /> China has sent rockets in Taiwan's direction.  However, the most recent rockets arrived much closer than those fired last summer and were far more dangerous.  They landed only 45 kilometres away from Taiwan's two main shipping ports from where shipments of computers, VCRs and high fashion undergarments are sent to markets all over the world.  Ships and planes were forced to detour from the target zones, although port and aviation activities were not seriously disrupted.  That is an indication of how serious these unacceptable war games were.  The test firings are proof that China can blockade Taiwan's economy for longer than a week if it wishes.</P>
    <P>China's flexing of its military muscles provided a dangerous and stormy background to the emerging democracy in Taiwan.  Nobody would have believed a few years ago that the 21 million people of Taiwan would have achieved such a material improvement in their lifestyle. The campaign to elect a president in Taiwan was fought vigorously.  The general razzmatazz, campaigning and postering that is common to democratic elections were employed by the major candidates and China's unacceptable and belligerent approach did not dampen the enthusiasm of the new democracy.</P>
    <P>China's activities warned Taiwan that it will never be independent and should not seek recognition abroad.  The issue for China, however, was not independence but democracy.  By electing a president the Taiwanese people are exercising their rights as a modern sovereign people.  People in China will ask their regime why they cannot do the same.  In Chinese culture the fact of the election and its result is profound.  It raises serious questions about authoritarianism and democracy in China.</P>
    <P>One must be concerned about the response of the Chinese when they came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on 13 March. The rejection of criticism of the recent Chinese military exercises was an indication <Col N="2156" /> of how belligerent China is about the situation and to call the recent Chinese military build-up normal indicates how serious is the situation.  Mr. Tian, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, told the committee that it demonstrated the determination of China to safeguard its territorial integrity.  He said that China had never committed itself to the non-use of force.  That should send signals to the free world that this situation will be ongoing and must be closely watched.  The Taiwanese democracy must be supported by the free world to ensure that its emergence can be seen as a beacon of light shining towards China.</P>
    <P>One must also flag the deep concern everybody must have about the inhuman approach of China to its own people.  There is a need for a debate on the issue of human rights in China. Despite its economic freedom, human rights violations take place on a massive scale.  They range from harassment or detention for those perceived to be a threat to the established order to gross violation of the physical integrity of the person and his right to life.  This is totally unacceptable.  These violations are caused by official policies, repressive legislation, a system of administrative detention and an arbitrary exercise of power by officials.  The activities against Taiwan, the television reports about the abuse of children and the recent elections should cause us to look closely at what is happening in China.  We should have a debate on those issues in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this discussion.  I support and congratulate the Minister on the policy he has adopted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important issue not only for the people of Taiwan but also for the people of the world.  The question, when and in what circumstances should a nation state or a union be allowed to cede part of a member state, is not easy to answer.  The American Civil War was fought on that issue <Col N="2157" /> and it is also an issue today in parts of Europe.  According to China, it is an issue of territorial integrity.  If I lived in Taiwan and I was asked to choose between Taiwan and China &mdash; I have not visited either &mdash; I would choose Taiwan because I would like to think there was some type of democratic control in my life, that there were democratic institutions to which I could aspire and that it was the will of the people which ruled my country and not the dictates of a particular party which, in China, is the Communist Party.</P>
      <P>I am not entirely satisfied with the Minister's speech because it fails to adequately reflect what should be the ideological opposition to the bullying tactics of China, not just in this issue but in other issues as well.  Nobody will have failed to notice the queues of people waiting for passports in Hong Kong a few days ago.  Those people were speaking with their feet.  They have no faith that they will be safe under a Chinese Administration in Hong Kong.  The people in Taiwan would not feel safe under a Chinese Administration.</P>
      <P>If China had invaded Taiwan, what would have been the response of the western nations?  Only the United States attempted to show some kind of military support.  What would have been the Irish position?  Would we have issued a bland communiqué stating our regret and condemnation, while we continued our relationship with China?</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss this issue.  I compliment Senator Enright for raising it and the Minister for coming here today.  Unlike Senator Mulcahy, I am pleased with the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that 22 million people live in Taiwan and that they are operating an independent state. China lays its claim to Taiwan, yet Taiwan is moving towards democracy.  I compliment the Taiwanese on their first democratic election for president.  I also compliment the Members of the Oireachtas who travelled to Taiwan to supervise the elections.  It is important that all democracies fully support emerging democracies.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs adopted a resolution passed by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in relation to Taiwan, which was subsequently included in the EU Declaration on the activities of China outside Taiwan.  China brought the wrath of the international community down on itself by its military activities around Taiwan. It was an unnecessary exercise of its military power.  The Minister said that China always stated it would stick to its fundamental policy on the Taiwan issue &mdash; that is, to seek a peaceful solution to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was not at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs when it met the Chinese delegation last Friday.  At that meeting the vice-chairman, in response to questions put to him about Taiwan, stated that, if necessary, China was prepared to use military and other force to achieve its ambitions.  That is a serious statement by a senior Chinese politician.  When I visited China last October another senior politician stated they were prepared to use force if necessary.  I suggest that in view of last Friday's statement to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, that the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs would raise this issue <Col N="2160" /> with the Ambassador and the powers that be in China.  It would appear to be a break from and to run contrary to its traditional statements that its policy is to seek peaceful solutions.  This is a serious change in policy.</P>
    <P>Some 22 million people have a right to decide their future democratically.  It is important we recognise that people have a right to self-determination.  The people of Taiwan have that right and the international community must speak out in this regard, particularly through democratic means.  Senator Mulcahy said that democratic principles do not seem to apply in China.  China is not a democracy; it is a communist dictatorship, although it pretends that it is moving towards a socialist democracy.  If that happens, it will be a progressive move.</P>
    <P>China compares very poorly to Taiwan which is moving towards instituting a democratic system which is commendable. We must support Taiwan in every way possible.  At various stages China has stated that it is prepared to allow the Taiwanese to have their own administration, government, judiciary and the institutions of state.  If it is prepared to do that, why was it necessary for it to engage in military manoeuvres around Taiwan prior to the elections?  Was it an attempt to frighten the people of Taiwan so they would not vote in the democratic elections?  If so, we must lend our voice to the condemnation of China.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers compared the human rights situation in China to that in Taiwan.  Much is left to be desired as far as China is concerned.  However, despite its repressive laws in relation to women, children and individual freedom and those who speak out against the system, it must be encouraged to think about the right of the individual to self-determination.  The fact that a delegation came here last week and met various interest groups and politicians will only open their minds to western ways and subject them to further pressure. We should not lose any opportunity to get them to think in that way. <Col N="2161" /> However, we must recognise the inherent problems in that country.</P>
    <P>The Hong Kong problem will be shortly resolved.  When in China we were told that it was prepared to use the Hong Kong model for Taiwan.  It is important that people are aware of that. However, the way china has dealt with Taiwan is different to the manner in which it has operated in relation to Hong Kong.  There seems to be a different attitude and approach to Hong Kong.  The most significant problem is the fundamental change in policy &mdash; that it is prepared to use military force in relation to Taiwan, if necessary.  If this serious situation develops, undoubtedly it will draw in the major world powers and will cause disruption to international peace, toward which we must work and contribute.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we recognise the mentality of certain members of the political structure in China.  Taiwan must be complimented on the manner in which it is proceeding, that is, towards democracy.  This democratically elected institution and the EU must do everything to encourage and support Taiwan. I hope China will listen to the voices of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my admiration for the Chinese people and their remarkable and ancient civilisation. When we presume to dictate to the Chinese, we should recognise the extreme significance in terms of human history of their contribution to world civilisation.  In some ways they have a great deal to teach us.  This was made clear recently with the uproar about the &ldquo;Dying Rooms&rdquo;, which was justified but, we took a particular moral line which was placed in context subsequently when we unearthed the Goldenbridge scandal.  We must see this in a broad context, but that does not mean I am inclined to be uncritical of The People's Republic of China.  I am merely saying that I have great respect for the people of China in order to place in context some of the sharp and perhaps even stinging remarks I may need <Col N="2162" /> to make about the situation which exists at present between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt in mine or in other people's minds but that Taiwan is part of China.  Geographically, historically, culturally and linguistically it is part of China, but not politically.  The Chinese Government, which has wonderful phrases for everything, appears to be recognising this by stating &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo;.  However, that raises the question of the difference between the two systems on which I will concentrate.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Government has raised the question of the difference between the two political systems.  The international community has a right to express a view on this, a right which the Chinese Government does not accept. Instead of answering criticism, looking at its system and into its heart and attempting in the interests of its survival and the welfare of its people to ameliorate the situation, the Chinese Government has consistently deflected criticism and rejected accountability to the international community.</P>
      <P>I received a briefing from Amnesty International which I read carefully and with which I concur.  I would like to place some of the significant points on the record.  After discussions with Amnesty International we feel there are five specific things which the Government could usefully do.  It should urge the Government of The People's Republic of China to invite the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to visit China.  This is a fairly modest demand which the Government, as it moves towards Presidency of the EU, could legitimately and powerfully make.  After all, we are in a good position as regards China in that we sponsored what was then known as Red China in the United Nations.  We have demonstrated our flexibility there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could ensure the regular and effective monitoring of the human rights situation in China by the United <Col N="2163" /> Nations human rights bodies.  We could urge the Chinese Government to allow independent domestic and relevant international organisations to monitor the human rights situation in China.  We could encourage the Chinese Government to sign and ratify the ICCPR, its optional Protocols and the ICESCR and to recognise the competence of the United Nations Committee Against Torture to receive individual complaints and hear interstate complaints.  We could ensure that asylum seekers are not forcibly returned to China if they risk serious human rights violations and that the claims of all asylum seekers, including those in detention, are fully and impartially assessed.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of shame to me that a Government of Ireland should have attempted to return to China one of those who was heroically involved in the demonstration for democracy at Tiananmen Square.  We have much with which to reproach ourselves in terms of democracy and China before we start preaching to the Chinese authorities themselves.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn briefly to the question of Tibet.  I have been to China on a number of occasions.  It is a wonderful country and they are remarkable, courteous, cultivated and industrious people.  They will also be an extremely important party in terms of the development of the politics and economy of the world over the next quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>While I was there we were talking about James Joyce and one of my colleagues had a wonderful intellectual convection about <i>Ulysses</i> being a post-colonial text and so on.  He illustrated this with the crimes of Britain as an empire towards its colony, Ireland.  I said that was very comfortable for us and asked why not look at the analogous situation obtaining in Tibet.  If nothing else I said drew attention that certainly did.  It was so successful in provoking discussion that I repeated it in every university I visited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2164" /> We must make a strong human rights case with regard to the situation in Tibet.  It has been appalling and it continues with the utmost cynicism on the part of the Chinese authorities who, having for long maintained a position of atheist materialism, now presume to intervene in the determination of the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama for political reasons.  In pursuit of this they have kidnapped a six year old boy and accused him of crimes.  I would say to our friends in the Chinese Embassy that this kind of material is very disturbing to those who see themselves as friends of China.</P>
    <P>We must ask what is the nature of these crimes.  The Dalai Lama's designated reincarnation has been accused of being cruel to a dog, a heinous crime in the eyes of Buddha as if the people in Beijing gave a damn about the eyes of Buddha.  His parents are described as notorious for speculation, deceit and scrambling for fame and profit and as not being pious, honest and kind people. I ask the Minister to take up the case of this missing six year old boy who, whatever the religious ramifications, is but a pawn in a detailed political programme.</P>
    <P>I have to draw attention to the increasing arrests, in Lhasa for example. In early 1990 about 400 people were known to be in military detention; the figure is now over 600.  We are entitled to know what is happening to these people.  Why have they been arrested? Let us have some justification if China wants to take its rightful place in the community of moral nations.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International is concerned about over 50 monks and lay people detained as a result of the reincarnation controversy.  Eight further detentions believed to be associated with the reincarnation dispute have been reported.  On 2 September 1995 two lay women from a carpet factory run by the Tashilhunpo monastery were detained and on 4 November 1995 six monks were arrested for demonstrating outside the monastery.</P>
    <P>May I put on the record some of the names because I know this is effective? <Col N="2165" /> When I was in Canberra I listed people like Gendun Richen, who we had the honour of receiving here and who was a victim of the violation of human rights. I know that the Chinese authorities prick up their ears when people's names are placed on the record.  I would like to read some of these names onto the record: Chadrel Rimpoche's assistant, Champa Chung, Samdrup, a business from Shigatse, Gyatrul Rimpoche, a lama from the Tashilhumpo monastery. Others reported to have been detained include Shepa Kelsang, Lhakpa Tsering, Ringkar Ngawang, Ngodrup, Tenzin, Tendor, Sherab, Tashi Dondrup, Tsering Phuntsog, Chungdag, Pema, Penpa Tsering, Buchung, Sonam Phuntsok, Tenzin, Gendun, Lobsang Tseten, Wangchuk, Pema Dorje, Lhakpa Tsering, Lobsang Dawa, Tsering Gonpo, Dorje Gyaltsen and Sil Zhi.</P>
    <P>At least 628 political prisoners are reported to be detained in Tibet as late as 1994.  This figure includes 182 women and 45 people who were aged under 18 at the time of arrest.  This compares with a figure of only 400 two years ago.  If I had time we could look at the details of those who are under age and are detained by the Chinese military authorities. I say this with respect to an ancient great people.  Their Government must move towards a situation where we can all respect them and they can operate to the benefit of their own people.  On that basis I would support the reintegration of the territory of Taiwan with mainland China where it clearly geographically and historically belongs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>Whenever I see a big boy bullying a small boy I feel that the big boy is in some way afraid of the small boy.  This is what we are seeing at the moment with The People's Republic of China looking across the Taiwan Straits at another country's development.  They are one nation and I have great respect for the Chinese people.  They taught the world an immense amount and are probably one of the two nations which <Col N="2166" /> have a decent cuisine &mdash; the other being the Italians.</P>
      <P>They look across and see the development in Taiwan.  They are not afraid of its economic strength, although it has the fifteenth largest economy in the world, but of the development of democracy.  As Senator Norris said some of the abuses they have perpertrated, particularly in Tibet, are appalling.  I remember a motion in the Seanad on the Chinese invasion and what they were doing in Tibet.  We were not strong enough in our condemnation of it and I believe we should not be afraid to say these things.</P>
      <P>The development of democracy frightens authoritarian regimes because these people belong to one nation.  If the large part looks across at the small part, it is not the people at the top but the people at the bottom who begin to ask why they cannot have democracy and freedom of movement such as people have in Taiwan.  That is what frightens the Government.  Anybody who read the statement of Mr. Tian will be frightened, as Senator Taylor-Quinn said.  It was frightening because it could very quickly precipitate a war that would involve America and many other nations and we do not want that.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the reintegration of the two parts of China but only when democratic reforms are put in place in The People's Republic of China.  I would look at how they will reintegrate Hong Kong first and see what model they use there.  If that is successful there may be a case for the other.  The Chinese people I have met here, whether from Taiwan or mainland China, have always been nothing but courteous and lovely people.  It is a pity this has developed.  One part of the nation has succeeded while the other has remained almost in the Middle Ages.  I can see how the people living in Taiwan would not want to be integrated but I can also see how the Government of The People's Republic of China is afraid of what the Taiwanese have put in place.  I hope we can support Taiwan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who made constructive contributions to the debate.  It is useful to attend in the Seanad to hear the contributions.  This is my second occasion in a short period to speak to the House on the Taiwan issue.  The current session of the UN Commission on Human Rights is dealing with the matter of human rights in China, including Tibet, and the question of arbitrary detention.  The draft EU resolution on human rights in China is being pursued at the UN.  The House is making statements on the situation in Taiwan and it is in that regard I wish to contribute.  I welcome the democratic developments in Taiwan and I note the welcome given by the Senators.</P>
      <P>It would appear from the contribution of one Senator that he wishes us to support the US exercises in the area while a former Minister for Foreign Affairs from his party, Deputy Andrews, recently described himself as &ldquo;flat earth&rdquo; on the issue of neutrality.  It is extraordinary that, when a debate on this issue is facilitated and I attend to take information from the debate that may help to form policy, provocative comments are made.  I reject them as petty and pursuing a separate selfish agenda.</P>
      <P>I hope the Seanad will continue to monitor this issue.  When I spoke in the House on 27 March last I indicated that the EU called on The People's Republic of China to refrain from activities which could have negative effects on the security of the entire east Asian region and urged an early resumption of the cross-straits talks.  I also said that &ldquo;The naval and military exercises had all the appearances of being gratuitously provocative&rdquo;. I do not know what a certain Senator would have me do.  Would he have me go and &ldquo;beat them with my cap&rdquo;, to quote a former Fianna Fáil Minister?  Would he have us take an extreme stand?  There seems to be a view that while the Americans react as they do we should react by sending faxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2168" /> We can influence the situation most with a balanced response.  We should try to influence The People's Republic of China towards opening up its country, towards the Taiwanese model which involves more democracy and towards accountability and human rights.  The Government has adopted that approach and will continue to do so.  Since the Irish Government recognised The People's Republic of China in 1979 we have had to pursue the one China policy while recognising the amazing developments that have taken place in Taiwan and to try to ensure that the democratic traditions which have taken root in Taiwan can be spread throughout the rest of China.</P>
    <P>With regard to the missing six year old Tibetan boy, the named successor to the Dalai Lama to whom Senator Norris referred, the Government has raised this matter and expressed its concern.  I look forward to participating in debates such as this from time to time.  They are useful to the Government and to me as Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs.  I found today's debate by and large informative and useful.</P>

    <Title>County Enterprise Boards: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pleasure to be here to address this issue.  As Members know, the county enterprise boards are a strategy to foster &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; development in counties.  For too long we developed on the basis of centralised decisions on grant aid and passed over the potential of many local communities to create enterprise and devise strategies for their area.  The county enterprise boards are filling that gap; they are drawn from trade unions, employers, the community and the agencies and give people an opportunity to look at their strengths and weaknesses and devise approaches which <Col N="2169" /> would be most attuned to their needs. At the heart of this approach is the development of a plan for the county.</P>
      <P>By way of background I will set out the development of the county enterprise boards and outline some of the work they are engaged in.  This will give Senators an impression of what we are trying to achieve.  I will be interested to hear the contributions, because this is an evolving area of policy about which we can learn and improve as we go along.</P>
      <P>The county enterprise boards are now well established and have, I believe, been actively addressing the mandate they were given to provide a new source of support for local enterprise initiatives. The original purpose of the boards was to fill a gap which had been identified in the range and scope of enterprise support services available to small and, especially, start-up businesses. They were developed as a countrywide scheme which would enable small enterprises to obtain funding from a variety of sources in order to assist local economic development.  It was envisaged that they would tap into local knowledge, energy and commitment and help maximise the efforts of the existing State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public intervention in the promotion of local development activity is a relatively recent phenomenon in this country. The main initiatives in this area heretofore were initially, the western development scheme which operated through county development teams in 11 counties and, subsequently, EU supported programmes such as Leader, INTERREG and the small and community enterprise scheme, a sub-programme of the operational programme for rural development.  These approaches to local economic development in a sense constituted a response to an industrial policy strategy which some believed over-emphasised the attraction of internationally mobile capital.  The perceived failings and limitations of this essentially &ldquo;top down&rdquo; model led to a growing recognition that action is also required at a local level to <Col N="2170" /> support small firm growth, given that the benefits of national economic prosperity do not automatically trickle down to local areas and communities.</P>
    <P>In the interests of drawing on past experience and ensuring that the wheel would not be reinvented, the western development scheme was used as an initial operational model following the establishment of county enterprise boards in 1993.  Primary responsibility for the duties of the county development teams has now been assumed by the county enterprise boards, and the activities which were previously assisted by the western development fund and SCES are now embraced by the broad remit given to the new boards.</P>
    <P>County enterprise boards represent a first effort to put in place a comprehensive but flexible local enterprise support mechanism on a countrywide basis. They take as their starting point the need to promote the know how of local development by switching the emphasis from support for centrally selected and funded projects towards investment in developing the knowledge, skills and entrepreneurial abilities of the local population and in changing attitudes. This is by no means an easy task and it depends crucially for its success on the capacity of those involved to develop a thorough understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the local economy and to proceed on the basis of a strategic plan to implement sharply prioritised activities.</P>
    <P>To appreciate the significance of the shift represented by the establishment of county enterprise boards as part of a new model of local development, it is useful to compare the level of resource allocation to the new boards with the provision for their predecessors. Throughout its history, the western development fund &mdash; operating through the county development teams in 11 counties, namely, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan, Mayo, Galway. Roscommon, Longford, Kerry, and west Cork, was modestly funded and addressed a relatively limited range of enterprise support activity.  In more <Col N="2171" /> recent years, from 1987 to 1993, the underlying per annum funding within the western development fund was £750,000, higher amounts shown in individual years being a result of special circumstances applying in those years.  As a result, most counties in the system could be guaranteed enterprise support capacity to a maximum of only £48,000 per annum for small grants, with the possibility of securing a limited amount of additional approvals in the form of main grants reserved to the central development committee.</P>
    <P>The position was improved when the county development teams assumed responsibility for the implementation of the small and community enterprise scheme in the western counties. However, overall amounts were still modest &mdash; between August 1992 and December 1994 only £2.9 million was drawn down between all western county development teams and Shannon Development.</P>
    <P>By way of contrast, the direct cash supports for capital projects, feasibility studies, etc., provided in the period ending 31 December 1995 by the county enterprise boards established in the same 11 western counties amounted to £6.44 million, or approximately 35 per cent of the total expenditure on direct grant support by boards throughout the country.  It is clear that the levels of funding available to the county enterprise boards for enterprise support purposes in the former western development counties is on a considerably larger scale than that formerly available to the western county development teams at any time.</P>
    <P>On the wider national front, I am satisfied that the funding currently being provided to all 35 county enterprise boards will enable them to achieve the board targets set for the initiative in the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99, under which the boards are supported by EU funding.  The planned investment by both the State and the EU under the OP for this <Col N="2172" /> initiative is IR£81.77 million for the period 1995 to 1999.</P>
    <P>The level of public expenditure on direct financial assistance to small firms by the county enterprise boards has already exceeded the projections in the operational programme.  In total, over £18.5 million has been provided to date in grants by the 35 boards, resulting in the creation of over 4,663 full-time and 1,078 part-time jobs.  An additional sum of £1.421 million was provided to the boards in 1995 to facilitate their indirect or &ldquo;soft&rdquo; support activities.  The 1996 Estimates for my Department provide £19.736 million to cover the running costs of the county enterprise boards; of this amount, some £10.250 million is available for project payments and £4.75 million for indirect enterprise or &ldquo;soft&rdquo; supports.</P>
    <P>Since the boards first commenced operation in 1993 their access to funding support for projects has been on the basis of uniform allocations.  In 1993 all boards were given a grant commitment quota of £250,000.  None of the commitments from this quota actually matured for payment in 1993 and so the projects fell due for payment in the following year.  I understand that in 1994 all boards were initially permitted to make new commitments up to a limit of £500,000.  This ceiling was soon reached and the Government subsequently raised the limits with the result that by December 1994 commitments of £24 million had been incurred by county enterprise boards, of which only £5 million had been drawn down by project promoters.  In this period the rate of draw down of funds was unfortunately out of kilter with the level of project approvals.</P>
    <P>In 1995 all boards were allocated a total approval capacity of £500,000, which comprised two separate elements: first, a maximum approval capacity of £365,000 in direct financial assistance and, second, an allocation of £135,000 to cover the new range of &ldquo;soft support&rdquo; measures introduced under the operational programme which came into <Col N="2173" /> effect for county enterprise boards in 1995.</P>
    <P>This total allocation of £500,000 in 1995 was intended to enable boards to fund a wide range of activity, including financial assistance in the form of capital grants in respect of the four specific measures under the local enterprise sub-programme of the operational programme for local urban and rural development.  These include promoting an enterprise culture, business information, advice, counselling and mentoring financial assistance and management development.</P>
    <P>As the boards had always been envisaged as an administratively slim structure working in partnership with other public sector bodies, a separate administrative budget of £120,000 was also allocated to each board last year.  The same provision applies in the current year.</P>
    <P>The introduction in 1995 of a fixed approval allocation reflected a concern on the part of the Government and the European Commission to ensure that boards took action to prioritise the areas of enterprise they wished to support, in accordance with their completed enterprise plans, so as to bring a focused and more positive outcome to their deliberations.  Concern had been expressed that some boards seemed not only to assume that there were no limits to their capacity to access public funds but also appeared to have devoted inadequate analysis to projects at approval stage in the interests of maximising their approvals.  An unfounded assumption that there would be unconstrained access to public funding support would leave boards with no incentive to seek additional private sector funding for projects, an important feature of mobilising local support for sustainable local development.</P>
    <P>After the experience in 1994 of escalating levels of approval capacity being made available through the course of the year, the introduction of new financial arrangements for county enterprise boards in 1995 brought greater consistency and stability to their operations.  It ensured that the commitment, payment <Col N="2174" /> and financial control procedures essential for the management of this kind of programme became more firmly established and that the rate of drawdown of funding increased significantly.  Having regard to the need for a balanced programme of grant approval activity to be undertaken by boards throughout the course of the year, I initially confirmed the application of a maximum grant approval capacity of £180,000 per board for the first six months of this year.</P>
    <P>Approval of grants is now a matter of day-to-day responsibility for each board.  Boards have been advised to consider the phasing of their supports over the course of the calendar year.  In this context, boards were advised, as in previous years, to prioritise projects in accordance with their enterprise plans. A balance must be struck between addressing the pressing claims of projects already on hands and retaining some flexibility to cope with anticipated demand at later stages in the year.</P>
    <P>I am at present examining proposals for the differentiated allocation of this funding between each county enterprise board.  A final decision on the allocation for each county enterprise board in 1996 will be communicated to each board as soon as possible.  Differentiation will not have an adverse effect on rural areas. On the contrary the approach to determining budgets will take account of the diversity of needs and the particular opportunities for developing rural enterprises.  Moreover, all county enterprise boards will be assessed for the quality of their plans and on the basis of their performance to date.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise boards will continue to play a key role in promoting small business growth at local level and will continue to expand their role as they deepen their co-operation with other local actors and with State agencies in the delivery of a comprehensive range of support services in every area throughout the country.  The Government remains committed to the success of the initiative, the key to the success of which remains jobs and, in particular, the sustainability of the jobs created. <Col N="2175" /> These factors will determine the success or failure of the county enterprise initiative and will be carefully assessed and monitored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome some of what the Minister stated in his contribution.</P>
      <P>At present, people have access to the Leader programme, area partnership boards, county enterprise boards, peace and reconciliation funding administered by the Combat Poverty Agency, FAS, Forbairt and the IDA, but how much money is spent on administration and how many layers of bureaucracy are in place within these bodies?  Is it not time that they were placed under one or two headings?  This is the crux of the problem. The Taoiseach recently established a task force to investigate what could be done.  Task forces seem to be the greatest thing since sliced bread.  They are the answer to every problem, but we never hear their findings or the cost involved in their establishment.  One thing we know is that jobs are not created for men who earn their living by rolling up their sleeves and engaging in productive work.</P>
      <P>Until we face these problems and remove bureaucracy and red tape, we will never succeed.  Responsibility for this matter is held by the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Enterprise and Employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Three just men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt about that, but why are the three needed to deal with this matter?  Why does the responsibility not lie solely with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment? Why are there so many headings? With the best will in the world I must state that Ministers are bedevilled by civil servants, none of whom will cross a threshold without reading the small print and returning to the Minister for further decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county enterprise boards succeeded the county development teams. <Col N="2176" /> I have always sung the praises of those bodies.  County development teams were administered locally and had the power to allocate grants up to a maximum of £2,000.  At present, if a feasibility study costs more than £1,500, it must be sent to the Department for sanction.  Invariably it is returned for further examination and another questionnaire is despatched.  I believe many civil servants have a great time passing the buck.  When young entrepreneurs become sick to the teeth with the process, they are eventually informed that their application has been granted.  Why must this time be wasted?</P>
    <P>The county enterprise boards were established with a bottom-up administrative structure, bureaucracy would be cut out and all matters would be dealt with at local authority level.  The boards would receive their allocations, decide how the money would be spent and the results could be seen at the end of the year.  However, there is still no power at local level.  The county enterprise boards were supposed to be the lifeline that saved the west and north-west, in particular.  As I stated earlier, it was believed that they would be the greatest thing since sliced bread.  However, they have been bedevilled by bureaucracy since their establishment.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister inform the House how much was spent on the administration of the bodies?  Why must civil servants and inspectors compete with each other and inform people that their applications are proper to the Leader programme, the county enterprise board or the IDA?  People who want to establish their own businesses are being stifled at every turn but when, eventually, they are ready to start operations, the Revenue Commissioners inquire from where their finance originated. Drug barons are seldom asked where their money comes from and they can spend it as they please with no questions asked.  However, people establishing legitimate businesses must dot their i's and cross their t's.</P>
    <P>This year £90,000 is being allocated per quarter.  My own county is living <Col N="2177" /> within its budget but it is not expanding as fast as we could.  There are many projects in the pipeline which cannot be taken on.  I have just returned from Donegal where this was a big by-election issue.  They want another £1 million to fund all the projects they have in the pipeline.  A lot of money is wasted in this country.  If we stopped giving this money out in grants, put it into a fund and loaned it to people who wanted to go into business at 1 per cent or 2 per cent interest, the Government would get most of it back.  It would be revolving fund.  More people would set up their own businesses and we could cut out all this bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>The funding guidelines for specialised equipment are too narrow.  The most anyone will get to help pay for expensive specialised equipment is £1,000 or £1,500, which would not pay a deposit on some of this equipment.  Business people with a good track record who are doing well and creating jobs should be given more leeway when buying specialised equipment.</P>
    <P>Where are the demarcation lines between agencies?  If somebody asked the Minister for advice about starting a project making folding chairs, where would the Minister send them?  Where would he advise them to go for advice? I have been working for 30 years.  I will be 30 years a member of Sligo County Council this year, but I no longer know where to send anyone for advice or funding.  Everyone here is the same, because we do not know where the lines of demarcation are.  We should publish a simple booklet telling us what we get under Leader, under the county enterprise boards and all the other initiatives.  We are getting confused.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, as I have appealed to other Ministers before him, to get rid of all this bureaucracy.  There should be only two organisations to deal with: the IDA for projects from £100,000 up and another agency to deal with projects of less than £100,000.  Then we would know where to go in a given case; we could get rid of the bureaucracy. <Col N="2178" /> That could best be done by reinstating the county development teams. When we had the county development teams and the IDA we knew exactly which body would recognise and fund a project.  The system was easy and administration costs were minimal.</P>
    <P>Are we giving any money to the bishops' initiative?  That was a big project for a long time.  We spent a lot of money conducting a survey of what we were going to do.  I have not heard of it for a long time.  Are we getting any money for it?  We gave people hope when we told them about the bishops' initiative.  I said at the time &mdash; I say it again &mdash; that I thought a smart university man who realised there was a certain sum of money available for a survey in the west of Ireland was behind that initiative.  He set in about the survey and did it, but what has been done with it? A lot of money has been spent on surveys.</P>
    <P>The new buzz word is &ldquo;monitor&rdquo;. Everything is monitored now, and we have more bureaucracy than ever before.  I welcome the work the Minister is doing &mdash; he is doing his best &mdash; but he is hamstrung.  There are too many Ministers dealing with the problems in the west and in other rural areas.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment is here.  I suggest that all schemes be put under his control.  In that way we would only have to write to one Minister.  We should give him the money and let him spend it.  If after four or five years he is not doing the job well, we can re-examine that system; but between the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the whole system is unwieldy.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing his best, but I appeal to him to examine the possibility of cutting down on the numbers of agencies, to give us action and jobs and let the people who want to work do so and not to stop them with red tape.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, especially when he is here to speak on the subject of the county and <Col N="2179" /> city enterprise boards.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this subject today because I have been a member of the Dublin city enterprise board.  People forget that there are cities in Ireland, they refer to this initiative as the county enterprise boards.  I am a member of the city enterprise board since its establishment in 1993.  The Dublin city enterprise board, as the Minister is aware, is one of the 35 boards throughout the country established for the purpose of promoting and facilitating economic development within its operational area.  In Dublin city this area coincides with the administrative area of Dublin Corporation, which the Minister will be very familiar with.  In the two full years since it was established, over 200 jobs have been established at a very low cost to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>When I was asked to become a member of the enterprise board I was cynical. I asked myself what this board would do.  I have been on a number of different committees in my lifetime in local authorities to create employment, but no employment was ever created.  I now have the satisfaction of being on the enterprise board and of seeing real jobs created.  I have met people seeking employment and I have been deeply impressed by their enthusiasm and ability.  The enterprise boards serve a very useful purpose in helping people in that area.  In 1995 a total of 50 projects were eventually approved to the value of £365,000, the full amount.  Some 93 full-time jobs were in existence from these projects at the end of 1995 with the short and medium term potential to create another 51 full time jobs.  Of the total grants approved, 39 per cent had been drawn down at the end of that year and I am pleased to report to the Minister that Dublin city, for the second year in a row, has one of the highest draw down rates in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board achieves its general aim of promoting economic development in a number of ways.  These include, first, the making of an enterprise plan for its area <Col N="2180" /> setting out aims, objectives, strategies, targets, costings, timescales, etc., which is kept under review.  Second, the general promotion of an enterprise culture. Third, the enterprise board makes use of the Dublin public library system in helping to provide a series of lectures, seminars and workshops focusing on all aspects of enterprise promotion.  Fourth, the enterprise board avails of the services of the Dublin Business Innovation Centre in providing information evenings on entrepreneurial opportunities, training and business development to people considering starting a business and wanting to know how to go about it.  Fifth, it has been involved in competitions &mdash; the object here is to stimulate the creation of new and innovative projects by providing support for enterprise competitions.  During 1995, the board was pleased to sponsor a prize money for the Project Development Centres' enterprise competition to the sum of £2,000.</P>
    <P>Sixth, the board was also pleased to participate in an annual young entrepreneur programme run by the Young Entrepreneur's Association.  The object here is to prepare young people for a changing and increasingly difficult employment situation by helping them to develop entrepreneurial skills to obtain the experience to set up and run a real business.  Seventh, the enterprise board has also been in contact with educational establishments in order to promote an enterprise culture.  The object here is to harness the full resources of many of the excellent third level establishments in the city with a view to fostering development and furthering an enterprise culture in general.  Initial contact was made in July 1995 with certain colleges with a view to placing graduates in need of work experience.  These graduates could be used to follow up surveys, assess the performance of grant aided companies and identify training needs.  The graduates could also be used to work out local linkages and import substitution opportunities. <Col N="2181" /> Eighth, the board also resolved to forge stronger links with the area based partnerships.  This is important.  The objective here is to focus more clearly on the problems and needs of the long-term unemployed.  The national policy objective of converting the current favourable economic climate into sustainable jobs has been supported by the board, particularly in the context of measures announced in the January 1996 budget.  The board is also involved in availing of the services of the Forbairt mentor programme.  This is an important issue because it is a most helpful resource.  The objective here is to put in place a system of mentors who will provide specialist help, guidance and ongoing support to small enterprises within the city.  The board decided, as a matter of policy in the first instance, to concentrate on those businesses which already had been grant aided in offering this service.  By doing this, they hope to see an increase in the survival rate of new start-up businesses and better performance by existing businesses. By the end of 1995, approximately 20 businesses had been assigned mentors.  To date the provision of mentors to start-up businesses has been a real success.</P>
    <P>The Dublin enterprise board operates in an area which has the highest unemployment rate in the country.  In some housing estates unemployment can be as high as 70 or 80 per cent.  When the enterprise boards were established initially, each enterprise board, irrespective of population or need, received the same amount of funding.  I am pleased that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has requested an independent consultant to draw up a model for the funding of enterprise boards to be built around three factors: first, the population and relevant needs of each area; second, the capacity of each area to successfully utilise enterprise funding and create employment; and, third, the quality of plans prepared by each enterprise board.  I note that he spoke today about the differential which will <Col N="2182" /> be built into the new funding system for enterprise boards and I welcome this.</P>
    <P>Certainly, the Dublin City Enterprise Board looks forward to this new model of funding as it would help to meet the needs of Dublin city in its efforts to help create employment and combat unemployment. I see the enterprise boards system as one spoke in the wheel to create employment.  It is an important spoke and one which must be encouraged and fostered.  I thank the Minister for the initiative and the support he has given to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber and welcome the opportunity to speak about the county enterprise boards.  We should not be surprised that the 30 county enterprise boards vary greatly in terms of the success they have achieved in creating jobs. What we should concentrate on is making sure that the experience of the most successful boards is used to the full by the others.  In business we tend to call this the ability to &ldquo;copycat&rdquo;; more often we call it the ability to &ldquo;leapfrog&rdquo;, which is not just the ability to copy what somebody else is doing but of doing better than they have done.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the best way to do this is not by fiat from above.  It would be a grave mistake to impose greater standardisation on the activities of county enterprise boards from the centre.  One of the great advantages of the county enterprise boards is that they are local rather than centralised and are driven from the ground up.  If they end up as nothing more than local offices of a central Government Department, then the potential power of a locally-driven initiative will be wasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the way forward is to encourage more.  Communication between the country enterprise boards themselves.  Peter Drucker, the American management guru, talks about the fact that we often spend our time starving the opportunities and feeding the failures.  In other words, we look at where we have made mistakes and concentrate so heavily to try to overcome <Col N="2183" /> them that we fail to concentrate on the opportunities.  They should be encouraged to learn from each other's successes and mistakes.  They should be encouraged to invent wheels only when they do not already exist, and to copy blatantly from their colleagues when there is something to gain from that.</P>
    <P>The resources available for the boards should be distributed so that more time can be spent on this learning process.  This is the essence of the point I want to make.  In this way we can preserve the local integrity and enthusiasm of each board, while ensuring that all parts of the country benefit to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I have discovered through my own business experience that one of the most difficult tasks is striking a balance between autonomy at local level and high standards throughout the organisation; but if we work at it with great intent and commitment, the balance can be struck.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise boards fill an important niche in our support for industry.  They concentrate on fostering micro businesses employing less than ten people, a sector with which State agencies have always found it difficult to deal.  They will continually find it so in future because such businesses are so small that they tend not to be able to be helped by a central agency to anything like the same extent as a self-help organisation or on a local basis.  Unique among development agencies, county enterprise boards have given as much attention from the start to service businesses as to manufacturing.  When I say that is unique, this is an important element.  I know the Minister is fully supportive of them but it takes more than support; it takes action too.  Future jobs will come from the service sector, that is, people business &mdash; supplying services rather than manufactured products to people.</P>
    <P>I spoke on this same topic of the service industry some time ago.  I was impressed at the number of new jobs created in the service sector since we <Col N="2184" /> joined the EU.  While we lost 110,000 agricultural jobs in those 24 years, we created 255,000 new jobs in the services sector.  The service sector is much more likely to grow from the blossoming of small micro-businesses employing fewer than ten people.  This sector will be most helped by the county enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>We should work to ensure these boards, local entities which build on local drive, enthusiasm and dedication are not watered down by our understandable wish to get uniform results. While it is understandable that we want uniformity, the real advance is in having a small number of success stories others will copy.  My enthusiasm for the county enterprise boards will rest on our ability to ensure that.  The Minister is aware of this and may be fully committed.  These boards should be given authority and the freedom to succeed and make mistakes. In making an effort, there will be failures and we should learn from them rather than give up.  I support the concept of county enterprise boards as long as we do not make the error of centralising authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the people in the county enterprise boards.  The county development officers and their staff are doing a tremendous job.  That State agencies, the private sector and the social partners were involved in the formation of the board gives it a tremendous amount of expertise.  The addition of county managers and local authority members will give it balance. These groups will be a terrific help to the county development officers in doing their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the local development associations, voluntary organisations set up by people in towns and villages.  They do a huge amount of voluntary work in developing their areas, promoting industry etc.  I also thank county <Col N="2185" /> development teams for their tremendous work in counties on the western seaboard, including that part of west Cork from which I come.  Because of differing economic categories, the county was split and consequently there was a separate development team for west Cork.</P>
    <P>The main purposes of the county enterprise boards is to create jobs and develop local enterprise.  If one can assist a local small businessman to create five jobs, they will be permanent jobs whereas many foreign companies stay for a small time and leave when the grants finish.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be careful about differentiation.  Population size should not be taken as an indicator.  I come from a rural area which has lost, and will continue to lose, much of its population unless industries can be developed.  We would go down the wrong road if we took population as the main indicator. The Minister mentioned that the quality of the plans and performance to date would be of significance and importance. However, I do not want population levels to be taken as an indicator because the rural peripheral areas would then lose out.</P>
    <P>All projects giving jobs should be favourably examined and should not be disqualified by bureaucratic systems. Jobs provided in the service, manufacturing, agriculture, fishing or tourism industries in rural areas, can add up to a considerable number.  IDA Ireland or Forbairt would have to do a great deal of work to get a factory to match the many jobs provided in this way.</P>
    <P>Sometimes enterprise boards are precluded from considering projects involving in excess of ten jobs.  A small enterprise with the ability to employ 20 people may not be able to slot into projects from other State agencies and could lose out.  I would like to see greater flexibility in that area.  If jobs are being created, grants should be given to people prepared to start an industry in a rural area.</P>
    <P>The population of west Cork declined for several years but incentives such as <Col N="2186" /> those offered by the county enterprise board helped to provide jobs to maintain people in the area for population stability.  The same population trends affect the regions from Castletownbere to the Mizen Peninsula and the west Cork area where the land is not of good quality.  There should be a definite bias towards peripheral areas with declining populations.  The logistics and costs of establishing business in a peripheral area greatly exceed those involved in areas with larger populations, services and markets.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment the West Cork Enterprise Board has approved the allocation of substantial moneys.  These approvals have now been converted into jobs and the grants drawn down.  The same amount of money should be given on a continuous basis.</P>
    <P>The board's action plan was one of the first launched and it achieved wide acceptance as a document which outlined west Cork's problems and how to solve them over the next few years.  The plan was launched in advance of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development and will obviously need to be refined to take account of the provisions of the programme. Nevertheless, it contains a quality strategy and has widespread acceptance in west Cork.  These boards badly need to get the same amount of money or percentage increases in it.</P>
    <P>Boards in rural regions, which have huge areas to cover, have many problems. The cost of providing services such as water and electricity is generally borne by the promoter, as they are not normally available on site or at the roadside as in urban environments.  Any enterprise established in an urban area has access to markets on its doorstep. Rural enterprise must generally bear the cost of transport of raw materials to its base and the subsequent cost of transporting its finished product to the marketplace.  This is very much the case in areas like west Cork.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, in populated areas private enterprise or community organisations, with the assistance of <Col N="2187" /> State funding, will provide work space for the businessman willing to set up his own business.  Many of these complexes also provide centralised administration for businesses operating there, but that is not the case in rural areas where buildings and sites are difficult to acquire.  Even then, the cost of servicing, renovating and building must be borne by the business.  These higher set up costs inevitably mean there are higher operational costs to service this outlay and the outgoing costs of transport.</P>
    <P>The same level of money should be available to the West Cork Enterprise Board as in the past, and no loss should be suffered on account of it being in a rural area with a small population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank Senator Calnan for sharing his time.  I have been a member of the County Limerick Enterprise Board since 1993.  County enterprise boards constitute the first major system of support for small businesses and, as such, provide a much needed service. some £61.3 million will be available for county enterprise boards during the lifetime of the operational programme for local urban and rural development.  The programme shows that the Government is serious about its commitment to local development at micro level.</P>
      <P>For many county councillors, membership of county enterprise boards presented the first opportunity of handling real money.  There was an initial enthusiasm to give financial support to people in their respective counties and this produced a feeling of euphoria.  On most boards that role took precedence over the more important role of acting as a broker or networking organisation to examine enterprise in a given county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fulfilling the latter role involves assessing the strengths and weaknesses of industrial development in counties in addition to examining what alternative funding sources are available.  With guidance from county enterprise boards, people would know if they were better <Col N="2188" /> off applying under the Leader programme or ADM.</P>
    <P>The idea of enterprise should be fostered not only among young people but also among the unemployed.  In 1971 some 12,304 people were employed in agriculture in County Limerick &mdash; or 23 per cent of the population &mdash; but that figure fell to 7,889 in 1986.  According to the most recent labour force survey that figure has fallen to 13 per cent of the population.  Farming families have drifted out of agriculture to towns and villages where they now make up the bulk of our long-term unemployed.  We need to encourage such people to use their talents, but if their talents are outdated they should be brought back into the mainstream workforce through training programmes.  Enterprise should not be seen solely as the prerogative of the young.  Older people must also have an opportunity to use their skills or to update them.</P>
    <P>While county enterprise boards are grant based, grants are not necessarily all that a small business needs.  I started up a small business but I did not get a grant because it was in the retail sector which is not funded by county enterprise boards, and I can see the logic of that.  Sometimes businesses require more than grants.  They need a supply of money that does not cost them an arm and a leg, such as soft supports like revolving loans.  From that point of view, county enterprise boards should work hand in hand with credit unions, banking institutions and building societies to encourage the provision of easier finance terms for entrepreneurs.  Some banks already have this in place but their terms are rather strict.</P>
    <P>The Department's insistence that each county should produce a county enterprise development plan was a good idea.  However, Limerick County Enterprise Board did not receive one letter of support or criticism when it published its plan, even though it had plenty to say about the county's potential and weaknesses.  The county enterprise officer was featured on local radio and in the local newspapers but <Col N="2189" /> we still need to get through to ordinary people the importance of the county enterprise plan's central role in the life of our community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his speech.  I would encourage him to continue the same dynamic approach he has adopted to the development of industry since he took office.  I was glad to welcome him to County Clare when he met the local enterprise board and saw evidence of their success.  I wish to put on record the enthusiastic work that has been done by the County Clare Enterprise Board since it was established.  The report of the board's activities over the last year reveals an impressive record in the area of small industrial development within a small budget and a low cost per job ratio.  That must be taken into account when one looks at such industrial initiatives.</P>
      <P>Our comments relating to arrangements for the promotion of industrial development should be taken into account.  Over the years, both Houses of the Oireachtas have had numerous debates about the administration and promotion of industry.  Unfortunately, it seems that much of the time we are wasting our efforts because not much account is taken of our views at planning and administrative levels; I do not mean at the political level here but at the administrative level within Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Culliton report was published almost immediate action was taken on some of its recommendations. It was mainly as a result of its recommendations that the decision was taken to divide responsibilities within the IDA.  That fragmentation was not to the advantage of the country, industrially or <Col N="2190" /> in terms of job creation.  I would like to hear the Minister's opinion on whether the decision to fragment the IDA into Forfás, Forbairt and IDA Ireland has been in the best interests of the drive to create employment.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to set up strong regional development organisations.  In this regard I support the successful work that has been done for many years by Shannon Development.  Its role, remit and area of jurisdiction have been extended.  Within that regional concept there is an important place for county enterprise boards.  This may sound like I am running with the hare and hunting with the hounds, but I do not believe it is in our best interests to fragment organisations too much.  There must be co-ordination.  The success of such co-ordination has been demonstrated in Clare where there is a representative of Shannon Development, which has responsibility for tourism and industrial development in the region, on the county enterprise board.  That type of cross fertilisation is important in ensuring a concentrated and co-ordinated approach.  One certainly does not want to see a situation where people with ideas or businesses must jump from one agency to another, or set one agency against another, to get the best possible deal for whatever they wish to do.</P>
    <P>There are a few areas to which the attention of the county enterprise boards should be addressed, as they have been most successful in what they have been doing so far.  The first area involves the exploitation of opportunities for new technology within regional and county enterprise areas. With the arrival of the Internet and the range of new developments in technology it should be possible to have an agency which will not only help people seeking advice and assistance in the establishment of small businesses but identify areas which are not being filled at present.  It should be possible to identify areas where services can be supplied to large multinational companies.  We have many such companies in the mid-west region in areas adjacent to Limerick <Col N="2191" /> city and the university.  There is a huge range of multinational companies and the county enterprise boards should source some of the supplies and services which are delivered to them.  Many of them would be in the import substitution area and this would be of enormous benefit, especially to young graduates many of whom are at present unemployed.</P>
    <P>There are about 3,000 students in second level schools in Ennis.  Of the number who did the leaving certificate last year, almost 60 per cent went on to higher education; many more got involved in courses and very few went to the unemployment office.  However, I understand that about 1,500 people are signing for unemployment assistance and benefit.  It should be possible for the enterprise board to break down that figure according to the skills and talents of the people who are signing each week. The Department of Social Welfare is not doing it.  We pleaded with the Department on several occasions to do it and when I was Minister I endeavoured to get the Department to break down the figures according to skills. How many of the 300,000 unemployed are fitters, welders, typists, graduates, etc.?  How can one plan the future development of any town or its future prospects for development if one does not know what skills and talents are available within that area?  I agree with Senator Kelly that it is necessary to identify ways in which opportunities can be exploited and developed within the regional and county areas.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to the availability of seed capital to finance small projects that are just starting.  The major problem is that young people cannot get the securities necessary to raise finance. They have good ideas which have been tested and approved by the enterprise boards.  The boards are willing to give assistance but there is a lack of availability of the seed capital necessary to start up an enterprise.  Many of these young people are energetic and keen to get work under way.  They would probably <Col N="2192" /> have to sign for unemployment if they cannot get started.  They have a contribution to make not only by working themselves but also by offering employment opportunities to others.</P>
    <P>The enterprise boards must pay attention to the high technology sector and open up prospects of doing business with the big multinational companies in products that are at present supplied through imports.  They also must pay attention to young graduates who could be organised to fill gaps in the market. Finally, they must look at the provision of seed capital for young people who want to start up enterprises and devise a method whereby they could go guarantor for these people rather than pay them grants.</P>
    <P>Attention to these areas could make a major contribution to the creation of employment, and especially employment that will offer security.  Young people want to know that if they go into an enterprise they will not be left high and dry with a financial institution tightening the noose on them every week.  If the enterprise boards could offer assistance by way of seed capital or security to raise finance from financial institutions, it would remove a major burden from many of the young business people who wish to start their own businesses. It would certainly have a major impact on the creation of employment and offer the prospect of security in employment to many people in their local areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the county enterprise boards although, like Senator Kelly, I have a vested interest in that I am a member of the Laois County Enterprise Partnership Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that approval of grants is now the responsibility of each board.  The allocation to the boards for <Col N="2193" /> 1995 was intended to enable them to fund a wide range of activities, such as promoting an enterprise culture, providing business information and advice, counselling, mentoring and management development as well as providing financial assistance for people setting up small industries.  Advice and mentoring is most important to people, and particularly young people, who are setting up in business for the first time and do not have much experience.  This is a worthwhile development.</P>
    <P>In Laois 300 full-time jobs have been created and £638,351 has been allocated by the county enterprise board.  That is a good return for the money expended. There is approval for over £1 million but the balance has not been taken up so far.  Hopefully, that will happen in the near future.  This success is mirrored in the 34 boards throughout the country so the establishment of the boards was a successful development.  It represented a recognition by the Government that local unemployment problems and business development are best solved by people working at local level.</P>
    <P>For a small country we are very centralised. We have persisted for too long in the belief that everything should be run from Dublin.  It is not only Departments which are based in Dublin but almost all State agencies.  This is bad for the country.  There is great scope to devolve power, to give people more control over their affairs and, in the case of the county enterprise boards, to use the funding allocated to them.  Between 1986 and 1991, for example, the population declined in two-thirds of the electoral areas in County Laois by up to 10 per cent.  That is a substantial decline. Initiatives, such as the county enterprise boards which support small industries in towns and villages, is a step in halting that decline.  We want people to remain in our rural towns and to stop the move towards the capital and our larger cities.</P>
    <P>Few local bodies have money.  Many of our local government bodies, such as health boards and county councils, have become little more than administrators. They provide local administration not <Col N="2194" /> local government because they depend on central Government for funding.  We need to move away from our obsession with centralisation and county enterprise boards are important in that regard.  However, they do not move sufficiently in the direction of devolution. As long as they are funded at the discretion of central government, county enterprise boards will be under the control of central government.  If central government, for example, decided to withdraw funding in the morning, the boards would disappear.  We have created a strange situation where taxes are collected in every county and forwarded to Dublin.  Central government then creates a plethora of State controlled agencies to distribute this money back to the regions.  Nobody seems to think that people in the regions might know best what to do with the money without having to put in through the Dublin merry go round.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise boards are part of a number of new local development organisations being set up with direct State funding.  Other examples are the Leader groups and the area partnership boards.  If we include Forbairt, FÁS, regional tourism organisations and other development bodies, we are in danger of creating an enormous bureaucracy of local bodies.  I approve of local bodies but they must be co-ordinated and they must work together.  We should have one-stop-shops which include county enterprise boards, Leader groups and area partnership boards so that people do not have to go from one to the other, a frustrating exercise, as Senator Daly said.  Laois County Enterprise Board and the Leader group have set up offices side by side.  That has happened in other counties, such as Kildare, but it may not happen throughout the country.  People starting up a business get frustrated if they have to go from one organisation to another.  We are all concerned about creating employment.</P>
    <P>During the past 25 years public policy has tried to diminish the role of the democratically elected local authorities <Col N="2195" /> which have been given few additional functions.  In contrast, the number of Departments and their responsibilities have increased significantly.  County enterprise boards, Leader programmes and area partnership boards have been set up independent of county councils.  I know county councils have representatives on these boards, but local authority members are democratically elected.  Other bodies are not locally funded or controlled and they are not accountable to the public.  Many county councillors are angry about the democratic deficit.  County councillors should be involved in more local organisations. The administrative infrastructure is already in place and county councils could take on new responsibilities at an additional minimum cost.</P>
    <P>Job creation could be managed more efficiently and effectively through the local government system.  A better result would be achieved if all the people in the county council worked together to improve employment prospects. If local government was reformed, funds for industrial promotion would be provided without any interference from central government. However, local government funding is a thorny issue which has not been addressed by successive Governments. We must also examine our taxation system which penalises people for working and, in some cases, makes it more attractive for people to stay at home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a county enterprise board I am interested in this debate.  It is difficult to please everyone. People complained there was not enough money for local enterprise when counties did not receive funding.  Now they can choose between the area partnership boards, Leader groups and county enterprise boards rather than going home with their tails between their legs.  They now have three choices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members on county enterprise boards do not get expenses; they work on a voluntary basis.  I have been heartened by the interest shown in County Longford. <Col N="2196" /> We are happy that many projects in Longford have received funding.  The Minister will soon make a decision on future funding, but I am glad that criteria, such as plans and incentives, will be taken into account.  I understand that population will determine how much each board receives.  However, if one area has a greater population than another, it should not mean they receive more funds.  Other criteria, such as plans drawn up by the county enterprise board and the interest shown in the area, must also be taken into account.  I am confident my county of Longford, and the Leas-Chathaoirleach's county, Roscommon, will feature in that criteria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for the many gems of wisdom, particularly Senator Belton's final comment which is at the root of all evil in this country.  It will be difficult to do justice to the range of issues raised but I will try to cover them fairly quickly.  A common thread which ran through a number of contributions was that there are too many agencies and that we should consolidate them and bring them under one Minister.  This is a difficult area because these initiatives have evolved from different backgrounds.  Some have developed through European initiatives to promote rural development.  The county strategy teams have been set up to ensure reasonable liaison between them.  They have a clear mandate to ensure the avoidance of duplication and to ensure sensible access rules so there will be one-stop-shop approaches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is encouraging that many counties have adopted that approach, including Senator Farrell's county of Sligo where a single point of contact approach has been developed.  That is the way to deal <Col N="2197" /> with this because if we move towards consolidation, we will be swimming against what seems to be the tide of opinion in the Seanad where the idea of local autonomy is good.  There is no point trying to smother these blooms with a centralised or consolidated approach.  We cannot have the neatness which some Senators crave and at the same time have devolved autonomy.</P>
    <P>Another common theme that has arisen is that loans are better than grants, a view to which I subscribe. However, there has been a difficulty in that Europe provides a good deal of the money with which we promote the local development operational programme.  It has a clear view against loans which has constrained our ability to take the loans route.  We have taken this route in some other areas, like the loan fund for small businesses &mdash; they have not tended to be micro start up businesses but established ones &mdash; with grant aid provided. I believe the loan fund for start up businesses has potential.</P>
    <P>It is significant that initiatives are growing up around the loan fund area outside the county enterprise partnership boards, including First Step and the International Fund for Ireland in the Border counties.  That should be encouraged and there is a role for county enterprise partnership boards in promoting loan fund development in alliance with the financial institutions.  I would like to see grant aid levering other types of loan finance and a more co-operative approach to developing good financial vehicles for getting small businesses off the ground.  The idea of loans rather than grants is something we should continue to try to develop.</P>
    <P>I would like county enterprise partnership boards to be a focal point for local groups looking at local BES funds and the various vehicles for development at which counties should look.  The idea of having a local plan, as a number of Senators pointed out, is to try to bring together efforts from different institutions and agents.  The theme of access and the one-stop-shop has come up.  Many county enterprise partnership <Col N="2198" /> boards are taking the one-stop-shop route and are trying to ensure single contact points.  Forbairt has set up an enterprise link and a freephone service so people can telephone and get single point of contact advice as to whom they should go.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn raised the issue of promoting best practice, something the Department is actively doing.  We set aside money last year to try to transfer the idea of best practice to different counties.  The Department has looked at a number of areas, including project appraisal, single points of contact, developing work space, sustaining local mentors and many things which Senators said were successful.  While we are trying to disseminate best practice, more can be done in that area.</P>
    <P>Some Senators suggested the Department must sanction feasibility money of over £1,500.  That is not the case under the new arrangements to which Senator Honan referred.  Senator Daly made an interesting point about the opportunity for linkages.  I know some county enterprise partnership boards have made that the focus of what they are trying to do as regards their plans.  They have deliberately tried to establish the linkage opportunities and set about trying to develop them.  I do not believe the Government should direct them in this regard.  The board should look at its strengths and weaknesses.  In Clare, which has a high technology base, there are certain types of linkages which might not be available in other counties. The notion of looking at linkages is particularly valuable and it should be done in relation to plans.</P>
    <P>The Senator also touched on an area of weakness.  Not since the mid-1980s has there been proper analysis of the unemployed.  FÁS has some analysis of the background of the unemployed but it is not in an easily accessible set of tables where we can see the basic skills of people locally or the areas of enterprise most suitable for them. Senator Honan asked whether there should be a local funding base for county enterprise partnership boards <Col N="2199" /> which raises the much wider issue as to whether we should move away from bloc grants to something else.  That is an issue of local government reform more than one over which I would have direct comment.  I would like county enterprise partnership boards to use their money to mobilise other funds locally, even if they are not raising funds by way of a tax basis.</P>
    <P>Several Senators touched on the issue of the differential and the proposal for differential funding.  We cannot pretend it is reasonable for every county to have an equal share of funds.  Without giving too many examples, County Galway is one borough although it includes a city and a county.  It has a large population which spans rural areas and urban black spots, but it is treated on the same basis as any other county.  As one goes through different areas, one can see that there needs to be some basis for differentiation. While I accept what Senator Calnan said that it cannot be based on population alone, we must look at a range of measures that take into account the problems of rural depopulation, the scale of unemployment, the capacity of the county to develop small businesses and its performance to date in terms of how it has used its resource cost effectively.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt, as Senator Doyle said, that some boards have been very focused in the way they have used their money.  We must look at the performance of boards and the quality of their plans as part of an overall system to decide the allocation of funds.  We want to reward best practice and that comes through deciding how much money we allocate.  Those who are using the money well should be recognised, not only by congratulations but also by allocating more funds because they are being used so wisely.  That would start to promote the idea raised by Senator Quinn of best practice and disseminating best practice.  If there is a practical result, people will take a keen interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2200" /> I have tried to deal with an overview of the issues raised.  However, there are some specific issues.  I accept for instance the emphasis on services which came up in Senator Calnan's contribution and again in Senator Quinn's. Services provide a range of opportunities for us now and it would be a shame if we discriminated against them in any way.  They are not discriminated against at county level and I hope that, in time, we will be able to develop vehicles whereby services will be also regarded as an equal partner in national policies.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to what has been a useful debate on this issue, which is evolving.  It is only in its first couple of years of operation.  We are starting the process of evaluating its success and impact and we will, in the course of that process, be able to refine it as a vehicle and try to improve it.  At the end of the day it depends on the local commitment and initiative.  We cannot replicate or force that because it must come from the groups involved. By and large, this has been a successful approach and one that we should certainly run with and review at the end of three years and then look to its future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Tourism and Trade to</P>
      <P>&mdash;take action to promote even growth in tourist numbers and income in the regions;</P>
      <P>&mdash;ensure that available finances and resources are no longer employed to further exacerbate regional imbalance;</P>
      <P>&mdash;develop marketing strategies which place more emphasis on quality and income generation than on numbers;</P>

      <P>and urges the setting up of a National Co-ordinating Manpower Development Plan for training in the area of services to tourism.</P>
      <P>This motion seeks to encourage the Minister to spread the tourism numbers more evenly throughout the regions and ensure that the benefits of tourism are spread throughout the country in order to promote economic prosperity arising from tourism development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism development has had a dramatic impact on economic development and employment in the last number of years.  Anybody who examines the figures which show increased revenue from tourism and increased numbers employed in the tourism area must admit that the drive to increase tourism, <Col N="2202" /> which started a few years ago, has been very successful.</P>
    <P>There is, as some Members will be aware, a continuing concern that the volume of tourists visiting Ireland are concentrated to a greater degree in the eastern regions &mdash; and the east coast in particular &mdash; mainly because of the success of attracting continental visitors to Dublin.  It has weighted the balance in favour of the eastern regions to the disadvantage of the west.  This has been exacerbated to some extent by the controversy relating to the Shannon stopover.</P>
    <P>The feeling was that the change in the transatlantic stopover in Shannon would have a serious and adverse impact on tourist numbers, especially from the North American market, coming into the mid-west region.  Where these numbers are divided between Dublin and the west, it is felt that the traffic will never work its way back to the western regions, and the mid-west region in particular. The efforts made to promote business through Shannon and to develop new services, as well as efforts to develop a new spirit of enthusiasm in the regions of the west, and the mid-west in particular, has to some extent counteracted that trend.  While the numbers of passengers going through the airport and revenue figures from the region are fairly good, people involved in business believe that the western regions are not getting the volume of traffic and business they should.  This is having an adverse impact on the people involved in the tourism business.</P>
    <P>The introduction of some initiatives would be advantageous to the western areas.  There has been a fairly substantial increase in the numbers of people visiting Ireland because of its attraction in the areas of heritage and related matters. There is still a sizeable number of heritage areas which are under-developed and unexploited.  This must be done in a reasonable and balanced way and in any development of these <Col N="2203" /> facilities care should be taken to protect their valuable heritage.  However, some investments in key areas would open up the possibility of attracting international business to counteract the current imbalance.</P>
    <P>There is no question that there is an imbalance between the east and west coasts.  It is not possible to tell tourists where they go because they themselves will decide where they want to visit. However, they will make their decision on the basis of information available. That is why we have embodied the question of marketing in this motion.  It is necessary to fund extensive and intensive marketing campaigns to attract more people, especially during the off-peak period.</P>
    <P>I can give an example of an area in the west where a small investment could have a dramatic impact on the number of visitors going to a particular location. For instance, Scattery Island on the Shannon is the site of a Viking settlement with the round towers of seven churches.  It is comparable to Clonmacnoise or Glendalough.  However, the absence of a basic landing facility at the island means that it is not possible to develop that huge resource.  The development plans of SFADCo and local tourism development associations and the interest of local people in promoting an attractive heritage site like Scattery Island have, to a large extent, been negatived because of the absence of a landing facility there which could be provided for £1,000 to £3,000.</P>
    <P>In order to get the numbers to visit these areas one needs substantial investment in infrastructure which has not been available up to now.  While there has been a major improvement in conditions and investment in roads and infrastructure generally, there is further necessity, especially in the isolated western areas which are the most attractive areas in the country, for investment which would provide amenities in areas <Col N="2204" /> hitherto under-developed.  One could bring up to 300,000 people to Scattery Island if there was a landing facility there.  There were about 2,000 visitors there last year according to the Commissioners of Public Works.  The development of Mullaghmore and the Burren has been a tale of horrific proportions. The relevant Department should press ahead with its plans for that area.</P>
    <P>I refer to these areas to draw attention to the need for investment in infrastructure which would open up rural areas, such as the Céide Fields in County Mayo.  I compliment the Office of Public Works for the work it has done in the preservation and development of our heritage areas and for the identification and enhancement of the Killarney and Glenveagh national parks.  Such efforts should be expedited and the necessary funding provided.</P>
    <P>Any analysis of the figures, whether of numbers employed, revenue accruing or visitor numbers, shows that the east coast is forging ahead.  Fianna Fáil has no problem with that.  The east coast can take even more tourists and it is possible there will be greater investment in the east coast as the benefits accrue from the increased numbers.  This can result in a lot of private investment, as has been the case with the Malahide marina and boatyard.  We welcome and support such development.</P>
    <P>The State's maritime resources have not been developed to the point where we could take a sizeable slice of the international maritime business. Government support is needed for the events that would attract leisure boats. While on a recent parliamentary delegation to Norway I witnessed the extent of the development of its maritime resources, despite its being frozen for nine months of the year.</P>
    <P>There is great opportunity for maritime developments on the west coast and co-operation between various locations there.  I am glad the Minister <Col N="2205" /> of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, is present because he is aware of the impact the maritime leisure business has had in Kinsale and can have in Cork harbour. The Government should pay more attention to attracting the international maritime business we have not been able to attract to date.  We have the locations; all that is required is a small amount of investment and work.</P>
    <P>The representatives of the hotel industry are concerned at the fall-off in bookings for this season.  There is a fear that because of the continuing uncertainty with regard to Northern Ireland the enthusiasm evident during the peace process is waning.  The uncertainty with regard to the peace process leads to a fear that the expected benefits will not materialise.  Many of the larger investors who have invested heavily in places like Dromoland Castle are apprehensive about the future and the decline in numbers in the west.  They want the Government to identify areas where that trend might be reversed and to work to spread the numbers of visitors more evenly.</P>
    <P>More Government funding is needed. We appreciate the amount of work that has been done through the Structural Funds which has been beneficial in developing all weather facilities in the resorts.  The resorts have always been the backbone of Irish tourism, yet successive Governments allowed them to run down.  Hotels and guesthouses, for example, went out of business because investment such as that being made under the operational programme was not made.  This investment must be accelerated.  Concessions have to be made on licensing laws and other matters which would assist the resort areas to continue to be a dominant force in Irish tourism.  I compliment the Government on the introduction of the designated resorts scheme which has proved worthwhile.  It has been beneficial in Ballybunion, Lahinch and Kilkee, and I am sure Senator Fitzgerald will tell us about Dingle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2206" /> More Government funds and Structural Funds must be put into tourism. We must examine the balance of the figures between the east and west coasts. We must have a co-ordinated approach to marketing the various areas of the country.  In the light of the success of the tourism industry the Government should give it a further boost so it can continue to play a dominant role in the economic life of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, to the House.  Coming from Cork, he is my neighbour in the south west.  Cork Kerry Tourism works well.</P>
      <P>Tourism will become more important to the economy over the next few years. It will also become more competitive. Other countries have their attractions. Fortunately, the shoal of dolphins has come back to Ballydavid, County Kerry, this year and I can assure everybody we will have another fine summer.  Hopefully, we will have a tourism boom.  In the past the bad weather has greatly affected tourism and if we were fortunate to have a fine summer it would make a huge difference.</P>
      <P>We have to be aware of tourism in other countries and the package tours available.  I have taken them myself &mdash; it is nice to go on holiday now and then and the package tours are easy and cheap.  We do not seem to have the same facility to sell the type of holidays in Ireland that are sold to us by other countries at a cheap rate.  I do not know how much a German would pay for a week in Ireland, but he could get a holiday in sunny spots like Greece or the Canary Islands for about £300 per person per week.  That includes flight, accommodation and, in many cases, full board.  There is no hope that we could offer the same facilities at that price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of actions we should take as regards tourism.  The most popular places are out of the way spots on the west coast, but the roads <Col N="2207" /> going to most of them are diabolical. Not only that, but they are crowded with tour buses and cars during the summer. I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices for these places, not just Dingle but resorts all over the west.  I am worried about the west and south coasts; I do not suggest that the east has enough, but it is doing all right while we are not doing well.  We need more money spent on us because people are leaving the land &mdash; the fact that more milk quotas are being made available shows that.  This means people are leaving the west coast to come to Dublin, which is a pity because opportunities exist for us.</P>
    <P>Bodies like the IDA and Údarás na Gaeltachta have not helped set up small craft industries.  Everywhere one goes in Egypt, for instance, one sees people carving camels with a penknife.  A tourist will buy one as souvenir to bring home, which puts more money into the economy. I do not see why we have not bombarded tourists with our souvenirs, or promoted Irish nights out.</P>
    <P>If I may be critical, Irish tourism bodies have not targeted first, second and third generation Irish-Americans and Irish-Canadians.  When I visited Canada recently I was amazed at the number of people who told me they were Irish on the basis that their grandfather came from Ireland and who spoke like me, with a broad Kerry accent.  A man introduced himself to me as Mr. Dinny Connor from Castlemaine.  I asked if he was long in Canada and he told me he was born there &mdash; his father had come into Montreal on the coffin ship, the <i>Jenny Johnson.</i> I asked him if he had ever gone back, but he said we had lost track of the Irish Canadians and had no interest in them.  People from the Minister's party and Fine Gael heard these conversations also.  We were not in Canada to promote tourism, but nonetheless I have a pocketful of requests for information <Col N="2208" /> on accommodation, hotels and golf.</P>
    <P>We are not properly promoting Irish golf facilities in Canada.  All through the winter Canadians cannot play golf because the country is covered in snow, and that is the time of the year they want to come to Ireland.  When we were in Montreal I went to a huge golf exhibition which also promoted accommodation. There were 150 tourism stands from every part of the world, including all over Europe, but the only mention of Ireland was in a brochure for Fitzpatrick Hotels.  The last time we discussed tourism in this House the then Minister said Bord Fáilte was going to move into Canada. It must do so quickly and latch onto the Irish Canadians and Irish Quebecquois, who want to come here to spend their money.  I am critical because Ireland is not being sold properly.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I cannot speak for an hour because I have not covered half the points on the motion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;notes the exceptional performance of the tourism sector in 1995 in terms of foreign revenue earnings and visitor numbers and the substantial growth in tourism in all sub-regions of the country in recent years; and calls on the Minister for Tourism and Trade to continue to <Col N="2209" /> pursue, in association with the industry, a range of policy measures in the product development, marketing and training areas designed to assist in the achievement of the targets set for sustainable growth in the industry under the EU Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to the debate and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, to the House.  He has already shown his interest in tourism promotion and both he and his senior Minister have shown by their actions in the last few months their commitment to ensuring that the tourism industry can be promoted effectively. The re-focusing and re-organising of Bord Fáilte has been important in that regard and I accept Senator Fitzgerald's point that the overseas promotion of the Irish tourism product has left much to be desired over the years. We have also failed to tap into the potential of our ethnic market in many countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly spoke about the current severe imbalance in tourism within Ireland, which I will deal with shortly. The importance of tourism to Ireland cannot be overstated and in particular it is crucial to the economy of the west. My figures may be slightly out of date but they are fine for comparison purposes. They show that we had 4.2 million visitors and that the growth in national tourism has been about 17 per cent.  Some regions gained and some lost; they did not stay static.  Senator Daly, who comes from the same constituency as me, referred to the damage done to tourism development in the west by the flying over of Shannon.  The imbalance can be seen in the figures provided by the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, which show that revenue on the east coast increased by 33 per cent; in the south-east, it increased <Col N="2210" /> by 25 per cent; in the south-west, it dropped by 4 per cent; in the mid-west, it dropped by 1 per cent; while in the west, there was a marginal increase of 2 per cent.  These figures speak for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lesson there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>In the period between 1989 and 1994, tourism revenue grew by 86 per cent in the east but by only 43 per cent in the west.  Until 1989, the west had a larger share of tourism revenue. The greatest imbalance occurred in 1993 and 1994.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly stated that tourists cannot be told where to go.  If tourists travelling from the UK are faced with a situation where it will cost them an extra £100 to fly to Shannon rather than Dublin, the choice is already made for them. The difference in the cost of access to Dublin to that of the west has contributed to creating the imbalance to which I referred.  There is also a situation where American tourists visiting Ireland travel through London because it is more attractive and cost effective to fly from America to London to Dublin than it is to travel directly to Ireland. The role of Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte must be questioned in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to wait for the reorganisation of Bord Fáilte to see if the imbalance can be rectified.  The fact is that Bord Fáilte contributed, in no uncertain way, to creating the imbalance being experienced by the west at present. Therefore, Bord Fáilte's role must be seriously examined.  Since 1989 Aer Lingus has played a disgraceful role in using every gimmick at its disposal to encourage tourists to enter Ireland through Dublin rather than Shannon. The performance of Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism organisations, including Shannon Development, must be measured during the current tourist season. Perhaps the Minister of State will <Col N="2211" /> indicate the precise role of Shannon development in overseas promotion of the Irish tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly made the point that this issue does not involve taking tourist revenue from the east and returning it to the west.  It is a case of redistributing the existing cake, it is a question of ensuring that resources are put in place to redress the imbalance.</P>
    <P>I have one complaint with the Fianna Fáil motion before the House which refers to developing marketing strategies which place more emphasis on quality and income generation than on numbers.  That is the expression of an anti-backpacker sentiment which is gaining ground with certain elements in the tourism industry.  Tourists who visit Ireland on backpacking holidays may become successful business people in the future and may return to this country driving a Mercedes Benz.  For that reason I reject the shabby attitude adopted by the industry which is contained in the motion before us.</P>
    <P>It was stated that there is a surplus of accommodation in the west and that a reluctance exists to grant aid any further accommodation there.  This is a representation of a failure by Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development to fill existing accommodation in the west.  Tourism is the growth market of the future on a world scale.  Ireland and Europe are not holding their market shares in this regard.  At present the areas of growth in world tourism are the United States, Central America and the Far East.  I support the Senator Fitzgerald's point that the proportion of the ethnic market is declining.  The average length of people's stay in Ireland is also in decline.</P>
    <P>Earlier contributors referred to the question of investment in the tourism product.  Between 1989 and 1993, 60 per cent of investment in the tourism product went to the west while 40 per cent went to the east.  However, numbers of <Col N="2212" /> hotel bedrooms in Dublin have increased by 46 per cent during that time.  There has been no reluctance on the part of the west to invest in the tourism product.</P>
    <P>There are economic reasons for the imbalance.  There is the cost of access and the failure of the promotional agencies. As Senator Fitzgerald stated, I would like more time to be devoted to this issue.  I hope the points I made will find an echo with the Minister of State, the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Trade (Mr. T. O'Sullivan) Toddy O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Trade (Mr. T. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for putting down this motion as it gives me an opportunity to address certain issues that have been raised in various fora in recent times about the growth of tourism throughout the country.  Some concerns have been expressed that in certain regions, particularly the west and south-west, the general level of growth in tourism numbers and revenue in recent years, and in 1995 in particular, has not been experienced on the ground.  Before addressing those issues in detail, however, it is important to put tourism performance in context and relate it to national tourism policy and Government targets for the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operational programme for tourism sets out the Government's targets for the tourism industry for the period 1994 to 1999.  These are to achieve foreign exchange earnings of £2.25 billion per annum by 1999; to create the equivalent of up to 35,000 additional jobs in the economy; to concentrate an increasing proportion of growth in the shoulder and off-peak periods, that is, outside the July/August period and to improve the quality of service in the Irish tourism product by the provision of high quality training programmes.  The strategy to achieve these targets will focus on a large expansion in marketing activities, further product development to meet specific market deficiencies, major <Col N="2213" /> improvements in the conference, angling and cultural tourism products and an expansion in the range and scale of training to cater for anticipated employment growth.</P>
    <P>Overall, the programme envisages total investment of £652 million during its lifetime &mdash; £369 million of this will come from the EU with the public and private sectors contributing £84 million and £199 million, respectively.  Programmes under the aegis of other Departments, such as the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry, the second Leader Programme and the operational programme for local urban and rural development will also assist smaller tourism projects as part of their primary non-tourism objectives.  In addition, tourism projects in the Border counties may also qualify for assistance from the International Fund for Ireland, the EU INTERREG Programme or the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The targets I have outlined are national targets, but the operational programme for tourism also contains an indicative breakdown of expenditure on a regional basis in order to achieve a balanced distribution throughout the country.  It is also worth noting, and is recognised in the programme, that tourism is a powerful instrument of regional policy, assisting in raising incomes and providing jobs in the country's more remote and under-developed regions.  I accept Senator Fitzgerald's point in this regard and will convey his concerns about roads to the relevant Minister. Apart from purely economic considerations, tourism has the important &ldquo;added value&rdquo; effect of energising and raising the morale of communities in those regions, many of whom were adversely affected by emigration and depopulation.  Tourism also acts naturally as an instrument of regional balance in Ireland.  Some of the major tourist destinations, outside Dublin, are <Col N="2214" /> located in the country's less developed regions.</P>
    <P>Apart from the grant aiding programmes I have already outlined, tourism development also benefits from tax incentives such as the business expansion scheme and the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas.  Subsidised, fixed interest loans are available through the access to finance scheme, launched last September by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, and a similar scheme confined to the Border counties introduced recently under the Peace and Reconciliation Fund.  Some of the programmes and schemes I mentioned are, by their nature, confined to specific regions.  The overall tourism support framework could be seen, therefore, to provide a positive bias in favour of regional development.</P>
    <P>The targets we have set out for the tourism industry are ambitious but realistic and tourism performance over the past two years indicates that we are well on course towards achieving them. Foreign earnings from tourism in Ireland in 1994 grew by 9.5 per cent from £1.367 billion in 1993 to almost £1.5 billion.  Bord Fáilte's estimates for 1995 suggest that revenue last year was up on 1994 by as much as 18 per cent. This rate of growth compares very favourably with an average European growth in tourism revenues of 2.3 per cent, making Ireland the top performing European destination in 1995.</P>
    <P>Overall visitor numbers in 1995 reached a record high of 4,256,000.  We experienced particularly strong growth in visitor numbers from Britain.  This figure was up by 13 per cent.  Bord Fáilte estimates suggest that holiday, business and conference visitors were the fastest growing segments, which is particularly encouraging as these tend to be the higher spending visitors.  Senator Howard made a valid point when he said that the backpacker of today is the big spender of tomorrow.  These figures do not include domestic tourism earnings <Col N="2215" /> which in 1994 were estimated at £680 million.  The domestic market is of course particularly significant in the context of regional tourism development.</P>
    <P>The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation &mdash; ITIC &mdash; announced the findings of a preliminary study in December 1995 covering the period 1989-94, based on CSO and Bord Fáilte figures, which showed that in 1994 the level of growth in expenditure by overseas tourists in Dublin and the south-east region was higher than elsewhere in the country. They are now undertaking a detailed analysis of the situation which will take account of a number of issues such as changes in composition of Ireland's visitors by nationality or holiday types, increase in share of arrivals by air, the shortening average length of stay, the decline in ethnic links, which is the point raised by Senator Fitzgerald regarding the exploitation of the Canadian market of people of Irish origin, the extent, if any that pre-visit promotion and/or distribution of product influence regional distribution of demand within the country and any problems of capacity and/or access within areas of the western regions which might frustrate potential demand.  Senator Daly also mentioned that point regarding the problem of access.  I look forward to the findings of the final report which I understand will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>In considering the question of the regional spread of the growth in tourism the most important point I want to emphasise at the outset is that tourism revenue in all regions of the country grew at rates above international and European averages over the period 1989 to 1994.  This was a key conclusion of the recent ITIC preliminary study to which I have referred but it was overshadowed by other elements, in particular the question of varying levels of growth within the regions, which was the reason for the motion here tonight. <Col N="2216" /> No official figures are yet available on regional distribution for 1995.  Bord Fáilte has advised me, however, that while Dublin has benefited from continued growth in the short break holiday market, particularly from the UK, preliminary indications are that all regions are again benefiting from overall growth this year.  Official estimates will not be available for some weeks yet.</P>
    <P>The tourist revenue figures for 1994 show a very even distribution of revenue by overseas visitors in the eastern and western regions and, indeed, taking total tourism revenue for the year, the western regions as a whole fared better, with 54 per cent of the total spend.  One of the benefits of our vibrant and expanding tourism sector over the last number of years has been the regional dispersal of its economic benefits. However the spread of tourism throughout the country depends heavily on the origion and requirements of overseas visitors, the perceived attractiveness of the different regions in terms of quality, the range of what they have to offer and the marketing efforts of individual operators. It is basically up to the regions to attract the overseas or domestic tourist who decides to holiday in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is true that Dublin has enjoyed significant growth in recent times, partly because of the increased demand for city breaks and shorter stays, which has become a holiday trend internationally. Competitively priced and regular access to Dublin has also played a part but this can operate to the benefit of other regions as well.  A point worth noting, for example, is that 40 per cent of all bookings made in the Dublin Tourism Centre are for accommodation and activities in the other regions.  This means that the overall growth in visitors to Dublin does not just benefit the Dublin region but the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Any differential growth in the Dublin and eastern regions and other regions is not necessarily a function of development incentives but can also be attributed <Col N="2217" /> to many other factors, including the special appeal of Dublin as a capital city and its proximity to eastern seaports. A positive feature of the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-93 was the extent to which it achieved a good regional spread of investment and helped to build the tourism industry across all regions.  Senator Howard referred to that.  The spread of investment extended to the west as well as Dublin.  Well over half the grants under the programme related to projects in western regions.  This investment in infrastructure is expected to continue under the current operational programme which covers the period 1994 to 1999.  However, ultimately the spread of expenditure will depend on the ability of the public and private sectors within each region to bring forward suitable quality proposals for co-funding.</P>
    <P>Some progress has been made in exploiting opportunities for expanding access to Ireland and the regions generally with an increasing number of European tour operators undertaking direct charter services into airports outside Dublin, including Cork, Kerry, Shannon and Knock.  Nearly 180,000 seats are now provided annually on inbound charter services with very competitive prices from mainland Europe.  Some 80 per cent of these go to airports other than Dublin.  The decision of tour operators from Germany to commence services to Knock for the first time in 1996 is a further positive development.</P>
    <P>Increased competition on the Lon-don-Shannon route has been facilitated by the commencement of services on that route by AB Shannon since December 1995.  In addition, Aer Rianta has announced that the new carrier development at Cork and Shannon will be further facilitated by a package of landing charge rebates which exceed the incentives available at Dublin.  Combined passenger movements at all regional airports in 1995 were 20 per cent higher than in 1994, reaching over <Col N="2218" /> 350,000, and Cork and Shannon airports reported terminal traffic increases of 21 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively.</P>
    <P>The issue of appropriate marketing strategies has been raised.  I should first point out that the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 provides for total programme related spending on marketing of almost £125 million over the period 1994 to 1999, with some £51 million of this funding coming from the EU.  The programme makes the point that as it was planned to invest more resources in marketing Irish tourism relative to the Tourism Operational Programme 1989-93, it was considered necessary to identify specific marketing schemes which would focus on the key objectives of the programme, including the achievement of foreign exchange earnings of £2.25 billion in 1999.  I might add, in passing, that unlike the first tourism operational programme, the current programme does not contain targets in relation to the numbers of visitors, reflecting a shift in emphasis from numbers to revenue yield which I am sure will be welcomed.  Senator Howard made that perfectly clear but many people in the industry are of the opinion there is a need for the shift of emphasis. We all accept that if there is more to spend it is to the benefit of the economy.</P>
    <P>The five themes which underpin the marketing sub-programme of the operational programme are improving seasonality, where priority is given in the maximum support rates available under the operational programme for marketing projects which attract visitors in the shoulder and off-peak periods, expanding sea and air access, developing new markets, developing product and niche markets, and attracting more high yield business. These themes have guided the work of the Independent Management Board for Marketing which, up to 31 December 1995, had approved over £12 <Col N="2219" /> million in marketing grants under the operational programme.</P>
    <P>A wide variety of projects have been supported, ranging from brochure production to direct campaigns and mainstream consumer advertising.  Tourism enterprises of every type have been assisted, including carriers, tour operators, marketing co-operatives, individual suppliers and relevant public bodies. I understand that in 1996 the marketing board, having reviewed its activities to date, will be seeking to focus more support towards projects which are strategic in direction as opposed to the more tactical nature of previous years.</P>
    <P>The major consumer advertising campaigns for Irish tourism in 1996 will, as in 1995, be undertaken under the aegis of the industry-led Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative, which is a marketing partnership involving Bord Fáilte, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the tourism industry, North and South. Here, I want to get back to the point raised by both Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Howard regarding the budget. A budget of £6.5 million will be available to the OTMI this year, comprising £1 million from the industry, £500,000 sourced from Northern Ireland, £1 million from the Exchequer and a total of £4 million from the marketing sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Tourism.  I feel that a budget of £6.5 million is quite a generous one.  Despite Senator Fitzgerald's claims that there should be more outlets on the continent of Europe, I feel that for a country of our size the sum of £6.5 million is a substantial amount of money to be spending on promotion.</P>
    <P>Television and press campaigns which promote holidays to the island of Ireland are now being run by the OTMI in our four main markets &mdash; the US, Britain, Germany and France.  The content and timing of OTMI advertising is carefully selected so that it makes the maximum impact on the target audience <Col N="2220" /> for Irish tourism, which is usually in the mid to high income categories.  OTMI campaigns feature a variety of response mechanisms, such as freephone numbers, coupons or minitel which have been carefully selected for their appropriateness to the target market in each country.  Typically, respondents will receive a holiday kit which includes specially produced OTMI brochures and the Bord Fáilte and NITB market books.  The aim is to provide the potential customer with the impetus to holiday in Ireland and the method of doing so in the easiest manner.</P>
    <P>The renewed mandate for Bord Fáilte, in line with the Arthur D. Little consultancy review, has been confirmed as international marketing and the organisation is refocussing its resources on this key task while divesting itself of other non-core functions.  Senators may remember that in the past matters, such as the Tidy Towns competition, which were not related directly to tourism were undertaken by Bord Fáilte.  This is no longer the case.  Bord Fáilte has now been told to concentrate on marketing. The new structure reflects a concentration on three core priorities &mdash; selling and promoting Ireland overseas, helping the less mature elements of the industry to develop its marketing and product development capabilities, and providing information for enhanced decision making by marketers, investors and managers in the industry as well as Government.</P>
    <P>A new mission statement has been agreed for Bord Fáilte and a new organisational structure is being finalised.  An international marketing director with a proven track record in private industry now heads up the international marketing division and a new general manager for Europe has been appointed.  The board is currently recruiting a small number of marketing executives and graduates to work in the development of overseas markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2221" /> For the longer term, the work which is currently ongoing in Bord Fáilte on the development of the destination brand for Irish tourism will help to position Ireland as a unique high quality destination. Consumer research in tourism strongly indicates that <i>de facto</i> destination brands already exist in the minds of most travellers for many international destinations, including Ireland. The challenge in developing and managing a brand is to move such images in the direction of firmly establishing a brand proposition which motivates the traveller as well as being distinctive and memorable compared to its competitors.</P>
    <P>But the development and promotion of a new brand for Irish tourism will only be possible if it gets widespread support from the industry.  By support, I mean not only inputting its views and ideas but also contributing financially to the project.  Developing a new brand only makes sense if tangible economic benefits can be seen to flow from the process.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the marketing strategies for Irish tourism currently being implemented have contributed to the most successful period ever for Irish tourism, but marketing strategies must continually evolve in response to market demands.  Above all, they must seek to achieve the maximum co-ordination between all potential partners who have an interest in marketing Ireland as a destination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator.</P>
      <P>I mentioned earlier the importance of the domestic tourism market.  One of the significant achievements of the last Tourism Council &mdash; which is made up of representatives of the industry, the State tourism agencies and Government Departments under the chairmanship of Minister Kenny &mdash; was its endorsement of the comprehensive report <i>Domestic Tourism Marketing</i> which was commissioned by the marketing sub-committee at my specific request.  This report outlined the value of domestic tourism in economic terms, the increased level of competition, especially in the short break sector, and the marketing opportunities which are emerging.  It specifically recommended that a new and reorganised approach to support growth in the domestic market was opportune and put forward a number of suggestions for new marketing initiatives.  Following from this, I am pleased to say that I secured Government agreement earlier this year to the allocation of £500,000 towards the cost of developing a new initiative to encourage greater marketing by the industry of home holidays, particularly in the off-peak and shoulder season.  This initiative will only succeed, however, if it has the co-operation and involvement, both financially and actively, of the tourism industry right across the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to the question of co-ordination of State and other grant aiding agencies involved in tourism.  Arising from concerns about possible inconsistency and duplication in tourism development efforts, the product development sub-committee of the last Tourism Council prepared a report on co-ordination in tourism in June 1994. Essentially, this report recommended that the Operational Programme for Tourism should be seen as the starting <Col N="2223" /> point for all tourism related initiatives and that the Minister and the Department of Tourism and Trade are the final arbiter of tourism policy.  Other agencies and measures that assist tourism projects as part of their primary non-tourism objectives should complement rather than act in conflict with the incentives offered under the Tourism Operational Programme.  The report made a number of specific recommendations to this end.</P>
    <P>The Department of Tourism and Trade subsequently engaged in discussions with other relevant Departments with a view to the implementation of the report's recommendations. I am happy to say that a good deal of progress was made and the objectives of the exercise were largely realised, particularly in relation to Leader, the county enterprise fund and the agritourism scheme.  Because of the Department of Tourism and Trade's implementing role, difficulties over coordination are not expected to arise in relation to the International Fund for Ireland and the EU INTERREG.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the mechanisms now put in place will go a long way towards eliminating the potential for duplication or conflict in tourism development.  The Department of Tourism and Trade will nevertheless continue to monitor the situation.</P>
    <P>The Department of Tourism and Trade and Bord Fáilte have prepared national marketing and development strategies.  Development plans have been drawn up for each of the regions by the six regional tourism organisations and Shannon Development.  The draft national strategy guided the evolution of the regional plans and, in turn, the regional strengths and priorities influenced the thrust of national strategy. With the establishment of county tourism committees in 1994 has come the opportunity and responsibility to develop county action plans for tourism <Col N="2224" /> which can be integrated into the plans of the county enterprise boards and regional tourism organisations.</P>
    <P>The regional tourism organisations and SFADCo play an important role in encouraging grant applications under the Operational Programme for Tourism within their regions.  They also have a direct input into the evaluation of each individual development proposal from their area seeking European Regional Development Fund assistance. This gives the regional bodies, who are responsible for tourism promotion in their areas, the opportunity to co-ordinate development proposals with regional marketing strategy at an early stage in both the design and evaluation of expenditure proposals.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, important that efforts to secure the optimum level of co-ordination between programmes and Government Departments and agencies are mirrored within the industry itself. To this end, and in line with Government policy, a number of product specific marketing groups have been set up. Nineteen such groups are now in existence and the tourism products covered include golf, angling, cruising, equestrianism, cycling, walking, language learning, heritage, culture and rural tourism.  By marketing on a group basis the sector concerned can help to maintain high standards and make the best possible use of European Regional Development Fund marketing assistance with a view to achieving commercial sustainability during the lifetime of the present Operational Programme for Tourism.  By focusing on a specific product rather than on a geographical basis, the group can help to achieve a good regional spend of tourism revenue.</P>
    <P>The programme, however, contains a complementary provision where cooperative marketing support will also be available to encourage individual suppliers of different tourism products in a region to co-operate in developing <Col N="2225" /> attractive packages of visitor facilities in their areas.</P>
    <P>Manpower Policy is an issue which is of vital importance to the future of Irish tourism.  By the end of the century we expect that five million people will visit us each year.  All of these tourists want and must be provided with an efficient and friendly service which they will remember and associate with their visit.</P>
    <P>Over the last two years tourism training has received an unprecedented amount of attention and study.  As Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Trade, I am conscious of the need to boost human capital by enhancing education and skill levels in the industry and I am determined that the focus on training and development which has now been recognised as essential will continue.  Training has for too long been the Cinderella of the tourism industry and indeed other sectors in our economy.</P>
    <P>This is acknowledged in the Operational Programme for Tourism where training is one of the four main sub programmes. A total of £110 million will be invested in tourism training between 1994 and 1999 and over 72,000 people will be trained.  This almost doubles the number trained under the last operational programme.</P>
    <P>In keeping with overall national tourism policy, CERT's role and function will be to provide training for new entrants and the existing workforce in tourism to assist in the provision of a higher quality tourism product leading to the creation and enhancement of employment.</P>
    <P>The training policies and strategies envisaged in the operational programme are derived primarily from the anticipation of market led changes and demand in the overall tourism product and its component parts.  Training programmes are adapted as required by changes in the tourism product while the shorter term interventions have an in built flexibility to meet any more immediate training needs that may arise during the course of the operational programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2226" /> Training programmes run by CERT are matched to the skill needs of tourism, as identified by research and liaison with the tourism industry at sectoral, regional and individual establishment level.  I have no doubt that CERT's training and development initiatives will assist in the promotion and facilitation of a quality culture in tourism.  European language training will continue to be an integral part of the overall training strategy of CERT.</P>
    <P>Government strategy will continue to place great emphasis on the close matching of trainee output with employment opportunities over the 1994-99 period and trainee output will be increased on a phased basis during this period.  This close matching of supply and demand is ensured by a variety of measures which include research on the current and future demand of tourism for skilled staff, an ongoing review of whether the output of training programmes meets that demand as well as the monitoring of job placement rates for graduates.  The annual average throughput of trainees over the programme period will be close to 12,000 people.</P>
    <P>Initiatives will be undertaken which will include training for new product areas, localised training, increased emphasis on management level training, distance learning and an extension of the business start up programmes. Training programmes for the non-traditional sectors are being introduced to provide more tailor made and relevant training.  This would include: heritage-cultural and interpretative centres; rural tourism; air and sea carriers; local and regional guiding interests; leisure, recreation centres and golf clubs; local and community tourism co-operatives and tourist facilities and services.</P>
    <P>The last tourism council, through a subcommittee chaired by Peter Malone of Jury Hotels, produced a report on tourism manpower and training for the 21st century.  A number of key issues were highlighted by the report, but the two most important were the shortage of trained staff and the poor image of <Col N="2227" /> the industry.  Many people in the industry now rely on this report.  There were difficulties recently with recruiting staff into the industry.  I am happy that in his report, Mr. Malone identified the image of the industry and how it related to the shortage of trained staff as being a problem.</P>
    <P>The perception of the tourism industry as an industry dogged by long hours and low pay is not attractive.  We all agree that this poor image needs to be seriously addressed and this must be done sooner rather than later.  The Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny, raised this question when addressing the annual conference of the Irish Hotels Federation in Cork in February and the industry is aware of the problem.</P>
    <P>There are, as we all know, some craft sectors in the industry which have improved their image.  The hotel chef is probably a good example.  Other positions in the industry, unfortunately, do not have the same reputation and are often seen as unattractive and inferior. The industry must do more to project itself as a worthwhile and rewarding career for young people.  Improving the image involves addressing matters such as pay, hours of work training for a career, and terms and conditions of employment.  Many hoteliers are conscious of their responsibilities but there is a minority who fail to take a longer term perspective.</P>
    <P>The stream of young eager and highly motivated recruits for all sectors of Irish industry will not continue indefinitely. The Malone report referred to the fact that tourism will face increasing competition from other service sectors because of the level of growth in the economy and demographic changes towards the end of this decade and beyond.</P>
    <P>The Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland, in conjunction with CERT, formed a recruitment committee to look at ways of encouraging operators to increase the promotion of careers in the hospitality industry and to make them an attractive <Col N="2228" /> option for school leavers.  In 1995 the committee launched a pilot promotional scheme aimed at second level students in the mid-west.  The scheme was well received by schools and industry alike and it is planned to extend this promotional scheme nationwide during 1996.</P>
    <P>Action must now be taken to face these problems.  The Government, through CERT, will train over 70,000 people for tourism by 1999.  This is a major commitment.  CERT has produced a draft corporate plan for the period up to 1999 which takes on board much of the recent analysis conducted and seeks to reposition the organisation to meet the future needs and requirements of the industry.</P>
    <P>However, the industry must address these critical issues if it is to continue to secure and retain a quality trained workforce.  The level of European social funds available for training and other related tourism initiatives will be uncertain when the current operational programme expires in 1999.  The industry must plan now to develop and take responsibility for its training needs.</P>
    <P>The new tourism council chaired by the Minister Deputy Kenny, which will first meet tomorrow, acts as a national forum for consultation between the tourism industry, State tourism agencies and Government Departments.  Manpower planning is one of the strategic issues listed on the agenda for discussion by the council at a future date. It may be the only forum of its kind where the Minister acts as chairman and the people involved in the industry have direct access to the Cabinet.  It is unique in that regard.</P>
    <P>We must accept that for a variety of reasons, some parts of the country will always have a stronger tourism appeal than others.  This is not to say every area does not have its own story to tell and a significant tourism potential.  The strategy must be to ensure that the optimum support mechanisms are in place to facilitate realisation of this potential. We have made a great deal of progress <Col N="2229" /> in this respect and regional tourism interests should take full advantage.</P>
    <P>Understandable concerns have been expressed recently about the regional spread of tourism growth.  It is important, however, that we maintain a sense of proportion in what is an outstanding success story for all regions.  I hope my contribution this evening and the debate that will follow will help in this respect.</P>
    <P>I apologise for my lengthy reply, but in view of the importance of this motion, both I and the Minister felt it deserved a substantial response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his broad and sweeping statement on the future of our tourism industry up to 1999.  The Minister admitted that the Structural Funds, especially those relating to training, will be completely exhausted by that time. We must grasp the nettle by putting our house in order and setting up training programmes.</P>
      <P>I support the motion's call to &ldquo;take action to promote even growth in tourist numbers and income in the regions&rdquo;.  The Minister admitted the need for this when he said that the growth in 1995 seems to have been in the eastern side of the country. We are all well aware of that because the streets of Dublin, and other areas on the east coast, were bursting at the seams from May to October.</P>
      <P>On the other side of the country, however, there was a huge decline, particularly from North America.  The Shannon Airport flyover caused real problems for the region.  The Minister said that figures are not yet available for 1995 but I know that tourist figures from North America to Kerry were down last year, although we clawed some of it back through increased figures from Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cork-Swansea ferry nearly went to the wall last year and it is still shaky. If that service had not been operating for the Cork/Kerry region we would have had a weak season in the south west.  How does the new marketing board intend to get the influx of people <Col N="2230" /> in the eastern side of the country to the west?  How we can counteract the imbalance?</P>
    <P>There are cheap flights from Dublin to the UK, but why can we not have similar flights into Shannon, Cork and Farranfore?  Americans can now fly from the United States to any part of Britain or into Dublin far more cheaply than flying from Shannon to New York. There may be a £150 difference at this time of the year.  That is a huge imbalance because for £150 people could stay an extra five or six nights in a bed and breakfast establishment.  When people are planning their holidays they take such considerations into account and they will go for the cheapest deal.  Naturally, anyone visiting Ireland from any part of the world would like to see Dublin, but tourists should also be attracted to the most beautiful part of the country in my own region.</P>
    <P>The imbalance in landing rights and fees is causing problems in the south west.  The Government will have to deal with the fact that while there are free landing rights in Shannon and Cork Airports, exorbitant landing fees are charged at the new airport in Farranfore which has cost £15 million of taxpayers' money.  We cannot compete with other regions because the playing pitch is uneven.  It is totally unfair.  The Government must act to improve this imbalance by levelling the playing pitch.  The Government will also have to provide extra resources for our roads infrastructure so that we can compete with the east coast region.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, recently produced a nice glossy brochure about clearing up rubbish on our roads, but action will have to be taken on this.  When I drive from Kerry to Dublin every week I am ashamed of the appalling amount of rubbish on the road, which is disgraceful. On the way up from Kerry yesterday I saw 20 or 30 FÁS people out with rubbish bags picking it up.  People will have to be made more conscious of rubbish and encouraged not to throw it on the roads for others to pick up.  People <Col N="2231" /> will have to become more conscious of their own countryside and the environment in general.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that visitor figures through Shannon Airport were up last year.  While that is true, the figures were well down from North America generally.  Over the years extra facilities have been installed to cater for tourists, and during the winter extra bed nights were created in Killarney, Tralee and elsewhere in County Kerry.  Despite that, we will have a fall off in numbers because visitors will take the cheapest and shortest route into the country which is in the east.</P>
    <P>I was amused by the figures from the Dublin Tourism Board which show that 40 per cent of people who came into the east were anxious to move onto other parts of the country.  When people landed in Shannon or Cork we got the first wave, which is the best.  Now, however, by the time we get them coming from the eastern side of the country the lining in their pockets is running thin.  Their spending power is not as good as it would be at the start of their holidays.</P>
    <P>The split between the Shannon Regional Tourism Authority promoting the northern part of Kerry, and Cork-Kerry Tourism running the southern part of the county has created a desperate situation.  It is ludicrous to promote County Kerry in two halves because of administration and other costs.  That problem will have to be tackled by marketing Kerry as a single region.</P>
    <P>If we are to develop the west, including Clare, Galway and Mayo, people <Col N="2232" /> must be encouraged to come in through Cork, Shannon or Farranfore Airports and aboard the Cork-Swansea ferry so that the west will benefit generally.  It is wrong if 60 to 70 per cent of tourists are coming in through the eastern side of the country where hotels are shooting up.  People in the west are totally dependent on the tourist trade, and staff trained in local hotels have won awards all over the world.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his lengthy speech and for the interest he has taken in the situation.  The Minister should take on board the points that Senator Fitzgerald and I have raised.  The east-west tourism imbalance must be corrected, because if it is not done now it will be impossible to promote industry and tourism in the west after 1999.  You might as well lock the west behind a gate, and one day the eastern side of the country will tip into the sea because there will be no one left in the west.</P>
    <P>While we welcome urban renewal as it relates to seaside resorts, facilities and infrastructure must be put into the west. Big shots with money are building holiday homes and using resources in our seaside towns, but the money will have to be invested to put these facilities in place if we want to develop the country together.  It is pointless to bring people in for a two or three week holiday when we need to attract visitors into our areas for four or five months of the season.</P>
