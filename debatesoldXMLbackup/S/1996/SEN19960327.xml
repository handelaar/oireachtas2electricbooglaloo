      <P>It is my duty on behalf of this House to propose a vote of sympathy to the wife and son of the late Seán Browne.  Seán Browne devoted his life to public life.  I knew him best as a member of Wexford County Council and during that long period I always found him generous, unselfish and caring. During his term in the Upper and Lower Houses &mdash; he was Leas-Cheann Comhairle from 1979 to 1984 &mdash; I always found him impartial.  He was also a great sportsman.  While he never played for the County Wexford team, he was chairman of the Wexford board of the GAA for 21 years and brought great honour to the county's hurling teams during that period.</P>
      <P>While we were aware that he was not well, his death still came as a great shock to County Wexford.  He served Wexford and Ireland well.  He was a generous, honest and good man.  On behalf of Seanad Éireann, I extend my sympathy to his wife and son.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who did not have the privilege of knowing Seán Browne were deprived of knowing a real gentleman of the highest standard who had the most reasonable disposition <Col N="1754" /> to all colleagues in public life.  I had the privilege of knowing him for almost all the years he was a Member of Seanad and Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>When we pay tribute to Seán Browne, we should recognise what people like him represented in public life.  There is some cynicism about people in public life and the word &ldquo;politician&rdquo; tends to be denigrated.  However, there are still, as there was then, people who are animated only by commitment to their community and to serving the country they love so well.  Seán Browne was one such person.  I cannot think of anyone who would have anything but the kindest and warmest words of appreciation for him.</P>
      <P>His Wexford roots meant much to him.  We joked, laughed and fought about it in terms of the hurling rivalries between our counties.  However, he was definitely rooted in the values of Ireland and in not only maintaining, but enhancing those values.  At a time when they are under attack we should at least acknowledge that men like him have done much to maintain standards in public life.</P>
      <P>It is a privilege for me, although a sad one, to be asked by my party to acknowledge his contribution not only to us but to public life.  I join with Senator D'Arcy, who knew him personally, in conveying our sympathies to his wife and son.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis uasal.</P>

      <P>No one on the Independent benches had the privilege of knowing the former Deputy and Senator Seán Browne.  However, as is our practice, we wish to be associated with the expression of condolence to any public representative who gave his or her best to improve democracy.  We agree that those who have contributed to public life are the guardians of democracy.  The country is indebted to this man who gave his time at local and national level. We wish to be associated with the expression of condolence to his wife and son.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats also wish to be associated with this expression of sympathy to the wife and son of the late Seán Browne.  It is a singular achievement to have served in one or the other Houses for over 20 years and it should be marked.  I also extend our sympathy to his nephew, Deputy Browne.

      <P>The Labour Party would also like to be associated with the tributes paid to Seán Browne.  I did not know him either.  I know from talking to party colleagues in the Dáil that he was a fine public representative who worked with people from all sides for the good of his constituents and for the good of Ireland.  Like other Members, I pay tribute to him for his long service both in the Dáil and Seanad and I convey our sympathy to his wife and son and to Deputy John Browne.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Hayes that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to finalise the situation that surrounds the siting of a new school for Coláiste de hÍde in Tallaght.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mooney of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1756" /> The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to outline the current state of relations between Ireland and Taiwan, known as the Republic of China, and the practical steps he believes Ireland can take to assist in reducing tension in the South China Seas.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to appoint a remedial teacher to Glenbrohane, Knockadea, Ballylanders and Knocklong national schools in County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Hayes's and Senator Mooney's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Neville may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Last week this House had the opportunity to discuss BSE because the Leader kindly arranged statements last Thursday.  In light of events taking place at present, would the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry come into this House?  As I mentioned last week, we support the need for national co-ordinated support for the industry.  If the Minister was available this week, we would welcome him and we would agree to time being made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On many occasions, as would be the position of Leader of the Opposition, I have cause to disagree with various areas of Government policy.  On this <Col N="1757" /> occasion I wish to comment on a success story in the film industry which particularly involved the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins. I refer to the success of the film <i>Braveheart.</i> I note the newspaper comments this morning on the claims of other countries.  In my view this is a success story for this country and there is enough in it to help the appropriate agencies to promote our country.</P>
    <P>The economic benefits of events in the last 48 hours will be ongoing.  I encourage the Minister and the Government to continue the policy of promoting and encouraging investment in this country to the economic benefit of all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's White Paper on Foreign Policy was published yesterday and I am sure the Leader will be making arrangements to have discussions on it at an appropriate time.  I want to focus on the aspect of neutrality.  There have been clear indications from all party leaders that they are walking on eggshells on this issue and it is easy to understand why.  It is crucially important that such discussions should take place in peace time, if you will forgive the analogy.  It is important for public representatives to clear their minds before they start coming under pressure from various groups with different viewpoints.</P>
      <P>People should take time to establish what they mean by neutrality and how this country would act neutrally in different situations.  I would prefer that to be done here before there is a major public debate.  Neutrality should be discussed by the House to allow people to be better informed about it rather than falling victim to other persons' points of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>For the second week running we do not have Private Members' time.  I realise that we will debate a very serious issue this evening &mdash; during what is normally Private Members' time &mdash; when we can avail of the debate on the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations to make observations on BSE.  I expect <Col N="1758" /> that Fine Gael or Labour could have found a motion on which we could all agree.  It is not necessary for them to table a motion on which they could be voted down on the basis of having a minority in the House.  It creates a bad precedent when we do not have Private Members' time, and if that means allocating other time to these serious issues, then that should be done.  Private Members' time, however, should be sacrosanct.</P>
      <P>Like the Leader of the Opposition, I am glad BSE was discussed last week, although it was regrettable that neither the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry nor the Minister of State was here to take the debate.  The Leader should bring to the Taoiseach's attention the necessity of contacting the Egyptian authorities as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be careful because the position could get worse.  It should not have taken as long as this to have made contact.  If I can phone my house from a public phone booth in the Gaza Strip, I suspect that the Taoiseach should have been able to contact the Egyptian President by telephone more expeditiously than has been the case.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the White Paper on Foreign Policy entitled <i>Challenges and Opportunities Abroad.</i> I am curious to know the significance of the picture on the front of the White Paper showing Ireland alone in the world and hanging by a thread.  Perhaps someone will clarify the significance of that piece of art.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Can time be made available to discuss this matter?  Professor Dooge is coming to the House tomorrow and it would be appropriate to combine those two items.  I can understand why it might not be possible but it is something we have to discuss as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I endorse the remarks that were made about the film <i>Braveheart.</i> I thank members of the Defence Forces and the FCA at the Curragh for having contributed so significantly to this singular achievement.</P>
      <P>Over the past couple of weeks we sought time to discuss proposals for the representation of emigrants in the Seanad.  When is it proposed to take that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Wright and Senator Dardis in congratulating both the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and all the Irish people who were involved in the film <i>Braveheart.</i> Senator Dardis rightly singled out the Defence Forces and the FCA whose members looked very well in their kilts.  Senator O'Toole mentioned the White Paper on Foreign Policy. It is important that we take the time to read the paper fully before we discuss it here because it is quite a long document. While naturally the media have concentrated on the neutrality issue, there are other important aspects, such as how we relate to countries where there are human rights abuses, development aid and so on.  We should give equal importance to each issue when we discuss the White Paper.</P>
      <P>Private Members' business was to have been the Labour Party's motion tonight but we gave up our time because of the important issue that needs to be discussed.  I can assure Senator Dardis that we had prepared a motion, about which we felt strongly, but we decided to give up our time because the other matter is more pressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As a fellow constituent of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, I congratulate him.  He will <Col N="1760" /> get so many votes in Galway West next time around that those of us opposing him will need a brave heart to be able to withstand all the great things he is doing.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise two issues with the Leader of the House.  Last Sunday's <i>Sunday World</i> carried a report on the crime bosses.  I ask the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on the subject matter of that report.  This was a brilliant piece of investigative journalism and it is time we discussed the crimes perpetrated by well known criminals, not just in Dublin but in other cities, including Galway.  If a newspaper can photograph people and state clearly that they are involved in serious criminal activity, then it is time for the relevant Ministers to discuss with us the action to be taken to put those people where they belong.  They are a problem for society.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business last week I raised the situation in University College Hospital Galway and I raise it again today because it is even more urgent now.  You will be familiar, Sir, with the problems that have existed there for some time.  The most serious problem occurred this week.  Two of the three X-ray theatres have now been closed because the patient radiation dose and the operator radiation dose is considered excessive.</P>

      <P>A question to the Leader, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The major acute hospital in the Western Health Board area, serving the western seaboard, now has the same facilities as a cottage hospital.  It is not possible to be X-rayed in University College Hospital at present.  I ask for an urgent debate about this hospital so that we can find a way forward.  This is not the fault of the present Minister, it is the fault of successive Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>At what stage is the reorganisation of the education structures and when it is likely to be complete?  I wholeheartedly support the commendations <Col N="1761" /> to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins.  I knew at the outset that his commitment, dedication and involvement would result in a great success for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister who will be dealing with the bovine diseases levy this evening address as a matter of particular importance and urgency, the question of controls by our Customs authorities along the Border? This has become the most important single issue to be addressed having regard to the actions we took in our time to ensure that we maintained what is called white country disease free status but unfortunately the UK, which includes Northern Ireland, did not do the same.  Given the priority attached to this industry in this part of Ireland, it is essential to know what steps the Customs authorities &mdash; perhaps the Minister for Finance should deal with this aspect &mdash; are taking and will continue to take to ensure that smuggling across the Border will not undermine our status.  This matter is of vital importance.</P>
      <P>In relation to contact with Egypt, will the Leader communicate to the Taoiseach that there is precedent for a successful conclusion to problems caused by restrictions imposed by that country? In 1989, in conjunction with the veterinary authorities, I visited Iran and made contact with the Egyptian authorities regarding similar difficulties.  Vetinarians travelled to Egypt and the authorities there were then satisfied that our beef was absolutely secure.  This precedent exists and I hope there will be no further delay in reactivating the guarantees established at that time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1762" /> I agree with Senator O'Sullivan that it is important to take time to consider neutrality in detail.  However, the Tánaiste could have considered it over the last 18 months and ensured there was sufficient time to discuss it.  It is being introduced now, just two days before the Intergovernmental Conference in Turin, and although everyone has been asked for comments, there has not been proper analysis or discussion. It is far too late at this point, but it is essential the House holds a reasoned ongoing debate on this matter.  I hope the Tánaiste will be in a position to come to the House to discuss these issues.</P>

I join in the congratulations to the Minister, Deputy Michael Higgins, and the Irish craftsmen and technicians who took part in the production of the film <i>Braveheart.</i> I do not frequently visit the cinema, but having heard Senator O'Sullivan's eloquent disquisition on the beauty of the Defence Forces in their kilts, perhaps I shall make an exception on this occasion.  This country is frequently accused of begrudgery, but yesterday in the Dáil Deputy de Valera of Fianna Fáil very generously congratulated the Minister, Deputy Michael Higgins, on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Will the Minister make a statement, now that he is obviously basking in the reflected glory of the movie's success, on this matter?  It is important that he clarify, for those who might now be considering this country as a location for epic movies of the magnitude of <i>Braveheart</i>, if it will be financially attractive for them to come here following the decision to amend section 35 of the Finance Act.</P>

I have carried out research on this and have discovered that I have been seeking a debate on health matters for eight months now.  A White Paper on mental health has been published and there have been many calls for a debate on it.  Will the Leader give us a definite date for the debate? The legislation governing mental health is 50 years old and is out of tune with modern psychiatry.  We owe it to the psychiatric profession and to those being treated under existing legislation to debate this issue sooner rather than later.</P>

Will questions be allowed during tonight's debate on BSE because the problem of contaminated ingredients in the food chain is as important as the main issue?</P>
      <P>I join with other Senators in suggesting that it would be appropriate to have a discussion about responsibility for criminal earnings, avoidance of tax and criminal abuse of the social welfare system.

      <P>Section 3 states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, pay to the company a sum not exceeding £15,028,500.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister explain the reasons for this?  I know that a loan of £17 million must be discharged.  On Second Stage we discussed implementing works which are necessary from an environmental point of view.  Is section 3 relevant to this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cregan's point is valid and relevant to the environmental works.  He referred to the outstanding loan of £17 million which is being written off under section 2.  The sum of £15.0285 million in this case consists of a number of different elements.  There is a provision of £2.36 million to fund necessary environmental and other remedial works which were identified during the due diligence process.  A sum of £2.831 million has been provided for charges and expenses identified by ISPAT International during the due diligence process which should have been included in the balance sheet of Irish Steel for the 12 month period ended 30 June 1995.</P>
      <P>A sum of £192,500 has been provided to finance a matching contribution from the Exchequer towards a staff training grant under Article 56.2 (b) of the ECSC Treaty.  A sum of £7.2 million has been provided to compensate the company for restrictions on production and sales imposed on the Irish Steel-ISPAT International project for the next five years to overcome UK objections and to ensure unanimity among all member states of the EU under Article 95 of the treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will know this relates to negotiations with the British Government <Col N="1775" /> and the amount is essentially to compensate ISPAT International for the restrictions imposed on it in terms of sales to the European market and the capacity ceiling.  The last payment is to provide an up front cash payment in lieu of indemnities in respect of possible residual taxation and other costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said but I understood environmental works were to be carried out.  Members will understand the problems in the Cork region where environmental groups constantly made complaints. Many jobs were lost because of these complaints, which were probably genuine in some instances.  I understood the State would carry out the environmental works rather the company.  I did not know that over £2 million was being paid to the company to carry out these works.  Are we happy that this amount must be paid?  This steel plant is relatively elderly and it is located in a part of the port which is important in terms of the water system.  I am afraid the works may not be to done to our satisfaction if they are taken out of our hands.  I know there are environmental structures through which such matters can be investigated.  As I said, having listened to the Second Stage debate, I was under the impression that the State would carry out these environmental works rather than the company.  I will discuss later the other money being given to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding on the advice available to me is that a considered provision and that everyone concerned is happy about its adequacy. In terms of the amount of money being provided, there is no question that the environmental and remedial works carried out will be adequate to meet best environmental requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Minister's word that ISPAT International is best placed to undertake the environmental works needed.  However, I was under <Col N="1776" /> the impression on Second Stage that the State would carry out the environmental works before the company was handed over.  We are spending £10 million more than we anticipated last September.  As regards the £7 million being spent because of restrictions on business required by one member state, is there any way we can recoup that money back from the EU?  I do not see why we should pay this money to the company.</P>
      <P>I am aware of how well this company works and how it can turn businesses around in a short period, which I hope it will do in the case of Irish Steel.  Every possible assistance should be given to protect the 300 in the company. However, it is embarrassing that we must pay an additional £7 million to subsidise this company because one nation wants to restrict production at Irish Steel, a relatively small company compared to those in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On Senator Cregan's first question, I think I can assure him that he need have no concern about the people, as he puts it, being satisfied about the quality of the environmental and remedial works which are to be put in place.  ISPAT International is required as part of the agreement to do this in consultation with the local authority and I am sure Senator Cregan would agree that the local authority is best placed to make a judgment on what is acceptable locally from the point of view of the environment.  The work, of course, will be carried out over a period and no doubt there will be ongoing discussions, etc., and resort to the technical and professional expertise of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second question which Senator Cregan raises, it may not be quite true to say that the opposition of one member state has cost us an additional £10 million but it has cost us in excess of £7 million.  Indeed, it is a painful penalty for objections which, in my view, were not sustainable.  I do not believe that the argument made by the British Government was well founded but the reality is that the agreement <Col N="1777" /> before you is the best which could be secured by my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, who, with his officials, devoted an enormous amount of time to it.</P>
    <P>Whereas there is a penalty, in the wider scheme of things, our disposition is that this was necessary in order to conclude the agreement.  Unfortunately, the question of us being able to recoup this amount elsewhere within the EU framework does not arise.</P>

      <P>We have among the most modern and up to date plants and equipment.  These steel works employed approximately 140 people and the receiver, Mr. Ray Jackson, has reengaged 70 people.  I am anxious to know whether the Department can assist some of the people who applied to purchase this company.  There are about 20 inquiries at present but I understand they are narrowing down to the serious purchasers.</P>
      <P>It is important that, with Irish Steel Limited, we would have some company which would utilise and benefit from its production.  This firm, situated in the middle of Ireland, has been able to sell its products in Britain but, unfortunately, it has been placed in receivership and is in serious financial difficulty.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the support I received from the Minister of State on this matter. When we arranged meetings with a number of people from the firm he was most co-operative.  I want him to bear this company in mind.  These 70 people were re-employed because the company is completing one of its major contracts in County Kildare.  Any assistance the Minister can give would be most helpful.</P>

      <P>Obviously I share Senator Enright's concern about what has happened at Portarlington.  It is a significant steel fabrication plant in Irish terms.  It is a tragedy that losses in excess of £20 million were run up before we reached the stage which, unfortunately, led to the appointment of a receiver.  The task of the receiver is to attempt to rescue the company and dispose of it as a going concern.  That is difficult, obviously, in the context of the extent of the accumulated deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt but that there is a market niche for a company with the proven expertise which is in the ranks of Butlers Engineering Limited.  I assure Senator Enright that, as far as is possible <Col N="1779" /> within the mechanisms which are available, the Department would be willing to do anything it can to assist the retention of the optimum employment at Portarlington.  To some extent, it is outside of the Department's control in so much as the receiver has definite parameters within which he must operate but it is extremely regrettable that good employment in such an important company should be put at risk.  I am aware there is great concern in the area about the future employment prospects of the workers concerned.  If there is any pragmatic way in which the Department can help, it will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to hold up the proceedings so I will speak on the matter once.  While the Minister agrees that one member state has reduced steel exports from Ireland to the EU, it is still disappointing to hear him say that.  The Minister may say there are no avenues open but it is very serious that the State must spend over £7 million, which was not part of the initial deal, because one nation decided to limit the production in a small Irish plant.  In comparison British plants, which rationalised over a 15 year period, are now producing more steel than ever thanks to the EU regulations and recommendations.  The State must now give more than £7 million because production is limited in order to save 300 or more jobs.  The EU is demanding a reduction in steel production in general.  Is there any other avenue open to us?  Can we make an ongoing argument?  I am not saying we should hold back the Bill but this should be noted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister's feelings on the matter and those of the senior Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton.  I am also aware of what they both went through over the last 16 months.  At the same time, should the other member states not allow this State to spend extra money?  Is there not an argument being made today in Brussels for avenues to be opened to protect Britain's beef industry?  After all, the British beef <Col N="1780" /> industry is in trouble because of mistakes made.  We are not making mistakes; we are rationalising Irish Steel by reducing staff numbers from 1,000 to 300 people to ensure it stays open. However, Britain wants avenues opened to protect its beef industry, whose problems came about because of their own mistakes.  Does the Minister agree with me?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the validity of the arguments advanced by the British Government and the Minister concerned, Mr. Eggar, at the time.  Its arguments have no validity.  One could discuss for a considerable time the real motivation behind the position adopted by the British Government, but that is history.  The best feasible deal was secured on behalf of the Irish taxpayer.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that an additional penalty in excess of £7 million had to be paid, but the price was dictated by the requirement of unanimity on the Council of Ministers.  A Minister representing one member state could not agree to what seemed a reasonable arrangement to the other 14 member countries and because of that requirement we felt there was little other choice if we wanted to secure the deal.  In so far as anything can be assured in this business, we seem to have secured a sound future for Irish Steel and the overwhelming majority of its workers and we should conclude this agreement with optimum dispatch.</P>
      <P>I understand and share Senator Cregan's chagrin, but the <i>realpolitik</i> is that we had little choice.  The beef or any other matter notwithstanding, there is no avenue open for us to recoup these moneys.</P>

      <P>The figure in section 3 may have increased by up to £9 million because of this arrangement.  It may be a case of the tail wagging the dog.  It is unfortunate and we cannot just put it down to history.  There has been a constant historical problem between ourselves and Britain and we should not allow it to continue.  It is unfair if we are <Col N="1781" /> forced to pay this penalty and I ask the Minister to find some way of avoiding it.  There is no reason why we could not use a similar argument to that used by our Commissioner in regard to the savings made in regard to beef last week and tell him to find out why one nation can control the production of one of the smallest steel plants in the EU.  This money could provide up to another 100 jobs in the next five years.  Will this restriction last for five years, for all time or until such time as we can change it?</P>

Section 4 (2), which states that &ldquo;Moneys may be paid out of the said account until such purposes and in accordance with such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the Minister and the purchaser.&rdquo; is also vague and I ask the Minister for clarification on those points.</P>

      <P>This point is a complex matter.  Its genesis lies in two outstanding loans to this company, one from the European Coal and Steel Community in 1979 and the other from the ACC in 1993.  The £4.617 million provided for, to which Senator Sherlock drew attention, is the interest accrued.  That is being put into an escrow account in the event of default so the moneys will be there.  The Minister named in the section is the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  It may be a complex mechanism but its purpose is to provide that if they were to default, the loans would revert to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Steel came very close to the precise circumstances Senator Fahey envisages; it might well have happened.  This eventuality was examined carefully.  However, both these loans were guaranteed by the Government.  In that event, I cannot see any way where the Government would not be liable to discharge them in the event of liquidation.  In the case of a formal liquidation and a liquidator being appointed, the normal rules would apply.  However, this guarantee is on the books and it would be difficult to see how these loans could be written off; I do not believe it would be successful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Steel came close to liquidation.  The only reason it did not come about was due to the workforce, management and chairman who took over the handling of the company.  One can get a full settlement of moneys owed in receivership and liquidation situations because a letter of commitment from the State confirms that every pound will be paid.  Could we have saved money if Irish Steel had been liquidated?</P>

      <P>I promised to give Senator Fahey a full answer to that outside the parameters of the Chamber.  If he will meet me for a cup of coffee afterwards I will tell him my views on that issue in some detail but, for the purposes of the record the answer is yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cregan asked whether we would have been better off with a liquidation or receivership.  Much blood was spilt avoiding that situation for a variety of reasons which are well known to <Col N="1783" /> Members.  Liquidation would be an expensive option for the State.  The State has guarantees and the outstanding loan and would consider itself to have a liability to the workers who would be made redundant.  Liquidation would therefore have been a similarly expensive exercise.</P>
    <P>The objective was to maintain employment at Cobh and it has been an extremely difficult objective to realise. One sincerely hopes, now that it has been realised, that everybody engaged in the enterprise at Cobh will make the best of the new situation.  A company of some international standing has taken over Irish Steel and one hopes that everybody will put their shoulder to the wheel to make sure it is a success. Otherwise, it will have been an admittedly painful exercise and an expensive one for the taxpayer, as it has been traditionally. There is no point trying to avoid that answer, but it does have some strategic significance in the Irish economy. The location at Cobh is of some significance for reasons the Senators present will know and the overriding objective was to secure employment. Happily, that has been done, but it clearly has been done at a price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>When discussing the payments of money and agreements on shares and loans, we should remember the amount of rationalisation which took place.  The Minister is well aware of the arguments which took place in SIPTU and other trade unions about rationalisation.  It baffles and annoys me that we tried to get an agreement to ensure the workforce did not have to leave but they still had to leave.  People who were committed to Irish Steel for a long time are now working harder and for less money than they were getting two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are handing over something that has been the subject of expenditure and rationalised and upgraded to such an extent that it will be a plant of high technical advancement for the future.  I am delighted with that, but I do not want to <Col N="1784" /> welcome it without mentioning the loss of the workforce in Cobh and other parts of the region.  These people put much into Irish Steel over the years and have ended up with less because other people can dictate to us.</P>
    <P>We would have been in a marvellous position last March or January if we could have spent another £7 million or £7.5 million to ensure the proper thing was done.  Last October, November and December we had to come up with the idea to get a proper deal and we needed to spend another £7.5 million because somebody else said we could not get a deal.  It annoys me that so many people had to lose their jobs or work more hours for less money than they were earning two years ago.  It is a sad reflection on us that we could not see that in the future.  It should go not unsaid.  It is a bad situation that we had to spend so much money just to please somebody else and not just the work force.</P>

It is not the most pleasant job in the world at the best of times.  It is a difficult task and the workers concerned made significant sacrifices, which should be acknowledged.  It is probably appropriate to mention that the management of the enterprise may not always have been as good as one might have liked. However, that is history now and it is fair to say that the rationalisation which took place was necessary if we were to make Irish Steel an attractive proposition for the kind of leading international company that is coming in there now.  I hope the synergy of the local workforce and a company of international standing will mean that the exercise will have been worth while.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the protection of the workforce, which is very important in light of what has happened in Irish Steel over the years. I want to ask a few questions to ensure the staff generally are well protected. There is a danger here, of which Senator Sherlock will also be conscious, in the use of the word &ldquo;trustees&rdquo;.  While in theory the word &ldquo;trustees&rdquo; sounds very well, there are situations throughout the country and in local communities where trustees dictate and the general group may not have a say.</P>
      <P>It is agreed that £628,000 will go into the pension fund.  I would have been delighted if some of the £7 million could have gone into it.  We discussed the protection of the 300 staff on Second Stage and we were promised that it would be itemised on Committee Stage.  Is there a commitment over a five year period as regards the pensions and protection of the 300 people working there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The moneys we are talking about are designed to make up a shortfall or deficit in the staff pension fund.  It covers only the segment of the workforce in the staff category, not the workforce generally.  The reason the moneys will be paid to the trustees is to draw a distinction between the trustees and Irish Steel/ISPAT.  The moneys will not be paid to the company Irish Steel/ISPAT but to the trustees, who will invest that money on behalf of the members of the staff pension fund. Senator Cregan asked about assurances. All existing liabilities and commitments will be honoured by ISPAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of my queries may have been raised already.  I will avail of the opportunity to ask about the five year period.  I take it that with the record of ISPAT in the international <Col N="1786" /> business world, the investment in Irish Steel at Cobh and the retention of 300 jobs there is not for a five year period but long-term.  I would like to have it confirmed that it is a long-term investment because the question of five years could create some confusion.</P>
      <P>On section 5 the explanatory and financial memorandum states:</P>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to enable the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to make a once off payment [of £628,000] to the trustees of the staff pension fund of Irish Steel Limited in respect of a deficiency identified during the due diligence process.</P>
      <P>That should be explained.  I do not understand much of this terminology but I would like to know what transpired in that due diligence process that resulted in a shortfall of £628,000 which the State has to pay to the trustees.  I have no objection to that but these matters need to be clarified before the Bill is passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are very welcome. The sum of £628,000 being paid as a result of a deficiency identified during the due diligence process is questionable.  Irrespective of whether people are staff or general operatives they are workers. Senator Sherlock may not agree with me but, looking at the section, a commitment was given that 300 staff would be guaranteed work over a five year period.  I am not saying that it should only be five years because, as I said on Second Stage, I want to see 400 or 500 people working there after five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can it be said by virtue of the section that we are availing of these avenues? Because of Irish Steel Limited's deficiencies in not paying £628,000 by a due date, can the staff avail of AVCs? While staff members are paying tax and <Col N="1787" /> general operatives may not be, can we, with the Minister for Finance, provide an opportunity to see what benefits can be given to these people seeing we will be giving it to the company?</P>
    <P>We cannot give the staff or workers shares now because we are selling all the shares.  Every avenue should be opened to see whether money paid out on our behalf can be used for tax benefits or AVCs.  I do not know how many staff are involved in the pension fund, but can they avail of the extra 15 per cent per year to gain the tax relief on it?  That would be very helpful and they should be advised about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sherlock is right.  The intention is clearly that the new arrangement being entered into is not merely for a period of five years, but five years is the period to which ISPAT is contractually bound in terms of maintaining a certain level of employment and honouring certain conditions and commitments.  It is the intention of both contracting parties that it will, hopefully, be the beginning of a new existence for Irish Steel and a productive and profitable one for all concerned.</P>
      <P>I understand Senator Sherlock's concerns that this should be spelt out.  He has made representations to me on a number of occasions on behalf of Irish Steel workers during the crisis there.  I understand the wish of people in Cobh to be assured, in so far as anybody can be assured, that their future employment is secure.  If a company with the reputation of this one cannot carve out a niche in world markets, as well as the ceilings provided for within the European Union, then it is unlikely that any other arrangement could do so.

    <P>Senator Sherlock asked about due diligence.  This is part of the normal professional procedure required in the purchase of an undertaking of this size.  The professional people were sent in to ensure that everything was as it seemed <Col N="1788" /> and that there were no pitfalls.  A deficit in the staff pension fund was uncovered. I am not sure precisely why it arose but unfortunately, it is not uncommon, especially where the trustees are not broadly representative, as Senator Cregan said, of the members of the pension fund, it is simply not funded by default. It is an expensive item and a company living under some financial strictures finds it a convenient way of avoiding making a payment sooner than they have to.</P>
    <P>I do not think the money being injected here has any significance other than making up that shortfall.  The AVC facility to which Senator Cregan adverts is not relevant in this context.  However, if the Senator thinks he has stumbled on something that can make it more tax efficient for those concerned, I would be happy to take expert advice on it.  My opinion is that this is no more than bringing the fund up to the level it ought to have been at, and that members of the pension fund will benefit from that in accordance with the pension scheme's rules when the time comes.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's reply and I know he is well informed about pension structures.  The word &ldquo;trustees&rdquo; worries me.  I would be the first to ensure that every employee is properly covered because it is so important for their future employment. Perhaps we could insert a wording that would grant protection to the staff generally rather than to the trustees of the staff pension fund.  Could we say payment &ldquo;to the staff pension fund&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;to the trustees of the staff pension fund&rdquo;?  We should not be afraid to look at that area because trustees can take control.  We have seen that happen in many areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seeing that money is being paid in because of past deficiencies, can we make sure that every possible tax benefit is granted?  Obviously, if we are paying money into a tax fund it is divided by the number of staff who are there. While they may not be able to avail of it for 1994 or 1993 or since the deficiency <Col N="1789" /> occurred, I see no reason if the Bill is passed before the start of the new tax year, why the staff cannot avail of the AVCs for 1995.  We should not be afraid to examine this opportunity, particularly for 1995, provided of course that the legislation is enacted before the end of this tax year.</P>
    <P>I might be going too far here; I hope not because I do not want to insult anybody in Irish Steel.  But for far too long there was a situation where a few were dictating to the staff pension fund rather than to the trustees of the staff pension fund.</P>

      <P>I can reassure Senator Cregan.  I have expressed my view on the question of the AVC's and if it is otherwise I will come back to him on that.  In regard to the trustess in this case, we are talking about a very small number of people and the trustees are representative of the people concerned. The terms of the pension scheme itself and the general provisions circumscribing it provide that the money must be invested for the purposes stated by the trustees.  There is no question but that the benefit will go as intended.  The purpose is to make up the shortfall.</P>

The money is going toward that purpose.</P>

      <P>I cannot let this opportunity pass without saying in a lighthearted way that I recall some years ago bringing in legislation to make some minor changes which involved a minor transfer from the public to the private sector.  The Minister tore me apart for this minor change.  I have to smile when I see the Programme for Government which states that this Government will retain majority State ownership in State companies. It also states that change in State companies will be managed in the best interests' of the employees.  I cannot let the opportunity pass without complimenting the Minister.  The wheel has turned so much that for the first time an entire State company is being transferred from public to private ownership. I wish Irish Steel, its management and its employees a bright and sucessful future under new ownership.  I agree with much of what Senator Cregan said. Irish Steel will have a very bright and successful future.</P>

      <P>I wish to make one brief comment.  We have followed the debate all the way along over the last few years.  Let there be no doubt about the fact that the investment in Irish Steel was a good investment by the State.  It is the only steel industry in Ireland and the company has a very diligent workforce.  I am confident that ISPAT will be able to turn around Irish Steel and that the company will be able to harness the proven record of the workers and establish itself a good market. Great credit is due to the Government and in particular to the Ministers, Deputy Richard Bruton and Deputy Rabbitte.  The negotiations were very delicate, with constant British interference and the end result is what we want.</P>

I am saddened in many ways because I was directly involved in the number of <Col N="1792" /> people who lost their jobs in Irish Steel through no fault of their own.</P>
      <P>The Minister, the Minister of State and the staff of the Department deserve credit and should be complimented for the way they handled this delicate matter, particularly last October, November and December.  Many people, including departmental officials and the work force, were worried over the Christmas period about the situation in Irish Steel. I compliment the Minister of State for his thinking in the Bill and I commend all those involved.  I wish the company, ISPAT, and the workers a positive future and I hope the strength of the work force will increase from 300 to 500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments would allow a regional fisheries board to apply to the courts for payment to it of a fine imposed on foot of a summary prosecution under the Bill.  However, the amendments are premature and inappropriate.  They seem to be based on a confusion of different aspects of the Bill and the <Col N="1794" /> enforcement powers available to regional fisheries boards under it and other enactments.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a distinction between the different aspects involved.  These include, first, the powers of the boards under various enactments to take measures to secure the remediation of the polluted waters; second, the general powers of a regional fisheries board under various enactments to prosecute offences involving water pollution and to apply for payment to the board of fines imposed in cases prosecuted by the board; third, the power which will be available to a board under the Bill to take measures to secure the remediation of polluted waters, and, fourth, the prosecution by a board of offences under the Bill and the allocation of fines.</P>
      <P>Regional fisheries boards already have extensive powers under the Water Pollution Acts and the Fisheries Acts to take legal action in relation to incidents of water pollution arising from any source, including emissions from waste activities.  They also have power to seek a court order to require an offender to mitigate or remedy the effects of water pollution and to secure the payment to them of fines imposed under those Acts. Nothing in the Bill seeks to diminish these powers in any way.  Section 58 of the Bill will extend the powers available to regional fisheries boards.  This section provides that, in the event of environmental pollution arising from a waste activity, any person may seek an order from the appropriate court for the remediation by the polluter of the environmental damage.  In the case of proceedings before the High Court, there are no limitations on the cost of remediation measures which may be required by order of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, Senators will note that regional fisheries boards are not authorised under section 11 to initiate summary proceedings for offences under the Bill.  It is not appropriate, therefore, to propose that a board should be empowered to apply for the payment to it of a fine arising from a prosecution taken by another party.  It is for this reason that I <Col N="1795" /> regard the amendments as premature and inappropriate.  I accept there is a strong case for authorising regional fisheries boards under section 11 to take summary proceedings for offences under the Bill and I will give consideration to prescribing regional fisheries boards under section 11 (2) for this purpose. If the boards are so specified, they would automatically be empowered under section 13 to make application to the court for the payment of fines arising from any summary proceedings brought by them under the Bill.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, Senators expressed support for those amendments on the basis that, where a major fish kill or damage to a fishery habitat is caused by the disposal of waste, a fine imposed should be devoted to the reinstatement of the fishery by the regional board.  While I appreciate the underlying concerns of Senators in this regard, I ask the House to note that section 13 is not intended to address the question of remediation of environmental damage caused by waste as this matter is well covered by section 58.  Section 13 relates only to the prosecution of summary proceedings for minor offences and that the maximum fine which may be imposed in such cases is £1,500.  I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The regional fisheries boards have a role to play and the Minister admitted as much in his contribution. They should be in a position to receive payment.  In many cases fisheries boards would be out of pocket, not only from replacing stocks but as a result of investigations and so on.  If we are to take seriously the possibility of waste damaging our waterways, the regional fisheries boards must have a role to play.  In the past regional fisheries boards have had to take local authorities to court for failing to do work.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>In page 19, line 33, after &ldquo;appointment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;stamped with an official seal of the Authorising Authority, Agency and Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to regularise the situation so that somebody in authority has a proper seal of office.  Section 14 (3) states:</P>
      <P>Every authorised person shall be furnished with a certificate of his or her appointment and when exercising any power conferred on him or her by or under this Act,. . . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seeks to have the words &ldquo;stamped with the official seal of the Authorising Authority, Agency or Minister&rdquo; inserted after the word &ldquo;appointment&rdquo;.  Given the difficulties and fears experienced by people, it is important for those acting on behalf of State agencies and others to have a proper official seal.  I am not sure how that operates under similar legislation. Increasing numbers of people are afraid of dealing with authorised persons if they are not sure whether they are officially authorised.  The intention of this amendment is to ensure that everything in this area is clear and transparent. It is very hard to deal with every possibility and eventuality under legislation. However, it is important for people presenting themselves as authorised persons to have proper identification stamped by the authorising authority, <Col N="1798" /> which they must produce on request.</P>
    <P>People need to be sure about those with whom they are dealing.  They must know that the person who presents himself or herself is who he or she claims to be and that he or she has the necessary identification and documentation. Under law such people must produce such documentation if requested. However, what do they produce at present?  The authentic caller will produce authentic identification and that is all right, but it is other circumstances we have to worry about.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take this amendment seriously and consider it favourably.  It would add to the legislation and would demonstrate to the public that when we consider legislation we look at all the eventualities that could arise in its implementation.  I have outlined the intent of the amendment, which was emphasised by Senator Daly on Committee Stage.  There was less need for such identification in the past, but in the times in which we live certification stamped by the agency which the person represents is of vital importance. I hope the Minister will be in a position to respond positively.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 5 would require that a certificate of appointment issued to an authorised person under section 14 of the Bill would be stamped with the official seal of the authorising authority, agency or the Minister.  While I understand the intent, I do not propose to accept the amendment for practical reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the practice for a Minister, the agency and in many cases local authorities to seal a certificate of appointment for an authorised person with the relevant official seal, but it is not a legal requirement.  In the case of a local authority such a requirement might cause practical difficulties in situations where it was necessary to appoint an authorised person as a matter of urgency.  The <Col N="1799" /> affixing of the seal of a local authority requires the presence and signature of the chairman or a member of the authority. It is not, therefore, a procedure which could apply in an urgent situation.</P>
    <P>There is no precedent in environmental or fisheries legislation for the proposed amendment.  I am satisfied that it would not meaningfully strengthen the provisions of the Bill with regard to the appointment of authorised persons and it could inadvertently cause difficulties.

      <P>In page 25, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) The Agency or a local authority shall as soon as may be after the conviction of a person, publish a list of convicted persons in a newspaper circulated in the area, giving details and fines imposed.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is very important.  It is the only way in which successful outcomes of prosecutions can be dealt with. The amendment proposes that the agency or local authority should publish a list of convicted persons in a newspaper circulated in the area giving details of the fines imposed.  The legislation provides that the relevant local authority or agency inform other agencies, but that is too loose.  We cannot have a situation where a local authority <Col N="1800" /> or agency might not know about somebody who has been convicted in an adjoining area.  We have seen the consequences of that.</P>
    <P>I doubt that the provision in the legislation will work in practice.  Some officials will send a formal letter to a neighbouring authority and will ensure that the letter goes directly to the recording secretary.  However, others might simply pick up the telephone and convey the information verbally.  The provision is too loose; we cannot be sure that it will be implemented.  If we are to implement this legislation, information about somebody who is convicted and fined for an offence should be made known.  We do not want that person to be able to commit a similar offence or conduct similar activities again in an area under an adjoining authority or agency.  In order to deal with such a situation we must ensure that information about somebody who is convicted of and fined for an offence under this legislation is made known.  A proper structure to make such information known must be put in place.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill is not specific. Section 18 (6) states:</P>
    <P>. . . . . the Agency or the local authority, as the case may be, shall, as soon as may be after the conviction of the person, inform each local authority or, as the case may be, each other local authority and the Agency of the fact that the person has been so convicted, giving such details, as it thinks appropriate, of the nature of the offence.</P>
    <P>That wording will not secure the desired effect.  This amendment will enhance the legislation in that context.</P>

      <P>This amendment would require the agency or a local authority to publish details of persons convicted of offences under the Bill in a newspaper circulating in the relevant area.  I do not propose to accept the amendment. <Col N="1801" /> I agree that the publication in the press of details of convictions would have a deterrent effect on offenders. However, it is undesirable to impose an unnecessary and costly obligation on the prosecuting bodies concerned.</P>
      <P>Normal press reporting arrangements for court proceedings will apply in relation to offences under the Bill. Section 19 requires local authorities and the agency to maintain a register for the purposes of the Act which will be open to public inspection.  The Minister will prescribe the matters to be contained in these registers and it is the intention that details of all successful prosecutions initiated would be specified in the registers. It is our intention that details of all successful prosecutions initiated would be specified in the registers.  Accordingly, this information would be available to the public, including members of the press.  It will be open to the local and national press to publish whatever information they consider relevant.  I consider that the proposed amendments are unnecessary and I ask for them to be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I accept the point about the register which is part of the legislation.  Cost should not be an issue if somebody whom the authorities did not know had been convicted and fined reoffends.  The person's conviction should be made known in an advertisement in the local newspapers.  It is in the public's interest to protect wastelands, waterways and the environment; therefore they must know that a person operating in their area was convicted. Concerned citizens will then watch those individuals even if they are not authorised to do so.  This may stop them from reoffending.  The opportunity provided in the legislation for local authorities and agencies to be informed is not sufficient.  It is just as important for names to be published as it is for people to be convicted.  Since people move about, there is an onus on local authorities and agencies to publish the names of those convicted and fined in <Col N="1802" /> the local newspapers.  That might be as good as a conviction.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 27, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) failure by a local authority to make a plan as may be prescribed within the time set down shall be reported by the Minister to both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister must deal with certain provisions in legislation once it is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, the Houses of the Oireachtas are excluded after that and the Minister is not legally entitled to report back to them.  The implementation of the legislation is important as far as the Houses are concerned.  While it is our primary function to legislate, it is also important to know how it operates.  We should include a provision that the Minister of the day must report back to the Houses of the Oireachtas, which can then decide if amending legislation is necessary. Some time ago, for example, a Bill dealing with drainage works by the Office of Public Works was passed, but within months we had to introduce further legislation to amend it.  I am sure a lot of legislation is difficult to implement, but the Houses of the Oireachtas may not be aware of that unless someone brings it to their attention. The Minister should be responsible for reporting back to the Houses.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with the failure of a local authority to make a waste management plan.  If a local authority fails to make a plan, which is specified in legislation, it should be reported to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There seems to be confusion about this issue because some local authorities have already drawn up waste management plans.  If local authorities fail to make such a plan, it should be reported to the Houses so that we can deal with it.</P>

      <P>I have given a good deal of consideration to this matter, which was debated at length on Committee Stage. I cannot accept the amendment because it seeks to impose on the Minister an inappropriate supervisory and reporting function in relation to the actions of individual local authorities.  It is inconsistent with the general framework for enforcement of environmental protection legislation and, in particular, the statutory role of the Environmental Protection Agency in relation to the performance of functions by local authorities.</P>
      <P>During the discussion on Committee Stage the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, set out in detail the supervisory role of the Environmental Protection Agency under section 63 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, which gives the agency significant powers to ensure the satisfactory performance by local authorities of their statutory functions in relation to environmental protection.  This clearly includes functions imposed under this Bill.  It would not be appropriate to interpose the Minister between the agency and local authorities in relation to this specific function.  There is no precedent for such a provision in relation to any obligation imposed upon a local authority and I am, therefore, unable to accept the amendments.  Contrary to assertions by Senator Fitzgerald during Committee Stage, I am informed there is no provision in the Harbours Bill, 1995, equivalent to the proposed amendment.  I ask for the amendment to be withdrawn.</P>

    <P>I understand the explanation given by the Minister of State to some extent.  I also appreciate the involvement of the <Col N="1804" /> Environmental Protection Agency and I was present in the Chamber when that legislation was debated at length.  I agree with the Minister of State that we do not want too much cross involvement or undue interference.  However, I am worried we could have a situation where independent republics would deal with matters for a long time before they would come before the Houses of the Oireachtas, which would cause major damage.  While I appreciate what the Minister said, this legislation is letting local authorities off the hook to some extent.  However, I accept he has difficulties with this and he cited the Environmental Protection Agency as having a role in that area.</P>

      <P>This is a very realistic amendment which asks the Environmental Protection Agency to make a national plan inside a specific period of not later than one year, which is a reasonable period. Unless the Minister of State has a good reason why that should not be the case, it should form part of the legislation. We must attach a time scale to the provisions we legislate for, otherwise we could be here every day until midnight passing reams of legislation which would be left in the various Departments. It is important to set targets and deadlines for legislation which covers the environment, waste management and so on, in particular.  One year seems a realistic deadline.</P>

It is a very sensible amendment because unless we decide a time scale for tackling this problem, which will require a great deal <Col N="1805" /> of courage and decisiveness, we will avoid the issue until we are forced to deal with it.

      <P>This amendment seeks to impose a time limit of one year with regard to the making of the national hazardous waste management plan by the Environmental Protection Agency. While I appreciate the sentiment underlying this amendment, I am not prepared to accept it as it would be unduly restrictive.  A period of one year would not be adequate for the making of the national hazardous waste plan.  This plan will be very detailed and extensive in its scope and will require considerable research, public consultation procedures and input from various sources.</P>
      <P>A minimum time scale of 16 to 18 months will be involved in the making of the national plan.  It will involve the request for tenders, selection of consultants, preparation of a draft plan, carrying out of necessary public consultations, revision of the draft plan as a result of those consultations and the making of the final plan by the agency. It is a detailed and lengthy process and it would be impractical to accept the amendment, although the sentiments behind it are laudable.  Reasonable time must be allowed to complete these processes, having regard to the extensive planning process involved.  It will take 18 months and there is little merit in seeking to impose a rigid one year time scale or any other rigid deadline.  If there is undue delay on the part of the agency in making a plan, it will of course be open to the Minister to intervene and force the pace by prescribing a final date under section 26(1).  I ask, in view of this information, for the amendment to be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I understand the difficulty of drawing up a national plan, which is a major task.  However, if a deadline is not imposed, this or another Minister will be rapped over the <Col N="1806" /> knuckles &mdash; possibly from outside the State &mdash; in regard to this matter.  I tabled this amendment in order to ensure we keep our house in order.  The whole area of the environment and hazardous waste plans will become a major issue in future and we cannot take a haphazard approach.</P>
      <P>I regret that when the Minister of State said he could not accept the period of one year, he did not say he would not accept a time longer than 18 months.  In that way he would have given notice that he is very serious about this matter and will not allow the agency to delay bringing forward this plan within a reasonable time.  I know the Minister will have powers under the Act to intervene, but there should be a deadline.  I understand the difficulties and that matters can drag on, but we must send a message to the agency that we are serious about this legislation. The Oireachtas spent days debating legislation to set up the agency.  There was a great deal of tough talk at that time about how the agency would take over the functions of local authorities and interfere.  I did not see it as interference because local authorities and agencies can be very compatible.</P>
      <P>This legislation states the agency must bring forward a hazardous waste plan but it does not state how long that should take.  That is a mistake and a weakness in the legislation.  I will not press the amendment but I urge the Minister to inform the agency of his intention to invoke the section under which he can intervene if it is not moving fast enough.</P>

    <P>(iv)  state the full grounds of objection and the reasons, considerations and arguments on which they are based.</P>
    <P>(11)  An objection shall be accompanied by such documents, particulars and any other information relating to the objection as the objector considers necessary or appropriate.</P>
    <P>(12)  A person making an objection may request an oral hearing of the objection.</P>
    <P>(13)  Where a request is made for an oral hearing of an objection the Minister shall have an absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing and the Minister shall give notice in writing of that decision to the applicant and the Agency.</P>
    <P>(14)  The Minister having considered any such objection or oral hearing may require the Agency to vary (whether by addition or deletion) a Hazardous Waste Management Plan made by it in such a manner as the Minister may specify or to replace the plan by a new Hazardous Waste Management Plan.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides an opportunity for a person to object to the Minister about the plan.  I have set out a series of avenues a person might take and the objector should make the objection within a period of 21 days.  The objection must be made in writing, should include the name and address of the objector and state the full grounds and reasons for the objection.</P>
    <P>There must be an opportunity for a person to object and make the Minister <Col N="1808" /> aware of the objection.  The Minister must provide for that right in legislation. In all planning situations there is an opportunity for people to object and, in this context, it is proper that the opportunity should be set out in the legislation. The amendment also provides for oral hearings and gives the Minister the power to vary the plan.  It is not unreasonable that legislation should provide an opportunity for a person who feels aggrieved to object.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to introduce provisions whereby a member of the public may submit objections to the Minister in relation to the national hazardous waste management plan to be drawn up by the agency and may request an oral hearing of such objections.  It would empower the Minister to direct that the agency's plans be varied or replaced.  I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the independent status of the agency and its singular expertise for sound environmental management of hazardous wastes, it is not appropriate to provide in this Bill for a system of direct ministerial intervention or oversight of the agency in the performance of its planning functions.  There is provision in section 26 of the Bill for public consultation and input regarding the draft hazardous waste management plan.  Having considered public representations made at that stage, the agency has legitimate discretion in finalising the national plan.</P>
      <P>The Minister is empowered under section 60 to give general policy directions to the agency with regard, among other things, to the making or review of the hazardous waste management plan. This level of ministerial input is adequate and appropriate.</P>

      <P>There may be a difficulty as far as the public is concerned because it is assumed that the agency has all the wisdom and, while it is <Col N="1809" /> obliged to have public consultations, at the end of the day it makes the plan and the ordinary person does not have the opportunity or the structure to make an objection.  While we need agencies, hazardous waste plans and so forth to protect our environment, we also must ensure that the ordinary person has the opportunity to object to some person or body about such plans.  Under the amendment the objection would be made to the Minister, who in the final analysis could ask the agency to vary the plan.  If that is not possible, where is the protection for the person once a plan is made?</P>
      <P>When drafting a county development plan there is a structure to deal with this matter.  Can the Minister show where there is protection for the individual?  Is the individual's right to make a case, other than during consultations before the plan is drawn up, being protected? Is there redress for the individual once the plan has been finalised by the agency?</P>

      <P>In page 43, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d)  not hold, recover or dispose of waste in a manner which causes, or is likely to cause, environmental pollution.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment refers to a local authority. It might appear that the amendment is unnecessary, but there is good reason for proposing it.  Local authorities might believe that they have an extra latitude due to the fact that they <Col N="1810" /> are local authorities.  That should not be the case &mdash; they should not be involved in this matter.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I referred to my local authority, which, as a result of a fire in a meat factory, had to dispose of tons of meat.  It became a major controversy because local people objected. The difficulty was that the manager was on his own and had to act because he was the sanitary officer.  He had no choice and I supported his action at the time, as did many of my colleagues including the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  If he were to do the opposite, which many people thought he should have done, and carry out a holding operation until he had gone through all the processes the danger would have been far greater. He had to act.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation will a local authority be able to dispose of waste in an emergency in the interests of public health, although it could be proven at a later date that the environment was damaged as a result?  We should try to prevent that happening.  This amendment seeks to ensure that local authorities cannot dispose of waste which will damage the environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment and I support the points made by Senator Finneran.  This amendment will not only protect the environment but it will also send a clear message to local authorities that it is unacceptable to deal with waste in a way which could damage it.  The record of most local authorities is abominable in this area.  I am a member of a local authority and the Dunsink tiphead is in my electoral area.  If one asked the people in Finglas if the maintenance and management of that landfill site helped to protect the environment, the answer would be no. An adjoining local authority is the worst polluter of the watercourse running through the area in which I live.  I do not know if the actions of local authorities are dealt with in other legislation, but this Bill is important in that regard.  It has been long awaited not only by local authorities but by residents, although <Col N="1811" /> they have not greeted it with enthusiasm. If we fail to recognise that local authorities are major contributors to pollution in watercourses as a result of the way landfill sites have been managed, we miss the point.</P>
      <P>This is a good amendment.  If the Minister is not willing to accept it, perhaps he could indicate that he understands its purpose.  As a local authority member for 11 years, I know that people are becoming increasingly concerned about the manner in which local authorities do their business.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

However, this amendment would provide that a local authority may not hold, recover or dispose of waste in a manner which causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. The amendment is unnecessary. Section 32 (1) already prohibits any person from holding, recovering or disposing of waste in a manner which causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; is defined in the Interpretation Act, 1937, as any body corporate.  That includes local authorities.  The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in this context includes a local authority, therefore the position is clear in this regard.</P>

      <P>In page 86, to delete lines 39 to 44.</P>
      <P>Section 66 amends the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  I want section 67 (1) deleted because we are letting local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency off the hook.  I do not understand why they should not be liable for injuries caused to any person.  What makes them special in this regard?</P>
      <P>Local authorities and the agency must implement legislation and they have the authority to do certain things.  If they fail to carry out their duties, they should not be protected by legislation from being found guilty and fined.  We are giving out the wrong message to the agency and to local authorities who have a duty to perform.  We should not include provisions, such as those in section 67(1), which exclude them from facing their responsibilities.  I do not understand why we should include provisions to protect people &ldquo;in respect of any injury to persons, damage to property or other loss alleged to have been caused or contributed to by a failure to exercise any power or carry out any duty conferred or imposed on the Agency or local authority by or under this Act&rdquo;.  If we give them powers under this Act, they have a duty to carry them out.  Failure to do so should result in them being charged for negligence or being made to pay for damage or loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are constantly making excuses for agencies and authorities and allowing them to escape the law.  I support this Bill but we take away from it by including such provisions which let certain authorities off the hook.  It is the responsibility of the agency and the <Col N="1813" /> local authorities to implement the powers we confer on them.  If failure to do so results in loss or damage, they should be brought to court and fined.  This is the kind of message we need to send to agencies and local authorities that have responsibility in this area.  We are concerned with the environment and the management of waste.  Derogations should not be the order of the day.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. We should send a clear signal to local authorities.  The message sent to them in section 66 condones their actions, regardless of whether they get it wrong.  The legislation also suggests to those operating waste management facilities that it shall be a good defence to say they have done the best they can. This worries me.</P>
      <P>We have produced a good Bill but if those responsible say they have done the best they can, they will be exonerated from wrongdoing, while section 67 allows for failure on the part of local authorities or the Environmental Protection Agency to comply with the regulations. These are major flaws and will be exploited.  The amendment should, therefore, be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the points raised by Senator McGennis, there are similar provisions in previous legislation to which I will refer later.  I cannot accept this amendment.  Section 67 (1) provides for an essential level of protection for the agency and the local authorities against unwarranted and inappropriate litigation.  The proposed amendment is based on a misunderstanding of the purpose and effect of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 67 (1) does not protect the agency or local authorities from any claims made against them for wrongdoing on their part.  It does not give them immunity against negligent performance of functions or improper activities.  The subsection does not, for instance, give any protection to a local <Col N="1814" /> authority with regard to water pollution or damage to fisheries attributable to the actions of a local authority.  It would remain open for any person to sue the agency or a local authority on these grounds, or on any grounds which demonstrate that a person has suffered personal injury, loss or damage to property as a result of the actions of the agency or an authority.  In such a case, the onus of proof would be on the plaintiff.</P>
    <P>Section 67 (1) provides that the agency or a local authority shall be immune from any legal proceedings arising from an alleged failure to perform its functions under the Act in any specific case.  This provision reflects the broad range of functions under the Bill. If this immunity from legal action was not provided for the agency and local authorities, they could be exposed to an unlimited succession of damaging law suits arising from any incident, personal injury, damage or loss arising from waste activities, even though they had no involvement whatsoever in the activities in question.</P>
    <P>Given the doctrine of joint and several liability which applies in Irish law, they could be joined in any such action and would, in practice, be more accessible to penalty than a polluter.  It would be unfair and inappropriate to penalise these bodies for matters in which they were not involved.  For example, Mr. or Mrs. A hold liquid waste on his or her land or premises.  They dispose of it carelessly on their own land in a manner which pollutes a well owned by Mr. B. The owners have previously committed a criminal offence and have also injured property owned by Mr. B and are open to action for damages.  It would not be reasonable to suggest that the agency or the county council would also be liable for damages suffered by Mr. B.  It would be open to Mr. B to argue, however, that he would not have suffered damage if an authorised officer of the county council had inspected the premises of the polluters, had detected the waste and taken action to remove it from the premises &mdash; it is empowered to do so under section 56.  It is necessary, therefore, <Col N="1815" /> to protect public authorities from being joined in such actions.  This gives rise to the immunity provisions, such as section 67 (1).</P>
    <P>Provisions similar to this section are common in legislation governing the activities of statutory bodies.  Section 15 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, provides for similar indemnification of the agency with regard to duties and functions arising under this Act.  It is important that there be consistency between these two important environmental statutes. There is further recent precedent in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  I ask, therefore, that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>As this is my last opportunity to speak, I wish to clarify a number of issues that arose on Committee Stage. Senator Daly asked if section 9 covered offences committed by a local authority. Local authorities, being bodies corporate, are covered by section 9.  Accordingly, where an offence is committed by an authority with the consent or connivance of a senior officer of that authority, or is attributable to neglect on the part of such a person, that person, as well as the local authority, shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 19, I wish to clarify the position regarding registers to be maintained by the agency and local authorities.  Senators expressed concern that there may be overlap or confusion regarding the registers.  This is not the case.  Section 19 provides for the establishment and maintenance by each local authority and the agency of a register containing such information as may be, from time to time, prescribed by the Minister.  Accordingly, there will be 35 registers in total, one register maintained by the agency and one by each county council and county borough council.</P>
    <P>The registers to be maintained by the agencies, on the one hand, and local authorities, on the other, will contain different information in many respects and will reflect the different functions of <Col N="1816" /> these bodies under the Bill.  The local authority register will contain information relating to the functions of that authority and with regard to certain waste activities carried on in the functional area of that authority.  This might include, for example, information on waste collection permits issued by the authority, by-laws made by they authorities, information on court proceedings, notices served on, or other enforcement actions taken by, the authority.</P>
    <P>Generally, a local authority register will relate to local activities.  On the other hand, the agency register will mainly contain information with regard to the activities of the agency or activities with regard to which the agency has a function.  This might include, for example, information on applications made for waste licenses or applications for consent to import waste.  These activities may be based in any part of the country.  In this respect, the agency register will have a nationwide scope.</P>
    <P>However, the agency's register is not, in any sense, intended as a master register and will not duplicate information already contained in local authority registers regarding the functions of these authorities under the Act.  These arrangements will clearly distinguish between the responsibilities of local authorities and the agency with regard to the keeping of registers, and the information to be contained in the registers maintained by different bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 44 deals with the publication of reports of oral hearings.  On Committee Stage on 21 March, the Minister, in response to a query from Senator Daly, undertook to elaborate on Report Stage on the position regarding publication of the outcome of oral hearings held by the agency under section 42.  I wish to confirm that reports of oral hearings will be published, as is done at present by the agency with regard to oral hearings under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  As is the case under this Act, there is no explicit provision in the Bill for publication of reports of an oral hearing conducted by the agency in <Col N="1817" /> relation to an application for, or the review of, a waste licence.  The agency has indicated, however, that all such reports will be public documents.  When a final decision is made by the agency on the grant or review of a waste licence, a copy of that decision, including the report of any relevant oral hearings, will be available for public inspection. Copies of the reports of oral hearings and decisions of the agency will also be available to the public at a reasonable charge.  It would be possible for the Minister to make regulations under section 45 (2) to require the agency to publish reports of oral hearings but I do not expect that this will be necessary.  No oral hearings have yet taken place with regard to licence applications under the 1992 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember the debate on the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  I am of the opinion that there is a devious reason for inserting such provisions in legislation and that this results from the fear that a local authority or the agency may say in court that the Minister failed to provide it with funds to carry out a certain task. What is wrong with the agency and local authorities being brought to court?  This happens every day with regard to other matters.  I am sure the courts will not find wrongly against local authorities and that they will be as protective of the rights of such authorities as they are of the rights of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsection is a cop out and has more to do with Departments, local authorities, the agency and funding than with anything else.  I am sceptical when such a provision is included in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  In many cases local authorities have said they polluted rivers because the Department of the Environment failed to give them the necessary funds for treatment plants or to rectify other factors which contributed to the pollution. To some extent there is a collusion and a conspiracy in this regard, although I am not saying that the Minister <Col N="1818" /> is part of this.  I believe this angle is considered when legislation is drafted.</P>
    <P>However, everybody should be dealt with equally under the law.  Under the Bill an ordinary citizen may be fined up to £25,000, but it is extraordinary that cases cannot be taken against Dublin Corporation, Roscommon County Council and the Environmental Protection Agency where injury or damage to property is involved.  If cases could be taken against them, the courts would find in their favour if they were in the right.  Such a provision has been included in a great deal of legislation and we should get away from this practice. Legislative provisions should apply equally to everybody, including local authorities and statutory bodies.  Local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency should exercise the powers conferred on them and if they do not they should be brought to court.</P>

      <P>A comment made by the Minister earlier provoked a response from me about the manner in which local authorities do their business. Senator McGennis also referred to this.  I now want to make two specific points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 22 requires local authorities to make plans for &ldquo;the prevention, maintenance, collection, recovery and disposal of non-hazardous waste within its functional area&rdquo;.  It is vital that the Department makes additional finance available to local authorities to enable them to implement these plans.  The country is strewn with litter and indiscriminate dumping takes place in our streams and waterways.  This situation is <Col N="1819" /> getting worse and people must be made conscious of the fact that there is a law with which they must comply.  However, first of all local authorities must do their duty.</P>
    <P>One Minister said that an environmental impact study was required for all landfill sites, whereas my local authority was told this is not necessary for sites where the amount of refuse being disposed of is less than 25,000 tonnes. Somebody said that because of the impermeable nature of the soil in the site in my area, lime was not required. We were told there is a major water aquifer under that soil and this has frightened people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It should be brought into operation as soon as it is passed.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my thanks and appreciation to the Ministers of State, Deputy Allen and Deputy McManus, and the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  This legislation is important and the key to it is that we have a recycling rate of slightly over 7 per cent. The Minister has set a realistic target of 20 per cent for the year 2001.  I hope by then we will be able to say this legislation has been part of a process which achieved that 20 per cent rate.  If we can do that we will be far closer to European averages, which have been ahead of ours for the past number of years.  I congratulate the Minister's officials on the work they have done preparing this legislation and Members who contributed to Committee and Report Stage.</P>

We are dealing with an important issue and this Bill is necessary if we are to do our job correctly.  I hope that when the Bill is passed local authorities and those involved in the protection of our environment will do the right thing.  After all, the enactment of this legislation is only the beginning of waste management.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned, a seminar on waste management was held in County Cork and a plan was drafted.  Recycling and packaging must be done in such a way as to minimise the number of landfill sites.  However, we cannot do without landfill sites, which, like so many other things, nobody wants on their doorstep because we are not that careful in disposing of waste and we like to dump it on the local authority.  People in an area, including farming organisations, must agree on the location of a landfill site, but that is not easily done.  I thank everyone involved in drafting this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome this legislation, it falls short of what is necessary to achieve the targets mentioned.  I believe 20 per cent is a small target in relation to the reduction of waste.  The thrust of the legislation deals with the reduction of and reusing and recycling waste.  I support Senator Sherlock's point about local authorities, which was dealt with in amendment No. 67 tabled by Senator Finneran.  Unless local authorities are properly financed many things will not be done.  The policing of polluters will not occur unless sufficient resources and staff are made available to local authorities.  My constituency would mirror that of Senator sherlock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, I picked up a canvass card which was four years old.  My local authority does not have the manpower, staff or resources to ensure that litter is picked up.  It would be interesting if residents were to take cases against local authorities because of the filthy condition of housing estates in Dublin and probably in most urban areas.  I was not <Col N="1821" /> joking when I said that a canvassing card had been lying on the ground for four years.  I do not apportion blame to this or any other Government, but local authorities have been under financed by all parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not mine.  Perhaps the Minister can reassure me about the financial implications of such legislation. Far from getting extra funds, the Minister said regulatory costs will be recouped from local authorities and the commercial waste sector.  That means local authorities will have to contribute financially to the implementation of this legislation, including the policing necessary to ensure it does the job the Government intends.  We have no chance of achieving the high ideals of this legislation &mdash; I do not say that in a disparaging way &mdash; at local authority level.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the legislation, local authorities must receive funding.  It may be necessary to oversee that funding to ensure it is correctly spent, because those of us who are local authority members have doubts as to whether money is spent in the correct areas. Such money is not being spent on litter collection or on the management of tips. If local authorities do not get extra funding, there is little chance of County Dublin and elsewhere being tidied up.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators who participated in the debate. I was not the creator of the Bill, but I had to carry it through Committee Stage in the Dáil and Seanad, where well informed comments were made and probing questions were asked.  I compliment everyone on the work done.  Over the years there has been a conflict between industrial development and environmental protection which would not have occurred had this legislation been in place.  This legislation, along <Col N="1822" /> with the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, will deal with emissions and encourage recycling.  They will reduce an unnecessary conflict between industrial development, jobs and the environment.  As Senators will know, controversies arose in Cork because of the absence of such legislation.</P>
      <P>This legislation will help those on both sides of the argument.  Industrialists will have to abide by the rules, while environmentalists will know there are laws to protect their interests.  We are all interested in a clean environment. While legislation is important, so too is education.  I despair when I see the condition of our streets.  Local authorities and the public, particularly parents, have a responsibility in this regard.  We can now get on with creating jobs, while protecting the environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed regulations would be made under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979, and their purpose is to reduce the financial contribution by the farming community towards the cost of the bovine TB and <Col N="1823" /> brucellosis eradication schemes by £18 million.</P>
      <P>Bovine disease levies were introduced here in 1979 under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979, to secure a financial contribution from the farming community towards the cost of the TB and brucellosis eradication programmes. Under that Act, <i>inter alia</i>, a levy was imposed on all cattle slaughtered in the State, on live exports from the State and on each gallon of milk delivered for processing.  Currently farmers contribute some £28 million annually by way of levy to the operational cost of the bovine TB and brucellosis programmes.  The Exchequer carries the balance of the operational costs as well as the costs of salaries of administrative, veterinary, technical, laboratory and clerical staff.</P>
      <P>The current rates of levy, generating the aggregate £28 million are £7.30 per animal slaughtered or exported live and 1.3p per gallon of milk delivered.  The proposed draft regulations to reduce the bovine levies from 1 April next to £2.50 per animal exported or slaughtered and to 0.5p per gallon of milk delivered, which seek to generate an aggregate amount of some £10 million, are now before this House for approval.  This levy reduction of almost two-thirds is proposed in the context of the major restructuring of the operation and financing arrangement of the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes which I am putting in place on 1 April.</P>
      <P>The TB eradication scheme has been in operation in Ireland since 1954.  The scheme succeeded in reducing the endemic levels of disease in the national herd and currently some 99.5 per cent of cattle are free of TB.  The country was declared officially brucellosis free in April 1986 and currently 99.7 per cent of the country's herds are free of that disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1954 total expenditure on both schemes has exceeded £1 billion.  The total cost of the schemes in 1995 was £67 million, of which about £20 million, was <Col N="1824" /> spent under each of the headings, testing, compensation and administration with the balance on operational aspects. Since the disease levies were introduced, farmers have contributed about £285 million while £16 million has been received from the EU veterinary fund. Most of the EU funding received relates to the brucellosis scheme rather than the TB scheme, for which we have received minimal EU funding to date.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this major expenditure, we have not, unfortunately, made progress in reducing the residual level of TB over the past 30 years.  While the country was declared officially brucellosis free in 1986, and notwithstanding various intensive programmes over recent years, there are a number of areas where there is still some infection and over 400 herds were restricted in 1995.</P>
    <P>As regards TB, the House will be aware that, under ERAD, an intensive testing programme was undertaken under a four year programme aimed at reducing the incidence by 50 per cent. Unfortunately, this did not happen for a variety of reasons.  The main conclusion from the ERAD experience is that eradication of TB is more difficult than had been envisaged.  Indeed, the consensus now is that while some progress can be made, final eradication will be possible only when new diagnostic tests, vaccines for wildlife and movement control arrangements are in place.  Until these are developed to practical field application, the emphasis must be to contain and hopefully reduce the disease and costs of programmes.</P>
    <P>Under current trading rules, it continues to be necessary to operate annual programmes for these diseases which are costly both to farmers and taxpayers and which cause particular difficulties and hardship for some farmers whose herds break down.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the operational aspects of both schemes have remained largely unchanged down the years.  The House will also be aware that over the years a number of attempts were made to change the testing <Col N="1825" /> arrangements but these were resisted, mainly by the veterinary profession. Following on from the IVU's rejection of rotational testing last year, both the Government and the farming bodies considered that the continuation of the <i>status quo</i>&mdash; involving ongoing and escalating costs for farmers and taxpayers &mdash; was not an acceptable option for the future.  Consequently, during 1995, I reviewed the measures that should be introduced from 1996 to improve their effectiveness while at the same time moderating their overall costs.  The review was undertaken initially in consultation with the farming organisations which together with the Government provide the funding for the schemes and I announced the outcome of this review in November last in the Dáil, to the farming bodies and Irish Veterinary Union.</P>
    <P>The central aspects of the proposals were as follows: the orderly annual testing of the national herd and/or designated categories of animals, with primary responsibility for arranging testing, negotiating terms and paying for certain tests being devolved to farmers; follow up and focused strategic testing, including use of blood testing in certain circumstances; a quality control programme; a comprehensive programme to expedite the lifting of movement restrictions on certain herds; a comprehensive research programme aimed at preventing TB spread by wildlife; improved epidemiology and feedback to farmers; continuation of research on developing blood tests, vaccines and other technological tools required to improve effectiveness of programmes; a rearrangement of funding, with levies to be substantially reduced and receipts to contribute to compensation on an agreed basis; the establishment of a national forum comprising representatives of the main farming organisations, the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Finance and the veterinary unions to advise and make recommendations to me on the operation of <Col N="1826" /> the schemes and, finally, abolition of the compulsory two month pre-movement test.</P>
    <P>The arrangements envisaged a partnership approach to implementing and overseeing the operation of the new arrangements at national and local levels. Farmers would have greater direct involvement and responsibility under revised and more effective measures.  In particular, farmers would choose practitioners to carry out the first tests on their herds each year and negotiate and pay practitioners for such work, assist the Department in research work into disease spread by wildlife and have responsibility for protecting their own herds and, in particular, for deciding whether to buy in cattle which have been tested before movement and whether to test them after purchase.</P>
    <P>Together with the revised operational arrangements, I proposed an intensification of control measures, a more focused approach to tackling infection, a continuation of research and a rearrangement of the financing of the operational aspects of the schemes.  As indicated, farmers would engage and pay practitioners directly for the first tests on their herds each year; as these costs have been borne from central funds to which farmers contributed, the disease levies would be reduced to about £10 million a year from the first full year of operation of the new measures.  Thereafter, compensation costs would be shared by the Exchequer and farmers.</P>
    <P>In overall terms, total costs to be borne by the farmers would be moderated while some savings would also accrue from the discontinuation of the 60 day compulsory pre-movement testing requirement for internal movement. Apart from there being a reduction in overall costs, there would also be a fairer burden sharing of costs between farmers.  Under the current arrangements, levies are borne by farmers who supply milk, finish cattle and whose cattle are exported live.  Under the new regime, all farmers would contribute towards the costs of the measures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1827" /> Since November, the proposals have been refined following detailed discussions with the farming bodies and the Irish Veterinary Union.  All the main farming bodies have indicated that they are broadly supportive of the refined proposals.  Likewise, the IVU membership has voted to implement the revised arrangements.  It may be the first time in the history of the scheme that the IVU has agreed to proposals as innovative as these and I publicly thank it for accepting them.</P>
    <P>There is a new way forward for this programme.  If we can achieve proper co-operation from all the sectors concerned, we can go a long way towards eradicating TB and what remains of brucellosis in the next five years.  We have established the forum that was demanded for so long and, through it, I hope there will be the impetus and cooperation to ensure we have an effective programme that will clear out the residual TB levels that still remain in our national herd.</P>
    <P>The forum, which comprises of representatives from the four main farming organisations and the three veterinary unions which met for the first time today, has a major role to play in overseeing implementation of the new arrangements and in reviewing their operation.  I also consider that all parties have a contribution to make in ensuring the effectiveness of the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I commend the motion to this House so that the disease levies can be reduced as follows: in animals slaughtered or exported live from £7.30 to £2.50 per head and in milk delivered for processing from 1.3p to 0.5p per gallon. The intention is that these rates will apply from 1 April 1996 to coincide with the introduction of the new arrangements for the disease schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a similar debate in regard to another levy some time ago. I am not entirely happy with this new bovine disease eradication scheme. Farmers will have to pay more, irrespective <Col N="1828" /> of what the Minister or the Minister of State thinks.  Under this scheme, farmers will have to pay their vets annually for these tests and will also have to pay levies.</P>
      <P>I do not mind paying levies if they help keep these diseases outside the farm gate.  However, this will not be the case.  There have been more frequent outbreaks of TB and brucellosis in my locality than there was three or four years ago.  The Minister said that 400 herds were depopulated in 1995 because of brucellosis.  Some herds, including my own, were depopulated in 1994.  I know about the hardship experienced by any farmer who has to depopulate their herds because of these diseases.  The compensation paid by the Department is completely inadequate.</P>
      <P>There is currently great concern about BSE.  However, a farmer who has an animal infected with BSE will get greater compensation than one with brucellosis or TB and that is wrong. Some farmers who have animals infected with brucellosis were not inclined to sell them to the Department but then an animal infected with BSE was found in the herd.  How did that animal turn up so conveniently?  It was surprising that it had not been noticed before the animal with brucellosis was detected.  The Department has many questions to answer as regards the eradication of bovine diseases &mdash; TB, brucellosis or BSE.  I do not like referring to BSE because it has had a terrible effect on our beef industry.  I do not think there is any BSE in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In every profession there will always be some people who will not abide by the rules.  The use of angel dust is wrong and it should be stopped.  I condemn its use.  One farming organisation was silent on that issue but it welcomes this scheme which I do not think is a good one.  It has lost sight of complete eradication. The abolition of the pre-movement test is a disaster for the eliminating of bovine diseases.  In his speech, the Minister said there will be an&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1829" /> abolition of the compulsory two month pre-movement test.</P>
    <P>The arrangements envisaged a partnership approach to implementing and overseeing the operation of the new arrangements at national and local levels.  Farmers would have greater direct involvement and responsibility under revised and more effective measures.  In particular, farmers would choose practitioners to carry out the first tests on their herds each year and negotiate and pay practitioners for such work; assist the Department in research work into disease spread by wildlife; . . . . .</P>
    <P>I agree with that.  However, the Minister then said that farmers should &ldquo;have responsibility for protecting their own herds and in particular for deciding whether to buy in cattle which have been tested before movement and whether to test them after purchase.&rdquo; He also said that &ldquo;In overall terms, total costs to be borne by farmers would be moderated while some savings would also accrue from the discontinuation of the 60 day compulsory pre-movement testing requirement for internal movement.&rdquo; That is a complete contradiction. The Minister is first saying that farmers are responsible for protecting their herds, particularly for deciding whether to buy in cattle which have been tested before movement and later says that they would make a saving because they do not have to pay for a pre-movement test.  I would not buy cattle unless they passed a pre-movement test.  The abolition of this test spells disaster.</P>
    <P>I have no problem paying levies if the disease stays outside my farm gate and I sure other farmers feel the same way. We must pay the vet now and, as I mentioned on the last occasion, the vet must pay 21 per cent of his fee in VAT to the Government.  When we are paying the vet, we are paying the Government VAT.  It is a saving for the Government and the Exchequer but not for the farmers.</P>
    <P>The three month test has been abolished and farmers asked to carry out <Col N="1830" /> their own test.  I got a communication from the Department last week saying I must carry out a test.  I agree with the test and I hope it will continue.  I mentioned previously that an animal might not be tested for two years and I explained how this might occur.</P>
    <P>An animal could be tested in my herd in January 1994.  A couple of months later I could sell it to a farmer who may not require a test until December 1995. I received a notice saying I should test between dates in April and May.  The farmer to whom I sell the animal might not be scheduled to test until two years later or he may have been scheduled to test a month before my test.  The animal would not then be tested for almost two years and could still be infected with tuberculosis or another disease and spread it.</P>
    <P>The scheme is too loose.  It does not convince me or all the farming organisations. I know of one such farming organisation but it is obvious that it is loyal to the Minister and Fine Gael and would not go against them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The BSE scare is most serious.  What is the Government doing about it? There is an urgent need and onus on the Government to explain in clear language the excellent health of the Irish beef herd.  It has always been healthy.  The Commission in Brussels decided to ban all UK beef and this can have a knock on effect.  However, it is most important that the Irish Government explain and give a clear message that our beef is a disease free source of quality meat. Ireland has a good story to tell in this regard, but the problem is that this message is not getting through to the consumer.  The consumer in the marketplace <Col N="1831" /> is the arbiter of the value and worth of the product.  If the suspicions and concerns of consumers are not cogently and urgently addressed untold damage could be done to our £1.7 billion beef industry.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in Government pursued a clear and determined policy in relation to the food sector and food quality.  A separate food Ministry was established and during our time in Government that Ministry was always headed by its own Minister of State.  That is lacking at present.  The food Ministry was seen as a separate and completely distinct part of an integrated approach to the production and processing of food.</P>
    <P>The approach to BSE of successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Agriculture was always well ahead of what was required by the scientific evidence. Realising that the food industry is based ultimately on the choice and confidence of consumers, our approach in Government was always to put concerns of consumers first and foremost.  The wisdom and worth of the policy pursued by our party in Government is especially evident today.</P>
    <P>In the last two days new circumstances have arisen surrounding BSE in the UK.  The British beef industry is in total crisis.  The excellent health status of our own herd notwithstanding, the extent of public concern is such that there is a grave danger of our industry being brought down in the British quagmire. The first onus on the Government is to address the concerns of consumers at home and abroad about the quality of Irish beef.  We are self sufficient in beef production and the importance of reassuring foreign markets cannot be overestimated.</P>
    <P>In this context I am concerned at the complete silence of the Minister for Health on this issue.  Surely if there is any semblance of an integrated approach to the food industry, and food safety in particular, the Department of Health should be to the fore in reassuring the public on the issue.  In sharp conflict to the situation in Britain, neither <Col N="1832" /> the Minister nor the Department of Health appear to have any role in assuring the public of the health status of Irish food.  There is a food and safety advisory group in the Department of Health and the public have to date heard nothing from it.  Farmers are at risk of becoming the first and most seriously affected victims of the swing away from consumers by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I emphasise that there is a decrease in the consumption of Irish beef in Ireland and this must be addressed by the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>The Government is not adopting the proper measures.  A governmental committee should be established and headed by the Taoiseach.  I do not know how the Taoiseach got on today with his telephone call to Egypt.  At 2 p.m. the telephone call had not been effected.  If it takes 24 hours to effect a telephone call, where are we going?  Are we that slow about an important issue such as three ship loads of cattle waiting to be landed in Egypt?  We read in the newspapers about how the Taoiseach would make the telephone call and it is another example of public relations as highlighted by the present Minister for Agriculture.  It is all very well for the Government to say it is doing this and that and have everybody read it in the newspapers, but there is no action.  We want action.  What action is being taken?  There should be a committee at Government level headed by the Taoiseach to attack this issue.  It definitely should be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason for a lengthy debate on this issue because it has been debated in both Houses over the past four or five months on at least three occasions.  However, I intend to comment on the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The past week in particular has seen much talk about bovine disease.  There has been much misinformation in the media at all levels, which has been very damaging to the beef industry.  This is a serious situation for this country.  We have the best meat in the world.  I have <Col N="1833" /> travelled in most countries and one will not get a steak as good as that which one gets here.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to alter people's perceptions.</P>
    <P>Much of what has been stated on television in respect of BSE is an absolute scandal.  It is time people realised that there are far greater problems in this country than BSE.  We have no BSE in this country because we have dealt with it.  Fair play to the Ministers who went before us; they dealt with it effectively. We have no problem with that.  Unfortunately, however, as far as this scare is concerned, we are getting caught up in this mix across Europe.  The consumer's perception is that beef is a bad product when in fact it is a very nutritious product and is an absolute requirement as far as the population is concerned.</P>
    <P>Consumers here and abroad should be aware of the quality of our beef which is grass led and grass fed.  Ireland is one of the few countries that produces beef at that level.  In the rest of Europe beef is not produced as a grass fed product.</P>
    <P>In discussing this disease we are talking about changes towards new systems and methods.  As far as the new arrangements are concerned, progress was slow particularly in recent years in cleaning up the last residues of TB.  It is a difficult task here and in other countries also.</P>
    <P>The general belief across Europe is that it is physically impossible to completely eradicate TB.  Brucellosis, which like TB is an infectious disease, can be eradicated, but is has proved very difficult to completely eradicate TB in Europe.  Some 99.7 per cent of our national herd is clear of TB.  It is a good level but there must be no further deterioration.</P>
    <P>A new programme is being put into operation and I call on everyone to operate together.  That includes the Department, the vets and the farmers, because no one group can be in control. While serious negotiations have taken place about an aggravated situation, I hope it will have no effect in implementing the programme over the <Col N="1834" /> next few years.  Any deterioration in the incidence of disease would be serious because it is a sensitive area.  The value of beef exports from this county is approximately £2 billion a year, but there is room for improvement because we have the best beef in the world.</P>
    <P>Every speech on TB eradication mentions the fact that the programme began in 1954 and has cost £1 billion.  The contribution made by farmers has been £285 million, while the veterinary fund stands at £16 million.  During that period farmers suffered terrible hardship.  It is a serious situation for a farmer to discover the disease in his herd which must then be impounded.  He cannot sell his calves and cannot operate the farm properly.  Huge losses occur which people outside farming know nothing about.</P>
    <P>Compensation has been paid over the years but it has never been adequate and never will be.  People may complain that the TB eradication scheme has cost £1 billion, but it is good value when one sees what other diseases cost, especially human ones.  It is serious because animal diseases are reflected in human beings.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that &ldquo;Notwithstanding this major expenditure we have not, unfortunately, made progress in reducing the residual levels of TB over the past 30 years&rdquo;.  I cannot fully accept that.  The disease has been kept under control and it is still under control.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued: &ldquo;While the country was declared officially brucellosis-free in 1986, we still have some 400 herds which were restricted in 1995&rdquo;.  Research on TB has never been carried out properly and I accuse the Department of not doing it.  I have been debating this matter since I became a Member of the Dáil in 1977.  It has been stated and restated that the wildlife situation was never properly examined. Unfortunately, the badger is the main culprit as far as a source of the disease is concerned.  This has been proven, but the Department only accepted that fact last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1835" /> The badger population must be controlled but I am not sure how it can be done.  I can assure the House that badgers in my area have TB.  We have examined the situation seriously and we know how to control it.  However, I have never seen any Department official or Minister stating how this matter can be dealt with.  Badgers can freely roam huge areas of the country and when they are on the edge of pastures they constitute a source of infection for herds.  If we are to eradicate the last 0.3 per cent of the disease the badger must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Central aspects of the Minister's proposals include the orderly annual testing of the national herd and/or designated categories of animal.  In addition, primary responsibility for arranging testing, negotiating terms and paying for certain tests is being devolved to farmers. I am prepared to accept this.  We are asking for a reduction in levies but we cannot lose sight of the fact that farmers now pay directly themselves.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the fact that farmers can chose their own vets, but that is not easily done in such situations. A family believes in the family doctor and likewise a farmer believes in his vet. One cannot negotiate with a vet to carry out TB testing and then go to another vet at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning to ask him to help with a cow that has a problem in calving.  That is not on. Farmers stay with one vet and, thus, it is not practically possible to negotiate a price reduction from one vet to another. You will find that most farmers deal with the same vet for testing as for other veterinary functions on the farm.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister refers to the follow up on focus strategy testing including the use of blood testing in certain circumstances.  Where a serious breakdown occurs in an area, not just in a herd, can all blood testing be carried out on all herds in an area?  I ask the Minister because I do not know the technical terms attached to this.  If it is thought that blood testing can be more accurate then it should be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought not.  I checked whether such TB testing had been carried out and I understand it has not.  I agree with carrying out a quality control programme in the case of a serious breakdown in TB.  I have always had the greatest trust in veterinary surgeons. Like every profession there is the odd cowboy around, but there are cowboys in farming also.</P>
      <P>The Minister announced a comprehensive programme to expedite the lifting of the movement restrictions on certain herds.  I am not sure about this point until one is absolutely certain that there are no further sources of infection in the herd.  Before lifting the restrictions on any herd the Minister must make sure that all residues of the infection have been cleared up.</P>
      <P>I agree with the introduction of a comprehensive research programme aimed at preventing TB from spreading via wildlife.  The Department should clearly state what programme it is prepared to put into operation to deal with the source of infection from wildlife.  I also agree with the continued research and development of blood testing, vaccines and other technological tools required to improve the effectiveness of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also agree with the proposal about rearranging the funding, with levies to <Col N="1837" /> be substantially reduced and receipts to contribute to compensation on an agreed basis.  However, I have reservations about the abolition of the compulsory two months pre-movement test. The Department must be very careful in terms of allowing a period of 11 months during which cattle can be moved from one area to another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps.  Unlike most other countries, people in Ireland could move cattle up to five times during the animal's lifetime.  It has been stated that under the system which will be brought into operation it is possible that 16 or 17 months could elapse before a beast is tested if cowboys are allowed to operate in that area.  I attended the vigorous debate regarding the introduction of the pre-movement test.  This test was introduced for the specific reason of stopping cowboys operating with infected herds and I hope its abolition will have the effect desired by the Minister and the Minister of State, which is to improve the situation rather than disimprove it. I ask the Minister of State to closely monitor areas where the pre-movement test operated but will now operate differently to ensure there is no deterioration or further spread of TB.</P>
      <P>I welcome the arrangements and hope they work.  We have reached a stage where we are almost 99.7 per cent free of TB.  It is a difficult disease to eradicate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be in a position to state next year that we are 99.9 per cent free of TB. However, we must be clear that no country in Europe, with the exception of Denmark, has successfully eradicated TB from their herds.  The eradication of the disease is difficult and I hope the new arrangements will work in Ireland. It is a very sensitive issue in a sensitive area and this point was brought home in <Col N="1838" /> recent days regarding the new BSE scare in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the regulations. They are most important and not just from the economic point of view of the spread of tuberculosis and brucellosis to humans.  The eradication of the disease as rapidly as possible is vital, but I take the point that it is almost impossible to eradicate it totally from herds.</P>
      <P>The importance to the consumer of the association of an animal disease with humans has been demonstrated in recent weeks.  Many lessons can be learned from events in recent years and I hope they are applied as urgently as possible.  One of the saddest aspects of current events is that the innocent are going down with the guilty.  This is particularly important in Ireland when our beef and other products from animals are associated with Great Britain and events there.</P>
      <P>Since the war Britain has pursued a cheap food policy and has favoured quantity rather than quality.  This has not been the practice in Ireland and it is most unfortunate that we are included in the British Isles group.  The result is that those who did not feed contaminated food of the most revolting nature to herbivores are finding that their beef is also labelled inferior.  The current situation is also particularly sad for farmers in England who tried to pursue a policy of feeding herbivores grass rather than the extraordinary cattle cake.  They find themselves in exactly the same boat as those who were involved in feeding the cake because there is no evidence there at present of transfer from animal to animal within herds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far back as 1990, in an article in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i>, Dr. Vincent Carroll warned of the possibility of the spread of BSE from animals to humans. While I will not try to prove whether that is happening, we must consider the increase in the number of cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in young people.  This is a serious alarm bell and the reason major efforts must be made <Col N="1839" /> to ensure the prion protein is removed from the food chain as rapidly as possible because no treatment for the disease is available.</P>
    <P>The most worrying aspect at present is how far consumers will expect food producers to go and to what extent they will feel food is endangered.  Dairy products have escaped so far, except those that contain gelatine, such as some yoghurts, desserts and <i>fromage frais.</i> However, it would be most serious if what I term the &ldquo;yuck&rdquo; factor in the production of food regarding the cattle cake feed in Britain spread to the dairy industry also.  Many people will consider the material fed to dairy cows in particular and wonder about the attractiveness of food which contains offal, bones and chicken droppings.  Is it ethically right to feed such food to animals? Many years ago the manager of a co-op in Ireland told me the reason he did not import the cattle cake was that the thought of feeding such material to animals was nauseating to him.</P>
    <P>It is most fortunate that our animals were grass fed over the last few years and there has been such a low number of BSE cases in herds.  Approximately 12 of the 124 cases in Ireland involved animals which were imported.  Therefore, just over 100 cases have appeared in the country over the last eight years and this is a miraculously low level when one considers how high the level was in Great Britain.  I note with interest that some people in Northern Ireland have decided to be Irish.  This is being resisted, but it appears there are other ways, aside from removing the Border, to reunify the country.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous lack of consumer confidence at present and it will not be restored overnight.  However, an accumulation of matters, rather than the existence of a particularly serious problem, has caused this lack of confidence. For example, I do not know how seriously consumers are affected by the giving of hormones, such as testerone injections, to animals.  However, consumers do not want it and that is the <Col N="1840" /> end of the matter.  I do not know how seriously consumers are affected by angel dust, beta-agonists, which can have cardio-vascular effects.  It has serious effects on those using it if they inhale it and people have died from cardio-vascular collapse.  However, if the consumer does not want it, it cannot be there.  Consumers now look at labels and they expect better labelling.  They do not want to consume such substances and this must be the end of the matter if products which are described as clean and green are to be sold.  The effect of a substance does not matter; if the consumer does not want it, it cannot be there.  If consumers do not want antibiotic residues, they cannot be there.</P>
    <P>I was disturbed the other day when the leader of a farming organisation &mdash; I cannot remember which organisation &mdash; said in relation to who would pay the beef intervention fines that it was up to those policing the situation to do so properly because people would try to get away with things if they could.  This attitude will not do.  We must have a situation where Irish farmers can say that people can rely totally on them and if consumers do not want certain substances in products, people can be assured they will not be there.  Those involved in production processes after the animals leave the farms have a very serious responsibility regarding the health status of Irish food.</P>
    <P>I will not rehash the beef tribunal but many matters emerged during it, such as the mislabelling of goods, the repackaging of old meat and forequarter meat replacing extensive hindquarter meat. However, if we are supposed to produce quality products, this type of thing will not do.  I felt particularly sorry for the people who received canned beef under the Russian food aid project.  They were supposed to get best hindquarter beef, but apparently some of the cans contained insides, outsides, knuckles and rumps.  Imagine if one was in Moscow and thought one was getting nice Irish intervention beef but that is what came out when one opened the tin.  Those who received forequarter and heart <Col N="1841" /> were extraordinarily lucky.  This type of thing is unacceptable if we are supposed to produce quality products.</P>
    <P>A major change must be made regarding An Bord Bia.  The people who criticised the composition of the board because it did not include any consumers were right and this should be rectified rapidly.  A food board is not just about the production of food, but rather what the consumer wants to eat. If there is any lesson we should have learned over the last week it is that when the consumer decides they do not want what is being produced, they will not eat it.  The drop in the consumption of beef, even in this country where the level of BSE has been very low, has been staggering.</P>
    <P>I visited Scotland recently and my husband pointed out that the lights in McDonald's and Burger King were going down and signs were being changed.  No matter what habits consumers had in the past, if they lose confidence in a product it is pointless trying to encourage them to eat it.  I do not blame them because I would not eat anything which I felt was bad.  I am delighted the production of vegetables has improved so much in this country. This means that people who are not eating beef at present can be encouraged to eat what is being produced in a good way on most Irish farms.</P>
    <P>I hope confidence will be restored rapidly in Irish beef.  I regret most that the innocent are going down with the guilty.  The people who tried to maintain high standards are being affected in exactly the same way as those who did not do so, whether nationally or internationally. I am sure the Department will make every effort to reassure people about the quality of our produce. However, it is pointless reassuring consumers in that regard if a fresh scam or scandal is exposed a few weeks later and consumers once again discover people tried to get away with whatever they thought possible.  We must show that our policy is to put forward the best quality on the national and international market.  This is the only way the Irish <Col N="1842" /> food business can make further progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Parts of the Minister's statement are in conflict.  The TB eradication scheme has been in operation since 1954 and a vast amount of money has been spent on it.  The Minister said the scheme succeeded in reducing the endemic levels of disease in the national herd and currently 99.5 per cent of cattle are free of TB.  The country was declared officially brucellosis free in April 1986 and currently 99.7 per cent of the country's herds are free of that disease.  However, the Minister also stated that while the country was declared officially brucellosis free in 1986 and notwithstanding various intensive programmes over the years, there is still infection in a number of areas and over 400 herds were restricted in 1995. Why was that large number restricted if progress was made?</P>
      <P>The cost since 1954 of the efforts to eradicate TB and brucellosis in cattle has been one of the greatest scandals ever in this country.  Some people said at the time that it would make the industry but others said that was not the case, that it was Ireland and one could be sure the programme would be abused.  Those people were correct; the programme was abused.  Why is there such conflict between the Irish Veterinary Union and the Department if, as we are told, everything is going well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The beef industry and the food industry in general are two of the main pillars of the economy, providing both direct and indirect employment and playing a central role in our export economy. Consumer confidence is central to the ongoing success and expansion of the industry.  There is plenty of evidence regarding the use of angel dust and the shenanigans revealed during the beef tribunal and most recently the British BSE scare have combined to undermine consumer confidence in Irish beef. Comments I have heard in recent days indicate that this is the case.  Not enough was done to reassure people that there was no reason for fear.  Irish beef is one <Col N="1843" /> of the best products on the market today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>However, this point has not been put across and people do not have sufficient confidence in it. Undoubtedly, there are a handful of unscrupulous individuals in the production and processing sectors who willingly place profit before consumer safety.  However, they are in the minority and I have no doubt they will be weeded out.  It is in the interest of the beef industry and all those involved in it to unite with the Government in ensuring that rogue operators are not allowed to sully the reputation of Irish beef.</P>
      <P>The response to the current BSE scare by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has been rigorous and principled.  The Minister is making an impact in that regard.  The Consumers' Association of Ireland has persuasively argued that producers should be separated from the food industry's regulator and promotional agency.  It has also called for an identifiable consumer presence on An Bord Bia. Further consideration should be given to these proposals.  The arguments and wrangling over the years between the IVU and the Government, in addition to the high incidence of TB and brucellosis, has not helped the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed in recent days about reports of cattle smuggling from Northern Ireland. Checkpoints are now operating to stop illegal stock movement.  It would be disastrous if infected animals got through and I am also concerned about the revelations that Irish certificates have been sold to give British cattle a clean bill of health.  There is a need to ensure that all sections of the industry, including production and processing, operate to the highest standards.  I am glad the Minister has deemed it necessary to reduce the levies.  I hope he will be in a position to tell the House in the near future that, <Col N="1844" /> with the co-operation of producers and others, bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis have been eradicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement in relation to the bovine TB eradication programme.  I particularly welcome the fact that the veterinary union has agreed to operate the scheme proposed by the Minister.  This is a positive development.  I wish to make some observations on the new scheme about matters which still greatly concern me.  My first concern is the impact it will have on small farmers with low incomes who never supplied milk to creameries or cattle to factories and, therefore, were not liable to a levy. They exist in Kerry, Cork and Tipperary. I am referring to what are called small storemen who were never subject to any levy in respect of the range of charges applied by Government over the years.</P>
      <P>The social implication of this scheme is the depopulation of rural Ireland. This concern is shared by all parties and I am sure Senator Sherlock is particularly concerned.  These people, who should be our first priority, will be made liable for the first time for paying their vets directly for the cost of operating the bovine TB scheme.  That is a retrograde step at a time when we are looking at a very serious social problem in rural Ireland.  This will have a devastating effect on those low income small farmers and their families.  I would like to hear the Minister's observations on that because it must have been considered when this new scheme was introduced.  I encounter this problem regularly in Tipperary and it must be at least as prevalent in the west, Kerry and many other parts.  We must consider those serious implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second worry is in regard to the abolition of the pre-movement test.  It would be fine if all farmers behaved responsibly; but, no more than in any other segment of society, one cannot exclude the possibility that some farmers will not behave responsibly, for one <Col N="1845" /> reason or another.  If we find because of this saving that cattle which have not been confirmed as TB free in a pre-movement test are presented for sale and purchased, what will be the consequences? The Minister's answer might be that a prudent factory or purchaser would be very cautious before purchasing. However, there is no longer an obligation on them to do that.  I do not understand the rationale of eliminating this very important feature of the bovine TB eradication programme.</P>
    <P>I share the concern expressed by all that, despite the amount of money invested over the years by farmers, the Government and taxpayers, we have not succeeded in eliminating the TB bug.  However, as I mentioned before, anyone who has studied that bug will know it is probably the hardiest creature of all living organisms.  It can survive in the most extraordinary conditions and emerge in a spontaneous outbreak of TB in herds which had tested clear for many years.  As a former Minister and Deputy who represented a rural constituency for many years, I am aware of many such cases where spontaneous outbursts of TB occurred in herds which had been TB free for a long time.</P>
    <P>There are a number of factors involved such as wildlife, the climate and the extraordinary level of movement of our cattle in comparison to other countries.  In some countries the unfortunate animal never sees the light of day and travels straight from the feed lot to termination; but in our case, because of the nature of the trade, there are sometimes at least six or seven movements.  I am sure the operation of the new scheme will take all those vitally important factors into account.</P>
    <P>One of my achievements during my five years as Minister for Agriculture, which I would like to think was of consequence to the economy, was the fact I negotiated with the European Commission and the European Community a major contribution to the eradication programme, provided the conditions of our programme were acceptable to them.  I assume that contribution, which <Col N="1846" /> was worth millions of pounds, is still there to be implemented and applied to us.  If it is not, will the Minister tell me what has happened since I negotiated that agreement?  They laid down certain conditions which must be fully acceptable now.  When the Minister gave the costs to the House, did we get the full picture?  I am not saying he deliberately concealed the facts.  However, if we are discussing the overall costs we should recall that the level of contributions from the European Commission, unless they have radically changed their minds from the understanding and agreement I reached with them, will be very considerable. The Irish taxpayer will be very interested to know the current state of that agreement.</P>
    <P>While Ireland has been declared brucellosis free, it is important to recognise that the money spent on bovine TB eradication over the years was not, as is so often said, wasted.  It was not money down the drain or a scandal because the level of bovine TB has been consistently contained and reduced.  Ireland is recognised internationally, even in respect of bovine TB, as meeting the most stringent European and international standards. We must rid ourselves of the habit of knocking everything and everyone in sight and implying they are all cowboys.</P>
    <P>While the controls are not always as efficient as we would like, it is important to acknowledge the fact that the bovine TB eradication programme has achieved, for our health and that of the consumers to whom we export, the guarantee that our herds meet the highest standards in terms of bovine TB.  I stand to be questioned and contradicted by the Minister on that but it is important to put that fact on the record. Otherwise, we will engage in the usual Irish habit of knocking everyone for this awful scandal and looking for targets to attack &mdash; rogue farmers, the vets or the Department.  I can say with a degree of reassurance that the story is much better than that.</P>
    <P>The BSE story is current these days, but not because of any issue, problem or <Col N="1847" /> doubt around the world about the white country status of Ireland, which is the highest possible disease free status.  Due to the fact that beef is of such vital importance for us, I devoted considerable time, as would any other Minister, in the context of the outbreaks of BSE in the United Kingdom in 1989 and 1990, to deliberate planning and decisive actions to ensure that status was maintained and enhanced.  It is not a matter of concern anywhere outside Ireland if we keep talking ourselves into a crisis then we will generate a problem.</P>
    <P>I was in Geneva this week and because people knew I had been Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry during the period in question &mdash; although the issues we and representatives from countries all over the world were addressing had nothing to do with agriculture &mdash; a number of delegates from other countries approached me to congratulate me for the action I took at the time to secure our BSE status.  That was most reassuring and welcome.</P>
    <P>We must be careful.  On the BBC and other British television stations, BSE and mad cow disease is the big story and those programmes are being beamed into our homes every evening.  I have great sympathy for the UK and its beef producers.  I also have sympathy for the European Union taking the decision to ban the export of British beef to any part of the Union.  However, we must surely be able to distinguish between the British condition and ours.</P>
    <P>When the first outbreak of BSE occurred in the UK in 1989 we were naturally concerned and we watched to see if any incidence might occur in Ireland. I remember the first case very well because it was what we had feared.  It occurred in January 1989.  We could trace the case directly to imported meat and bonemeal.  It cannot be said often enough that the Irish beef industry is the only grass based beef industry in Europe, so the likelihood of BSE incidences in Ireland is therefore more remote than in Belgium, Holland, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. <Col N="1848" /> Some have not reported them but I will not comment on them.</P>
    <P>When the first incidence occurred in Ireland in January 1989 I immediately imposed a ban on the importation of meat and bonemeal.  That is a matter of record and it was the first guarantee to consumers, who are the major concern at all times.  The next stage was a ban on all meat and bonemeal, including that produced here, in case somewhere along the line somebody might introduce an element of ruminant feed to ruminants, which is an unnatural feed for ruminants who would never feed on anything other than a grass based, natural diet.  That was implemented within the following one or two months.  The next stage &mdash; and I do not say this in order to promulgate my foresight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They should be used not to promote O'Kennedy for the great job he did but to promote the integrity of the Irish beef sector as a result of the actions we took at the time.</P>
      <P>The next stage was the imposition of a slaughter policy.  I recall going to Government with that proposal.  That Government was probably the most stringent ever in terms of public expenditure. I have been privileged to be in Government many times but the privilege of serving in that Government is the one I appreciated most.  We took difficult decisions.  We were cutting back in every Department, including the Department of Agriculture.  I was the Minister who told the farmers that if they wanted advisory services they would have to pay for them.  I was criticised by all sides of the Dáil for asking farmers to pay but we did it and we were right.  We took many such actions.</P>

      <P>I need two more minutes.  Despite those difficulties we introduced a slaughter policy at huge cost.  We paid over £12 million for 126 animals.  That is a huge cost because the entire herd had to be slaughtered.  We should build on what we have done and not react to what is happening today.</P>
      <P>We have a precedent in respect of Egypt and Iran.  They had reservations about our product because some of our competitors were feeding them nonsense that we could not be BSE free when the disease was in Britain.  I spent some time negotiating with the Egyptians and sent our vets to Egypt and Iran. I visited Iran and brought their vets back to the Irish plants.  They accepted without question what the European Union, the OIE in Paris and the World Health Organisation accepted without question &mdash; that we were free of BSE. Surely the Government in the course of its current discussions with Egypt, about which there is reasonably encouraging news this evening, will be able to build on the acceptance of the Egyptians and the Iranians at that time to ensure that any barrier being imposed now will be lifted.</P>

    <P>We should build on what we have done and not be scared.  I regret my colleagues in Britain did not do that and I particularly regret it for the sake of Northern Ireland farmers.  Unfortunately, we did not have jurisdiction.  Had <Col N="1850" /> we had such jurisdiction in any degree, they would now share the same status as Irish farmers.  It is important that smuggling across the Border be restricted. Otherwise our competitors will be happy to say that British beef is getting into the Republic through the North.</P>

      <P>The only issue in the regulations before us which I wish to raise is the provision regarding improved epidemiology.  This is surprising after 42 years.  I cannot see how it can be improved.  Epidemiology is a straightforward investigative process in which one step naturally follows another.</P>
      <P>I worked in the Department of Agriculture, but not in an exalted position; I was a deputy principal in the animal health division.  That is why I am happy to make a contribution on this matter.  I agree with everything that has been said about TB.  There is no doubt that it is an awkward little bug.  Somebody, somewhere in the EU has ruled that, in order to be officially TB free, a certain level must be reached.  The State has not reached that level although it reached the required level with brucellosis. Every effort must be made to achieve the level.</P>
      <P>I think simplistically about these matters. There are certain parties involved in the fight against disease, particularly TB.  They include farmers, veterinary practitioners, Ministry veterinarians, Ministry administrators and the laboratory. Sooner or later, when the forum meets, we will have to examine what contributions have been made by each of the parties in the fight against this problem.  There is no need to ruffle anyone's feathers but the forum can be conducted in such a way that each of the parties can quantify its contributions since 1954 in the struggle to reach officially free status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fight against BSE, as a letter to one of the English newspapers stated, has been lost.  The consumer has been won over by the sensationalist material appearing on television and in the newspapers. It is important that farmers are <Col N="1851" /> not seen to be in the red corner and scientists in the green corner.  The farming industry is not expressing its concerns about this problem forcibly enough.  The same thing happened some years ago when botulism was found in salmon.  A huge world industry, much greater than the agricultural industry in Ireland, was under enormous threat. Someone should find out how it survived.</P>
    <P>From now on the State is faced with a public relations battle because hearts and minds must be won back.  This is an exporting country with a magnificent reputation, as has Northern Ireland, for pedigree stock.  Before pedigree stock was accepted in Northern Ireland and in the Republic it went into quarantine on Tolans Point and Spike Island, respectively. Import restrictions were sufficiently stringent to impress buyers in New Zealand and the United States. After the pedigree stock came out of quarantine, it was held on certain farms which were inspected.  Public relations advice should be sought on this matter, regardless of the costs, to try to persuade the countries which always bought Irish pedigree stock but which are now refusing it entry, to change their minds.  It would do no harm for the importers of this stock to support such a move because it is a public relations battle.  Unfortunately, Northern Ireland is sinking from the undertow of the British <i>Titantic.</i></P>
    <P>I refer Senators to &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; two nights ago when the most senior veterinarian in the British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food performed badly.  At one stage he walked off camera.  I strongly recommend a full briefing session for every civil servant, Deputy and Senator on this matter so that they will know what to say.  When botulism was found in salmon all salmon products were recalled, which must have cost billions of pounds.  However, a public relations coup had been achieved. That is what is needed in this situation.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to follow that excellent speech by Senator McAughtry which demonstrates how valuable his participation in this House is.  I look forward to the day when we will have further participation from his fellow Ulster people in a parliament of some kind on this island.  I also find it difficult to follow the astonishing modesty of Senator O'Kennedy.  I was sad that he found it impossible to praise himself to the extent he clearly thought was necessary in the circumstances which he deserves.  I looked forward to a performance which I would have relished greatly, having also enjoyed with almost equal fervour his superb performance on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; which must be one of the great comic highlights of this year's television viewing so far.</P>
      <P>There is a real problem, and not just with TB.  Senator McAughtry was delicate in what he said about the involvement of various sectors which we should examine.  It is ridiculous that TB has not been eradicated in 42 years so that we can get TB free status.  I am at least as realistic as anyone else.  We should not only look at these various sectors in terms of how they rate their performance, but we should also take into account the fact that certain groups have a vested interest in the continuation of a TB eradication programme rather than in the eradication of TB.  I leave that comment to stand on its own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember getting a report prepared by the Bank of Ireland on the beef industry 15 or 20 years ago, although I do not have any specialist qualifications in agriculture.  I read that report when we were examining the possibility of establishing the beef tribunal.  It indicated a number of things, including the fact that there is no satisfactory brand identification for Irish meat products, particularly for Irish beef.  If it is as <Col N="1853" /> excellent as we imagine it to be &mdash; I believe it is &mdash; then surely it is a pity that there is nothing to indicate to the consumer in the European markets that this is high quality Irish produce?</P>
    <P>It appears that the source of BSE has not been satisfactorily identified by the scientific profession.  There appears to be two separate possible sources of infection, one of which is the use of so-called bone meal as a food or food additive for animals, and the other is the application of chemical substances close to phosgene nerve gas in an attempt to destroy some form of parasitic infection in animals.  I find that interesting from a moral point of view because those two sources of infection come from a kind of hubris or intellectual pride by the human animal.  It seems to be morally repugnant and a violation of nature to extract from a dead animal brain and spinal cord tissue to pulverise them and to force animals to become cannibals of their own species.  That seems to display contempt for another life form.</P>
    <P>What we are seeing in terms of BSE is the inevitable by-product of a lack of respect for other species.  It is utterly disgusting that this type of practice should exist in an attempt to increase economic profit.  I hope that some established body will take on the task of monitoring humane practice in farming because this is a revolting practice which vitiates nature and violates the natural order.  It does not surprise me that nature should exact its revenge if we insist on inflicting these unnatural practices upon animals.  It may surprise the House that I so freely use the phrase &ldquo;unnatural practice&rdquo; but I do so with a certain passion because I do not believe that 20th century farming has treated other species in the way to which, as life forms, they are entitled.  If it was not from bone meal that this very unpleasant disease was acquired, then it appears to be from the nerve gas phosgene. So we have either man's inhumanity to man to thank for this or man's inhumanity to other species.  In any sense, we have a moral problem here that we ought to confront.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1854" /> This is not limited to BSE, which is but one manifestation.  The intensive and inhumane production of animals for food consumption is not only morally wrong but, probably, in the long run, dangerous in terms of human consumption. If one buys a chicken in a supermarket nowadays, chicken is the last thing it tastes of.  It tastes of fish because of the fishmeal it has been fed.  They are unpleasant to eat and often contain lumps which could be cancerous tumours.  This situation arises because these unfortunate fellow creatures are reared in what can only be described as concentration camps for animals.</P>
    <P>There may be a short-term economic yield in these farming methods but they are dangerous, wrong-headed and blasphemously immoral.  Neither the health of the animal nor of the human population will improve until we start to display some degree of compassion for our fellow creatures.  This may be an idle hope when I look around the globe and see the way the human animal treats fellow humans.  Perhaps it is a little idealistic to expect that, simply on the basis of a moral appeal, we will start to treat other animal life forms with a degree of decency.</P>
    <P>However, if BSE has done one thing for us it has at least alerted us to the existence of this moral problem, which we should address rather than engaging in fatuous exercises such as calling out enormous numbers of troops and gardaí to police the Border.  If Semtex cannot be stopped going across the Border, how are they going to stop cows?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in some cases.  Sizeable quantities of Semtex have gone across the Border.  There are dangerous, unnatural and immoral practices in farming in which we are not widely engaged and we must look at this situation and ensure that we do not engage in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy indicated that one of the advantages of our beef herd <Col N="1855" /> was that it was largely grass fed.  It is interesting that the reason our beef is so good is that it lives in what may still be regarded as a natural environment.  I would hate to think that this country, with its good, protected, benign and clean environment, would squander this resource in the future and move away from natural methods of farming.</P>
    <P>The consumer may be a little hysterical at present which is partly because of political stupidity on the part of the British, for which they have themselves to thank.  However, the consumer is a wise bird and, in the aftermath of this scandal and others like it, there will be an increasing demand for naturally grown food products.  We will find a public which is educated and prepared to pay the margin of difference for food products grown within the limits of what ordinary, decent people find acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I will decline to share my time with Senator Norris.  He may not have the modest characteristics he identified in Senator O'Kennedy, but both Senators have one thing in common, and that is a healthy disregard for the clock.</P>
      <P>I do not oppose the sensible motion before the House, but I wonder about the background to it.  Henceforth, farmers will be required to pay for the TB testing of animals.  Heretofore, the financing of this purchase was raised by levies imposed upon beef and milk.  A cost still arises from this, which will now be borne directly by the farmer through a payment to the vet rather than by way of levy.  There are certain vulnerable sections within the industry &mdash; those producing weanlings and store cattle &mdash; who heretofore did not have to bear these costs but will now have to bear them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope we are not opening a Pandora's box by adopting the new practice which has been agreed by the farming organisations, the Departments and the vets.  It will only be as good as the monitoring that goes into it.  History teaches us that the degree of monitoring in <Col N="1856" /> other areas of our animal and beef industry was not what it should have been.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the departmental official who has been suspended and who is alleged to have passed on documents allowing British beef to be exported to the continent as Irish beef. I accept this individual is unrepresentative of the vast bulk of public servants. However, the case underlines the controls and verification that has to be in place if this green, clean image about which we all talk and which is real, is to be of any use to us.  It is no good having this image unless it can be used to marked effect.  This is the problem confronting us.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that we should not react to the controversies regarding BSE.  Of course we should react.  Our industry is trying to survive in the marketplace where this is a reality.  It requires the most vigorous reaction by the Government and everybody involved to ensure that the welfare of the 150,000 people who are working in this industry and who are deriving a living from it is protected by the State.</P>
    <P>There is a degree of complacency, evidenced in how we approach the TB programme, which we must get out of the system.  We must realise that the complacency which derived from a market where we put our beef into intervention, will no longer serve us.  Intervention is gone.  The consumer decides and the country had better decide that the consumer is king and react to that reality.</P>
    <P>The Minister made an interesting statement, which I have not heard from his predecessors, and with which I agree.  He said:</P>
    <P>The main conclusion from the ERAD experience is that eradication of TB is more difficult than had been envisaged.  Indeed, the consensus now is that while some progress can be made, final eradication will be possible only when new diagnostic tests, vaccines for wildlife and movement control arrangements are in place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1857" /> We may be deceiving ourselves in thinking that it is possible to eradicate bovine tuberculosis.  The best we may be able to do is to contain it to the very low levels which pertain at present.  I raised this point a few weeks ago when we debated the matter.</P>
    <P>Why have we not progressed from the situation in 1989 when we talked about blood testing and monitoring the movement of cattle?  We do not seem to have made any progress since then in this respect.  I am sorry Senator McAughtry has left because I want to say that one of the great achievements in Northern Ireland is the ability to trace animals through the chain.  Animals may move from one farm to another six or seven times in their lives and unless we can effectively trace their movement it is difficult to understand how we will be able to deal with the epidemiological aspects about which Senator McAughtry spoke.  Northern Ireland uses this traceability to effect in its export markets.</P>
    <P>BSE is the biggest crisis to have confronted the agricultural industry since the economic war and it must be dealt with effectively and efficiently.  I do not understand why it took two days for the Taoiseach to telephone the President of Egypt to try to open that country's borders to cattle in a boat in the Mediterranean. I heard on the 7.30 a.m. news bulletin on RTE radio yesterday morning that the Taoiseach expected to contact the Egyptians over the next day or two and that the matter might be discussed at that's day's Cabinet meeting. I do not understand why this was the case because the matter was urgent and it was necessary to react quickly.</P>
    <P>I have been asked if I am suggesting that all Ministers should put their passports in their pockets and fly around the world to protect the industry.  My answer is yes, because if they can do so for St. Patrick's Day events they can do so to defend the industry on which the livelihoods of 150,000 people depend. When we have forgotten who won the <Col N="1858" /> by-elections in Dublin West and Donegal North-East, we will not have forgotten the week BSE hit us.</P>
    <P>I accept everything which has been said about the quality of Irish meat.  It is among the best in the world and we have a low incidence of BSE.  We have had only 124 cases of this disease in a six year period compared to 160,000 cases in the UK.  There is a fundamental difference between the two countries in this regard but this is irrelevant unless the purchasers and consumers of our meat are convinced that it is good and edible.  The perception has become reality and hysteria dominates.  Consumers react to the tabloid press in England and Sky News.  Unless we find the resources to deal effectively with that propaganda machine, our industry will be on its knees.  This is why the matter is grave.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for Ministers to go on RTE news bulletins to limit the political damage when they must limit the national damage; the two are not the same.  Our whole credibility is at stake. Senator McAughtry is right about the PR aspect of the matter but we must be sure about what is in front of us in terms of dealing with it.  There has been misinformation, as Senator D'Arcy said, about the potential effects of beef on humans.  It is probably more deleterious to the health of Members to smoke 20 cigarettes than to eat half a tonne of beef in a lifetime but this is irrelevant if consumers do not realise it.</P>
    <P>My local butcher has responded in the way I would expect An Bord Bia to respond.  It has put advertisements in the national press, but what is it doing in international markets?  Mr. Nolan in Kilcullen is my local butcher and he is one of the best in the country.  He circulated a notice to his customers which states:</P>
    <P>You can be assured of quality Irish beef in our shop.  Why?  All our beef are hand picked young heifers from our own farm.  Our beef heifers are reared on fresh green pastures, the most natural feed known.  Complementary <Col N="1859" /> feeding, as supplied by E. Morrin and Company Limited, a licensed feed mill compliant with all Department of Agriculture regulations, is totally free of bone meal. The beef which you buy in our shop comes from our farm directly to our new abattoir which complies with all Department of Agriculture and EU regulations.  This includes a veterinary examination of all beef before it enters our shop.  Nolan's quality assured beef is produced and sold with you, the customer, in mind.</P>
    <P>The last sentence is significant.  Intervention is gone and the customer rules. This is why when the An Bord Bia Bill was discussed my party put down an amendment which stated that there should be a consumer representative on the company's board.  We received no support from any quarter in the House for this proposal but now Members are saying, as was said in the Dáil yesterday, that this should be the case.  Where were they in 1994 when my party argued for this?  There should be somebody on the board who represents consumer interests.  This should not be somebody who just shops in supermarkets, even though such a person would be qualified, but somebody who can speak authoritatively on behalf of consumers.</P>
    <P>We are in the post-intervention era and unless we get things right the industry will go nowhere.  This is why the conspiracy of silence cannot continue.  It has been suggested that people are anti-national if they talk about angel dust, reboxing beef or other abuses.  It is the people who do those things, and not the people who highlight them, who are anti-national.  Unless we bring about and end to such activities, nobody will believe the Department when it says our beef is the best in the world.  This is what is at stake.  We cannot in this propaganda war convince people who buy our beef that it is good, wholesome and valuable unless we can prove it, unless we have a history which establishes <Col N="1860" /> our credentials and the consumer and the medical profession are involved.</P>
    <P>I attended my local cattle mart in Kilcullen this morning and, thankfully, prices seem to be holding reasonably well.  If prices in livestock marts here are maintained and are on the floor in England, the conclusion is inevitable. People will try to move cattle from England to our markets and this is why it is critical to protect the Border.  The Minister needs to talk to people in Northern Ireland to ensure there is a procedure at Larne whereby cattle cannot be moved from the UK to Northern Ireland.  I do not know how this can be done, because both areas are a single jurisdiction as far as customs are concerned. I suspect we can achieve as much in Northern Ireland as we can in the South.  There have been 1,680 cases of BSE in Northern Ireland and 124 here.  Procedures have been instituted to ensure the Border will be closed and I commend them, but it is important that this be done correctly.</P>
    <P>Senator McAughtry made an important point about the value of science. I understand why science has not been able to come up with answers as to the connection between BSE and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease or how to deal with them.  Part of the reason is that we have not resourced science.  This is also why it has not come up with answers to questions of epidemiology with regard to tuberculosis.  Has Teagasc enough resources to deal with this?</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia was promised money earlier in the year?  Was it given this money and is it being encouraged to move beef on our behalf?  There are huge opportunities to do this.  McDonald's stopped using British beef in its burgers for commercial reasons to ensure people would have confidence in the beef they use.  What are we doing to ensure they are now using Irish beef rather than Dutch or other beef?  We need to sell our beef in the national interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that charges for testing will be <Col N="1861" /> reduced.  I support fully what Senator Dardis said about the failure of the Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister to deal with the urgency of the thousands of cattle on ships off Egypt which are not accepted by that country's Government.  For the last 48 hours we have been told that the Taoiseach will contact the Egyptian President.  Some Ministers seem to live in the Government jet, which is now in South Africa because of the visit there of the President. Surely in a national emergency like this, the Minister, the Minister of State, who is also a good rural man, or the Taoiseach should be in Egypt to fight our case.</P>
      <P>If the live trade is terminated, there will be trouble elsewhere.  This crisis has been handled badly by the Government. The lack of urgency is a disgrace.  Given the risk to thousands of jobs in the meat industry and to livelihoods on the land, the haphazard approach by the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government is sad.  I hope they will not regret their lack of urgency in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 40 years millions of pounds of taxpayer's money has been spent on TB and brucellosis eradication, much of which could have been saved. There have been weaknesses in the schemes over the years and I do not know why departmental officials and vets did not deal with them.  I have had many breakdowns in my livestock herds which have resulted in considerable expense for the taxpayer because of repeated testing and a loss of income to myself.  If a herd is locked up for six months or longer, a person could rent land five miles down the road, buy more cattle and mix them with their herd. Perhaps they are not supposed to do that, but the scheme is weak in this regard.  They could bring some of those cattle to the mart and nobody would know anything about them because they would have tags and blue cards for the animals which are supposed to be disease free.  This has been going on for years.  Yet the so-called experts in the <Col N="1862" /> Department can be very strict with a farmer if a number is wrong on a blue card because perhaps the vet was in a hurry when filling it in.</P>
    <P>There is no supervision of those obliged to keep their stock within their holding.  People can rent land and buy cattle regardless.  A lot of money could be spared and the spread of disease could be limited if this area was seriously looked at.  I am glad that agreement has been reached with the vets and that the scheme will work smoothly from now on.</P>
    <P>I hope this crisis will not get out of hand and that the Government will act more responsibly in the days ahead.  As Senator Dardis said, this is more important than a by-election in Donegal North East or Dublin West.  I hope the Government will not live to regret its scant regard for the industry.  I was shocked to hear that Ministers could not get a flight to Egypt.  I do not know what is wrong with the Taoiseach, who is a farmer.  Perhaps the Minister could explain the lack of urgency.  Some Ministers are continuously globetrotting, although I am not suggesting that the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, is, because he travels around the country each week.  Some Ministers practically live on planes.  Despite the crisis in this important industry, nobody seems to care.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  In response to Senator Byrne's and Senator O'Kennedy's question, the Taoiseach had to wait for the definitive EU Commission decision. The Taosieach announced that he had a positive conversation with the President of Egypt today.  I am confident that live exports will be restored to Egypt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fed up with people trying to score political points on this issue.  The <Col N="1863" /> Government and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry have responded to this crisis, which is not of our making, in a calculated way.  Their attitude and policy will be proved right. A diplomatic campaign has been conducted through our embassies in countries with markets for our beef to ensure that misinformation as regards Irish beef is dispelled.  I am confident that we can regain markets which have been lost and increase our market share in those countries.</P>
    <P>The Government's co-ordinated approach must be recognised and the efforts made by the veterinary section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry must be lauded.  Departmental vets have travelled with the shipment to Egypt and have travelled to places where they are needed.  I do not believe that we can do any more than that.  Hysterical comment will not help anybody.</P>
    <P>I refer to some statements made this evening.  Given the realities of current and near future market developments, it behoves all concerned in the livestock sector to pull together in a cohesive approach and push towards final eradication at the earliest possible date.  One thing is certain in today's competitive world: we are increasingly on our own in this task.  As regards the implementation of the new approach, I was heartened to note that the first meeting of the national forum group, which took place this morning, immediately commenced work in mapping out the broad parameters for a co-ordinated, sustained, innovative and cost effective way forward. I am confident that with sustained input and effort as regards the new arrangements, we can make progress to reducing the level of TB and brucellosis. The close working together of farmers and veterinary surgeons and their organisations as regards herd health protection, coupled with a comprehensive research strategy, comprise the two <Col N="1864" /> key elements which, if preserved and persevered with, ultimately must yield a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate the challenge and the work which requires to be done.  Equally, it is important from our perspective to realise that this country has a TB problem with less than 1 per cent of animals with over 99 per cent of the seven million animals in the national herd being clear of the disease. This is contrary to the trade damaging impression sometimes given that our national herd has a high TB incidence. However, in disease terms, 1 per cent infection levels are notoriously difficult to reduce.  Our bovine TB is conforming to the predicable pattern in disease eradication &mdash; rapid progress in the earlier stages and eventual smaller progress increments coupled with increments of increasing difficulty.</P>
    <P>The forum group will find that in periods when rapid progress is made enthusiasm will run high. Understandably, when progress may seem to slow to a virtual standstill, enthusiasm will wane.  When that happens we must endeavour to ensure that enthusiasm is not replaced by pessimism.  A 1 per cent problem is easier to deal with than a 100 per cent problem.  Other countries have reduced that 1 per cent and have eradicated bovine TB.</P>
    <P>For Ireland, as an exporting country, market image will be vital in the GATT-free market-strong competitive trade arena which we are now entering.  By way of encouragement, we should be mindful of the tremendous amount of work and commitment in the farming industry since the 1950s to reduce the TB incidence level to 1 per cent.  That work and effort was manifested in the conclusion of the independent Sheehy analysis, which indicated that investment expenditure in the TB eradication scheme has been of substantial benefit to the national economy.  In its absence, the Irish cattle and dairy industries would have been at a severe competitive <Col N="1865" /> disadvantage.  The conclusion of the analysis indicated that the benefits exceeded the costs by a minimum of 86 per cent, or at a rate of real return of 16 per cent.  The operational expenditure has been realistic in the context of exports of livestock and livestock products which generate £2 billion annually, together with associated employment.</P>
    <P>The proposed reduction in farmer levies as part of the new restructuring arrangements for the scheme to commence on 1 April will give an important impetus towards acceptance and effective implementation of the arrangements. I commend these regulations to the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to the debate which took place here this evening on BSE, I agree with several speakers that our slogan to consumers must be to keep buying beef from the green grassland of Ireland which is the best quality nutritious beef that you can get anywhere.  Meat is a wholesome food which can form part of any varied diet and it is essential to proper physical development.  It is important that we send out a strong message to the consumer that meat is essential in any balanced healthy diet. Without meat, children's growth patterns will suffer, as will those of adults; so it is important to reemphasise the contribution which meat makes to a balanced diet.</P>
    <P>A number of other issues arose and I wish to refer to them.  On the issue of reactor compensation, our arrangement is the best in Europe &mdash; up to £600 per cow plus carcass value of on average £400 results in up to £1000 plus compensation per cow.  In addition, a depopulation grant may be paid and animals are transported free of charge to the meat plant.</P>
    <P>On the removal of the compulsory pre-movement test, the level of disease has not dropped much since the pre-movement test was first introduced in 1978.  Now farmers can purchase cattle which have been pre-movement tested. <Col N="1866" /> There will be a ready supply at marts; and, no doubt, cattle which have pre-movement tested status will get a premium price and pre-movement testing will be an advantage.</P>
    <P>Farmers will now have much greater freedom and flexibility to arrange their sales when they wish.  Previously, they did not have that flexibility.  In addition, it will bring more cattle into marts than was formerly the case because farmers used get rid of culled cows through dealers and there was a black market industry with did not involve the marts. If cattle are sold through our marts, there can be greater control and tracability. The animal now has a 12 month test-validity for sale and there will be an incentive in the reactor grant for farmers who buy voluntarily animals which have been pre-movement tested if their herd becomes a reactor subsequently.</P>
    <P>I agree that we must all work together to implement the vigorous and effective three year programme for disease eradication. That goes without saying and is why I am delighted there was general agreement that we must work together when the forum met this morning.  This is the first time the IVU has accepted a proposal put forward by a Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It is a positive development that a proposal as comprehensive and widespread in its implications as the proposal before us at this time was accepted.</P>
    <P>What we are saying is that most farmers will stay with the same vet for testing and general animal work.  The farmer and his or her vet will work closely together to have the best possible herd health and will work out the overall bill to be paid in respect of all the farm work, including work on animals.</P>
    <P>The relationship between bovine health and human health was raised and, as we know, there is no scientific evidence that bovine TB can transfer to humans.  This point was made again with regard to the quality of milk.  Ireland's one million dairy cows are grass fed and <Col N="1867" /> produce the highest quality milk. Emphasis has been made on the fact that our beef herd is grass fed; so are our dairy cows.  The possibility of the transfer of disease from cattle to humans has never been proven scientifically, but the chances of it occurring are minuscule.  With regard to hormone policy and angel dust, of which mention was made, this country has a rigorous anti-hormone policy.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy mentioned the burden on small farmers.  While small farmers will pay for the test, they will not make any contribution to the reactor fund.  The larger farmers will continue to carry the smaller ones in that respect.</P>
    <P>We will, on the basis of the new agreed approach, be seeking funding from the EU for the 1996 programme. Senator O'Kennedy referred rightly to the money for which he negotiated with the Commission back in 1991-92 but what he did not succeed in doing then was to convince either the vets or the farmers that this was the best solution because the vets and the farmers would not agree to an annual rotation of the national herd; both sides refused to accept that money.  I was involved in the recent negotiations when we put a proposal to the Veterinary Union of Ireland that there be rotation over a three year period.  Again, they rejected that proposal and the farmers did too. Therefore, all the money to date allocated to Ireland for our TB eradication programme, despite the fact that it has been negotiated in Europe, was rejected by both the farmers and the IVU.  Now, having reached agreement, we are returning to Brussels to seek funding for our scheme.  Hopefully, we will be successful on this occasion in achieving EU subsidy for our scheme now that we have the agreement of both the farmers and the vets.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator McAughtry's contribution regarding epidemiology.  We <Col N="1868" /> are increasing the level of epidemiology by carrying out more intensive veterinary investigations in the case of all serious breakdowns.  This is very much part of the Department's policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of a TB blood-testing arrangement.  This is a complex matter and research to come up with a blood test has gone on now for some time.  As yet, we have arrived at no consistent blood test.  We have come up with no alternative to the tuberculin test.  We are working in collaboration with top research experts in the US, New Zealand and Europe in addition to putting our own comprehensive research programme in place.  However, it is likely to be a number of years before the blood test is finally perfected. We should not forget that the TB test eradicated the disease in countries such as Denmark.  Tuberculin tests have been effective in other countries and no real alternative has yet been discovered to replace it.  Both cattle identity cards and tags are checked carefully at the marts <Col N="1869" /> by Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry officials.</P>
    <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to finish my response.  I am sure the Senators in question appreciate the fact that I took this extra time.  This provision should be welcomed by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I also warmly welcome the Minister and congratulate her on her work in the Department of Education. I also convey my good wishes on her speedy recovery; it is good to see her back on her feet so quickly.</P>
      <P>My motion refers to Coláiste de h-Íde post-primary school which is based in Tallaght, Dublin 24, and was opened in 1993.  It is an important all-Irish community school.  As Tallaght covers a colossal area, it is important to have this second level all-Irish school which will meet the needs of an ever expanding primary sector student population who want to study first and second levels through the medium of Irish.  It is only right that we provide this facility for them.  In January 1995, the Minister, through her Department, gave the go ahead to build a 600 pupil school on a site yet to be determined.  That site has been of considerable interest to the people of Tallaght and the wider community of Dublin 24.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment there are 113 students in nine prefabricated buildings in an area which does not augur well for education. There are makeshift science laboratories <Col N="1870" /> and woodwork rooms, not the kind of facilities we need for a community school of Coláiste de h-Íde's status.  Neither the students nor staff have canteen facilities.  Pupils and staff also share washroom facilities.  The Youthreach Programme, which vacated the premises in 1995 to facilitate the school and is now based in Lucan, is naturally annoyed and disappointed that it is not yet back in the area.  I am sure the Minister is more than aware of these problems.</P>
    <P>It might be sensible to draw together all groups with an interest in this case &mdash; the Department, the vocational education committee, the board of management of the school and the county council &mdash; so that together we can reach a decision on a site which is causing counsiderable confusion at the moment.  This has been expressed frequently at meetings of South Dublin County Council and also on the board of the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee. I hope that as a result of this Adjournment we will move towards that resolution.</P>
    <P>The immediate urgency that belies this problem is that in September next year, an additional 42 children will be coming into the school but there is no space for them at the moment.  I reflect the views of all people concerned when I say that, unless the building is completed by that time, we will not be able to take these children into the school system.  I know of the Minister's interest in this issue and I look forward to her reply.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to have this opportunity to clarify the position concerning the proposed new school for Coláiste de h-Íde in Tallaght.  Initially, it would be worthwhile to the background to this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coláiste de h-Íde is an all-Irish post-primary school which was established under the aegis of the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee in <Col N="1871" /> September 1993.  The school is at present housed in the Cumann Gaelach premises in Oldbawn, Tallaght.  These premises need to be modified to make them suitable for second level school purposes and only very limited facilities are available.</P>
    <P>The planning and building unit of my Department considers that permanent accommodation should be provided to cater for a long-term enrolment of 600 pupils; subsequently, I did approve the use of the Department's site at Tymon Park for the purpose of providing a new school.</P>
    <P>A site suitability report submitted by County Dublin vocational education committee has been examined and it is understood from the vocational education committee that it is involved in discussions with the parks department of South Dublin County Council concerning the most suitable site arrangements within Tymon Park compatible with the requirements of both parties. This might indeed involve a land swap with South Dublin County Council.  At present, my Department's technical staff are engaged in informal discussions with the vocational education committee's design team regarding the stage two submission &mdash; that is, an outline sketch.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that I am fully aware of the pressing need for this new facility and it is hoped that the confusion surrounding the siting of the new school will be finalised immediately. Every effort will be made to ensure that the architectural planning for this project is progressed as quickly as possible and construction commenced at the earliest opportunity.  I will convey the Senator's remarks regarding the urgency of the matter to my Department. It may even have been useful to have had this exchange of information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>My motion is timely in that the recent events in Taiwan and the <Col N="1872" /> South China Sea have put the region on the world map.  The motivation behind this motion centres on those events.  I take this opportunity to welcome the move towards democracy in Taiwan. The re-election of President Lee is the first democratic election of a Chinese head of state in over 5,000 years and it is a significant event.  It is a tribute to the 21 million Taiwanese people that they have embraced democratic ideals in such an enthusiastic manner, not only by the exemplary way in which they carried out their election campaign but also in the high turnout, which was around 75 per cent of the population.</P>
      <P>However, the matters I want to deal with here germinated from an invitation that was extended by the Republic of China, or Taiwan, to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am a member, inviting a number of delegates from the committee to attend and monitor the elections in Taiwan. Subsequent to that invitation the Department of Foreign Affairs, through the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, sent a letter to the chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in which he admonished the committee for accepting the invitation. He pointed out that Ireland does not recognise Taiwan and sending such a representative parliamentary delegation to the Republic of China would infer acceptance by this country of its status as a separate entity, the inference being that it would somehow upset their nearer and more powerful neighbour, the People's Republic of China.  Naturally, the committee rejected this view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess I found it quite astonishing and somewhat unprecedented and I raised the matter at the committee. I had it clarified that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs would act on its own initiative and accept or reject such invitations on their merits.  I am pleased to say representatives attended the elections in Taiwan. Sadly, I and a number of my colleagues <Col N="1873" /> were unable to do so due to the by-elections in Donegal and Dublin West, in which I know the Minister would have some interest.</P>
    <P>I want to attempt, during this difficult time, to concentrate the minds of the Government and the wider public on the issues which need to be addressed in relations between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland by the wider international community, of which Ireland is an active and influential member.  It goes without saying that the war games carried out by the Chinese leading up to the election were little more than intimidation. The reason seemed to be an internal power struggle in China itself with the passing of the old dynasty and the ascension to power of a new and younger power elite.  Sadly, that new power elite seem to be militarily inclined.  However, I would be grateful for clarification from the Chinese that their intentions are peaceful.</P>
    <P>Taiwan is pursuing reunification.  It should be put on record that it is clear from all of its public utterances and editorial comment and all the interpretations the international community has placed on the various remarks made by President Lee Teng Hui, that Taiwan is not seeking independence from the Chinese mainland.  It is pursuing peaceful reunification across the Straits.  Time and again the President is quoted publicly as having said that.  I have a briefing here from June 1995 where the President points to Taiwan's policy on well over a dozen occasions.</P>
    <P>In a statement on 22 August 1995 he said:</P>
    <P>Pragmatic diplomacy is designed to give the Republic of China necessary living space in the international arena before national unification.  This policy hurts no one, nor will we accept any coercion or pressure.</P>
    <P>On 9 September 1995 the President said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1874" /> We have always insisted that China should be unified, but China must be unified under the system of democracy, freedom and prosperity.</P>
    <P>On 17 January 1996 the President said that the mainland authorities cling to the one nation, two systems formula in its policy towards Hong Kong, which is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The Republic of China is totally different from Hong Kong.  It is because of what has been happening in Hong Kong, and what will undoubtedly happen in Macao by 1999, that Taiwan and many of its friends internationally are concerned about what China seems to be doing.  It is in that context that I wanted the Minister to clarify Ireland's policy towards the region in general, and Taiwan in particular, keeping in mind that officially we do not recognise the Republic of China.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is enough for us to repeat parrot-like, whenever the issue of Taiwan comes before us, that we do not recognise them and that we should not therefore be too concerned about what happens, or alternatively that we are more concerned about progress and development on the Chinese mainland than about what happens Taiwan, which has proven itself to be a bastion of democracy in the south east China area. An editorial on 13 February 1996 in <i>The Irish Times</i> states that Taiwan is in a limbo of political identity that quite distinguishes it from otherwise similar states.</P>
    <P>The US withdrew recognition of Taiwan in 1979.  Its status has now been reduced to the point where it is quite incommensurate with its economic success. When one thinks about that economic success, it cannot be ignored or dismissed.  Even for those who believe Taiwan somehow belongs to China, using or merely threatening rockets to settle an argument over relations between the two is, I am sure the Minister <Col N="1875" /> will agree, a gross breach of international rule.</P>
    <P>Taiwan has the world's second largest foreign exchange reserves.  It is the twelfth biggest trader and does almost as much trade with the United States as the mainland.  Outsiders in north America and Europe, as well as those in east Asia, have a keen interest in Taiwan's future.  The Americans, despite not recognising Taiwan, have passed the Taiwan Relations Act which obliges them to keep an eye on the fate of its former friend.  I would like some response from the Minister in a similar context.  Does Ireland have that sympathetic view towards Taiwan's status and position?</P>
    <P>I find it ironic that although the Department of Foreign Affairs was admonishing members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs for accepting an invitation to Taiwan, I understand that before the end of April the Irish Minister for Tourism and Trade will visit Taiwan on a trade mission, albeit in a private capacity but as part of a wider mission of trade to Korea and the south east Asia area.  It seems a strange doublethink that we would on the one hand refuse to acknowledge the reality of Taiwan and yet continue to have not only trade links at a private level but at a high political level.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter to clarify Ireland's position.  Ireland is a member state of the European Union and has enormous international credibility in the context of attempting to settle internal disputes through our peace keeping efforts in the United Nations.  The White Paper on Foreign Policy, which was published yesterday, states that Ireland's policy is to pursue the peaceful settlement of international disputes.  I hope Ireland takes a leading role in the European Union and in direct discussions with both China and Taiwan, be it at semiprivate or semi-official level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1876" /> I believe the Taiwanese would see Ireland as having a pivotal role in its pursuit of pragmatic diplomacy, which is not necessarily to seek international recognition for itself as a separate entity but to have an acknowledgement of the fact that it is now the only elected democracy in that region.  When one thinks of the struggle of this country to achieve international recognition after World War I, one must have a great deal of empathy with the struggle of the Taiwanese people, and especially their President, who has to pursue a finely balanced international policy that will not affect or offend his large neighbour, the Chinese mainland, and yet take account of international political realities such as lack of recognition or seats at the United Nations.</P>
    <P>If this debate is reported outside this House, as I hope it will be, it is important to emphasise again that Taiwan has stated repeatedly that it is not seeking independence but rather an eventual peaceful reunification.  One can interpret remarks in the last couple of days following the election of President Lee to mean that a timescale of some four years has been put on that if the Chinese on the mainland decide to embrace democratic traditions and democracy in the same way as their neighbours on the island of Taiwan.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's clarification in the context of the proposal or resolution as it is worded.  I hope we will return to this debate and keep it in the public eye now it has become an international issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>When Ireland established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979 the Government recognised the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole Government of China, including Taiwan.  Arising out of this one-China policy, Ireland does not have diplomatic or official <Col N="1877" /> relations with Taiwan.  Economic, trade and cultural relations between Ireland and Taiwan are pursued within the private rather than the public sector.</P>
      <P>On 8 March 1996, the day when the testing of missiles was commenced by the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan Straits, a declaration on behalf of the European Union, including Ireland, was issued within the context of the common foreign and security policy, by the current Italian EU Presidency in Rome and Brussels which regretted the firing by the People's Republic of China of missiles into test zones in the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>In addition, the declaration stated that the naval and military exercises which had also been announced could lead to further tension in the region and increase the possibility of any miscalculation eventually leading to confrontation.</P>
      <P>Further, the European Union recalled the repeated pledge made by the People's Republic of China that it would stick to its fundamental policy on the Taiwan issue, that is, the seeking of a peaceful solution, and called upon the People's Republic of China to refrain from activities which could have negative effects on the security of the entire east Asian region, and urged an early resumption of the cross-straits talks.</P>
      <P>The naval and military exercises had all the appearances of being gratuitously provocative.  Not only was there a danger of missiles misfiring due to high winds, human error or technological malfunction, but also there was the consequent disruption to regular sea and air traffic, not to mention the attempted adverse psychological intimidation of the people of Taiwan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no justification whatsoever in attempting to resolve the Taiwan problem by other than peaceful means.  As the Senator will be aware, the gravity of the situation was underlined by the fact that the American Administration dispatched two aircraft carrier groups to <Col N="1878" /> the region.  This amounted to one of the largest American naval presences in the region since the ending of the Vietnam War in 1975.  I am happy to note that the United States indicated yesterday that the crisis between China and Taiwan appeared to be over and that the American Defense Department said that the two US aircraft carriers would be withdrawn from the area within weeks.</P>
    <P>One can only speculate as to the exact purpose of the firing of the test missiles and the naval and military manoeuvres which preceded the first direct presidential election in Taiwan on 23 March 1996.  The result of that election was an overwhelming endorsement, by over 54 per cent of the vote, of the incumbent President Lee Teng Hui in the first application of direct universal suffrage for this position.</P>
    <P>The Government urges the resumption of high-level talks, as a matter of urgency between the Straits Exchange Foundation of Taiwan and the Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait of the People's Republic of China. These talks were suspended in June 1995 following the visit to the United States of America by Taiwanese President Lee Teng Hui.</P>
    <P>I am happy to note that on 24 March 1996, vice-president elect, Lien Chang, announced that Taiwan should follow a policy of <i>détente</i> and that the Taiwanese administration has drawn up a tentative timetable calling for top level unofficial talks.</P>
    <P>The Government would urge that utmost restraint be exercised in relation to the Taiwan issue as continuing tension in the Taiwan Straits could damage the stability and economic confidence of the region, including Hong Kong.</P>
